Glenn Youngkin presents his proposed amendments to the state's biennial budget before a joint meeting of the Virginia General Assembly's money committees in Richmond on Wednesday. (Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the third consecutive year, Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s proposed budget includes language seeking to eliminate state-funded abortions for severe fetal anomalies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title32.1/chapter3/section32.1-92.2/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> currently allows state insurance to cover abortions if a physician certifies that a fetus would be born with a “gross and totally incapacitating physical deformity or with a gross and totally incapacitating mental deficiency.” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diagnoses like anencephaly, where a fetus’ skull and brain fail to fully develop, fall under this category.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s proposed </span><a href="https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/item/2025/1/HB1600/Introduced/4/4-5.04/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">budget amendments</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> strike language permitting state coverage for such procedures. The bill reads that “no expenditures from general or non-general fund sources may be made out of any appropriation by the General Assembly for providing abortion services, except otherwise as required by federal law or state statute,” with the state-funded exception removed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The amendment has failed in past budget negotiations as the legislature was split between Democratic and Republican control. With Democrats now holding a majority in both chambers, the proposal faces even steeper opposition. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite this, Youngkin has continued to reintroduce the measure, aiming to reduce public funding spent on these abortions. Over the past four years, 121 state-funded abortions for severe fetal anomalies have been performed, according to the </span><a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/content/uploads/sites/38/2024/10/SFA_summary_GA25_SFY2020_2024.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Department of Health</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In 2020, two procedures cost the state about $5,000, while in 2024, 36 procedures cost approximately $61,000.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Planned Parenthood Advocates of Virginia Director Jamie Lockhart called Youngkin’s budget language “discriminatory” and “cruel.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“People facing complex and heartbreaking situations, such as a severe fetal diagnosis, deserve compassion, support, and access to necessary abortion care — not stigma and funding barriers that put this care out of reach,” Lockhart said in a statement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lockhart emphasized that the proposal would disproportionately affect low-income Virginians who rely on state coverage to navigate and and afford their pregnancies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With many fetal anomalies not diagnosed until around or after </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/two-women-two-pregnancies-two-agonizing-decisions/article_24e5d5fc-742d-11ee-984d-6befc702d5d0.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">15 weeks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, she added that the policy would target families already grieving over the devastating realities of a wanted pregnancy gone awry. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Youngkin’s administration defended the proposal as part of his broader budget focus on maternal health. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Governor Youngkin announced significant new maternal health initiatives this week that will continue to promote a culture of life in the commonwealth, including not forcing Virginia taxpayers to subsidize abortions except where it is required by federal law,” spokesperson Christian Martinez said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/youngkin-unveils-plan-to-improve-maternal-health-in-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">has proposed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over $4 million in investments for pilot programs and efforts to expand the maternal healthcare workforces. Similarly, Democratic lawmakers </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/momnibus-package-aims-to-close-maternal-health-gaps-across-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have introduced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">  a “momnibus” package of legislative and budget proposals aimed at improving maternal  health outcomes and providing support for parents-to-be.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite potential agreement on maternal health initiatives, Youngkin’s abortion proposal faces stiff resistance.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Democrats are also advancing a proposed </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/13/va-house-panel-advances-amendments-on-abortion-rights-marriage-equality-and-voting-rights/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">constitutional amendment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to enshrine abortion rights in Virginia’s Constitution. The amendment would need to pass in 2025 and 2026 legislative sessions before being placed on a statewide ballot for voter approval. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voters in House District 26 and Senate District 32, many of whom had just cast ballots in last month’s presidential and congressional elections, are now being called back to the polls.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Voters who support reproductive rights, you cannot sit this one out,” Repro Rising Virginia Director Tarina Keene told attendees at a gathering in Ashburn Wednesday morning. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic control of Virginia’s House and Senate is seen as critical to </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/12/06/national-democratic-group-boosts-srinivassan-singh-in-upcoming-virginia-special-elections/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">advancing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a proposed constitutional amendment to protect abortion rights. Securing both chambers would give </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats, who currently hold a slim 21-19 edge in the Senate and a 51-48 majority in the House, a stronger position to push forward the amendment in a state where Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin maintains veto power.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While abortion is not strictly a partisan issue, it often divides lawmakers along partisan lines. During last year’s statewide General Assembly elections, many Republicans supported Youngkin’s proposal to restrict most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy. In contrast, Democrats campaigned on preserving the state’s existing abortion laws, with a long-term goal of enshrining abortion protections in the state Constitution. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After Sen. Suhas Subramanyam, D-Loudoun, was elected to Congress in November, Del. Kannan Srinivasan, D-Loudoun, secured the Democratic nomination to succeed him in the Virginia Senate. To fill Srinivasan’s seat in the House of Delegates, first-time candidate J.J. Singh earned the Democratic nomination, positioning himself as a fresh face in the party’s push to maintain its legislative majority. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Residents of the 26th House District can cast their votes between now and Jan. 7, choosing between Singh and Republican challenger Ram Venkatachalam. Meanwhile, voters in Senate District 32 will decide  between Srinivasan and Republican Tumay Harding. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Venkatachalam and Harding did not respond to requests for comment on their positions regarding abortion access as of publication, and Venkatachalam’s campaign </span><a href="https://ramforva.com/why-im-running/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> does not reference  reproductive health or abortion, leaving his stance on this issue unclear. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harding’s campaign </span><a href="https://tumayforva.com/issues/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> states that she believes life “begins at conception.” She also emphasizes the need for measures to support expecting parents and “reduce abortions.” Additionally, Harding acknowledges that most abortions later in pregnancy are already prohibited.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under current Virginia law, abortions are allowed for any reason through the second trimester, which lasts until about 26 weeks of pregnancy. In the third trimester, abortions are only permitted with the approval of three doctors. A proposed constitutional amendment would ease that requirement, allowing a single doctor to authorize a third-trimester abortion if it is deemed necessary to protect the pregnant person’s life or mental health, or if the fetus is deemed non-viable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With no universal definition of fetal viability — the point at which a fetus can survive outside of the womb — doctors typically assess it on a case-by-case basis. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Less than 1% of abortions occur after 21 weeks of pregnancy, according to the most recent </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/reproductive-health/data-statistics/abortion-surveillance-findings-reports.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Some abortions that occur within the second or third trimester have been the result of </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/two-women-two-pregnancies-two-agonizing-decisions/article_24e5d5fc-742d-11ee-984d-6befc702d5d0.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">severe fetal anomalies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, low</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/04/11/fatal-anomaly-exception-didnt-spare-alabama-mom-who-needed-an-abortion/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> fetal viability</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or stem from </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/24/these-u-s-supreme-court-cases-could-affect-abortion-access-nationwide/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">medical emergencies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the only Southern state without strict abortion restrictions or a ban, Virginia has also become an important access point for people seeking abortions from neighboring states. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I cannot imagine what women are going through in those states, dealing with situations where politicians should not be interfering (and) should not be involved,” Srinivasan said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He and Singh also shared personal connections to reproductive healthcare laws.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Srinivasan shared a story about his wife, who was once told that her life would be at risk if she became pregnant. Singh, too, emphasized the importance of reproductive rights, especially for his young daughters. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I have two young daughters and I care about their access to reproductive health,” Singh said. “I don’t want politicians in the doctor’s offices with them as they make decisions about their own bodies.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s why the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee is putting a spotlight on Senate District 32 and House District 26. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After winning a Democratic primary, Del. Kannan Srinivasan, D-Loudoun, will face off against Republican Tumay Harding to be elected to the Virginia Senate. He could succeed Sen. Suhas Subramanyam, who was elected to the U.S. Congress last month.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, J.J. Singh, who won a Democratic primary for Loudoun County-based House District 26, could potentially succeed Srinivasan’s House seat. He faces Republican Ram Venkatachalam. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DLCC director Heather Williams issued a statement noting that protecting Democrats’ slim majorities will “position us to be competitive in November when the entire House of Delegates is on the ballot alongside a competitive </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/25/spanberger-and-earle-sears-tied-in-first-2025-gubernatorial-poll/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">gubernatorial race</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats currently have a 21-19 edge in the Senate and a  51-48 lead in the House with Republican Glenn Youngkin as governor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She added that Virginia can be a key indicator of “what the fight ahead looks like” to build Democratic power in states amid the Republican majorities in federal government. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortifying the Democratic firewall in the states has never been more important, and that work starts in Virginia,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through the DLCC “spotlight” program, Srinivasan and Singh will be assisted in fundraising and can tap into DLCC experts on staff for advice or help with organizing. The group has boosted legislative candidates around the country and focuses on seats that are crucial for protecting or making majorities, said Sam Paisley, an interim communications director with DLCC. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Democratic majority can jumpstart planned constitutional amendments</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While DLCC is watching key state elections around the country for how they can support Democrats’ ability to balance out federal GOP majorities, Virginia’s Democratic majorities will be a key part of advancing planned amendments to the state’s constitution.</span></p>

House panel advances amendments on abortion rights, marriage equality and voting rights&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/13/va-house-panel-advances-amendments-on-abortion-rights-marriage-equality-and-voting-rights/embed/#?secret=SmIsD8zngc#?secret=j6PDqB758w" data-secret="j6PDqB758w" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The amendments would enshrine abortion access protections into the constitution, remove a prohibition on same-sex marriage from it, and create an automatic process for formerly incarcerated people with felony convictions to have their rights restored. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia is the least-restrictive Southern state when it comes to abortion access. The matter was paramount in the 2023 state legislative elections as Democrats vowed to protect current law (and eventually enshrine it into the constitution) and many Republicans coalesced around a 15-week cap on most abortions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under current Virginia law, any abortion occurring in the third trimester requires approval from three doctors. The new amendment would reduce that threshold to one doctor, should a later stage abortion be deemed necessary to protect the life or mental health of the pregnant person or should their fetus be deemed not viable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With no national definition of fetal viability — which refers to the likelihood of a fetus being able to survive outside of the womb — doctors typically make the determination on a case-by-case basis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, people with felony convictions are all but permanently disenfranchised from various rights, even after they’ve completed prison sentences. Previous governors’ administrations had streamlined a restoration process. Then Youngkin’s administration made it petition-based with unclear criteria. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That meant that hundreds of applicants this year were rejected — and therefore </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/23/these-virginians-wont-be-able-to-vote-next-month/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">unable to vote </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">in presidential and congressional elections — without knowing why. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This amendment creates a process that is bound by transparent rules and criteria that will apply equally to everybody,” the bill’s sponsor Del. Elizabeth Bennett-Parker, D-Alexandria said last month. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, the third amendment would allow Virginia to continue recognizing same-sex marriages should federal protections be undone, as they were with abortion protections. Since a 2006 amendment, </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/constitution/article1/section15-A/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s constitution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> defines marriage between a man and a woman. Though it’s been rendered moot since a 2015 Supreme Court of the United States decision, some lawmakers and LGBTQ advocates have stressed the importance of removing the prohibition in case that precedent were to fall (as Supreme Court judge Clarence Thomas has </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/dem-lawmakers-want-to-put-same-sex-marriage-in-virginia-s-constitution/article_46aa7008-ab32-11ee-af3d-e79f1e61bf21.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">expressed interest</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in revisiting). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While a Democrat-led panel was able to </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/13/va-house-panel-advances-amendments-on-abortion-rights-marriage-equality-and-voting-rights/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">advance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> all three amendments earlier this month, the marriage equality one saw bipartisan support.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Placing these policies into the constitution would make them less subject to partisan shifts in the legislature or governors’ mansion — but it’s also a longer process than just passing one law. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Constitutional amendments have to clear both chambers of the legislature two years in a row, with a House of Delegates election in between. From there, they can appear as ballot referendums for voters around the state to approve or reject. This means voters could weigh in by November 2026 — if the proposals pass in 2025 and earlier in 2026. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McGuire, who was reached by phone, said to send him an email. He did not respond by the time of this publication. </span></p>

(Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Democratic-led House of Delegates panel on Wednesday advanced three proposed constitutional amendments, including a revised measure seeking to enshrine abortion rights in the state’s highest law. The new proposal would also require third-trimester abortions to be approved by one doctor instead of three, as the law currently mandates. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 22-member House Privileges and Elections Committee further backed amendments to extend constitutional protections to marriage equality and the automatic restoration of voting rights for felons who have served their time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The right to love, the right to vote, the right to bodily autonomy and privacy, these are the very rights and freedoms that are crucial to the foundation of this commonwealth and this nation,” committee chair Del. Marcia Price, D-Newport News, said in a brief news conference Wednesday afternoon. “We showed up today to do our jobs and to do everything within our power to protect these rights and freedoms for all Virginians.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The revised abortion amendment language in </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20251/HJ1" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HJ1</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> shocked the committee’s Republican members, who only saw the changes after the meeting was already underway. Price called a  five-minute recess to allow lawmakers to review the new language before deliberations and voting proceeded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I think we’re still trying to figure out what happened today,” a visibly frustrated House Minority Leader Del. Todd Gilbert, R-Shenandoah, said after the three-hour hearing. “Something this important and impactful — literally life-and-death decisions — I don’t think I’ve ever seen anything pushed through this fast where we didn’t get a chance to see it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gilbert warned that Price’s decision to not allow the committee more time to review the revised legislation would set a precedent for the way the House conducts its business in the future. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We were literally given five minutes to huddle and look at it before we had to decide what we were grappling with, and I think we still don’t know, other than it’s pretty clear that this is a pretty extreme version of efforts to protect abortion that goes well beyond what has been done in other states,” Gilbert said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price, however, defended her decision to move forward with taking a vote on the proposal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have an entire legislative process just like any other committee, and [the resolution] will go to the floor where (Republicans) will also have a chance to either put forward amendments or have their voice heard as well,” she said at the news conference.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amending the state Constitution takes several years in Virginia. The proposed amendment must be approved by the legislature in two separate years, with a General Assembly election occurring in between. Only then can the amendment proceed to a statewide referendum for voters to decide. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because the next election in Virginia is in November 2025, the earliest the three amendments that the committee advanced Wednesday could be put on the ballot is November 2026 — if the measures pass in the 2025 and 2026 legislative sessions. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The abortion rights amendment</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under current Virginia law, third-trimester abortions require approval from three doctors. The new amendment would reduce this requirement to just one doctor when a late-term abortion is deemed necessary to protect the life of the pregnant individual, or their physical or mental health, or when a physician determines the fetus is not viable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Wednesday’s hearing, dozens of abortion opponents lined up to speak against the proposal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among them was Olivia Turner, president of the Virginia Society for Human Life, who told the panel that her group opposed both the original amendment and its substitute. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We don’t know what’s going on with this new version, and how it will impact our ability as the people of Virginia to pass rational and reasonable protective laws in the future,” Turner said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And Gilbert, the House Minority Leader, said that the amendment capsized Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court case that established abortion as a constitutional right and that was repealed in 2022. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Roe v. Wade has within it a compelling state interest in protecting the life of the unborn at a certain point in the pregnancy. This amendment doesn’t contain that protection at all, it leans in the other direction,” Gilbert said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The legislation we just saw, which was dropped on us literally today without any ability to look at it, reflect on it, think about it, compare notes, talk to experts, only leans into the protection of the patient, which is the mother. And so there is no more protection for the unborn, which was envisioned and embodied in Roe (v.) Wade.”</span></p>

(Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But House Majority Leader Charniele Herring, D-Alexandria, the sponsor of HJ1, said that in her amendment both the state interest in protecting the unborn and life of the mother are considered. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The parameters are set out so if there is a live fetus, there are protections. But if there is a miscarriage, then the physician and the mother will be able to make a decision to abort and to complete a miscarriage. So they do coexist,” Herring said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abortion rights advocates urged the committee to vote in favor of the amendment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This amendment will protect Virginians’ rights to make their own reproductive health care decisions, including access to abortion, contraception, fertility treatment and miscarriage care,” said Jamie Lockhart, executive director of Planned Parenthood Advocates of Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Right now, with no state or federal protections in place, Virginians face the constant risk that anti-abortion politicians could restrict or ban essential care. No one is more qualified than an individual and their health care provider to make these complex personal decisions.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After defeating a Republican motion to kill the proposed amendment, the committee moved to advance the measure by a 12-9 party-line vote.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Restoration of rights amendment </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20251/HJ2" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HJ2</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, sponsored by Del. Elizabeth Bennett-Parker, D-Alexandria, seeks to automate the process of restoring voting rights to people convicted of felony crimes who have served their sentences. The proposal comes in response to a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/03/23/youngkin-administration-now-requires-felons-to-apply-to-get-their-voting-rights-back/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2023 policy change</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> implemented by Gov. Glenn Youngkin that requires people with felony convictions to proactively apply to regain their voting rights upon release from prison and is not automatically restoring rights for any group of offenders — a shift from Virginia’s three previous governors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bennett-Parker told reporters Wednesday that her amendment proposes automatic restoration of voting rights for individuals who have been released from incarceration, which she said would foster “a more just and bare” society.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The disenfranchisement of people with all convictions is a relic of Virginia’s Jim Crow past and was intentionally inserted into the 1902 Virginia Constitution to disenfranchise as many Black voters as possible,” Bennett-Parker said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She added that the right to vote is fundamental and the amendment ensures that if a person has served their time they deserve to have their rights to participate in democracy restored.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Virginia is the only state to permanently disenfranchise all individuals with felony convictions unless they individually petition the governor for rights restoration. The current system has no transparency and changes every four years, so no one knows what steps to take to get their rights restored. This amendment creates a process that is bound by transparent rules and criteria that will apply equally to everybody.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The committee backed HJ2 with a 12-9 party-line vote.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Marriage equality amendment</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the U.S. Supreme Court granted same-sex couples the right to marry in the Obergefell v. Hodges ruling in 2014, the state Constitution still includes the 2006 Marshall-Newman Amendment, which defines marriage as solely between one man and one woman and bans recognition of any legal status that approximates “the design, qualities, significance, or effects of marriage.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because it could become law again should the Supreme Court overturn its 2014 ruling one day, Del. Mark Sickles, D-Arlington, sponsored </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20251/HJ9" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HJ9</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in an effort to repeal the current constitutional provision and enshrine marriage as a “fundamental right inherent in the liberty of persons,” unrestricted by factors like sex, gender or race. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeff Caruso, executive director of the Virginia Catholic Conference, told the committee that his group has opposed efforts to repeal the Marshall-Newman Amendment for more than 16 years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We affirm the dignity of every person, we also affirm that marriage has an original design and purpose, which predates any nation, any religion and any law, and we urge you to uphold that principle today.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Narissa Rahaman, executive director of Equality Virginia, pushed back against that notion and reminded the panel that today there are more than 20,000 same-sex couples in Virginia who have more similarities than differences with couples in traditional marriages.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Here in Virginia we have seen how a state has evolved in its thinking about same-sex couples, and LGTBQ people overall. Now it’s time for our state to fully complete our evolution and finish the job in protecting marriage equality for all,” Rahaman said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The committee advanced the amendment on a bipartisan 16-5 vote, with four Republicans joining Democrats. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think our straightforward amendment will be welcomed by Virginia citizens and I’m really appreciative of the vote today in the committee,” Sickles said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All three amendments are now set to be voted on by the General Assembly during its 2025 session, which begins in January. </span></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong/Virginia Mercury) </p><p><em>Editor&#8217;s note:</em> <em>The Virginia Mercury is not using the last names of the women in this article to protect their privacy and safety. The accounts of all three women have been verified with medical records and by a medical professional with knowledge of their experiences.</em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nisa knew her third pregnancy was a non-starter. She didn’t know that she would fear death for 18 days while trying to get an abortion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I felt like I had a ticking time bomb inside of me,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is because Nisa has Von Willebrand Disease, a genetic blood disorder that prevents clotting. It puts her at higher risk for bleeding to death during things like injuries, surgeries, or if she were to have a miscarriage. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her first two pregnancies had been challenging and once she had been diagnosed with the blood disorder, she’d decided not to have more children for fear of complications or passing the disease onto others. By the time she became unexpectedly pregnant last summer, she was also in the throes of Stage 4 endometriosis symptoms — a diagnosis that would later lead to her having a hysterectomy. She&#8217;d also had an endometrial ablation to treat endometriosis symptoms before finding out she was pregnant last summer — placing her in a more at-risk pregnancy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under 10 weeks of gestation at the time, Nisa said she otherwise would have been able to take abortion medication. With her disease, she couldn’t. Surgical abortions also posed challenges because she needed to have specific medications and extra blood on standby. The procedure was denied by her local providers in coastal Virginia, she said, and the local Planned Parenthood facilities didn’t have the resources. A hospital was her best bet for completing the procedure, but it took 18 days to sort out an abortion at VCU Health in Richmond.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite Virginia’s status as the least-restrictive Southern state for abortion access, Nisa wonders how many others may be falling through health care gaps as she did. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Virginia is not safe. We think we’re safe, but we’re not,” she said. “How do you treat a person who isn’t the standard in this post-Roe world?”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Virginia’s barriers</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade two and a half years ago, states around the country have shored up their protections or enacted various bans and restrictions. And though Virginia is the least restrictive Southern state — and a bastion for out-of-state patients — a </span><a href="https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA3324-2.html?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axioslocal_richmond&amp;stream=top" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">new report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> indicates some hurdles. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, abortion is </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacodefull/title18.2/chapter4/article9/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legal for any reason until around 26 weeks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, with limited exceptions for later abortions. In those cases, three physicians must attest that someone’s physical or mental health would be “irremediably impaired” if a pregnancy were to continue. Conversely, surrounding states have </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/florida-abortion-ban-six-weeks-virginia-susan-swecker/article_e5c13ac8-0708-11ef-9bfa-831eade60f7b.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">near-total bans or limits as low as 6 weeks on the procedure.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key findings from the RAND Corporation report noted how abortion law is currently housed in Virginia’s criminal code (a Class 4 felony for unlawfully conducted abortions), the three-physician threshold for some abortions, and lack of clarity on the “ability to provide second-trimester abortions in non-hospital settings.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. William Fitzhugh, who runs clinics in Richmond, Newport News and Roanoke, said he’s seen a flux of out-of-state patients over the past two years. But sometimes, he’s had to refer patients elsewhere. For example, by the time a Tennessee patient had made it to one of his clinics, she was 28 weeks along, he said, so he referred her to Maryland where there are no gestation limits. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I worry for other women in gray areas like mine,” Nisa said. “I had family that could help watch my kids and I didn’t have to travel far, but I still had to travel in my own state. There are women who can’t take time off work or have childcare.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">North Carolina resident Kishia ended up having to take time off work and her children had to miss school for a few days so they could travel to Fitzhugh&#8217;s Richmond clinic for her 14-year-old daughter to get an abortion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She called the experience “H-E-double-L.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More important, Kishia said, is the fact that her daughter Myasia has been in pain. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At 19-weeks of gestation, she couldn’t legally obtain an abortion in North Carolina and being further into gestation means a more invasive abortion procedure. In these cases, small rods are typically placed in the cervix to prepare it for an abortion to occur the next day. Kishia said the family would have sought an abortion sooner if they could have. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Myasia has had regular menstrual cycles, her mother said, and with </span><a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/22044-bleeding-during-pregnancy" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bleeding in early gestation common in 15% to 25% of pregnancies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Myasia hadn’t realized right away that she was pregnant. By the time she did and told her mother, when they visited a clinic in Charlotte they were told she was too far along for the state&#8217;s 12-week limit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“People get abortions for different reasons,” Kishia stressed as she noted that people can have medical issues, or be young and not emotionally or financially ready to care for an unplanned child. In Myasia’s case, she is still technically a child herself. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a smile, Kishia said that she is grateful her family was able to connect with an abortion fund to offset travel costs. She said she doesn’t plan on having to go through their ordeal again. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kishia said she’s somewhat tuned in to state, congressional, presidential and gubernatorial elections. As her chance to vote in North Carolina this fall approaches, she’ll be thinking about abortion access and other reproductive rights. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t think this should ever be banned,” she said. </span></p>
	<div class="newsroomSidebarContainer ">
	<div class="newsroomSidebar"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abortion laws had been a flashpoint in Virginia’s state legislative elections last year as Democrats promised to place protections in the state’s constitution and many Republicans proposed capping most abortions at 15 weeks of gestation. Their idea, approved by Gov. Glenn Youngkin, noted exceptions for rape, incest and life-threatening situations for the pregnant person but </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/two-women-two-pregnancies-two-agonizing-decisions/article_24e5d5fc-742d-11ee-984d-6befc702d5d0.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lacked provisions for severe fetal anomalies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (which are often detected at or after 15 weeks). Ultimately, Democrats retained control of the Senate and gained control of the House of Delegates.</span></div>
	</div>
	
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Legal challenges</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another finding in the RAND report noted local-level abortion hurdles when it comes to city, town and county governments in the state. Such is the case in  parts of Southwest Virginia, where local governments have </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/florida-abortion-ban-six-weeks-virginia-susan-swecker/article_e5c13ac8-0708-11ef-9bfa-831eade60f7b.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ordinances</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to deter the establishment of abortion clinics. A clinic in Bristol has been embroiled in </span><a href="https://cardinalnews.org/2023/04/03/owner-says-abortion-clinic-in-bristol-is-here-to-stay-regardless-of-the-outcome-of-a-lawsuit-seeking-to-terminate-her-lease/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lawsuits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with its building’s landlords that threaten its existence. Conversely, Alexandria passed an </span><a href="https://www.alxnow.com/2023/04/13/zoning-change-that-makes-abortion-clinics-easier-to-open-in-alexandria-draws-ire-of-local-catholic-leadership/?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axioslocal_richmond&amp;stream=top" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ordinance to make it easier for clinics</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to open and Richmond recently </span><a href="https://www.vpm.org/news/2024-07-23/planned-parenthood-richmond-clinic-city-council-land-transfer" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">transferred land for cheap to Planned Parenthood to set up another clinic in town.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the state level, democratic  lawmakers still plan to strengthen Virginia’s abortion access laws. In 2025, they plan to introduce a proposed constitutional amendment. It will need to pass two years in a row with a House of Delegates election in between before appearing on statewide ballots for voters to approve or reject. Placing protections in the constitution would make them less susceptible to partisan shifts in the legislature over time. Even Republican-leaning states have approved similar ballot measures in recent years, showing that it is not a totally partisan issue. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It wouldn’t be the first time Virignia has tried to enshrine abortion access in its constitution. </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/house-panel-votes-down-abortion-rights-amendment-extradition-bill/article_aad3cc5a-af07-11ed-8954-a369717bdbc1.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similar proposals have failed </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">in the two previous legislative sessions. A sticking point had been language that GOP lawmakers alleged was too broad and would go further than Roe’s legal framework.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The language, much like language in other states’ passed </span><a href="https://legislature.vermont.gov/Documents/2022/Docs/BILLS/PR0005/PR0005%20As%20adopted%20by%20the%20Senate%20and%20the%20House%20Official.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">amendments</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, would declare people have a right to abortion unless there is a “compelling state interest.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where Roe balanced the right to obtain an abortion and health of the pregnant person with the potential life of a fetus, constitutionally protecting access within a state would operate similarly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s unclear what the language of the next attempted abortion amendment  would be but Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Chesterfield — who plans to co-sponsor it again — said there will be more to discuss later this year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are still working on the language to ensure that our constitutional amendment effectively protects safe and legal access to abortion in Virginia.”</span></p>

Jen Kiggans faces Democratic challenger Missy Cotter Smasal this year in Virginia’s 2nd Congressional District. Both Navy veterans have been involved in their local communities for years – Kiggans as a former state senator and Smasal as a member of the Chesapeake Bay Commission. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While both women share some priorities, like reducing inflation and the costs of living, their divergence on abortion policy is something Smasal and Democrats are hoping can help flip the district. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Kiggans and Republicans hope that maintaining control of the House of Representatives can put America closer to completing former president Donald Trump’s proposal of building a wall along the U.S. &#8211; Mexico border. </span></p>

<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Virginia’s 2nd Congressional District: Republican lean, pockets of Democratic support</h4>

	</strong></p>
<figure id="attachment_39960" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:1490px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/va02-map_supreme-court-of-virginia/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-39960 size-full" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/VA02-map_Supreme-Court-of-Virginia.png" alt="" width="1490" height="1008" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/VA02-map_Supreme-Court-of-Virginia.png 1490w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/VA02-map_Supreme-Court-of-Virginia-300x203.png 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/VA02-map_Supreme-Court-of-Virginia-1024x693.png 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/VA02-map_Supreme-Court-of-Virginia-768x520.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1490px) 100vw, 1490px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Virginia Congressional District 2 (courtesy Supreme Court of Virginia)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A drive along Route 13 on the Eastern Shore shows Kiggans signs sprinkled along much of the highway, signaling the district’s Republican lean. But pockets in Northampton and Accomack went for Kiggan’s Democratic opponent Elaine Luria in 2022, as did portions of Chesapeake, Suffolk and Isle of Wight on Virginia’s mainland. Much of Virginia Beach, which anchors the district, is also Republican territory, but 51% of the area </span><a href="https://www.vpap.org/localities/virginia-beach-city-va/election-results-map/?electype=general&amp;election=10135" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">showed up for President Joe Biden in 2020</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Despite the GOP lean, the district has oscillated between the parties over the years and is among several competitive ones in Virginia and around the nation to help determine partisan control of the U.S. House of Representatives. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Candidates’ local impact</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smasal said constituent services is something that most excites her about potentially becoming a congresswoman. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That&#8217;s one of the most interesting parts,” she said. “And when I go across the district and (people) have stories for me … they remember when somebody in Elaine Luria’s congressional office helped them out.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kiggans, whose campaign did not follow through on organizing an interview with The Mercury, has kicked it local with some of her advertising. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recent digital advertisements featured the refrain “</span><a href="https://x.com/JenKiggans/status/1834947865824612859" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">that’s Jen Kiggans!</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” as people noted some of her voting records to include supporting veteran health care. Home to the largest naval base in America, veterans and active duty service members make up a sizable portion of the 2nd District. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, she supported the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/8580" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” which includes funding for VA health care programs and benefits. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Reproductive health</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As they prepare for an upcoming debate next month, a poll from Christopher Newport University released on Sept. 13 showed Kiggans with a </span><a href="https://cnu.edu/news/2024/09/13-cnu-wason/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">five point lead</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over Smasal. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also showed that surveyed voters trust Kiggans more with veterans’ concerns while Smasal is more trusted to handle reproductive rights issues like abortion access.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pew Research Center shows 55% of Virginians believe abortion should be </span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/religious-landscape-study/database/state/virginia/views-about-abortion/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in all or most cases. A top issue for Smasal, she hopes it’s key to unseating Kiggans so that she can help restore federal protections. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“People are talking to me constantly about protecting reproductive rights,” Smasal said. “It&#8217;s really the number one thing that I&#8217;m hearing from people they&#8217;re concerned about.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smasal took issue with Kiggans last year over how the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act played out when it passed the House and failed to progress in the Senate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill was part of a hullabaloo between parties with President Joe Biden’s administration </span><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/H.R.-8580-%E2%80%94-Military-Construction-and-Veterans-Affairs-and-Related-Agencies-Appropriations-Act-2025-SAP.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">opposing it</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, in part, for a provision that would revoke veteran access to funding should they need to travel out of state for an abortion if the location of their duty assignment bans the procedure. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over in the U.S. Senate Alabama Republican Tommy Tuberville </span><a href="https://alabamareflector.com/2023/12/05/tuberville-relents-on-months-long-blockade-of-most-military-nominees-blaming-democrats/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">held up military promotions in protest over the Biden administration’s VA  abortion travel policy.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> At the time, Kiggans told the media that she didn’t agree with his method but supported his reasons.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Taxpayers should not be funding elective procedures,” she </span><a href="https://www.wavy.com/news/politics/local-lawmakers-react-to-block-of-hundreds-of-military-promotions-by-alabama-senator-over-abortion-policy" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">told an NBC affiliate in Hampton Roads </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">last summer. “If I wanted to get a Hollywood nose job in California, I do not expect the Navy to pay for my travel expenses to get there.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Smasal stressed the complexities of why someone may want or medically need an abortion and how the national patchwork of state laws is creating various additional barriers for people. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don&#8217;t know how any female veteran could do that to other service women,” Smasal told Virginia Mercury in a recent interview.  &#8220;She went to Congress and voted to restrict reproductive rights, so she&#8217;s chosen to be more extreme.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>But Kiggans took aim at Smasal in a <a href="https://x.com/JenKiggans/status/1839824215807078560" target="_blank">recent video on her social media</a> and asserted that Smasal is lying when referring to Kiggans as someone who is &#8220;extreme.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the video, Kiggans cited her status as the 19th most bipartisan member of congress from a <a href="https://www.thelugarcenter.org/ourwork-Bipartisan-Index.html" target="_blank">Lugar Center and Georgetown University ranking report</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe it is an issue that should be legislated at the state level,&#8221; Kiggans added to clarify her abortion policy preferences. &#8220;I&#8217;ve always been an advocate for women to choose life, allowing for exceptions in the cases of rape, incest and the life of the mother.&#8221;</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no mention of <a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/two-women-two-pregnancies-two-agonizing-decisions/article_24e5d5fc-742d-11ee-984d-6befc702d5d0.html" target="_blank">fetal anomalies</a>, many of which are detected at or after 15 weeks of gestation.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And while Kiggans supports abortion laws being up to individual states, she has also </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/08/13/virginia-democrats-do-not-support-infanticide-but-heres-why-trump-keeps-saying-they-do/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">echoed a false claim</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that Democrats support it to “</span><a href="https://jenforcongress.com/issues/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the moment of birth.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” </span></p>
<p>On other reproductive health laws, both women have expressed support for protecting contraception access and family planning procedures like in vitro fertilization. As<span style="font-weight: 400;"> the incumbent, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kiggans has </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/4626/cosponsors" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">voted for expanded contraception access</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="http://mace.house.gov/media/press-releases/protecting-fertility-rights-urgent-legislation-addressing-deepening-concerns" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cosponsored a resolution to protect IVF</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Immigration views</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Immigration policy has featured prominently in both presidential and congressional campaigns this year. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans and Democrats tend to diverge on solutions when it comes to concerns about immigration. Republicans have favored ramping up deportations of people who enter America illegally while Democrats have proposed enhancing pathways to U.S. citizenship. This year, Democrats in congress worked with Republicans on </span><a href="https://missouriindependent.com/2024/05/24/bipartisan-border-bill-loses-support-fails-procedural-vote-in-u-s-senate/#:~:text=By%3A%20Ariana%20Figueroa%20%2D%20May%2024%2C%202024%207%3A15%20am&amp;text=The%20Senate%20bill%20failed%20to,aid%20package%20earlier%20this%20year." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">boosting funding for border security, but the efforts failed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Nobody&#8217;s done enough to fix things,” Smasal said. “Both Democrats and Republicans have failed on this issue.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, she was glad to see Democrats coming to the table with Republicans on the bipartisan border deal that was toppled earlier this year. It’s something she would have supported and something Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris has </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2024/09/10/harris-slams-trump-for-killing-border-bill-in-debate-here-are-the-facts/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said she would support</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“(Republicans in Congress and Trump) wanted the political issue (for this election) as opposed to doing something substantial to actually help address the border,” Smasal said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She stressed how supporting border security efforts can help detect drugs like fentanyl entering the country and combat human trafficking. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I firmly believe we need to be security minded,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On related legislation, Kiggans has co-sponsored the “</span><a href="https://chavez-deremer.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/chavez-deremer.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/Summary%20-%20Defending%20Borders,%20Defending%20Democracies%20Act.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Defending Borders, Defending Democracies Act.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” The </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/7372/cosponsors%5C" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which has not progressed past introduction, would suspend entry of some immigrants at the U.S. border and require asylum seekers to “remain in Mexico” during adjudication of their immigration status. </span></p>
<p>She also voted for the &#8220;<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/2/all-actions" target="_blank">Secure The Border Act</a>&#8221; which would expedite construction of border barriers. It passed the House but did not clear the Senate.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On her website, Kiggans called the rise in border crossings a “self-inflicted crisis” that is “threatening the safety of Americans and emboldening cartels, which are making massive profits off of drug trafficking and exploiting vulnerable migrants.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Addressing inflation</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a local-yet-national issue, both candidates have stressed how they want to curb inflation and rising costs of living. Kiggans’ campaign website points to her support of the </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/3746/summary/00#:~:text=This%20bill%20increases%20the%20federal,work%20requirements%20for%20federal%20programs." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which passed congress and was signed into law by the president. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smasal </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">said that addressing affordable housing is a key part of addressing the cost of living. If elected, she aims to start by championing federal legislation to prevent large corporations from purchasing housing stock and raising prices or creating more short-term rentals in places like Virginia Beach. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If everything is turned into an Airbnb, where are our teachers and our firefighters and our police officers going to find their housing?” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both women are also supportive of ways to help </span><a href="https://kiggans.house.gov/posts/kiggans-supports-bipartisan-bill-to-address-childcare-workforce-shortage" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">alleviate the nation’s growing childcare cost and access issues</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kiggans called it an “unfortunate reality” that some parents are feeling forced to leave the workforce, take on debt or tap into their savings as a result of the growing issue. </span></p>

<p>The debate at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia hosted by ABC News just 56 days before the election was also notable as the first exchange between the candidates since President Joe Biden <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/president-joe-biden-bows-out-reelection-campaign-harris-vows-win-nomination-8" target="_blank">exited</a> the race weeks after his botched debate performance in late June.</p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;New polling finds Harris ahead of Trump by a comfortable margin in Virginia&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/new-polling-finds-harris-ahead-of-trump-by-a-comfortable-margin-in-virginia/embed/#?secret=5K63aDQ2YJ#?secret=3n2bUmc54v" data-secret="3n2bUmc54v" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p>It is the only debate the campaigns have agreed to before the November election, although the Harris camp afterward suggested they’re ready for another and Fox News offered to host it in October.</p>
<p>The night began with Democratic nominee Harris crossing the stage to initiate a handshake and introducing herself to Trump, the GOP candidate. The two had never before met.</p>
<p>But the back-and-forth quickly grew contentious, as Trump blasted Harris’ record as vice president under President Joe Biden, and Harris said Trump was unfit to be president for myriad reasons. The two did not shake hands at the close.</p>
<p>Harris portrayed herself as a champion of the middle class. She presented a hopeful vision of the country that she sought to contrast with what she described as Trump’s self-centered vision that included attacks on the country’s democratic traditions and people of color.</p>
<p>“I am actually the only person on this stage who has a plan that is about lifting up the middle class and working people of America,” she said. “I believe in the ambition, the aspirations, the dreams of the American people.”</p>
<p>The vice president lambasted Trump as “extreme” and sought to tie him to the ultraconservative Project 2025, with which he denied an association. Harris also underscored the numerous legal cases Trump <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trumps-jan-6-case-extend-beyond-election-day-under-timeline-laid-out-judge%C2%A0-2" target="_blank">continues</a> to face. Trump is the first former president to become a <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-found-guilty-34-felony-counts-ny-hush-money-trial-10" target="_blank">convicted</a> felon.</p>
<p>“Donald Trump actually has no plan for you,” she said. “Because he is more interested in defending himself than he is in looking out for you.”</p>
<p>Trump repeated unverified claims about migrants eating dogs in Ohio, returned time and again to complaints about immigration, defended his plan to raise tariffs and boasted about campaign rally crowd sizes — after Harris taunted him about his events, saying people left.</p>
<p>“In Springfield, they’re eating the dogs, the people that came in, they’re eating the cats. They’re eating, they’re eating the pets of the people that live there,” Trump said in one of the more jarring moments of the debate, when he repeated <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/misinformation/jd-vance-ohio-police-no-reports-haitian-immigrants-harming-pets-rcna170271" target="_blank">baseless</a> claims about Haitian migrants. The rumors have circulated on social media in recent days, and have been <a href="https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/GXC9L0aXQAAjeIm.jpeg" target="_blank">amplified</a> by Trump’s running mate, Ohio U.S. Sen. J.D. Vance.</p>
<p>Trump challenged Harris to use her position in the administration to address inflation and immigration, suggesting that she was not actually able to follow through on her promises.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="LvYR73wQrF"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/08/15/im-entitled-to-personal-attacks-against-harris-trump-asserts/"> ‘I’m entitled to personal attacks’ against Harris, Trump asserts</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220; ‘I’m entitled to personal attacks’ against Harris, Trump asserts&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/08/15/im-entitled-to-personal-attacks-against-harris-trump-asserts/embed/#?secret=M8t4AvGhe4#?secret=LvYR73wQrF" data-secret="LvYR73wQrF" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p>“She doesn’t have a plan,” he said. “She copied Biden’s plan, and it’s like four sentences like, ‘Run, Spot, run,’ four sentences that are just, ‘Oh, we’ll try and lower taxes.’ She doesn’t have a plan.”</p>
<p>Polls show the race is <a href="https://scri.siena.edu/category/political/nyt/" target="_blank">virtually tied</a> nationally and in seven key states that will decide the Electoral College margin: Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia, North Carolina, Arizona and Nevada. Harris enjoyed a polling bump soon after she became a candidate, but her numbers have dropped in the weeks since and recent polls showed her roughly even with Trump.</p>
<p>Among the top moments of the night touching on policy and politics:</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Election integrity</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The 2024 presidential election marks a test for the peaceful transfer of power after political violence marred the nation’s tradition when Trump’s refusal to accept his loss sparked a Jan. 6, 2021 riot at the U.S. Capitol.</p>
<p>Trump repeated false claims during Tuesday’s debate that he won the 2020 presidential election, even walking back recent public statements that seemed to accept defeat.</p>
<p>Asked by moderator David Muir if recent statements that he “lost by a whisker” and similar sentiments were acknowledgements he’d lost, Trump said the comments were sarcastic.</p>
<p>“I don’t acknowledge that at all,” he said. “That was said sarcastically.”</p>
<p>Harris called Trump’s answer “deeply troubling.”</p>
<p>“You did, in fact, lose that election,” she told him. She added that his continued denial “leads one to believe that perhaps we do not have, in the candidate to my right, the temperament or the ability to not be confused about fact. That’s deeply troubling, and the American people deserve better.</p>
<p>When asked if he regretted any of his actions when the U.S. Capitol was violently overrun by his supporters, Trump defended himself and returned to the topic of immigration.</p>
<p>“I had nothing to do with that, other than they asked me to make a speech,” Trump said.</p>
<p>Harris responded: “For everyone watching who remembers what January 6 was, I say ‘We don’t have to go back.’”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Race</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Moderators asked Trump about his <a href="https://georgiarecorder.com/2024/07/31/trump-insults-harris-makes-false-claims-quarrels-with-black-journalists-at-conference/" target="_blank">disparaging comments</a> about Harris’ biracial identity to the National Association of Black Journalists last month. Muir questioned if it was appropriate for Trump to weigh in on his opponent’s race.</p>
<p>Trump said it was not appropriate, but seemed to defend the comment that Harris had “turned Black” to promote her political career.</p>
<p>“I don’t care what she is,” he said. “Whatever she wants to be is OK with me. All I can say is that I read where she was not Black, that she put out, and I’ll say that, and then I read that she was Black, and that’s okay. Either one was okay with me. That’s up to her.”</p>
<p>Harris called it “a tragedy” that Trump continued “to use race to divide the American people.”</p>
<p>She invoked allegations that he refused to rent his residential properties to Black families, spread conspiracy theories that the first Black president, Barack Obama, was not born in the United States and supported the execution of Black and Latino boys accused of murder in New York’s Central Park. The suspects were later exonerated.</p>
<p>“The American people want better than that, want better than this,” she said, adding that voters wanted a conversation about how candidates could improve their lives. “Regardless of people’s color or the language their grandmother speaks, we all have the same dreams and aspirations, and want a president who invests in those, not in hate and division.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Abortion and IVF</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The 2024 presidential election is the first since the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in a 6-3 decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.</p>
<p>While Trump told debate moderators that he would not sign a nationwide abortion bill into law, he refused to give a yes or no answer when asked if he would veto one.</p>
<p>Moderator Linsey Davis corrected Trump after he claimed that some states allow abortion “in the ninth month,” but he continued to repeat it throughout the debate.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="qw37QWvj2i"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/08/13/virginia-democrats-do-not-support-infanticide-but-heres-why-trump-keeps-saying-they-do/">Virginia Democrats do not support infanticide, but here’s why Trump keeps saying they do</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Virginia Democrats do not support infanticide, but here’s why Trump keeps saying they do&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/08/13/virginia-democrats-do-not-support-infanticide-but-heres-why-trump-keeps-saying-they-do/embed/#?secret=O8snATNWbx#?secret=qw37QWvj2i" data-secret="qw37QWvj2i" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p>Trump hailed the Supreme Court justices — three of whom he appointed — for giving full control of abortion laws to state governments.</p>
<p>“What I did is something, for 52 years, they have been trying to get Roe v. Wade into the states, and through the genius and heart and strength of six Supreme Court justices, we were able to do that,” Trump said, adding that he “strongly” believes in exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother.</p>
<p>Harris said she would “proudly” sign a bill into law that restored the federal right to an abortion.</p>
<p>“One does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government and Donald Trump certainly should not be telling a woman what to do with her body,” Harris said.</p>
<p>She attacked what she dubbed “Donald Trump’s abortion bans” and said his actions resulted in a reality where couples “who pray and dream of having a family are being denied IVF treatments.”</p>
<p>In vitro fertilization, or IVF, has become a <a href="https://kansasreflector.com/2024/02/28/u-s-senate-republican-blocks-legislation-protecting-in-vitro-fertilization/" target="_blank">lightning rod for debate</a> on the right after an Alabama court ruled in early 2024 that frozen embryos counted as children. Legislators in the state have since passed a law to restore IVF access.</p>
<p>Trump said Harris was telling “another lie.”</p>
<p>“I have been a leader on IVF, with which is fertilization, the IVF. I have been a leader,” he said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Taxes, the economy, health care</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>With Trump’s signature 2017 tax law expiring at the end of 2025, tax policy has been front and center of the 2024 presidential race.</p>
<p>Harris trumpeted her plans for an “opportunity economy” and panned Trump’s proposal to raise tariffs and “provide a tax cut for billionaires and big corporations.”</p>
<p>“Donald Trump has no plan for you, and when you look at his economic plan, it’s all about tax breaks for the richest people,” Harris said on the debate stage.</p>
<p>Harris’ proposals include increasing the corporate tax rate to 28%, permanently expanding the child tax credit to pandemic levels and extending up to $6,000 to new parents, <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/harris-roll-out-new-plan-tax-relief-small-businesses" target="_blank">providing</a> up to $50,000 in tax relief for business start-up costs, and offering new homebuyers a $25,000 tax credit.</p>
<p>A large part of Trump’s economic plan is to impose universal tariffs of at</p>
<p>least 10% on all U.S. imports, with tariffs on Chinese goods at 60%. When asked by Muir if the approach could cause consumer prices to increase, Trump denied the possibility.</p>
<p>“We’re not going to have higher prices. What’s going to happen, who’s going to have higher prices is China, and all of the countries that have been ripping us off for years,” Trump said.</p>
<p>Trump has promised, at minimum, to extend his tax policies, which cut individual income tax rates, lowered the corporate tax rate to 21%, loosened business expensing and deductions, and doubled the child tax credit to $2,000.</p>
<p>Economists warn that if extended, the Trump-era tax cuts would add trillions to the deficit. That total could reach between $4 trillion and $5.8 trillion over the next decade, <a href="https://budgetmodel.wharton.upenn.edu/issues/2024/8/26/trump-campaign-policy-proposals-2024?te=1&amp;nl=the-morning&amp;emc=edit_nn_20240903" target="_blank">according</a> to the University of Pennsylvania’s Penn Wharton Budget Model. In a separate model, the Tax Foundation <a href="https://taxfoundation.org/research/all/federal/donald-trump-tax-plan-2024/" target="_blank">estimated</a> the policies could reduce federal revenue up to $6.1 trillion over a 10-year window.</p>
<p>The Penn Wharton model <a href="https://budgetmodel.wharton.upenn.edu/issues/2024/8/26/harris-campaign-policy-proposals-2024?te=1&amp;nl=the-morning&amp;emc=edit_nn_20240903" target="_blank">estimates</a> Harris’ proposals would increase the deficit by up to $2 trillion over ten years. Modeling from the Tax Foundation released Tuesday <a href="https://taxfoundation.org/research/all/federal/kamala-harris-tax-plan-2024/" target="_blank">predicts</a> the vice president’s plan would increase taxes by $4.1 trillion over the next decade, but after accounting for various tax cuts and credits, the projected revenue drops to $1.7 trillion, and even further if slowed economic growth is considered.</p>
<p>On health care, Trump said he had “concepts of a plan” to overhaul the law signed by President Barack Obama in 2010.</p>
<p>“I would only change it if we come up with something that’s better and less expensive,” he said. “And there are concepts and options we have to do that, and you’ll be hearing about it in the not too distant future.”</p>
<p>Harris defended the law known as “Obamacare.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Immigration and border security</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Trump tried several times to steer the conversation to immigration, his signature issue since he began his first White House run in 2015.</p>
<p>He referenced viral — but unverified — stories of sensational disruptions caused by immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, and Aurora, Colorado, and blamed Harris and Biden for the supposed episodes.</p>
<p>“These are the people that she and Biden let into our country,” he said.</p>
<p>Continuing Biden’s immigration policies would turn the country into “Venezuela on steroids,” he said.</p>
<p>Harris laughed after Trump pressed unverified claims about immigration. “Talk about extreme,” she said.</p>
<p>Harris promoted a bipartisan immigration and border security bill this year that included measures Republicans sought to strengthen enforcement. But the bill fell apart, she said, under opposition from Trump, who preferred campaigning on the issue to solving the problem.</p>
<p>When moderators then asked Trump about the bill, he began his answer by bragging about crowds at his campaign rallies, responding to a comment Harris had made.</p>
<p>Rally attendance remained high, he said, “because people want to take their country back.”</p>
<p>“Our country is being lost,” he said. “We’re a failing nation, and it happened three-and-a-half years ago. And what? What’s going on here? … What they have done to our country by allowing these millions and millions of people to come into our country and look at what’s happening to the towns all over the United States.”</p>
<p>He did not answer the question about the bill.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Energy and climate</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Moderators asked Harris about her position on hydraulic fracturing, a technique for extracting natural gas better known as fracking.</p>
<p>The process is controversial among environmentalists, but a major industry in gas-rich Pennsylvania. During her unsuccessful bid for the Democratic nomination in 2020, Harris told a climate activist during a televised town hall that she favored banning fracking, but has said this year that is not her position.</p>
<p>Asked by Davis to explain the change Tuesday night, she said she’s also made clear in 2020 that she did not want to ban fracking.</p>
<p>She also noted her tie-breaking vote in the Senate to pass the Inflation Reduction Act, a massive energy, taxes and domestic policy law Democrats passed along party lines in 2022 that included expanded leases for natural gas production.</p>
<p>Trump urged voters not to believe Harris.</p>
<p>“If she becomes president, fracking in Pennsylvania will end on day one,” he said.</p>
<p>The last question before closing statements was on climate change.</p>
<p>Harris called it a threat and touted the Biden administration’s work to expand the clean energy industry, while preserving natural gas jobs.</p>
<p>Trump declined to answer the question, instead focusing on the work of Hunter Biden, the president’s son, with a Ukrainian energy company. Trump called the Biden administration “corrupt.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Foreign policy</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>As the humanitarian crisis continues in the Gaza Strip with deaths mounting 40,000, according to Gaza health officials, Davis asked Harris how she could break through a stalemate on a proposed cease-fire deal between Israel and Hamas militants.</p>
<p>The vice president offered little detail on how to finally broker a deal, but said, “What we know is this war must end.”</p>
<p>“It must end immediately, and the way it will end is we need a cease-fire deal, and we need the hostages out, and so we will continue to work around the clock on that — work around the clock — also understanding that we must chart a course for a two-state solution,” she said.</p>
<p>Harris added that she will “always give Israel the ability to defend itself, in particular as it relates to Iran.”</p>
<p>Trump lashed back with accusations that Harris “hates” Israel and the “Arab population,” and repeated his refrain that “if I were president, (the war) would have never started.”</p>
<p>“I will get that settled and fast, and I’ll get the war with Ukraine and Russia ended. If I’m president-elect, I’ll get it done before even becoming president,” Trump said.</p>
<p>He did not directly answer if he wanted Ukraine to win the war.</p>
<p>“I think it’s in the U.S. best interest to get this war finished and just get it done, negotiate a deal, because we have to stop all of these human lives from being destroyed,” Trump said when asked if a Ukraine victory is in the U.S.’s best interest.</p>
<p>Harris said she would continue to stand with NATO allies on defending Ukraine.</p>
<p>“I believe the reason that Donald Trump says that this war would be over within 24 hours is because he would just give it up. And that’s not who we are as Americans,” she rebutted.</p>
<p>Another foreign policy topic was on display at the U.S. Capitol hours before the debate when congressional leaders held a <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?537990-1/house-speaker-mike-johnson-holds-congressional-medal-ceremony" target="_blank">ceremony</a> honoring 13 service members who were killed during the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Trump and Republican lawmakers have ratcheted up criticism of Harris — implicating her hundreds of times in a damning <a href="https://foreignaffairs.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/WILLFULL-BLINDNESS-An-Assessment-of-the-Biden-Harris%20Administrations-Withdrawal-from-Afghanistan-and-the-Chaos-that-Followed.pdf" target="_blank">report</a> released Monday — for the Biden administration’s handling of the August 2021 exit from Afghanistan after two decades of war.</p>
<p>“I will tell you I agreed with President Biden’s decision to pull out of Afghanistan. Four presidents said they would, and Joe Biden did,” Harris told Muir when asked if she bears any responsibility for the deadly withdrawal.</p>
<p>Harris criticized Trump for “negotiating directly with a terrorist organization” when he struck a deal with the Taliban before he left office.</p>
<p>Trump defended himself saying “I got involved with the Taliban because the Taliban was doing the killing” and said he achieved a “very good agreement.”</p>
<p>Trump made waves on the recent third anniversary of the 13 service members’ deaths when his staffers pushed an Arlington National Cemetery official aside to take photos in a restricted area, according to the U.S. Army and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/08/27/nx-s1-5091154/trump-arlington-cemetery" target="_blank">reporting</a> by NPR.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Swift endorsement</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Shortly after the debate’s close, mega star Taylor Swift said in an Instagram post she would vote for Harris.</p>
<p>Part of Swift’s exuberant fan base had called on her to endorse Harris, following her support for Biden and Harris four years ago.</p>

Tim Walz’s commitment to reproductive rights policy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The tour will tout campaign promises to voters, such as Harris’ plan to sign into law a bill to restore federal abortion protections, should congress send one to her desk if she becomes president, while Walz will stand ready to cast a tie-breaking vote in the U.S. Senate if need be. With stops planned in Richmond, Virginia Beach and Northern Virginia, the tour’s foray across the commonwealth comes as early voting begins in Virginia next week and less than two months until Election Day. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this year while President Joe Biden was still seeking re-election, he and Harris had kicked off their campaign in Virginia on the platform to “restore Roe.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new bus tour will stop in all 50 states, including its three Virginia pit stops. A spokesperson for the Harris-Walz campaign in Virginia said that more details on the time and exact locations will be announced soon. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The stops in Virginia will feature rallies led by elected leaders to include Virginia congresswomen Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond and Abigail Spanberger, D-Henrico. House Democratic Whip Katherine Clark will join them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Featured speakers include Amanda Zurawski, who is </span><a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2024/05/31/texas-supreme-court-zurawski-abortion/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">part of a lawsuit against the state of Texas for being denied an abortion amid her pregnancy complications,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and Louisiana resident </span><a href="https://lailluminator.com/2024/08/19/kaitlyn-joshua/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaitlyn Joshua who  shared the story of being denied care for a miscarriage</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the Democratic National Convention last month. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The tour plans to highlight the differences between the Harris-Walz campaign and that of former President Donald Trump and Sen. J.D. Vance, R-Ohio. The substantially-shifted national landscape surrounding abortion access has changed in recent years following the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, which had protected abortion federally for decades. Trump’s appointees to the court had upheld Roe as federal law during their confirmation hearings before ultimately ruling to undo it. As states now set their own laws on access or restrictions — something Trump has touted and claimed credit for —  Democrats point to growing uncertainty around access to birth control or family planning measures like in vitro fertilization. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several states have since voted to enshrine abortion protections into their constitutions — a process Virginia Democrats</span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/virginia-abortion-rights-restoration-same-sex-marriage/article_731f82a4-b4b0-11ee-9c14-7719906ce1fc.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> hope to kickstart next year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — or drafted laws to </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/youngkin-contraception-virginia-general-assembly-hashmi-price/article_c74b197a-fb59-11ee-92c1-1b2a173616ec.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">protect other reproductive rights</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Congressional Democratic campaigns along with the Harris-Walz campaign also point to outlines in a Heritage Foundation guidebook called Project 2025 that entails </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/28/mcclellan-spanberger-work-to-repeal-parts-of-19th-century-law-that-could-ban-abortion-nationally/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">employing a long-dormant federal law to further restrict abortion medication and mailing of abortifacients.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Critics and reproductive rights advocates have said this could pave the way for a national ban.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As we crisscross the country, we are driving that contrast home to red and blue voters and independents,” Harris-Walz campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez said in a statement. “The [tour] will drive home for voters that this threat to our fundamental freedoms touches every American.” </span></p>

<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Abortion</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the only state in the South that hasn’t restricted abortion access since the Supreme Court overturned Roe. v Wade in 2022, which made abortion a federal right, Virginia is a key player in the country’s reproductive health landscape. By dismantling Roe v Wade, the nation’s highest court laid the groundwork for each state to restrict or enhance access to abortion; a spate of state bans on abortion have since emerged, with 14 states making the procedure illegal. Abortion remains legal in Virginia and state Democrats will push to enshrine it as a right in the commonwealth’s constitution next year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many Republican candidates in Virginia’s congressional races assert that abortion access should be determined at the state level. In District 2, Republican incumbent U.S. Rep. Jenn Kiggans, a Navy veteran, nurse and former member of the state senate, has “consistently advocated for women to choose life, but respects exceptions for rape, incest, and life of the mother,” according to her campaign </span><a href="https://jenforcongress.com/issues/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Democratic challenger Missy Cotter Smasal, who is also a Navy veteran as well as the director of a nonprofit focused on women veterans, </span><a href="https://fb.watch/uhpo6DTiSN/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">declared herself</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “the only pro-choice Navy veteran in this race.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In District 7, anchored in Prince William County but also spanning rural parts of the state, Spotsylvania attorney and former Green Beret Derrick Anderson, a Republican, is challenging career military officer and Democrat Eugene Vindman for the seat currently occupied by Abigail Spanberger, who is running for governor next year. Anderson has expressed support for the overturn of Roe and </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/DerrickAndersonforVA/videos/my-life-story-is-pro-life-and-thats-how-i-will-serve-in-congress-my-mother-got-p/414067620643367/?locale=ms_MY" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">called himself “pro-life” while sharing on social media</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that his mother had him as a single parent at 17 years old. Vindman plans to support </span><a href="https://vindmanforcongress.com/issues/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">access to abortions and contraception along with in vitro fertilization</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In District 10, anchored in Loudoun County, Democratic state Sen. Suhas Subramanyam is running against Republican Mike Clancy to fill Rep. Jennifer Wexton’s seat. Wexton will not seek reelection due to a health issue, and endorsed Subramanyam during his democratic primary. He has supported an effort to </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+SJ255" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">enshrine abortion protections into Virginia’s constitution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and plans to support federal protections. Clancy said that he “does not support federal action on abortion.” His campaign website lists “respect life” as a campaign issue and notes his support for resources for pregnant people and families. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In District 9, incumbent Rep. Morgan Griffith faces Democratic challenger Karen Baker, a lawyer-turned-nurse. Griffith has voted against congressional efforts to protect abortion access and </span><a href="https://morgangriffith.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=402684" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">stated</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that Roe v. Wade had “produced decades of tragedy.” Baker wrote on her campaign website that “women’s choices must be respected.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Housing is an issue people experience practically and constantly, amid paying rent or mortgages. Local governments handle approvals or rejections of developments and craft zoning laws that guide development potential. But state and federal lawmakers have roles to play as well — largely through funding mechanisms or taking action where housing intersects with other policy platforms. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While many congressional candidates this year don’t have housing policy outlined on their websites, some have been talking about how they plan to help states and local governments from the federal level. The Mercury reached out to others for more details on what they would do to help with housing supply and affordability. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In District 2, Incumbent Rep. Jen Kiggans did not respond to inquiry for more details on housing policy by the time of this publication, though during her time in the state legislature as a senator, she voted in favor of the </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?212+vot+SV0271HB1889+HB1889" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Residential Landlord and Tenant Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her challenger, Democrat Missy Cotter Smasal, acknowledged the Mercury’s request for comment but did not follow through with a response in time for this publication. Her website touches on housing policy while addressing the economy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We need to stop the price gouging on groceries, and stop massive corporations from buying up houses and raising rent,” she wrote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In District 7, Democratic candidate Eugene Vindman expressed support for building more homes that middle-class families can purchase and “support programs that help first-time homebuyers buy a house.” He added that he’s concerned about out-of-state corporations buying homes that they then sell or rent at higher prices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In Congress, I will work to take on these speculators who are putting regular people&#8217;s American dream out of reach,” he said in an email. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican candidate Derrick Anderson said he’s going to focus initially on how Congress can help reduce inflation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The first thing I’d do is pass a federal balanced budget amendment – ridiculous inflationary spending drove up housing prices (and grocery costs, gas costs, etc),” he said in an email. “Let’s stop the spending and get inflation down for the sake of Virginians who are struggling to get by.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In District 10, Republican Mike Clancy could not be reached for comment by the time of this publication. His campaign website doesn’t include housing policy, but it does stress his goal of helping to reduce inflation and stimulate the economy by “unleashing American innovation” and energy as well as reducing regulations on small businesses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrat Suhas Subramanyam’s campaign replied to The Mercury’s inquiry but did not follow through with his housing policy plans should he become a congressman before publication. He has supported affordability measures as a state senator: This year he </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB597" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">co-sponsored a bill </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">to allow more Virginian localities to utilize Low Income Housing Tax Credits when approving developments, but it was vetoed by Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In District 9, Democratic challenger Karen Baker supports expansion of tax credits that can help spur construction of affordable housing available to various levels of area median income. She also wants to</span><a href="https://www.bakerforva9th.com/affordable-housing" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “work on tailored solutions that address the specific needs of rural communities,”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> like the Southwest Virginia ones she seeks to represent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his tenure as representative, Morgan Griffith has </span><a href="https://morgangriffith.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=402287" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">supported funding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> appropriations to his district meant to help with affordable housing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine has cited his early-career experience as a fair housing lawyer before he went into politics. As a member of congress, he pointed to a bill he co-sponsored, the </span><a href="https://www.kaine.senate.gov/press-releases/klobuchar-kaine-introduce-legislation-to-address-nationwide-housing-shortage" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Housing Supply and Affordability Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which would create a grant program for state and local governments to tap into. He’s also been involved with the </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/2797" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Low-Income First-Time Homebuyers Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which would establish fixed-rate 20 year mortgages for first-time buyers whose income doesn’t exceed a certain amount. Both bills have been introduced multiple times but have yet to become law. Kaine also supports expansions to Low Income Housing Tax Credits, which helps increase affordable housing supply. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine’s opponent, Hung Cao, </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/how-kamala-harris-new-policy-plan-could-impact-housing-in-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">echoes a stance of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump that ties housing issues to the U.S.-Mexico border</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“First and foremost, we need to secure the border,” Cao said in an email to The Mercury. “Everything that’s going wrong in our country right now is a direct result of our wide-open southern border. Housing costs are at an all-time high because there&#8217;s millions who were not here a few years ago for which we need to provide housing.” </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Guns</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Congress remains at a standstill as lawmakers fiercely debate the future of gun rights in America, with proponents of stricter gun control measures clashing with staunch defenders of the Second Amendment. Amid a surge in mass shootings and growing public outcry, both sides are digging in, setting the stage for what will likely be another defining battle over gun laws as the nation is headed toward the 2024 presidential election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the Senate, U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., who was governor of Virginia when the deadly mass shooting at Virginia Tech took place in 2007, co-sponsored the Virginia Plan to Reduce Gun Violence, which he said would enact the same gun safety provisions passed by the Democratic-controlled Virginia General Assembly in 2020 at the federal level. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hung Cao, Kaine’s Republican opponent, strictly opposes further legislation that he believes would infringe Second Amendment rights. Instead, Cao proposes that gun-related violence to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. Prosecutors who refuse to enforce the law must be held accountable, the retired U.S. Navy captain said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia’s 2nd Congressional District, U.S. Rep. Jen Kiggans, R-Virginia Beach, in 2023 received a 100% rating by Gun Owners of America (GOA), a national gun rights organization, and a 92% rating by the National Rifle Association (NRA) in the previous year. While in the Virginia legislature, Kiggans has voted against universal background checks, expanding red flag laws that take guns out of the hands of domestic abusers and those who pose a threat to Virginians, and against prohibiting guns in schools and childcare centers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Missy Cotter Smasal, Kiggans’ Democratic opponent, states on her campaign website that she is committed to legislation seeking to prevent gun violence, create safer communities, and prevent veteran suicide. Smasal said that there are “commonsense measures supported by large majorities of Virginians” that can make Virginia’s neighborhoods safer while also protecting individual rights.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In District 7, Derrick Anderson, the Republican nominee, has stated that Second Amendment rights are sacred and shall not be infringed upon. As a former special forces Green Beret, Anderson vows to be “a strong advocate for gun owners in the halls of Congress.” Earlier this year, the Republican turned to the social media platform X, where </span><a href="https://x.com/DerrickforVA/status/1774127722647687559" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">he said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that Americans have to “stand up for and protect our 2nd Amendment rights.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eugene Vindman, a former career military officer and the Democratic nominee, supports gun safety measures such as background checks and red flag laws to keep guns out of the hands of criminals, the mentally ill, and others who might cause harm. While he believes in the right of law-abiding gun owners to own firearms, Vindman also pushes for more legislation ensuring public safety. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Rep. Morgan Griffith, R-Salem, the incumbent in District 9, is a strong advocate for Second Amendment rights. Griffith said in a statement to The Mercury that he does not support government-mandated registrations of guns but that he backs harsher penalties for offenders who “abuse the right to have guns” by committing felonious crimes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrat Karen Baker, Griffith’s opponent and a gun owner, said she backs rigorous gun safety training for children in school. She is also pushing for enhanced gun safety laws, including tax credits for trigger locks, and she has called for enhanced mental health services for troubled individuals, and a legal mechanism to manage early reports of suspicious behaviors involving non-imminent ideation of shootings. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Across the state in District 10, constitutional lawyer Mike Clancy, the Republican nominee, has vowed to defend Americans’ constitutional rights without exception, including the Second Amendment right to bear arms. Instead of regulating gun ownership. Clancy is pushing for legislation to fully fund law enforcement to ensure law enforcement has the training and equipment to protect Virginia’s communities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During his time in Virginia’s state legislature, Sen. Suhas Subramanyam, D-Loudoun, Clancy’s opponent, has actively supported several gun safety laws, including </span><a href="https://www.suhasforvirginia.com/press-and-media/key-gun-violence-prevention-bills-from-senator-subramanyam-vetoed-by-gun-lobby-backed-governor" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">several measures which passed the General Assembly just this year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, two of which were signed by Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican. Suhas told The Mercury he believes America can achieve serious progress on this issue while respecting the Second Amendment, and without undermining the rights of responsible gun owners.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Education/Project 2025</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With divergent calls from some to eliminate the U.S. Department of Education and from others to improve teacher pay, public education is a top matter for voters in Virginia and across the nation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a Pew Research Center </span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2024/04/23/what-are-americans-top-foreign-policy-priorities/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> published in April, half of the Americans surveyed said that public K-12 education is going in the wrong direction. Some believe that schools should spend more time on core academic subjects. At the same time, communities, including those in Virginia, are sparring over what is taught in schools, particularly history, and gauging if students are falling behind in their studies and how to address that challenge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schools are also facing confrontation from parents over social issues, such as the types of books that are allowed in schools and the treatment of transgender students. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of these education issues and recommendations to address them are outlined in </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/04/what-could-project-2025-mean-for-education-in-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Project 2025</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — a conservative plan for how the country should operate if a Republican wins the White House. Some support the plan and others fear it could derail previous efforts to improve public education in Virginia.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the state’s District 2 congressional race, Republican nominee and incumbent Jen Kiggans has publicly supported</span><a href="https://jenforcongress.com/issues/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> prioritizing students&#8217; safety and security</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and equipping teachers with tools and resources to improve student outcomes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She voted for the </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/5" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Parents Bills of Rights</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a measure to “ensure the rights of parents are honored in public schools” and stands against critical race theory, a graduate-level framework that focuses on racial inequity and has not been found in Virginia curricula.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like the authors of Project 2025 and Kiggans, the Republican nominee for the District 10 seat Mike Clancy said he supports school choice. </span></p>
<p>Democratic nominee Eugene Vindman, in District 7, said he opposes book bans and the project, which he <a class="c-link" href="https://dailyprogress.com/opinion/column/eugene-vindman-project-2025-is-a-threat-to-democracy/article_709f3f3a-6a2a-11ef-927e-b310eb440bd5.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://dailyprogress.com/opinion/column/eugene-vindman-project-2025-is-a-threat-to-democracy/article_709f3f3a-6a2a-11ef-927e-b310eb440bd5.html" data-sk="tooltip_parent">sa</a>id his opponent and Republican nominee Derrick Anderson has failed to denounce.</p>
<p>Anderson said Vindman is “lying” and denied supporting the project&#8217;s proposal to eliminate the U.S. Department of <span class="c-mrkdwn__highlight">Education</span>.</p>
<p>He said he supports helping students in his home district “succeed” and will advocate for ensuring that “test scores go up and conflicts go down.”</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In District 9, Karen Baker, the democratic nominee, said she supports strengthening public schools, much like Vindman.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Baker’s </span><a href="https://www.bakerforva9th.com/issues" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">campaign website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, she supports making universal preschool “a reality for all families” in Southwest Virginia. She also supports investing in vocational education and making it accessible to the area. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Suhas Subramanyam, the Democratic nominee in District 10, said if elected, he will work to expand Pre-K, access to “critical“ job training into apprentice programs, and support providing resources to local schools to close the pandemic, learning loss gap.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He told the Mercury that if the recommendations for Project 2025 were implemented, it would “devastate” Virginia’s public education system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We must do the opposite: invest in our schools, support our parents and teachers, and make college and postgraduate education affordable,” Subramanyam’s campaign said in a statement.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Environment/Climate</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic candidates in Virginia’s congressional races largely have expressed the desire to address climate change by transitioning to zero-carbon generation sources. Some candidates differentiate themselves, like District 3 incumbent U.S. Rep. Bobby </span><a href="https://www.bobbyscottforcongress.com/the-scott-record" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scott</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who’s advocated for funding Norfolk’s flood wall to reduce sea level rise damage. District 6 contender Ken </span><a href="https://www.kenmitchellforvirginia.com/issues" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mitchell</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> highlighted a need to “transition public investments away from propping up fossil fuel companies” on his campaign site, while District 11 incumbent U.S. Rep. Gerry </span><a href="https://gerryconnolly.com/issues/environment/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Connolly</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has said he’s an advocate for environmental justice, an environmental lens that amplifies the voices and needs of overlooked and overburdened communities during development that could impact their area. District 9 candidate Karen </span><a href="https://www.bakerforva9th.com/coal-miners" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Baker </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">doesn’t address climate change on her website, but highlights a need to protect coal miners’ health.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Across the aisle, Republican congressional candidates also mostly fall in line with each other’s environmental policy views by advocating for  </span><a href="https://www.mikeclancyforcongress.com/services-5" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reducing regulations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.hungforva.com/enviornment/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">energy independence</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or promoting energy sources stemming from </span><a href="https://cline.house.gov/issues/energy/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fossil fuels</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><a href="https://sitkaforcongress.com/on-the-issues" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">nuclear</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Some candidates don’t take clear positions about their environmental policy plans. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taking unique approaches on the GOP side are District 2 incumbent U.S. Rep Jen Kiggans, who signed onto a letter with other House Republicans earlier this year asking for House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana to </span><a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/some-house-republicans-warn-against-climate-law-repeal/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">not repeal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> tax credits of the IRA, which have helped incentivize a burgeoning offshore wind </span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2024/07/09/south-korean-company-plans-to-build-681-million-offshore-wind-submarine-cable-plant-in-chesapeake/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">development</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> industry in the Hampton Roads region. U.S. Rep.

District 7 candidate Derrick Anderson doesn’t offer a clear position on his website.</span></p>

Some environmental groups say the bill includes some concessions for continued natural gas use. Whichever party gains majority control of Congress could determine the fate of that bill.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Election integrity</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Concerns over election integrity and the potential for voter fraud have sparked a renewed focus in Congress, as lawmakers from both parties debate how best to safeguard the democratic process. With allegations of fraudulent voting making headlines in recent election cycles, the issue has become a political flashpoint. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While some legislators call for stricter voting regulations to prevent potential abuse, others argue that such measures could suppress voter participation. As the 2024 election approaches, members of Congress are crafting new policies aimed at ensuring fair elections while addressing public concerns over security and accessibility.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the U.S. Senate, Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., has carried legislation such as the Freedom to Vote Act, which would implement provisions like automatic voter registration, same-day and Election Day voter registration, online voter registration, and no-excuse mail voting. Kaine has also co-sponsored the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, which seeks to restore and update crucial protections against voting discrimination that were weakened by recent Supreme Court decisions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine’s Republican opponent Hung Cao, a retired U.S. Navy captain who is backed by former President Donald Trump, has proposed few legislative means to secure the electoral process beyond a universal requirement for providing a voter ID in order to cast a ballot. But he said in a statement to The Mercury that “the only way to have election integrity is to have people watch the polls.” Cao has also suggested that the U.S. hold elections like the ones he witnessed in Iraq and Afghanistan, where people vote with their finger and blue ink. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In July, U.S. Rep. Jen Kiggans, R-Virginia Beach, who represents House District 2, voted in support of the </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/118/bills/hr8281/BILLS-118hr8281rh.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which passed in the House of Representatives by a 221-198 vote. Advocates of the SAVE Act say it would ensure that only citizens can vote in federal elections, partly by making it mandatory for states to obtain proof of citizenship to register voters and also requiring states to purge noncitizens from voter rolls. But President Joe Biden has vowed to veto the measure, stating that it would make it more difficult for eligible voters to register and increase “the risk that eligible voters are purged from voter rolls.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kiggans’ Democratic challenger Missy Cotter Smasal, who previously mounted an unsuccessful campaign in Virginia’s 8th Senate District, has talked little about election integrity legislation. But the U.S. Navy veteran has attacked her Republican opponent for being  a “big supporter of President Trump” for backing “Big Lie” conspiracy theorists in Virginia’s state legislature by being one of </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/02/24/virginia-youngkin-tax-cuts-house-senate/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">only four Senators to vote for an audit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the 2020 election that would have cost Virginia taxpayers $70 million.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Derrick Anderson, a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">former special forces Green Beret and the Republican nominee in District 7, has talked little publically about election integrity and he offers no clues about his views on his campaign website, but in </span><a href="https://dailyprogress.com/news/local/government-politics/elections/derrick-anderson-talks-biden-the-border-and-inflation-ahead-of-tuesdays-gop-primary/article_a009bd2a-2837-11ef-9cbd-0f478e969dbd.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an interview</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with The Daily Progress he acknowledged that Joe Biden is the legitimate president.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If elected, Anderson’s Democratic opponent Eugene Vindman, the twin brother of anti-Trump whistleblower Alexander Vindman, has vowed to work to pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and strengthen protections for election workers, “so that anyone who threatens a poll volunteer or election official in an attempt to undermine our vote is held accountable.” Vindman, whose family emigrated to the United States from the former Soviet Union, has also warned against downplaying the Jan. 6, 2021 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, which he blamed on a pro-Trump movement that did not recognize the nation’s norms of peaceful transfer of power and that he said undermines elections across the country to this day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Rep. Morgan Griffith, R-Salem, the incumbent in District 9, in 2023 sponsored the </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/4460" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">No Vote for Non-Citizens Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, seeking to ensure only eligible American citizens may participate in federal elections. The bill, which is still moving through the House, withholds some federal dollars that go to localities that allow non-citizens to vote in their elections. Griffith also voted for the SAVE Act. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrat Karen Baker, Griffith’s opponent, told The Mercury that Republicans have failed to provide any evidence of voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election and therefore there is no reason to believe that this year’s election will be different. Baker also stated that fears of undocumented immigrants voting are generated to induce distrust of election integrity but are absolutely without basis, and she has criticized Griffith for refusing to state that he will accept the outcome of the 2024 presidential election. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Mike Clancy, an attorney from Loudoun County and the Republican nominee in District 10, does not list election integrity as one of his legislative priorities on his campaign website, he has been outspoken on social media about strengthening election laws. “Congress must pass the SAVE Act,” Clancy </span><a href="https://x.com/MikeClancyVA/status/1811031488923586986" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said on X</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in July. “Only U.S. citizens should be voting in our elections.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State Sen. Suhas Subramanyam, D-Loudoun, Clancy’s opponent and a strict opponent of the SAVE Act, believes that “democracy is under attack” in America. The son of Indian immigrants, Subramanyam has vowed to continue to fight against “restrictive voter ID laws that are designed to suppress the vote, protect early voting to ensure greater access to the polls, and combat political gerrymandering.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Immigration</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Americans find that more migrants are turning to the United States for employment opportunities or to escape violent conflict in their home countries, among other reasons, they are increasingly interested in candidates&#8217; views on immigration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">America has become one of the most prominent destinations for migrants. However, over several years, many migrants have entered the country illegally, prompting backlash. At the same time, migrants have also been a staple of America’s workforce, including in the commonwealth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the </span><a href="https://map.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/locations/virginia/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">American Immigration Council</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, immigrants comprised about 12.6% of Virginia’s total population in 2022, and 16.2% of Virginia&#8217;s labor force.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the District 9 race, Republican nominee and incumbent Morgan Griffith said immigrants are welcome to come to the United States “legally” and share in the “American dream,&#8221; but supports “cracking down” on illegal immigration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While criticizing the House for ducking its responsibility, Democratic nominee Karen Baker in District 9 said Congress needs to pass comprehensive immigration reform. She said she supports the Senate&#8217;s template for more border control agents and asylum officers and advocates for a DACA bill to protect children who have lived in the U.S. their entire lives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the District 2 race, Jen Kiggans’ campaign said the Republican nominee and incumbent voted for legislation to increase security at the U.S. border by ensuring that federal immigration officials have the training and resources to stop the influx of illegal immigration, drugs and crime into the U.S. The measure has remained in the Senate since last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kiggans supports strict enforcement of existing federal immigration laws and holding President Joe Biden’s administration accountable. She also backed legislation to prevent the administration from using National Parks to house illegal immigrants.</span></p>
<p>Derrick Anderson, the Republican nominee for the District 7 seat, said he <a class="c-link" href="https://dailyprogress.com/news/local/government-politics/elections/derrick-anderson-talks-biden-the-border-and-inflation-ahead-of-tuesdays-gop-primary/article_a009bd2a-2837-11ef-9cbd-0f478e969dbd.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://dailyprogress.com/news/local/government-politics/elections/derrick-anderson-talks-biden-the-border-and-inflation-ahead-of-tuesdays-gop-primary/article_a009bd2a-2837-11ef-9cbd-0f478e969dbd.html" data-sk="tooltip_parent">supports</a> shutting down the border.</p>
<p>“It’s clear that the crisis at the border is hurting people right here in Virginia’s 7th District,” Anderson said in a statement. “Drugs, fentanyl, human trafficking – we need a serious change. We need to secure the border.”</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Suhas Subramanyam, the Democratic nominee in District 10, said with the U.S. immigration system being “broken,” he supports the country taking a comprehensive approach to the problem by starting with securing the border and ensuring that people who are doing “the right things the right way and contributing to our economy“ have a path to citizenship.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said the country must also fix its “broken” asylum system.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Foreign policy (Israel-Hamas conflict, China, Ukraine)</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Virginia voters are following their congressional candidates&#8217; views on common issues in the U.S., they are also considering their responses to global conflicts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a Pew Research Center </span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2024/04/23/what-are-americans-top-foreign-policy-priorities/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that was completed in April, two of the most important issues to Americans are limiting the powers of China and finding a solution to the Israel-Hamas conflict.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Americans are also interested in limiting Russia’s powers following its invasion of Ukraine in Feb. 2022.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., said he takes pride in the fact that he is among a wide slate of lawmakers President Vladimir Putin of Russia permanently banned from visiting Russia in response to his record of standing against Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine two years ago. Kaine has voted for aid to Ukraine, and earlier this year he helped pass a supplemental package that included support for the country to defend its sovereignty. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine also said he views the U.S.-China relationship as the most consequential bilateral relationship of the century. Kaine voted to pass the </span><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/08/09/fact-sheet-chips-and-science-act-will-lower-costs-create-jobs-strengthen-supply-chains-and-counter-china/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CHIPS and Science Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> designed to outcompete China by shoring up domestic supply chains and bringing manufacturing back to America. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After Hamas terrorists attacked Israeli territories on Oct. 7, 2023, Kaine has worked with Democrats, Republicans, and the Biden administration to ensure that Israel has defensive support. But Kaine has also called for a reduction of civilian casualties, supported the safe and swift delivery of humanitarian assistance to civilians in Gaza and the West Bank, and for long-term solutions to allow Palestinians and Israelis to live alongside each other in peace.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine’s Republican opponent and former U.S. Navy captain Hung Cao in a statement criticized the Biden administration and Congress for giving “blanket amounts of money” towards Ukraine’s defense effort, alleging the financial support instead helps fund Ukraine’s retired workers pension plans. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cao considers China an “existential threat” to the United States, and he has further called for the continued support of Israel, which he considers one of the United States’ closest allies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Jen Kiggans’ campaign, the District 2 Republican nominee and incumbent supports legislation to impose sanctions against China for its responsibility in the fentanyl crisis and </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/22/cosponsors" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">prevent selling any petroleum to Chinese Communist Party-controlled entities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her campaign also said she prioritizes protecting American jobs and intellectual property from being stolen by the CCP.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Derrick Anderson, the Republican nominee in District 7 and a former special forces Green Beret with six tours of duty overseas, including Afghanistan, Iraq, and various countries throughout the Middle East, told the </span><a href="https://jewishinsider.com/2024/04/virginia-congressional-candidate-derrick-anderson-military/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Jewish Insider”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in an interview in April that Congress needs to move quickly to provide additional aid to the Jewish state in its war against Hamas. He added that he was skeptical of sending more U.S. funds to the Palestinians, noting that other countries are providing aid. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like Anderson, his Democratic opponent Eugene Vindman, also a veteran, called for continued support for Israel, while asking that the U.S. continue to ensure that all the hostages — including Americans — are returned safe and sound to their families. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vindman has also pushed for the continued support of Ukraine in both military and economic terms, and for taking on China&#8217;s state-directed economic system, which he said unfairly competes in the market and compromises America’s national security. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While U.S. Rep. Morgan Griffith, R-Salem, voted for the Ukraine Democracy Defense Lend-Lease Act of 2022, which allowed the lending and lease of American defense material to the country in its defense of the Russian invasion, he also also voted to block similar legislation last year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Griffith </span><a href="https://morgangriffith.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=403045" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">has called</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> China a “dangerous, power-hungry actor” over the country’s territorial claims in the South China Sea, as well as its escalating efforts to control Taiwan, while </span><a href="https://morgangriffith.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=403086" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">criticizing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> President Joe Biden’s decision to hold an arms shipment to Israel last spring. Griffith also said that America’s dealings with other countries must be driven by a careful analysis of what best serves the United States and its citizens.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In relation to the conflict between Israel and Hamas, Karen Baker, Griffith’s Democratic opponent, has pointed out that while she acknowledged Israel’s right to exist, there are “bad acts on both sides.” Baker has also endorsed the continued financial and military support of Ukraine by the United States, </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Suhas Subramanyam, the Democratic nominee in District 10, said he supports the U.S. in opposing Russia leader Vladimir Putin&#8217;s territorial ambitions in Europe and standing up to China, which is “violating international law and illegally dumping goods to prop up their economy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also supports the CHIPS Act, which helped to boost domestic research and manufacturing of semiconductor chips.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for the Israel-Hamas war, Subramanyam said he supports the U.S. returning hostages, especially  American citizens, and helping to rebuild communities affected by the war.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also supports a two-state solution, adding that Hamas cannot be one of the states.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The human lives lost in this conflict have been devastating for all sides,” Subramanyam said in a statement. “I have visited the region, including the areas of Israel that were attacked, and made good friends there. I want to see an end to the war and a long-term path to peace.”</span></p>

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)</p><p>Advocates for abortion access say compounding crises of abortion bans, rising economic costs and systemic health care issues are beginning to cause significant funding challenges and potential disruptions to reproductive care of all kinds.</p>
<p>Several people described it as a “perfect storm” of problems with the U.S. health care system, particularly post-pandemic, and the rise of abortion bans and other reproductive care restrictions in the wake of the Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision in June 2022. Many individuals must now travel hundreds or thousands of miles to seek abortion care, and the consolidation of demand at a smaller number of clinics is increasing wait times, which means pregnancies progress to a more advanced stage and the costs balloon further. According to leaders of Planned Parenthood affiliates and abortion funds, there simply aren’t enough dollars right now to support the need at any level. A <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/telehealth-abortion-still-rise-especially-states-shield-laws-report-shows" target="_blank">recent report from #WeCount</a> showed the number of abortions nationwide started to increase in 2017 and has continued to increase post-Dobbs, with more than 102,000 abortions in January alone.</p>
<p>Abortion fund directors nationwide have been raising the alarm for months about declining donation revenue and their struggles to meet the needs of those seeking help with the financial burdens of finding abortion care, especially those who live in one of <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/see-data-reproductive-rights" target="_blank">22 states</a> with near-total bans or severely restrictive abortion laws. That includes every state in the Southeast.</p>
<p>Planned Parenthood of Northern New England announced at the beginning of the month a projected <a href="https://mainemorningstar.com/briefs/planned-parenthood-of-northern-new-england-projects-multi-million-dollar-deficit-calls-for-state-funding/" target="_blank">funding shortfall</a> of about $8.6 million over the next three years, and Planned Parenthood of Greater New York announced just a few days later that it would pause abortion care at or beyond 20 weeks because of financial struggles that began earlier this year. The National Abortion Federation runs America’s largest financial assistance program for abortion patients and said that just in the first half of this year it has partially funded more than 60,000 people’s abortions — a total of around $6 million per month — but has now had to reduce patient grants from 50% of the cost of care to 30%.</p>
<p>Even in areas with new abortion restrictions, such as Florida, donations have declined significantly. Stephanie Loraine Piñeiro, executive director of Florida Access Network, said during a June press conference that the month after the Dobbs decision ended federal abortion rights, the fund received $200,000 in individual donations — but after the state supreme court decision in April 2024 reduced the state’s abortion ban from 15 gestational weeks to six weeks, the fund received just $40,000 in donations.</p>
<p>“That is a stark difference, and it has everything to do with donors feeling burnt out,” Loraine Piñeiro said.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">States with abortion access face hostile political winds </h4>

	
<p>Planned Parenthood Federation of America told States Newsroom it is meeting its fundraising goals, but the organization’s local health centers and regional affiliates are struggling to provide care in the current climate.</p>
<p>Nicole Clegg, interim CEO of Planned Parenthood of Northern New England, told States Newsroom the affiliate has always been under-resourced and under-reimbursed for the care it provides, which includes birth control, testing for sexually transmitted diseases and routine gynecological care in addition to abortion services. But now that the region, which includes Maine, Vermont and New Hampshire, is taking on more patients from states with abortion bans, it is reaching a tipping point.</p>
<p>“The services we provide are just not valued by the insurance industry, or Medicaid and Medicare — they have always been poorly reimbursed,” Clegg said. “Once costs really started to skyrocket, the margin we were operating with disappeared.”</p>
<p>According to an analysis of health care spending and costs<a href="https://www.kff.org/health-policy-101-health-care-costs-and-affordability/?entry=table-of-contents-how-do-high-health-costs-affect-affordability-of-care" target="_blank"> by KFF</a>, health spending tripled between the year 2000 and 2022, from $1.4 trillion to $4.5 trillion. The pandemic accelerated that spending, but the analysis also said the aging population of the U.S., rising rates of chronic conditions, inflation, and expansions of insurance coverage have also driven up costs.</p>
<p>A bill that would have provided nearly $3.4 million to Maine’s family planning centers got caught in<a href="https://mainemorningstar.com/2024/05/21/less-than-10-of-bills-on-the-legislatures-2024-appropriations-table-became-law/" target="_blank"> legislative wrangling</a> that affected many appropriations bills at the end of the session.</p>
<p>In New Hampshire, which allows abortions until 24 weeks of pregnancy, the affiliate had nearly secured a multi-year grant of more than $2 million total, with the <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/council-could-get-rejected-family-planning-contracts-fifth-time" target="_blank">support of Republican Gov. Chris Sununu</a>. However, Clegg said that when the grant went before an executive council for final approval in 2023, the members <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/executive-council-republicans-again-reject-family-planning-contracts" target="_blank">struck it down</a>, saying they didn’t want taxpayer dollars to fund abortions. Both led to the projected $8.6 million shortfall over the next three years.</p>
<p>“The executive council has become increasingly hostile to Planned Parenthood,” Clegg said.</p>
<p>Planned Parenthood Great Northwest, which includes northwestern states as well as Hawaii, Alaska, Indiana and Kentucky, also said it is facing financial challenges that put access to care at risk. Lisa Humes-Schulz, vice president of policy and communications for Planned Parenthood Alliance Advocates, said in a statement that the affiliate is facing the same health care cost challenges, an underfunded federal family planning program, workforce shortages and rising labor costs. Great Northwest includes Idaho, where there is a near-total abortion ban and which was at the center of a recent U.S. Supreme Court case over whether emergency room physicians could be prosecuted under the state law for providing an abortion in the case of a medical emergency. The affiliate’s clinics in Washington have seen an influx of patients from Idaho as a result of the abortion ban over the past two years, including some emergency patients that were<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/loss-federal-protection-idaho-spurs-pregnant-patients-plan-emergency-air-transport" target="_blank"> airlifted out of Idaho</a>.</p>
<p>“Unlike other safety net providers, we are trying to navigate these business challenges on top of the unprecedented political attacks focused on providers of abortion care and gender-affirming care,” Humes-Schulz said.</p>
<p>For Planned Parenthood of Greater New York, financial struggles have already prompted a change in care. After the state legislature <a href="https://www.nynmedia.com/opinion/2024/07/opinion-states-abortion-access-ecosystem-pushed-limit-two-years-after-demise-roe-v-wade/397800/" target="_blank">failed to increase Medicaid reimbursement rates</a> for medication abortion, the affiliate said it implemented executive pay cuts, consolidated job functions and closed small health centers to make up deficits. More than half of the patients that visit Planned Parenthood centers rely on Medicaid.</p>
<p>But it took another step in temporarily stopping abortions at 20 or more weeks starting Sept. 3 because it can’t afford to cover the vendor costs for anesthesia. Only one Planned Parenthood location in New York City will offer deep sedation and abortions at 20 or more weeks for now.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘Unprecedented is not even the word anymore’</h4>

	
<p>The struggles also extend to organizations that provide more basic infrastructure for abortion clinics, such as the Abortion Care Network, which started a campaign called Keep Our Clinics to raise funds for independent abortion clinics. Independent clinics make up 55% of abortion providers, according to the network, while Planned Parenthood comprises 41%, and the remaining 4% occur at physicians’ offices and hospitals. The vast majority of clinics offering abortion care after 22 weeks — about 86% — are also independent.</p>
<p>Erin Grant, co-executive director of the Abortion Care Network, told States Newsroom the organization’s mission is to provide grant funding for independent clinics to support infrastructure needs — such as supplies, equipment, building repair, security, and litigation support — rather than patient care. The network has supported 32 clinics, and gave out $700,000 to providers in recent months.</p>
<p>But for the network too, donations are down by one-third. The full amount of donations to the Keep Our Clinics campaign goes to clinic members, and the organization granted nearly $5 million to clinics in 2022, but only $3.4 million in 2023. The requests for support did not go down during that time, but donations did.</p>
<p>Grant said it’s important to support the infrastructure of independent abortion clinics because once they close, it is extremely difficult to work through the bureaucratic process again to reopen them. In areas with newly instituted six-week abortion bans, such as Florida, Iowa and South Carolina, more clinics have closed their doors.</p>
<p>“We are in times where ‘unprecedented’ is not even the word anymore, and there is so much happening that calls for our attention. … There’s a need in this moment for us to hold multiple crises across communities,” Grant said. “… This isn’t something we get to say we did as an immediate need, because there’s decades of work ahead to build the actual infrastructure to have health care access, let alone abortion access in this country.”</p>
<p>During a June press call, several leaders of state abortion funds discussed funding struggles. Oriaku Njoku, executive director of the National Network of Abortion Funds, said the funds provided more than $36 million in abortion funding and $10 million in logistical support in 2023.</p>
<p>“This is not the same movement that it was five years ago, let alone 50 years ago, and yet we’re still operating and funding as if it were the same issue as it was before,” Njoku said.</p>
<p>There are nine clinics in Ohio, where voters affirmed their desire to keep access to abortion in 2023, but it is surrounded by three states with near-total bans — Indiana, Kentucky and West Virginia. Lexis Dotson-Dufault, executive director of the Abortion Fund of Ohio, said during the press conference that her organization averaged about 100 patients per month in 2022, but now it averages more than 500.</p>
<p>“While abortion funds have a huge increase in need, we are not seeing a huge increase in money coming in to support this need,” Dotson-Dufault said.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">National Abortion Federation: Without cutbacks, funding would run out by fall </h4>

	
<p>Planned Parenthood Federation of America, the national organization, did not directly address whether it would provide more support to the affiliates facing significant financial troubles.</p>
<p>“While issues around funding are a concern, it is important to note that the reproductive health care ecosystem is straining under the weight of the post-Dobbs crisis,” a Planned Parenthood spokesperson said in a statement. “PPFA is working to support affiliates as they take action to adapt and continue to provide care.”</p>
<p>The organization’s comments came a few days after 41 abortion funds from around the country signed on to an op-ed <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/activism/abortion-funds-movement-crisis/" target="_blank">in The Nation</a> saying there is a disconnect between the most visible national reproductive rights organizations, like Planned Parenthood and the National Abortion Federation, and grassroots groups working to directly support those who need care. The op-ed called out the National Abortion Federation for cutting back its financial assistance program in July. Signers included the Abortion Fund of Ohio and the Florida Access Network.</p>
<p>Brittany Fonteno, CEO and president of the National Abortion Federation, called the change an “incredibly heartbreaking and difficult” decision that had to be made despite an “incredible and generous budget” that is the largest it has ever been. She said that in the first half of this year, NAF was funding at $6 million per month for abortion care, and then upwards of $200,000 per month in patient assistance funds to help with associated travel costs. These patient assistance funds are completely funded by foundation and individual donors, Fonteno said, noting that individual donations dropped nearly 40% in 2023 from the previous year after the Dobbs decision leaked.</p>
<p>In 2023, NAF said it funded 106,865 people with an average amount of $519 per patient. So far in 2024, the hotline has funded 66,330 people at an average of $541 per patient.</p>
<p>“We’re truly in a public health emergency right now, and unfortunately, we just can’t keep pace with the patient need,” Fonteno told States Newsroom. “We had to make this decision in order to make sure that we could stretch our funds and make sure that we could help as many people as possible for the rest of this year. If we hadn’t made this decision, then we would have run out of funding in the fall.”</p>
<p>The changes include no longer making exceptions for those in later stages of pregnancy who face higher costs — sometimes as much as $10,000, Fonteno said — because the procedure costs more or they have to travel further to find a clinic that can provide it. That “exception budget,” which was also used for patients facing extreme circumstances like intimate partner violence, will not exist for the remainder of the year, according to Fonteno.</p>
<p>“Of course, we’re working incredibly hard to try to fundraise, to try to get the word out and bring awareness to this issue. And if we’re able to fundraise, we may be able to consider increasing the funding that we’re able to do,” she said.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Presidential election matters, director says </h4>

	
<p>Clegg, interim CEO of Planned Parenthood of Northern New England, said the problems will only get exponentially worse if the presidential election in November breaks for Republicans over Democrats. Project 2025, the <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/states-are-already-collecting-more-abortion-data-and-hipaa-wont-always-keep-it-private" target="_blank">blueprint document produced by the Heritage Foundation</a> for the next Republican presidential administration to follow, calls for the federal government to <a href="https://static.project2025.org/2025_MandateForLeadership_FULL.pdf#page=504" target="_blank">prohibit Planned Parenthood from receiving any Medicaid funds</a> (for non-abortion reproductive health services; federal funding of abortion is <a href="https://www.kff.org/womens-health-policy/issue-brief/the-hyde-amendment-and-coverage-for-abortion-services-under-medicaid-in-the-post-roe-era/#:~:text=Since%201977%2C%20the%20Hyde%20Amendment,result%20from%20rape%20or%20incest." target="_blank">currently prohibited</a>) and issue guidance to states that says they are free to defund Planned Parenthood in their state Medicaid plans as well.</p>
<p>Instead, it calls for the funding to be redirected to “health centers that provide real health care for women.” The anti-abortion organizations involved in crafting the document, such as Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, often promote funding for crisis pregnancy centers, which counsel pregnant patients against abortion and are known to spread misinformation about the procedure. A recent analysis from reproductive rights advocacy group Equity Forward showed<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/abortion-states-have-spent-nearly-500-million-on-anti-abortion-counseling-centers/" target="_blank"> nearly $490 million</a> was allocated in 23 state budgets over the past two years for crisis pregnancy centers, most of which were in the same states that restrict abortion access.</p>
<p>“It’s not just making sure the public understands that we need them to engage and partner with us to make sure we can keep providing the care; it’s also having them connect the dots to the November election and understand that who they vote for, who they put in office is going to determine our future,” Clegg said.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said it in the June </span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/trump-made-false-claims-late-term-abortion-debate-rcna159460" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">presidential debate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, on a panel at the </span><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=trump+nabj+stream&amp;client=safari&amp;sca_esv=659c3819f780e791&amp;sca_upv=1&amp;rls=en&amp;ei=6u20Zo_PJbWu5NoPyufosAc&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiP7MSa5OWHAxU1F1kFHcozGnYQ4dUDCBA&amp;uact=5&amp;oq=trump+nabj+stream&amp;gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiEXRydW1wIG5hYmogc3RyZWFtSIYRUM4FWPkPcAF4AZABAJgBUKAB0wOqAQE3uAEDyAEA-AEBmAIAoAIAmAMAiAYBkgcAoAe7Ag&amp;sclient=gws-wiz-serp#fpstate=ive&amp;vld=cid:f9fd87d0,vid:yjN5dvDTeaE,st:0" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Association of Black Journalists conference</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in July, and more recently during an Aug. 8 </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/McXjpQFFN90" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">press conference at his Mar-A-Lago estate in Florida</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Based on the [former] governor of Virginia, they’re allowing the death of the baby after it’s born,” Trump said of Democrat Ralph Northam, who was governor from 2018 to 2022. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But infanticide is illegal in all U.S. states. Abortion, which terminates a fetus before it is born, is </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacodefull/title18.2/chapter4/article9/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legal for any reason up until around 26 weeks of gestation in Virginia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with limited exceptions for later abortions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The infanticide allegation stems from a </span><a href="https://wtop.com/ask-the/2019/01/virginia-gov-northam-joins-wtop-live-jan-30/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">WTOP interview</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with Northam in which he described palliative care for babies born with severe complications and low survival rates — not abortion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Palliative care is a type of care to keep dying patients comfortable. It’s typically applied to those dying of old age or terminal illness, but can be used for babies born with severe fetal anomalies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clips from Northam’s interview fed into the popular “no limits” or “moment of birth” narrative that abortion opponents have pushed over the years in Virginia and beyond. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Because [Northam] never provided the full context of the issue, his comments were interpreted that way — and one could see why they were interpreted that way,” said political analyst Bob Holsworth. </span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">How the national allegation took hold in Virginia </h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flash back to the winter of 2019. Del. Kathy Tran, D-Fairfax had </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+sum+HB2491" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that would have lowered the three-physician threshold of approval for abortions that occur later in pregnancy.  </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_35027" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:300px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/04/19/56-of-virginia-abortions-were-performed-via-medication-in-2021/img_8710/" rel="attachment wp-att-35027"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-35027" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/abortion_legal_sign-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/abortion_legal_sign-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/abortion_legal_sign-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/abortion_legal_sign-768x511.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/abortion_legal_sign-1536x1022.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/abortion_legal_sign-2048x1363.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  A sign outside a clinic that provides abortions in Richmond, Va. (Sarah Vogelsong / Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abortions at or after 21 weeks of gestation are rare, </span><a href="https://www.kff.org/womens-health-policy/issue-brief/abortions-later-in-pregnancy-in-a-post-dobbs-era/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">making up 1% of abortions nationally</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. These types of abortions tend to happen later in pregnancy because severe fetal anomalies aren’t usually detected earlier through tests or ultrasound. They may also happen because a life-threatening emergency arises later in pregnancy. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacodefull/title18.2/chapter4/article9/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> then and now also allows for instances where continuing a pregnancy would “irremediably impair” a person’s mental health too. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">During a committee hearing on Tran’s bill, Del. Todd Gilbert, R-Shenandoah, asked if the bill would allow for an abortion to occur if a woman were already in labor. Tran answered “yes,” though she later said that she misspoke.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tran told The Washington Post </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I should have said: ‘Clearly, no, because infanticide is not allowed in Virginia, and what would have happened in that moment would be a live birth.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Holsworth thinks Tran “botched the answer.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When Northam attempted to rectify the situation, he made it worse.” </span></p>

<p><strong>Status of abortion rights in Virginia</strong></p>
<p>Abortion remains legal in Virginia and next year Democrats will begin a process to enshrine protections in the state’s constitution. The measure will need to pass two years in a row with a House of Delegates election in between before it could appear on statewide ballots in 2026. From there, voters will give final approval or rejection.</p>
<p>Trump has repeatedly claimed that he thinks the matter should be settled on a state by state basis while Vice President Kamala Harris has made restoring federal protections a platform of her campaign.</p>
<p>Democrats are skeptical if Trump is being truthful in his states’ purview stance.</p>
<p>Project 2025, a policy guideline published by conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation, points to federal mechanisms to further restrict abortion and ban abortion pills nationally. Trump has said he doesn’t know “who is behind” the blueprint, though members of his previous administration authored portions of it. In a recent press conference, he did not rule out having the Food and Drug Administration revoke access to abortion pills. </div>
	</div>
	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Northam had explained how later abortions typically occur because of fetal survivability issues. He added that if a person were in active labor, a birth would occur. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If a mother is in labor, I can tell you exactly what would happen. The infant would be delivered,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then he added what has since percolated in messaging from abortion opponents in the years since: </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The infant would be kept comfortable. The infant would be resuscitated if that’s what the mother and the family desired, and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the allegation has been </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-ralph-northam-virginia-abortion-952598071326" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">debunked</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> multiple times over the years, it has taken a mythic and persistent root in political arguments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic Party of Virginia chairwoman Susan Swecker declined to comment when asked about Trump’s rhetoric of Virginia to national audiences and Republican Party of Virginia chairman Rich Anderson did not respond. </span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Abortions and palliative care needs will continue</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia abortion providers have reported a </span><a href="https://www.wvtf.org/news/2024-08-07/report-as-southern-states-ban-abortion-virginia-sees-increase-pf-out-of-state-patients-seeking-services" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">spike in out-of-state patients</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And sometimes patients have had to travel up to Maryland. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diane Horvath, an OB GYN, said her Maryland-based clinic is seeing more patients in need of later abortions. Her clinic provides the procedure regardless of how early or late in gestation patients are. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As surrounding states have near total bans or restrictions as deep as six weeks, patients are sometimes needing to travel to areas that can legally give them abortions. While some people may not know they are pregnant earlier in gestation, for others it may take time to arrange appointments, leave work, or find childcare. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then in the cases of fetal anomalies that might inspire someone to seek an abortion, patients may not find out until after their state’s abortion limit. Some testing that reveals anomalies doesn’t occur </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/two-women-two-pregnancies-two-agonizing-decisions/article_24e5d5fc-742d-11ee-984d-6befc702d5d0.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">until after 15 weeks of gestation and can take about two weeks to reveal results</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Horvath said that when parents are faced with severe fetal anomalies sometimes aborting the fetus can be the easier choice, while for others that might be birthing, then burying their child, who has died from natural causes after palliative care.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Horvath said to insinuate infanticide is “willfully misrepresenting an incredibly difficult circumstance that happens to some families when their baby has a lethal diagnosis.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As abortion continues to be a political talking point, it’s the patient experiences she hopes lawmakers can reflect on. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When you ban abortion at a certain point in pregnancy, it just pushes people further into pregnancy. Some people still need an abortion, they just have to work a lot harder to get it,” Horvath said. “That takes a lot of time and a lot of resources, and it&#8217;s just hard on people — nobody would do this unless they absolutely needed it.”</span></p>

J.D. Vance, and many GOP candidates have attempted to soften their abortion stances while also adopting the longtime movement narrative that abortion is dangerous to women and equivalent to infanticide.</p>
<p>As the first presidential election season since the Supreme Court’s Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision heats up, here are the facts behind the most commonly touted myths about abortion.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">1. Abortion is safe.</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) concluded in a <a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/24950/the-safety-and-quality-of-abortion-care-in-the-united-states" target="_blank">comprehensive review</a> of the safety and quality of abortion care in the U.S. in 2018 that complications from abortion are rare, especially when <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/anti-abortion-researchers-back-riskier-procedures-when-pregnancy-termination-needed-experts" target="_blank">compared to the complications of pregnancy and childbirth</a>. The anti-abortion movement <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/suspect-science-and-claims-center-abortion-pill-lawsuit" target="_blank">falsely claims</a> abortions are more dangerous than childbirth, and <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/anti-abortion-groups-say-supreme-courts-mifepristone-ruling-wont-deter-them" target="_blank">tried unsuccessfully</a> to legally force the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to revoke its approval of the abortion medication mifepristone. Meanwhile, a new Louisiana law will, starting this fall, classify mifepristone as “dangerous,” despite <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/ob-gyn-questions-louisianas-dangerous-classification-abortion-miscarriage-drugs" target="_blank">opposition from state doctors</a>.</p>
<p>Medication abortion has been the most common way to terminate a pregnancy since 2020, when pills accounted for 53% of all pregnancy terminations, according to the <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/2024/03/medication-abortion-accounted-63-all-us-abortions-2023-increase-53-2020" target="_blank">Guttmacher Institute</a>. When administered at 9 weeks gestation or less, the FDA-approved regimen has a more than <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26241252/" target="_blank">99% completion rate</a>, a<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22898359/" target="_blank"> 0.4% risk</a> of major complications, and a <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/164331/download" target="_blank">reported 32 associated deaths</a> over 22 years. Common <a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/21899-medical-abortion" target="_blank">symptoms</a> include heavy bleeding and cramping, diarrhea, and nausea.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">2. Abortion can reduce health risks and infertility and save lives.</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>There are <a href="https://www.yalemedicine.org/conditions/high-risk-pregnancy" target="_blank">many conditions</a> that can develop during pregnancy — such as ectopic and molar pregnancies, severe preeclampsia, and preterm premature rupture of membranes — that can put the pregnant person at risk of death, serious health complications, and future infertility, as well as make it unlikely the fetus would survive even if the pregnancy continued. Though anti-abortion activists do recognize this reality, they use the political term “<a href="https://lozierinstitute.org/fact-sheet-medical-indications-for-separating-a-mother-and-her-unborn-child/" target="_blank">separation of a mother and her unborn child</a>” to obfuscate that abortion is sometimes necessary. And even in emergency cases, they <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/anti-abortion-researchers-back-riskier-procedures-when-pregnancy-termination-needed-experts" target="_blank">advocate for riskier procedures like C-sections</a> to avoid performing less invasive abortion procedures. Meanwhile, the future legality of emergency abortions in states <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-supreme-court-ruling-reinstates-ability-perform-emergency-abortions-idaho-under-ban" target="_blank">like Idaho</a> remains uncertain.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">3. Abortion is not infanticide. </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Candidates have been <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/political-rhetoric-about-third-trimester-abortion-misleading-experts-say" target="_blank">campaigning on rhetoric</a> that abortion is infanticide and happens “post birth,” “up until the moment of birth,” or “after birth,” as Trump alleged in the June debate with President Joe Biden. However, abortion does not happen “after birth.” That would be categorized as murder, as it was in the case of former Philadelphia abortion doctor and convicted murderer <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/14/us/kermit-gosnell-abortion-doctor-found-guilty-of-murder.html" target="_blank">Kermit Gosnell</a>.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">4. “Late-term” and “partial-birth” abortions are political terms not grounded in science.</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/reproductive-health/data-statistics/abortion-surveillance-findings-reports.html" target="_blank">more than 93%</a> of abortions occur within the first trimester, and less than 1% after 21 weeks’ gestation. Still, anti-abortion groups and candidates emphasize the idea of “late-term” abortions, which is not a medical term. Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, which helps elect anti-abortion candidates, has begun calling the vice president an “<a href="https://sbaprolife.org/newsroom/press-releases/biden-drops-out-endorses-abortion-czar-kamala-harris" target="_blank">abortion czar</a>,” with president Marjorie Dannenfelser claiming Harris wants to “impose on all 50 states all-trimester abortion without any limits, even painful late-term abortions in the 7th, 8th, and 9th month of pregnancy.” Though <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/political-rhetoric-about-third-trimester-abortion-misleading-experts-say" target="_blank">abortions do occur later in pregnancy</a>, they are rare and typically involve nuanced and heartbreaking circumstances. The GOP’s national platform <a href="https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/2024-republican-party-platform" target="_blank">opposes</a> “late term abortion.”</p>
<p>Sometimes anti-abortion activists also refer to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/election-2023-abortion-amendment-ohio-strategy-610e427f753a6803e4a59b7af8aa744f" target="_blank">“partial-birth” abortions</a>, a non-medical term for a procedure known as dilation and extraction (D&amp;X), which is already banned under federal law.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">5. Abortion exceptions for rape, incest, fetal anomalies, and health risks do not exist in most states where abortion is totally banned.</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Despite Republicans’ oft-touted support for rape and incest exceptions in abortion bans, many currently on the books don’t include them. Of the <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/see-data-reproductive-rights" target="_blank">14 states</a> with near-total abortion bans, only Idaho, Indiana, and North Dakota’s maintain some exceptions for survivors of rape and incest. Indiana also allows for abortion if there is a fatal fetal anomaly. Reproductive health experts say abortion exceptions are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/01/21/us/abortion-ban-exceptions.html" target="_blank">rarely granted</a> even when they exist.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">6. The terms “heartbeat bill” and “six-week abortion bans” are misleading. </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Currently Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/iowa-six-week-abortion-ban-take-effect-monday-judge-orders" target="_blank"> soon Iowa</a> will ban abortion at the moment embryonic cardiac activity can be detected on an ultrasound, which typically occurs around <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7065984/#:~:text=Cardiac%20Activity,definitively%20visualize%20fetal%20cardiac%20activity." target="_blank">six weeks’ gestation</a>. This type of law is often referred to as a “heartbeat bill,” but reproductive health experts say the term is <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/09/02/texas-abortion-heartbeat-bill/" target="_blank">misleading</a> because the heart is not fully developed at that stage. These laws are also referred to as six-week bans, which is also misleading, given how gestational age is calculated: by counting from the first day of one’s last menstrual cycle. This is an <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-absurd-pregnancy-math-behind-the-lsquo-six-week-rsquo-abortion-ban/" target="_blank">approximate estimate and varies</a> depending on when conception officially occurs. For many, a six-week ban is closer to four weeks or less of pregnancy, before many people realize they’re pregnant.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">7. The GOP platform contradicts promises to leave abortion to the states and to protect IVF.</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The Republican Party’s recently unveiled “Make America Great Again!” policy platform does not explicitly call for a federal ban on abortion and expresses support for birth control and in vitro fertilization. But it simultaneously <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/rnc-approves-platform-would-give-rights-fetuses-endangering-abortion-ivf" target="_blank">supports states establishing “fetal personhood</a>” under the U.S. Constitution’s 14th Amendment, which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/31/opinion/abortion-fetal-personhood.html" target="_blank">legal experts warn</a> could lead to the criminalization of pregnancy and implicate abortion, contraception, and IVF.</p>
<p>A nationwide concern about Americans’ access to IVF kicked off this winter after the <a href="https://alabamareflector.com/2024/02/19/alabama-supreme-court-ruling-could-end-ivf-treatments-in-state/" target="_blank">Alabama Supreme Court ruled</a> that embryos are “children,” leading IVF clinics in Alabama to shutter temporarily. In the aftermath, some states, including Alabama, have taken steps to ensure access to the fertility treatment, but future access <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/after-abortion-fetal-anomalies-she-hoped-ivf-would-build-her-family-now-thats-doubt" target="_blank">remains largely uncertain</a>, especially as congressional bills to protect IVF nationally have <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-senate-republicans-reject-democrats-bill-ivf-protections" target="_blank">failed to advance</a>.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">8. Emergency contraceptives are not abortifacients but could be impacted by personhood laws.</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Emergency contraceptives like Plan B and ella are designed to be taken shortly after sex, to delay or prevent ovulation. They <a href="https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/committee-opinion/articles/2017/07/access-to-emergency-contraception" target="_blank">are not abortifacients</a>, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and they don’t work on someone who is already pregnant. Anti-abortion activists largely oppose emergency birth control (and <a href="https://studentsforlife.org/learn/contraception/" target="_blank">many other contraceptives</a>), based on outdated drug labeling that Plan B might work by preventing the implantation of a fertilized egg, which many in the movement say should be treated in law <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/can-fetus-be-employee-states-are-testing-boundaries-personhood-after-dobbs" target="_blank">as a person</a>. The FDA <a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/postmarket-drug-safety-information-patients-and-providers/plan-b-one-step-15-mg-levonorgestrel-information" target="_blank">revised the label</a> in December 2022, following additional scientific evidence concluding Plan B works <em>before</em> fertilization.</p>
<p>Research on ella also indicates it <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31351035/#:~:text=UPA%2DEC%20is%20not%20more,the%20dose%20used%20for%20EC." target="_blank">likely does not</a> prevent implantation, but Project 2025 includes a <a href="https://static.project2025.org/2025_MandateForLeadership_FULL.pdf#page=518" target="_blank">proposal</a> to exclude ella from contraceptives currently covered under the Affordable Care Act, referring to it as “a potential abortifacient.”</p>

</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though now somewhat outdated after President Joe Biden dropped out of his campaign for reelection, a recent </span><a href="https://emersoncollegepolling.com/virginia-2024-poll-trump-45-biden-43/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emerson College poll</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> showed former President Donald Trump with a two-point lead over him. While forthcoming polling can help shed more light on a matchup between Trump and current Vice President Kamala Harris, the presumptive Democratic nominee, the Emerson poll also noted where abortion law could give an edge to Harris’ campaign in Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forty-four percent of polled Virginia voters “would like to see abortion laws be less strict.” Meanwhile, 35% support laws remaining as they are — legal for any reason up to about 26 weeks, with limited exceptions later — and 21% support more strict abortion laws, the poll showed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harris has emerged as a national leader in discussing abortion rights — often noting the prominent role electing Democrats plays in retaining or re-establishing abortion rights around the country. Earlier this year, she visited an abortion clinic — an apparent first for a presidential or vice presidential candidate in America. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abortion access has been a winning issue for Democrats around the country in state congressional races since the overturn of federal protections two summers ago. In Virginia, Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin led an effort to build consensus around a </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/abortion-virginia-democrats-republicans/article_7671a5b2-1cef-11ee-b3ed-67d2bc05b52d.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">15-week ban </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">with limited exceptions after that point and most GOP candidates fell in line last year as the entire state legislature was up for election. Amid heated debates about that key issue, Democrats </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/11/08/virginia-democrats-triumph-in-statehouse-elections-reducing-youngkins-power/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">held their majority in the Senate and gained control of the House of Delegates.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nationwide, a </span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/fact-sheet/public-opinion-on-abortion/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pew Research Center </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">survey found that two thirds of the country believes abortion should be legal in most or all cases.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;At this critical point in our history, the leadership of women, both at the federal and state levels, has become even more important,&#8221; said Virginia state senator Ghazala Hashmi, D-Chesterfield, who is a voting delegate at next months Democratic National Convention where Harris can formally become the party&#8217;s nominee. &#8220;On this issue especially, the contrast between Kamala Harris and the dangerous misogyny of Donald Trump is a bright and clear line.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reproductive rights advocates began </span><a href="https://19thnews.org/2024/07/kamala-harris-abortion-2024/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lending their support</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to Harris soon after Biden’s announcement. Planned Parenthood Action Fund’s CEO Alexis McGill Johnson said in a recent statement that she believes Harris will “continue to fight like hell to rebuild a fundamental right that was stripped away.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Trump’s campaign has said Virginia is “in play” among other states that could be key to control of Congress and the White House, Harris’ stance on abortion could be one of her strongest policy positions that could lock down Democratic voters and sway others for whom reproductive rights resonate strongly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Early in their re-election campaign before Biden dropped out, he and Harris announced restoring federal abortion protections as a key pillar of their platform, and </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/elections/biden-harris-virginia-abortion-rights/article_2470d9f4-ba0b-11ee-8a33-cf7a3fed9ec7.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">expressed </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">the same sentiment in Virginia. Democratic leaders around the country have </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/florida-abortion-ban-six-weeks-virginia-susan-swecker/article_e5c13ac8-0708-11ef-9bfa-831eade60f7b.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">also stressed reproductive rights as a key focus of this year’s elections</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aside from abortion, other areas of reproductive rights have emerged as campaign talking points this year as well. When Louisiana’s Supreme Court ruled that embryos are people, it called national </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/virginia-elizabeth-carr-first-ivf-baby/article_4e86ef1e-d7f5-11ee-a484-f38d84585aab.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">access to in vitro fertilization into question.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Virginia brought Norfolk, Va.-born Elizabeth Carr as his State of the Union address guest this year — she was the first American born of IVF. Democratic members of Congress have pressed for a bill to support IVF access nationwide. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They’ve also tried to pass a </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/youngkin-contraception-virginia-general-assembly-hashmi-price/article_c74b197a-fb59-11ee-92c1-1b2a173616ec.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">similar measure</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to protect contraception, as have state lawmakers Sen. Hashmi and Del. Cia Price, D-Newport News. Though Hashmi and Price’s measure passed the state legislature, it was vetoed by Youngkin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price accused the governor at the time of “aligning with the most extreme parts of the Republican Party despite overwhelming support for right to contraception bills.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A largely Democratic yet not totally partisan issue, reproductive rights may continue to feature as prominently in Harris’ presidential campaign as they have nationwide. </span></p>

Abigail Spanberger, D-7th, speaks to a crowd in Richmond, Virginia on the second anniversary of the overturn of federal abortion protections. (Charlotte Rene Woods / Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats are finally talking about the Comstock Act — and they are finally trying to repeal it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The act is a dormant 19th century federal law that’s still technically on the books and could be used to implement a national abortion ban. Named for activist Anthony Comstock who pushed for it, the 1873 </span><a href="https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title18-section1461&amp;num=0&amp;edition=prelim" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> prohibits the mailing of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“every article or thing designed, adapted, or intended for producing abortion, or for any indecent or immoral use.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dubbed the “Stop Comstock Act,” U.S. Sen. Tina Smith, D-Minn., announced legislation last week that would repeal portions of it. A House version of the bill is co-sponsored by Virginia Reps. Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond and Abigail Spanberger, D-Henrico.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More broadly, the Gilded Age-era law focuses on obscene materials such as pornography, but other provisions of it have included abortifacients and contraception. The contraception components were stripped away over the years. While its abortion components have not been enforced, the law has been used in child pornography prosecutions. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.congress.gov/search?q=%7B%22source%22%3A%22legislation%22%2C%22search%22%3A%22%5C%22comstock%5C%22+AND+%5C%22abortion%5C%22%22%7D&amp;pageSort=dateOfIntroduction%3Aasc" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Four previous attempts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from decades ago to repeal the abortion components of the act have failed and McClellan was candid about how her bill may not see success in the U.S. House right away due to its current GOP control.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That doesn’t mean we don’t start fighting,” McClellan said, noting how it took her about a decade to pass legislation to remove abortion barriers when she was a state senator in Virginia. “Hopefully it will be the next Congress, under Speaker Hakeem Jeffries, that we pass that bill.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeffries, the House Minority leader from New York, stands to become the next Speaker of the House if Democrats are able to take control of the chamber in this year’s elections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Showing their work on Comstock can help Democrats communicate about threats to abortion access amid this year’s presidential and congressional elections, said Erin Covey, an analyst for the Cook Political Report. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think the reason that this is coming up now is because we&#8217;re getting closer to the presidential election,” she said. “The potential reality of a second Trump term is something that Democrats in Congress are reckoning with right now.”</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Why does this particular law matter?</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has </span><a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/110384051064378318" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">taken credit for</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">how his Supreme Court picks during his presidency ushered in the fall of Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court ruling that federally protected abortion for nearly 50 years. With speculation at how far he would seek to regulate abortion, he’s said different things in interviews with national press over the past year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While President Joe Biden has made abortion protection a pillar of his re-election campaign, Trump has made </span><a href="https://www.kff.org/compare-2024-candidates-health-care-policy/?utm_campaign=KFF-Health-Policy-101&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_HRRnbnWlwDVW2NM5l9DQk1jYM_RqWvqC6w7ohqGbfp_j_cbuKLZ05Xq7-b22j0fd-elvauV1HskryaKFS-80nxUFu2dQz3wq4ZTMK3CjN0iGvNgo&amp;_hsmi=312903414&amp;utm_content=312903414&amp;utm_source=hs_email#abortion" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">various statements</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">ranging from supporting a national 15 or 16 week ban, to leaving regulation to the states, and “feeling “strongly” about Comstock. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an </span><a href="https://time.com/6972022/donald-trump-transcript-2024-election/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">April interview with TIME Magazine</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, he said he’d have a “big statement” within two weeks, but he never did.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also said earlier this month that he would “</span><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-says-hell-work-side-side-group-wants-abortion-eradicated" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">work side by side”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with a group that wants to see abortion “eradicated.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And though Comstock’s abortion provisions were not enforced during the nearly 50 years of Roe, it has been a looming specter for the abortion rights movement all along. Activists and legal scholars have cautioned about its potential as it is still technically on the books. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a Trump-appointed Texas’ judge’s interpretation of Comstock that helped propel the Federal Drug Administration v Alliance For Hippocratic Medicine to the U.S. Supreme Court. Though the Supreme Court, which has several Trump appointees, did not rule in the Alliance’s favor, they kicked the case back down to lower courts where it will continue to be litigated. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most directly, the Comstock Act applies to mailing abortion medication, but some think it can be interpreted further to prohibit transport of supplies to establish abortion clinics. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While “not literally a ban,” legal historian Mary Ziegler explained how abortion opponents can interpret it to be used as one. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The question is, if you can&#8217;t put anything in the mail or through a common carrier or potentially into interstate commerce, then how do you get surgical tools or whatever? How do you get any of the items you would need?” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Comstock’s </span><a href="https://static.project2025.org/2025_MandateForLeadership_CHAPTER-14.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legal code</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> appears in a conservative manifesto called “Project 2025” that Trump could tap into should he win a second term. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chapter 14 of the policy guidebook by conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation recommends that promotion and approval of mail-order abortion medications cease and alleges they are “in violation of long-standing federal laws that prohibit the mailing and interstate carriage of abortion drugs.” Comstock’s legal code is then cited in footnote number 16. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Local government officials have tried for years to use Comstock to limit abortions in their communities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The law has surfaced in local ordinances around the country, such as in Virginia where it was </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/a-virginia-county-considered-19th-century-approach-to-abortion-restrictions/article_2b72de8a-9b04-11ee-9864-1fbc992a7e0e.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">voted down</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last year and in New Mexico where </span><a href="https://sourcenm.com/2023/12/14/n-m-supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-local-anti-abortion-ordinances/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legal challenges</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have ascended to the state’s supreme court. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assisted by former Texas Solicitor General Jonathan Mitchell, Texas activist Mark Lee Dickson has </span><a href="https://sourcenm.com/2024/03/04/texas-activists-pushed-abortion-restrictions-in-nm-cities-and-counties-records-show/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">encouraged localities to pass such ordinances</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Dickson also has said that they offer legal representation to localities that </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/abortion-roe-versus-wade-youngkin-bristol-tennessee-virginia/article_31281cfc-15f1-11ee-8559-9b85d4db3696.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“goes up” to the U.S. Supreme Court.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be it Trump utilizing Comstock if elected, or legal challenges progressing successfully in Dickson’s favor through courts, Dickson’s confident it can be a path for a national ban. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If enforced, it would have the same impact as a national ban on abortion,” he said. “That is because it is a de-facto national abortion ban.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legal historian Lauren MacIver Thompson, who specializes in Comstock, echoed Ziegler’s theory of how that could work. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If Trump is reelected, (abortion opponents) basically have a clear path to enforce it with a newly re-formed Department of Justice,” said legal historian Lauren MacIver Thompson. “They can kind of read the act however they want it to be read.” </span></p>

Charlotte Rene Woods / Virginia Mercury</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My story includes abortion — a guy I&#8217;ve known since I was a kid raped me,” actress and activist Ashley Judd shared with a crowd of about 100 in Richmond on Monday to mark the two-year anniversary of the overturn of federal abortion protections. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And when I became pregnant, I was so grateful that I was able to access safe and legal abortion,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Judd, who was a prominent figure amid the #MeToo movement to advocate against sexual assault and harassment, joined state and federal lawmakers Monday to stress the significance of abortion access amid this year’s presidential and congressional elections. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the personal story Judd shared was grim, the attitude of the event was light at times; Sen. Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, celebrated the </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/11/08/virginia-democrats-triumph-in-statehouse-elections-reducing-youngkins-power/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic gains made in the state legislature last year </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">while U.S. Reps. Jennifer McClellan, 4th District, and Abigail Spanberger, 7th District, celebrated camaraderie among women in politics. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the seriousness of abortion laws was central to the gathering. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Signs held by participants read “This is Trump’s fault” — a reference to how President Donald Trump’s U.S. Supreme Court picks gave conservatives the majority to overturn Roe v. Wade, the nearly 50 year-old case that had guaranteed abortion rights. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you think Dobbs was the beginning, it wasn&#8217;t,” McClellan said, in reference to the 2022 case that overturned Roe. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_39056" class="wp-caption alignright" style="max-width:100%;width:300px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_2149-scaled.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-39056 size-medium" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_2149-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_2149-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_2149-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_2149-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_2149-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_2149-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Attendees hold signs in Richmond, Virginia on June 24,2024 for a political rally on the second anniversary of the overturn of federal abortion protections. (Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She noted how in the years following, legislators and legal cases have challenged contraception and in vitro fertilization, as well. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump will face off against current president Joe Biden this November, as will congressional and U.S. Senate candidates around the nation. While Biden has made abortion protection a key pillar of his campaign, another Trump presidency and GOP gains in congress could usher in further abortion restrictions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We cannot afford Republican-controlled governance. We cannot afford a Republican-controlled Congress,” Lucas told the crowd. “Our freedoms are at stake: Freedom to vote, freedom to contraception, freedom over our bodies.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lucas and Spanberger stressed how before Democrats held their line in the state senate and flipped the House of Delegates last year, they’d blocked Republican-led attempts to restrict abortion in Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Spanberger, who is not seeking another term in congress and is instead running for governor, could be the person to sign other reproductive health-related legislation into law in 2026. That year, voters statewide could also see a potential ballot referendum to </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/virginia-abortion-rights-restoration-same-sex-marriage/article_731f82a4-b4b0-11ee-9c14-7719906ce1fc.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">decide if abortion protections should be enshrined in Virginia’s constitution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are in a place where we have seen desperate people come from other states, because Virginia is the only state in the South that has not put additional restrictions in place,” Spanberger said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That fact was reiterated several times later in the morning in a roundtable discussion at the VCU Health Hub in Richmond’s east end. McClellan was joined by U.S. Department of Health and Human Services acting director Melanie Fontes Rainer, Sen. Jennifer Boysko, D-Fairfax and Del. Rae Cousins, D-Richmond to hear from reproductive health professionals. </span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘A turning point’</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From various providers of reproductive healthcare, to those who assist with births and political advocates, each person had insight to share. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Longtime OB-GYN William Fitzhugh, Whole Woman’s Health CEO Amy Hagstrom Miller, Kenda Sutton-El of Birth in Color and Stephanie Spencer of Urban Baby Beginnings shared concerns about the influx of out-of-state abortion patients.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_39055" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:300px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_2297-scaled.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-39055 size-medium" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_2297-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_2297-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_2297-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_2297-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_2297-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_2297-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Lawmakers and reproductive healthcare professionals participate in a roundtable discussion in Richmond, Virginia on June 24, 2024. (Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hagstrom Miller said that there’s been an uptick in patients visiting Whole Women’s Health from Georgia and Florida – where most abortions are banned after six weeks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She noted how last year, a patient&#8217;s menstrual cycle had continued after she conceived, so she was unaware she was pregnant until she had lost the ability to receive an abortion in Georgia. The patient, Chasity Dunnans, then traveled to Whole Woman&#8217;s Health’s Charlottesville clinic for the procedure. As many other southern states impose near-total bans or six-week limits, North Carolina and Virginia stand as a point of access for some. But </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/n-c-s-12-week-abortion-ban-to-make-va-least-restrictive-state-in-south/article_5ac91606-f503-11ed-b9b5-2315241bf865.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">North Carolina’s 12-week</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> cap meant </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/oct/31/virginia-abortion-rights-ban-south-state" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dunnans had to travel further</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are at a turning point here in Virginia,’ Boysko said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She has carried a proposed constitutional amendment that would enshrine abortion access in Virginia’s constitution. This would make access less subject to partisan turnover in the state legislature.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To alter the constitution, Boysko’s resolution will need to clear the legislature two years in a row, with a House of Delegates election in between, before appearing on statewide ballots for voters to accept or reject. Pending its first passage next year, this could happen in 2026.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Abortion isn’t always a partisan issue,” Hagstrom Miller said. “Everytime we put abortion on the ballot, it wins.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the two years since Roe was overturned, voters have backed abortion rights in red states like </span><a href="https://kansasreflector.com/2024/03/05/august-was-not-a-fluke-kansas-advocates-warn-against-raft-of-bills-limiting-reproductive-rights/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kansas </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span><a href="https://michiganadvance.com/2023/11/08/ohio-voters-pass-issue-1-constitutional-amendment-to-protect-abortion-and-reproductive-rights/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Ohio</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and blue states like </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/abortion-us-supreme-court-health-california-89310197d2b3bd3e3ba806620dd2bdbb" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">California</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and in competitive states like </span><a href="https://michiganadvance.com/2022/11/10/braving-long-lines-michigan-college-students-help-propel-dem-proposal-3-victories/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michigan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But a patchwork quilt of different abortion laws exist around the country. So, as people travel to other states to receive abortions, privacy and criminalization concerns have emerged. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rainer noted a </span><a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2024/04/22/biden-harris-administration-issues-new-rule-support-reproductive-health-care-privacy-under-hipaa.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">new Biden administration rule </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">that strengthens privacy protections. It will prevent reproductive healthcare information from being shared for criminal investigations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Bolstered patient privacy and trust isn&#8217;t just about your records,” she said. “It&#8217;s about ‘am I too scared to go back to an emergency room or to go back to a facility to get the care that I need? Am I too scared to keep information from my doctor because I&#8217;m trying to protect myself or I&#8217;m trying to protect my doctor? Or is my provider too scared to give me information because they risk criminal liability?’”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similarly, Virginia has taken on the issue at the state level. After vetoing it previously, this year Gov. Glenn Youngkin signed a bill this year to </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/youngkin-menstrual-data-virginia-search-warrants-general-assembly/article_b2ea107c-f5b8-11ee-ac2c-ab1a87d2cca1.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">prohibit menstrual health data from being subject to search warrants.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> But  he vetoed a companion bill that would have </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/youngkin-menstrual-data-virginia-search-warrants-general-assembly/article_b2ea107c-f5b8-11ee-ac2c-ab1a87d2cca1.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">prevented Virginia from complying with extradition requests</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for patients who travel from states with bans to receive abortions in Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Concurrent with abortion legislation, lawmakers from Virginia and nationwide have sought to protect access to contraception and in vitro fertilization. Youngkin vetoed a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/20/youngkin-vetoes-bills-on-contraception-access-skill-games-confederate-heritage-rollbacks/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">right-to-contraception</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bill this year while congress’ right-to-contraception and IVF efforts have </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/05/u-s-senate-gop-prevents-contraception-access-bill-from-moving-ahead/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">been stalled </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">as well. Lawmakers say they will keep trying. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is imperative that we take action at the state and federal level,” Cousins said. “It’s concerning to me that with one election, we could go all the way backward.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Judd noted how some who seek abortions are already mothers and may not be able to afford to care for more children, an example of the various reasons a woman may need to end a pregnancy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Becoming a mother or a parent is a profoundly human endeavor. It rests on our hearts and on our souls,” Judd said. “It involves circumstances that are deeply practical — our light bill, our pocketbooks, housing, social support — and it often involves faith and prayer. And what it should not include is the United States government.”</span></p>

(Photo by Ashley Murray/States Newsroom)</p><p>WASHINGTON — Top Democratic campaign officials Thursday pressed their case for control of Congress and the White House by pointing toward the upcoming two-year anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court overturning the constitutional right to an abortion.</p>
<p>More than a dozen Democrats also introduced legislation in Congress to prevent a future Republican administration from using an 1873 law, known as the Comstock Act, to bar mailing abortion medication.</p>
<p>On a call with reporters, the three campaign leaders said voters must flip the House from red to blue, keep Democrats in control of the Senate against the long odds and ensure President Joe Biden stays in the Oval Office to prevent the GOP from potentially implementing nationwide restrictions on reproductive rights.</p>
<p>Democratic National Committee Chair Jaime Harrison, Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee Vice Chair Sen. Tina Smith of Minnesota and Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chair Rep. Suzan DelBene of Washington repeatedly said that Democrats would restore nationwide protections for abortion access if given unified control of government.</p>
<p>They, however, didn’t provide a clear road map for what Democrats would do on reproductive rights, including access to contraception and in vitro fertilization, if divided control of government continues.</p>
<p>Instead, they pointed to what Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, might do in the event voters elect him president during November’s elections.</p>
<p>“We need to be clear that Trump and MAGA Republicans want to ban abortion and they have a plan to do it through executive action without any bill ever passing Congress; because they believe that politicians should have the power to make these decisions for women, whose lives and stories they will never know,” Smith said on the call.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Comstock Act fears</h4>

	
<p>The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, has released “Project 2025,” a lengthy document that outlines what it believes Trump should do during a second term.</p>
<p>The Trump campaign hasn’t endorsed the document or said it would seek to implement it in full or in part, though a former Trump administration official led its development.</p>
<p>The proposal includes using the Comstock Act —  a law enacted more than 150 years ago to prevent the mailing of obscene materials, contraceptives and anything that could produce an abortion — to bar the shipment of medication abortion throughout the United States.</p>
<p>Smith on Thursday introduced a three-page bill that would eliminate that as a possibility, though the legislation may not advance in the Senate and is very unlikely to make it through the GOP-controlled House before November.</p>
<p>Medication abortion, which includes mifepristone and misoprostol, accounts for about 63% of abortions nationwide, according to the Guttmacher Institute. The two pharmaceuticals are also used for miscarriage care. Misoprostol has other medical uses, as well.</p>
<p>The Comstock Act, enacted in 1873, originally barred the mailing of materials considered lewd or obscene at the time, but is written so broadly that it has been used to bar boxing photographs, art and information about contraception.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title18-section1461&amp;num=0&amp;edition=prelim" target="_blank">law</a> explicitly prohibits mailing “every article or thing designed, adapted, or intended for producing abortion, or for any indecent or immoral use.” Smith’s bill would seek to eliminate those provisions.</p>
<p>Smith, when asked about the Comstock Act on the call Thursday, said the “zombie law” could be used to make medication abortion illegal without a vote in the Congress.</p>
<p>“It’s very clear what their plan is,” Smith said of Republicans. “And so this is another example of the very clear choice that American voters have.”</p>
<p>DelBene, who is leading Democrats’ campaign arm in the House, said on the call that Republicans are already trying to change when and how Americans have access to various reproductive rights by attaching amendments to the must-pass government funding bills.</p>
<p>“This election is fundamentally about our rights, our freedoms, our democracy and our future,” DelBene said. “House Republicans have made it clear they’re willing to do anything to take those away.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">A divided Congress predicted</h4>

	
<p>The most likely outcome of November’s elections isn’t currently unified Democratic control in the eyes of some analysts however.</p>
<p>Three experts at Moody’s Analytics released an <a href="https://www.economy.com/getfile?q=EA99E998-560D-4A12-85DE-3727A7EBE9A8&amp;app=download" target="_blank">analysis</a> this week, showing the most probable result is that Biden will remain president with a divided Congress.</p>
<p>That scenario had a 40% probability, while a Republican sweep had a probability of 35%. Trump winning the presidential election and gaining a divided Congress had a 15% probability. A Democratic sweep had a 10% probability, according to the report.</p>
<p>The most likely scenario of Biden remaining president with a split Congress suggests that the GOP would flip the Senate and the Democrats would regain the House of Representatives.</p>
<p>“With the retirement of West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin, the deep-red state will almost surely elect a Republican senator, leaving the Senate evenly divided,” the report states. “But while recent polling shows that Senate races in Arizona, Maryland, Montana, Nevada and Ohio are close, Republicans need to take only one of these seats to regain the majority.”</p>
<p>“Each race has its own story, but helping the Republicans’ cause is angst over inflation and heightened concern over the immigrant crisis at the southern border,” the report adds.</p>
<p>The analysis goes on to say that “federal judicial decisions on redistricting efforts have also leaned in Democrats’ favor, boosting their chances” of regaining control of the House.</p>
<p>“Also, given that incumbents win reelection more than 90% of the time, the relatively high number of congressional retirements relative to previous cycles creates the potential for more change in the body,” the analysis states.</p>
<p>The report details the four outcomes of November’s election as well as the various economic scenarios that would play out under either a Biden or a Trump presidency for the next four years.</p>
<p>The report was written by Chief Economist Mark M. Zandi, Director/Senior Economist Brendan La Cerda and Economist Justin Begley.</p>

(Photo illustration by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in a much-anticipated decision Thursday that mifepristone, one of two pharmaceuticals used in medication abortion, can remain available under current prescribing guidelines.</p>
<p>The high court unanimously rejected attempts by anti-abortion groups to roll back access to what was in place more than eight years ago, writing that they lacked standing to bring the case.</p>
<p>Those limits would have made it more difficult for patients to get a prescription for mifepristone, which the Food and Drug Administration has approved for up to 10 weeks gestation and is used in about 63% of U.S. abortions.</p>
<p>Erin Morrow Hawley, senior counsel at Alliance Defending Freedom, who argued the case in front of the court on behalf of the legal organization, doesn’t believe this is the end of efforts to challenge access to mifepristone.</p>
<p>She said on a call shortly after the ruling was released the three states that intervened in a lower court — Idaho, Kansas and Missouri — could still advance their arguments against mifepristone and potentially hold standing, the legal right to bring a case.</p>
<p>“I would expect the litigation to continue with those three states,” Hawley said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Kavanaugh writes opinion</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Justice Brett Kavanaugh <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-235_n7ip.pdf" target="_blank">wrote the opinion</a> in the united ruling from the Supreme Court, with Justice Clarence Thomas writing a concurring opinion.</p>
<p>“Plaintiffs are pro-life, oppose elective abortion, and have sincere legal, moral, ideological, and policy objections to mifepristone being prescribed and used by others,” Kavanaugh wrote.</p>
<p>The four anti-abortion medical organizations and four anti-abortion doctors who originally brought the lawsuit against mifepristone have protections in place to guard against being forced to participate in abortions against their moral objections, he noted.</p>
<p>“Not only as a matter of law but also as a matter of fact, the federal conscience laws have protected pro-life doctors ever since FDA approved mifepristone in 2000,” Kavanaugh wrote. “The plaintiffs have not identified any instances where a doctor was required, notwithstanding conscience objections, to perform an abortion or to provide other abortion-related treatment that violated the doctor’s conscience.”</p>
<p>“Nor is there any evidence in the record here of hospitals overriding or failing to accommodate doctors’ conscience objections,” he added.</p>
<p>Alliance Defending Freedom has not “identified any instances where a doctor was required, notwithstanding conscience objections, to perform an abortion or to provide other abortion-related treatment that violated the doctor’s conscience since mifepristone’s 2000 approval,” the opinion said.</p>
<p>Kavanaugh might have also included hints on how the court will rule later this session on <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/supreme-court-justices-appear-split-over-whether-protect-abortion-care-during-emergencies" target="_blank">a separate abortion access case</a> that addresses the Emergency Medical Treatment &amp; Labor Act, known as EMTALA.</p>
<p>“EMTALA does not require doctors to perform abortions or provide abortion-related medical treatment over their conscience objections because EMTALA does not impose obligations on individual doctors,” Kavanaugh wrote.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Thomas agrees but questions who can sue</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Thomas wrote a concurring opinion in the case, saying that he agreed with the court’s unanimous decision, which he did join, but brought up concerns with how a certain type of standing is used by the Court.</p>
<p>“Applying these precedents, the Court explains that the doctors cannot establish third-party standing to sue for violations of their patients’ rights without showing an injury of their own,” Thomas wrote.</p>
<p>“But, there is a far simpler reason to reject this theory: Our third-party standing doctrine is mistaken,” Thomas added. “As I have previously explained, a plaintiff cannot establish an Article III case or controversy by asserting another person’s rights.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Reaction pours in</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Politicians, anti-abortion groups and reproductive rights organizations all reacted to the ruling within hours of its release, often pointing to November’s elections as a potential next step.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden released a written statement saying the “decision does not change the fact that the fight for reproductive freedom continues.”</p>
<p>“It does not change the fact that the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade two years ago, and women lost a fundamental freedom,” Biden added. “It does not change the fact that the right for a woman to get the treatment she needs is imperiled if not impossible in many states.”</p>
<p>Former President Donald Trump, the Republican Party’s presumptive nominee, was in meetings most of Thursday with U.S. House Republicans and then separately with Republican U.S. Senators.</p>
<p>Neither Trump nor his campaign released a statement by early Thursday afternoon addressing the Supreme Court’s ruling.</p>
<p>Louisiana Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy, ranking member on the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, wrote in a statement that the justice didn’t actually address the merits of the case.</p>
<p>“The Court did not weigh in on the merits of the case, but the fact remains this is a high risk drug that ends the life of an unborn child,” Cassidy wrote. “I urge FDA to follow the law and reinstate important safeguards.”</p>
<p>President of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Stella Dantas related a statement saying the ruling “provides us with long-awaited relief.”</p>
<p>“We now know that patients and clinicians across the country will continue to have access to mifepristone for medication abortion and miscarriage management,” Dantas wrote. “Decades of clinical research have proven mifepristone to be safe and effective, and its strong track record of millions of patient uses confirms that data.”</p>
<p>Hawley from Alliance Defending Freedom wrote in a written statement the organization was “disappointed that the Supreme Court did not reach the merits of the FDA’s lawless removal of commonsense safety standards for abortion drugs.”</p>
<p>“While we’re disappointed with the court’s decision, we will continue to advocate for women and work to restore commonsense safeguards for abortion drugs—like an initial office visit to screen for ectopic pregnancies,” Hawley wrote. “And we are grateful that three states stand ready to hold the FDA accountable for jeopardizing the health and safety of women and girls across this country.”</p>
<p>Nancy Northup, president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights, wrote in a statement she had “both relief and anger about this decision.”</p>
<p>“Thank goodness the Supreme Court unanimously rejected this unwarranted attempt to curtail access to medication abortion, but the fact remains that this meritless case should never have gotten this far,” Northup wrote.</p>
<p>“The FDA’s rulings on medication abortion have been based on irrefutable science,” Northup wrote. “Unfortunately, the attacks on abortion pills will not stop here — the anti-abortion movement sees how critical abortion pills are in this post-Roe world, and they are hell bent on cutting off access.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Scientific evidence argued</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Court heard <a href="https://tinyurl.com/4h8yfaks" target="_blank">oral arguments </a>in the case in March, during which Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar argued the FDA’s guidelines for prescribing mifepristone were based on reputable scientific evidence and years of real-world use.</p>
<p>“Only an exceptionally small number of women suffer the kinds of serious complications that could trigger any need for emergency treatment,” Prelogar said. “It’s speculative that any of those women would seek care from the two specific doctors who asserted conscience injuries. And even if that happened, federal conscience protections would guard against the injury the doctors face.”</p>
<p>Hawley of ADF told the court that conscience protections in federal law didn’t do enough to protect anti-abortion doctors from having to possibly treat patients experiencing complications from medication abortion.</p>
<p>“These are emergency situations,” Hawley said. “Respondent doctors don’t necessarily know until they scrub into that operating room whether this may or may not be abortion drug harm — it could be a miscarriage, it could be an ectopic pregnancy, or it could be an elective abortion.”</p>
<p>The case reached the Supreme Court within two years of ADF originally filing the lawsuit in the District Court for the Northern District of Texas, where ADF wrote the FDA “exceeded its regulatory authority” when it originally approved mifepristone in 2000.</p>
<p>ADF filed the case on behalf of Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists, American College of Pediatricians and Christian Medical &amp; Dental Associations, as well as four doctors from California, Indiana, Michigan and Texas.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Kacsmaryk ruling started journey to high court</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Judge Matthew Joseph Kacsmaryk essentially agreed with the anti-abortion groups, in a <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/biden-administration-appeals-judges-ruling-ordering-abortion-pill-us-market" target="_blank">ruling</a> in April 2023, where he wrote he did “not second-guess FDA’s decision-making lightly.”</p>
<p>“But here, FDA acquiesced on its legitimate safety concerns — in violation of its statutory duty — based on plainly unsound reasoning and studies that did not support its conclusions,” Kacsmaryk wrote.</p>
<p>The U.S. Supreme Court <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-supreme-court-preserves-access-abortion-pill-lawsuit-continues" target="_blank">issued a stay</a> at the request of the Justice Department, which put the district court’s ruling on hold until the appeal process could work itself out.</p>
<p>The Justice Department also appealed the district court’s ruling to the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in Louisiana, where a three-judge panel <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/three-judge-panel-us-appeals-court-hears-arguments-abortion-pill-case" target="_blank">heard the case</a> in May 2023.</p>
<p>The panel — composed of Jennifer Walker Elrod, who was appointed by former President George W. Bush, as well as James C. Ho and Cory T. Wilson, who were both appointed by former President Donald Trump — <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/abortion-pill-stay-market-until-us-supreme-court-ruling-after-appeals-court-order-0" target="_blank">issued its ruling</a> in August 2023.</p>
<p>The appeals court disagreed with the district court’s ruling that mifepristone’s original approval should be overturned, though it said that the FDA erred in making changes to prescribing guidelines in 2016 and 2021.</p>
<p>“It failed to consider the cumulative effect of removing several important safeguards at the same time. It failed to consider whether those ‘major’ and ‘interrelated’ changes might alter the risk profile, such that the agency should continue to mandate reporting of non-fatal adverse events,” the appeals judges wrote. “And it failed to gather evidence that affirmatively showed that mifepristone could be used safely without being prescribed and dispensed in person.”</p>
<p>That ruling didn’t take effect under the Supreme Court’s earlier stay.</p>
<p>The Department of Justice wrote to the high court weeks later in September, <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-justice-department-asks-supreme-court-take-abortion-pill-case" target="_blank">urging the justices</a> to take up an appeal of the 5th Circuit’s decision.</p>
<p>“The loss of access to mifepristone would be damaging for women and healthcare providers around the Nation,” the DOJ wrote in the 42-page document. “For many patients, mifepristone is the best method to lawfully terminate their early pregnancies. They may choose mifepristone over surgical abortion because of medical necessity, a desire for privacy, or past trauma.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Briefs filed with court</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Dozens of abortion rights organizations and lawmakers filed so-called amicus curiae or friend of the court briefs to the Supreme Court <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/dozens-friend-court-briefs-backing-abortion-pill-access-arrive-supreme-court" target="_blank">calling on the justices</a> to keep access to mifepristone in line with the FDA guidelines.</p>
<p>A group of more than 16 medical organizations, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association, wrote that “restricting access to mifepristone will not only jeopardize health, but worsen racial and economic inequities and deprive women of the choices that are at the very core of individual autonomy and wellbeing.”</p>
<p>Anti-abortion groups and lawmakers opposed to mifepristone <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/who-wants-us-supreme-court-limit-abortion-pill-access-heres-list" target="_blank">wrote numerous briefs</a> as well.</p>
<p>Attorneys general from Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, West Virginia and Wyoming sent in a 28-page brief.</p>
<p>They wrote that the availability of mifepristone undermined states’ rights, since some of their states had sought to restrict abortion below the 10 weeks approved for mifepristone use or had sought to bar access to medication abortion.</p>
<p>“The FDA’s actions undermine these laws, undercut States’ efforts to enforce them, and thus erode the federalism the Constitution deems vital,” the attorneys general wrote. “Given these harms to federalism, this Court should view the FDA’s actions with skepticism.”</p>
<p>During oral arguments in March, several Supreme Court justices brought up conscience protections that insulate health care workers from having to assist with or perform procedures they have a religious objection to, like abortion.</p>
<p>Associate Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson said she was “worried that there is a significant mismatch in this case between the claimed injury and the remedy that’s being sought.”</p>
<p>“The obvious, common-sense remedy would be to provide them with an exemption that they don’t have to participate in this procedure,” Jackson said.</p>
<p>Associate Justice Neil Gorsuch said the case seemed “like a prime example of turning what could be a small lawsuit into a nationwide legislative assembly on an FDA rule, or any other federal government action.”</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GOP senators contended the vote was mere politics and that if Democrats were serious about safeguarding access to contraception for future generations, they’d work with Republicans on a bipartisan bill. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevada Democratic Sen. Jacky Rosen said the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn the constitutional right to an abortion in the Dobbs decision two years ago showed women how quickly things can change. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It demonstrated that a fundamental right, the right of women to make decisions over their own bodies, could be taken away in the blink of an eye,” Rosen said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Women, she said, can’t rely solely on the Supreme Court to uphold the cases that have guaranteed Americans access to contraception for more than 50 years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Contraception has been safely used by millions of women for decades,” Rosen said. “It’s allowed women to take control over their own bodies — to decide when they want to start a family, how many kids they have, who they want to start a family with.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For these very same reasons, the right to contraception has been a target of anti-choice extremists for years,” Rosen added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Minority Whip John Thune, the South Dakota Republican seeking to become the chamber’s next GOP leader, said the bill was meant to “provide a talking point for Democratic candidates.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These votes have nothing to do with legislating and everything to do with boosting Democrats’ electoral chances, he hopes, in this fall’s election,” Thune said, referring to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislation was a non-starter with many Republicans, Thune said, because it didn’t carve out the conscience protections that exist under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/103rd-congress/house-bill/1308#:~:text=Religious%20Freedom%20Restoration%20Act%20of%201993%20%2D%20Prohibits%20any%20agency%2C%20department,government%20may%20burden%20a%20person's" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">federal law,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> enacted in 1993 after being sponsored by Schumer, established “a heightened standard of review for government actions that substantially burden a person’s exercise of religion.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Sales of contraceptives</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats’ bill would have protected “an individual’s ability to access contraceptives” and “a health care provider’s ability to provide contraceptives, contraception, and information related to contraception.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislation would have barred state and federal governments from prohibiting the sale of any contraceptives or blocking “any individual from aiding another individual in voluntarily obtaining or using any contraceptives or contraceptive methods.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill defined contraception as “an action taken to prevent pregnancy, including the use of contraceptives or fertility-awareness-based methods and sterilization procedures.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Democrats </span><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-senate-dems-decry-limits-abortion-access-house-dems-unveil-contraception-bill" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">introduced an identical bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in that chamber on Tuesday, though it’s unlikely to get a vote while Republicans remain in control. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Larry Sabato, who heads the Center For Politics at the University of Virginia, called the effort “a good move for Democrats” to still try. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The problem they&#8217;re going to have is most people don&#8217;t believe that Republicans would actually [prohibit birth control],” Sabato said. “Now the obvious comeback for that is ‘Well, did you think they would abolish Roe v Wade?’ Because people didn&#8217;t believe that either — and then it happened.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But since the overturn of federal abortion protections, access to contraception has come into question as </span><a href="https://stateline.org/2022/05/19/some-states-already-are-targeting-birth-control/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">some states have targeted it </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">and a recent Alabama Supreme Court</span><a href="https://alabamareflector.com/2024/02/19/alabama-supreme-court-ruling-could-end-ivf-treatments-in-state/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ruling </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">declared embryos used for in vitro fertilization as people.</span><b> </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the vote on the contraception bill, Schumer moved to schedule a procedural vote next week on legislation that would guarantee access to in vitro fertilization. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schumer said during a press conference afterward that vote would give Americans an opportunity to “see where Republicans stand on the so very important issue” of reproductive rights.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Supreme Court opinion</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Supreme Court Associate Justice Clarence Thomas stirred up concerns about access to contraception two years ago when he wrote a </span><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/19-1392_6j37.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">concurring opinion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the Dobbs case.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thomas wrote that the justices should “reconsider all of this Court’s substantive due process precedents, including Griswold, Lawrence, and Obergefell.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">None of the other nine justices joined Thomas in writing that opinion, likely signaling they didn’t agree with some or all of it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 1965 Griswold v. Connecticut case was the first time the court recognized that married couples’ constitutional privacy rights extend to decisions about contraception. That ruling struck down a Connecticut state law that barred access to contraceptives. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Supreme Court, in 1972, extended the right to make private decisions about contraception to unmarried people in the Eisenstadt v. Baird ruling. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the release of Thomas’ concurring opinion, Democrats and reproductive rights organizations immediately began pressing for federal laws that would reinforce current contraception access. Congress has not passed any so far. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mini Timmaraju, president and chief executive officer of Reproductive Freedom for All, said during a press conference with Senate Democrats on Wednesday before the vote that women should talk with their mothers and grandmothers about when they were first able to obtain birth control. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When we talk about the generations of women in this country who didn’t have access to birth control, we’re just talking about my mother’s generation — 1965,” Timmaraju said. “It was not that long ago and that should really be a wake-up call.” </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">White House, Biden campaign weigh in</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Biden administration signaled its support for Senate Democrats’ bill hours before the vote, writing in a </span><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/SAP-S4381.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Statement of Administration Policy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the measure “would protect the fundamental right to access contraception and help ensure that women can make decisions about their health, lives, and families.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Women must have the freedom to make deeply personal health care decisions, including the right to decide if and when to start or grow their family,” the policy states. “Now is the time to safeguard the right to contraception once and for all.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Biden-Harris campaign held a press call on reproductive rights Wednesday morning to highlight the differences between the presidential candidates on reproductive rights, including access to abortion, contraception and in vitro fertilization. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden-Harris Campaign Manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez said during the call that Donald Trump, Republicans’ presumptive nominee for president, couldn’t be further away from Biden on access. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rodriguez said Trump’s </span><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-leaves-door-open-banning-medication-abortion-nationwide" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">comments</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> during an interview with TIME magazine in April and his </span><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-signals-hes-open-state-limits-contraceptive-access-then-insists-hes-not" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">statements</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to a local Pennsylvania TV news station in May show he’s not supportive of women’s reproductive rights. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Decisions about contraception, abortion and in vitro fertilization belong to women and their doctors, “not politicians and the government,” Rodriguez said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">North Carolina Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper, a member of the Biden-Harris campaign’s advisory board, said on the call this year’s election will be a “defining moment” for the country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican efforts to restrict access to reproductive health care, he said, mean they are trying to “control women.” </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Ernst alternative proposal </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iowa Republican Sen. Joni Ernst said during debate on the bill that Democrats’ legislation went too far and pressed for the Senate to take up </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/4447/text?s=5&amp;r=1&amp;q=%7B%22search%22%3A%22ernst%22%7D" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a bill she introduced </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">earlier this week. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The measure has since gained nine co-sponsors including Chuck Grassley of Iowa, Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, Steve Daines of Montana, Todd Young of Indiana, Thom Tillis of North Carolina, Ted Cruz of Texas, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, James E. Risch of Idaho and John Cornyn of Texas. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iowa Republican Rep. Ashley Hinson plans to introduce the companion bill in the House, according to an announcement from Ernst’s office. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With my bill, we’re ensuring women 18 and over can walk into any pharmacy, whether in Red Oak, Iowa, or Washington, D.C., and purchase a safe and effective birth control option,” Ernst said. “This Republican bill creates a priority review designation for over-the-counter birth control options to encourage the FDA to act quickly.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ernst said she was “encouraged” that one over-the-counter oral contraceptive has been approved and is available, but that should be “just a starting point.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The four-page bill would encourage the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to approve additional over-the-counter oral contraceptives and “direct the Comptroller General of the United States to conduct a study on federal funding of contraceptive methods.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislation would require the secretary of the Health and Human Services Department to give priority review to a supplemental application for oral contraceptives “intended for routine use.” But it does not extend that to “any emergency contraceptive drug” or “any drug that is also approved for induced abortion.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Access to over-the-counter oral birth control that receives FDA approval so that it no longer requires a prescription would be available for people over 18.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">States, including Virginia, can still control contraceptives access — for now</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While federal politicians continue their back and forth over legislating contraception access, states can still take their own stances on the matter. Virginia already tried to do so earlier this year in a measure that cleared both the House of Delegates and state Senate before being vetoed by Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Cia Price, D-Newport News, joined Schumer and the other U.S. senators Wednesday for a press conference outside of the Capitol. She had carried Virginia’s own right-to-contraception act months prior. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin had stated support for contraception and initially attempted to amend Price’s bill. While hers would have codified protections whether or not the Griswold and Eisenstadt rulings are upheld or repealed, his amendment — which the legislature rejected — would have aligned Virginia with the rulings. He then vetoed the bill. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Gov. Younkin unfortunately taught us again that actions mean more than words,” she said Wednesday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Likewise, U.S. Sen Tim Kaine, D-Va., said in a call with States Newsroom affiliate the Virginia Mercury that he was not surprised the state measure passed with bipartisan support, but that he was surprised to see Youngkin veto it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you really want to reduce abortions, contraception access is a way to do it,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price and Virginia state Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Chesterfield, plan to reintroduce their proposal during Virginia&#8217;s next legislative session and again until it is passed. As Virginia governors cannot serve consecutive terms, a new person will be elected to helm the state come 2026. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Virginians may still have hope since we will soon have a new governor due to our own state term limits,” Price said. “But other states may be stuck with governors like him for years.”</span></p>

And should doctors in states with abortion bans be able to perform the procedure during medical emergencies? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two cases that the United States Supreme Court is expected to rule on this summer could answer these questions and have a ripple effect on abortion access nationwide. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One case challenges ease of access to abortion medication while another challenges whether a federal law concerning emergency care supersedes a state’s abortion ban. It’s the first time the nation’s highest court has reviewed abortion-related cases since overturning federal protections two summers ago. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mary Ziegler, a legal historian who has written about abortion law, noted that the emergency room case in particular can be a “game changer” pending its ruling. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whatever the Supreme Court decides will have an effect on how a lot of states’ abortion bans are interpreted,” she said. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Idaho v. The United States</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/04/24/supreme-court-justices-appear-split-over-whether-to-protect-abortion-care-during-emergencies/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This case</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> could determine whether a federal statute outweighs a state’s abortion ban when it comes to emergency medical care.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Idaho officials are seeking to disregard the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, otherwise known as EMTALA. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The nearly 40 year old federal law requires hospitals with emergency rooms that receive Medicare funding to provide “stabilizing treatment” to anyone experiencing emergency medical conditions. Most hospitals in the nation receive Medicare funding, and therefore would be subject to EMTALA. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plaintiffs in the case say this is at odds with Idaho’s own abortion law, though. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://legislature.idaho.gov/statutesrules/idstat/title18/t18ch6/sect18-622/#:~:text=Search%20Idaho%20Statutes&amp;text=18%2D622.,the%20crime%20of%20criminal%20abortion." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Idaho enforces its abortion ban</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with criminal penalties up to five years in prison for people who perform them or assist people in getting them. There are limited exceptions for rape, incest and to save the life of the pregnant person, excluding protections for pregnancy complications. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Doctors in Idaho have been </span><a href="https://idahocapitalsun.com/2024/04/23/loss-of-federal-protection-in-idaho-spurs-pregnant-patients-to-plan-for-emergency-air-transport/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sending pregnant patients out-of-state</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to comply with the state’s abortion law. During such medical emergencies, some patients are air-lifted out of the state. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. Stacy Seyb, a maternal fetal medicine specialist in Boise, explained that it’s become a safer alternative to send a pregnant patient elsewhere should they suspect an emergency abortion may be needed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There are times they may not even need the procedure. But we can’t predict that, and we can’t predict how quickly their status might change,” Seyb told </span><a href="https://idahocapitalsun.com/2024/04/23/loss-of-federal-protection-in-idaho-spurs-pregnant-patients-to-plan-for-emergency-air-transport/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Idaho Capital Sun</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “I think it’s a great hardship, it’s an extra expense to our medical system, and it doesn’t make sense why something that I’ve been doing for 30 years of my career is now taboo.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Countering this, President Joe Biden’s administration argues that EMTALA should protect doctors should abortion be needed as “stabilizing treatment” in emergencies. Plaintiffs in the case from Idaho argue that interpretation of EMTALA could make it too easy for patients to get abortions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When visiting Richmond earlier this year, U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/abortion-biden-richmond-becerra-virginia/article_5343af02-b62f-11ee-8521-171afce83cb7.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xavier Becerra said that the Biden Administration would “pull every lever” </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">to protect reproductive healthcare access — such as defending EMTALA in the case against Idaho.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In line with the administration’s support for protecting abortion access, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid services launched a new option on the CMS.gov website for people to </span><a href="https://www.cms.gov/priorities/your-patient-rights/emergency-room-rights/how-to-file-complaint" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">file complaints</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> if they feel EMTALA has not been upheld.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While a ruling in the case would only apply to Idaho, it may set a precedent for more than 20 other states which have </span><a href="https://states.guttmacher.org/policies/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">deep abortion restrictions or near total bans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. As the least restrictive southern state, Virginia’s Planned Parenthood is already reporting a 30% increase in out-of-state patients. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jamie Lockhart, the director of the Virginia League of Planned Parenthood, thinks the number of patients traveling for abortions outside of their home state could increase. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When and if the Supreme Court allows Idaho to do this — then it&#8217;s going to be Texas, and it&#8217;s going to be Mississippi, and Alabama, and just across the South,” Lockhart said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It concerns her, especially as she thinks about the broader maternal health outcome </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7384760/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">disparities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for patients of color, in part due to racial bias, and people living in </span><a href="https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/committee-opinion/articles/2014/02/health-disparities-in-rural-women" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rural communities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that already have to travel further for care to begin with. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, the other abortion-related case before the Supreme Court could make it more difficult to obtain abortion medication.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">FDA v. Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine</h4>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2000, mifepristone is the first part of medicine-induced abortions or miscarriage-related care. </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/03/20/medication-abortion-rates-grew-10-over-the-last-few-years-report-shows/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mifepristone</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> blocks a hormone that’s needed to continue a pregnancy and another drug, misoprostol, is administered after to help bodies expel tissue. The drugs typically are used for abortions under 10 weeks of gestation, but are also used to manage miscarriages to help prevent deadly infections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abortion-opposing physicians and organizations </span><a href="https://adfmedialegalfiles.blob.core.windows.net/files/AllianceForHippocraticMedicineComplaint.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">previously argued</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in lower courts that the FDA should not have approved mifepristone 24 years ago. Now, they </span><a href="https://adfmedialegalfiles.blob.core.windows.net/files/AHM-OpeningBrief.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">argue</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the drug should not have become easier to access in 2016 and 2021. The FDA changes from those years increased the limit of when it could be used from seven to 10 weeks of gestation and allowed for telehealth prescriptions, respectively. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those provisions could be affected if the court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Patients in Virginia would be forced to receive this care in person rather than via a telehealth appointment — which we know places undue and medically unnecessary barriers to care for people across Virginia who struggled to travel long distances to receive care,” Lockhart said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, when the case was heard by the Supreme Court this spring, it seemed likely the judges would </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/supreme-court-abortion-mifepristone-telemedicine-4406d53e8af90f6a523264f535f5adf8#:~:text=Supreme%20Court%20seems%20likely%20to%20preserve%20access%20to%20the%20abortion%20medication%20mifepristone&amp;text=The%20Supreme%20Court%20seems%20likely,conservative%20justices%20overturned%20Roe%20v." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">preserve access to the medication.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The justices may decide the plaintiffs lack the legal standing to sue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Zeigler, the legal scholar, cautions that a favorable ruling to abortion advocates in the mifepristone case may not be the end of challenges to the drug and abortion at-large.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">A potential future case is building</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attempts to enforce the Comstock Act — a dormant federal law from 1873 — have </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/as-abortion-issue-heats-up-dormant-law-a-vehicle-for-potential-restrictions/article_97be880a-bc6a-11ee-97e7-1f45bf0b8393.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">been surfacing in local governments around the country</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Grayson County in Southwest Virginia </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/a-virginia-county-considered-19th-century-approach-to-abortion-restrictions/article_2b72de8a-9b04-11ee-9864-1fbc992a7e0e.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">voted down</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a measure last year, while a case in </span><a href="https://sourcenm.com/2023/12/14/n-m-supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-local-anti-abortion-ordinances/#:~:text=Chacon%20argued%20for%20the%20city,Supreme%20Court%20Justice%20Briana%20Zamora." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">New Mexico has advanced to that state’s supreme court.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 19th Century act prohibits the mailing of “obscene” or “lewd” materials such as pornography, as well as contraception and “every article or thing designed, adapted, or intended for producing abortion.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the years Congress chipped away at the act, but the abortion components have remained. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, they’ve emerged in modern-day arguments against the procedure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proponents of implementing the act interpret it as a way to stop the mailing of abortion medications and materials needed to perform an abortion or establish a clinic. Local governments have considered ordinances that employ the act. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mark Lee Dickson, the architect of the national movement, told the </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/abortion-roe-versus-wade-youngkin-bristol-tennessee-virginia/article_31281cfc-15f1-11ee-8559-9b85d4db3696.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richmond Times-Dispatch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last summer that the ordinances are “simply requiring compliance with these federal statutes, which we believe completely stops abortion in communities.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dickson travels the country meeting with local officials who are interested in invoking the act. He and legal ally, former Texas Solicitor General Jonathan Mitchell, offer their representation in the case of legal challenges. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dickson said this offer “goes up” to the U.S. Supreme Court. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Justices Thomas Alito and Clarence Thomas recently </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/29/politics/comstock-act-alito-thomas-abortion/index.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">mentioned Comstock while hearing the FDA v. Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine case</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation also offers guidance for national abortion restrictions. Its series of policy goals called “</span><a href="https://www.project2025.org/policy/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Project 2025</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” has included the</span><a href="https://static.project2025.org/2025_MandateForLeadership_CHAPTER-14.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> legal code</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for Comstock without naming the law specifically. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Calling abortion medication a “gift to the abortion industry,” the guidebook asserts that the FDA should “stop promoting or approving mail-order abortions in violation of long-standing federal laws that prohibit the mailing and interstate carriage of abortion drugs.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Comstock itself has not yet made it to the Supreme Court in the form of its own case, Ziegler noted how the issue is gaining salience. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Now, I think you&#8217;re seeing it as, you know, a major election issue and something that a lot of Republicans say a (President Donald Trump Department of Justice) would do,” Zeigler said. “Of course, Trump has essentially avoided answering the question.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While many GOP congressional candidates, including in Virginia, have </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/17/they-dont-like-abortion-but-kaines-gop-challengers-say-they-wont-seek-a-federal-ban/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said abortion regulation is a state-level issue</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Democrats hope to proactively shore up federal protections legislatively. Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine has pressed to codify protections through the Reproductive Healthcare For All Act and Biden has made abortion protections a pillar of his reelection campaign.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Should Democrats retain the White House and make gains in Congress, they could enact various protections. But the Supreme Court still has a conservative majority that could continue its pattern of taking up legal challenges to abortion access.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What has been less obvious is whether his Republican challengers would support federal abortion bans or restrictions. Many on their campaign websites refer to themselves as “pro-life” but don’t specify where they fall on the spectrum of restrictions that Virginia Republicans have presented in recent years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, four of the five candidates have told the Mercury that they believe abortion regulation should be handled state-by-state. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Candidates who hold that view include former 10th Congressional District GOP nominee Hung Cao, lawyer Jonathan Emord, former Gov. Ron DeSantis staffer Scott Parkinson and Army veteran Eddie Garcia. The fifth candidate, Navy veteran Chuck Smith, could not be reached for an interview by the time of this publication. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At campaign events, social media, or on their websites, they’ve each expressed support for abortion restrictions or celebrated the reversal of federal abortion protections. Cao, a military veteran, likened abortion advocates to the </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gx2uj2TZ1o8" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“evil” he described seeing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> during his time in the service interrogating a suspected bombmaker in Iraq. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But each man has noted how they </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">don’t see their potential role in Congress as having much impact on abortion law. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I understand why Democrats continue to try to stoke fear and make the 2024 election about abortion, but it is not about abortion because abortion is a state issue,” Parkinson said in an email.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But abortion has </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/virginia-the-latest-state-sending-a-message-about-abortion-rights/article_46cab106-7f45-11ee-b92e-633bb12f549a.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">remained a salient national issue in elections</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> since the United States Supreme Court overturned federal protections in the summer of 2022. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While state legislatures around the country have imposed restrictions or near-total bans, others have enshrined protections into their state constitutions. Next year, Democrats in Virginia’s legislature hope to do the same, as it remains the least restrictive southern state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, some members of Congress have sought measures to implement federal controls.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine has spearheaded an effort to codify Roe into federal law while Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-SC, has introduced a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.lgraham.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/9/graham-introduces-legislation-to-protect-unborn-children-bring-u-s-abortion-policy-in-line-with-other-developed-nations#:~:text=The%20Graham%20legislation%3A,more%20protective%20of%20unborn%20life." target="_blank">federal 15-week limit</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During an October 2023 </span><a href="http://johnfredericksradio.libsyn.com/episode-969-the-fall-of-the-house-of-mchenry" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">interview on the John Fredericks Show</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Parkinson had been posed with a hypothetical situation of whether or not he would vote for Graham’s 15 week bill.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Parkinson said it would be unlikely to find success in the Senate. But when Fredericks pressed further, Parkinson said that he would vote for the bill because “it would ultimately protect life.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Parkinson said in a recent email to the Mercury that he expects to see continued differences in abortion regulation state-by-state. He noted how Virginia </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacodefull/title18.2/chapter4/article9/#:~:text=Notwithstanding%20any%20of%20the%20provisions%20of%20%C2%A7%2018.2%2D71%20and,of%20a%20human%20pregnancy%20by" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">state law </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">allows the procedure through the second trimester, with exceptions for later abortions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If policymakers don&#8217;t like that position, I recommend they run for governor, state senator, or delegate to change the law in Virginia,” Parkinson said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He asserted that he’s running for Congress for other issues, such as immigration and the economy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Garcia asserted that he does not plan to seek federal abortion law. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;m not trying to institute any bans or caps or restrictions or anything at the federal level,” Garcia said in a phone call. “I think that [the overturn of Roe] was correctly decided, that it should be pushed down to the states.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cao, likewise, wrote in an email: “I will vote against any national abortion ban.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before the men could  face the option to vote for or against a national prohibition, they first have to undergo a primary and general election. Each of them will face off in a June Republican primary to determine who is challenging Kaine in November. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smith indicated support for states implementing abortion bans at an April candidate forum, but noted that it’s states’ purview to do so. He stressed that he and his fellow opponents have to be clear against Kaine going forward on the matter of abortion, especially since Democrats have made abortion a key pillar of their campaigns.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What we say here today we should be prepared to say in the general election. We’re looking to beat Tim Kaine and this is what [Democrats are] gonna lead out with,” Smith said. “And my position is: Life begins at conception. There are no exceptions to that.”</span></p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://www.prri.org/research/abortion-views-in-all-50-states-findings-from-prris-2023-american-values-atlas/" target="_blank">Public Religion Research Institute</a> survey of some 22,000 U.S. adults released last week, 93% of Unitarian Universalists, 81% of Jews, 79% of Buddhists and 60% of Muslims also hold that view.</p>
<p>Researchers also found that most people who adhere to the two major branches of Christianity — Catholicism and Protestantism — also believe abortion should be mostly legal, save for three groups: white evangelical Protestants, Latter-day Saints and Jehovah’s Witnesses.</p>
<p>Historically, the Catholic Church has opposed abortion. But the poll found that 73% of Catholics of color — PRRI defines this group as Black, Asian, Native American and multiracial — support the right to have an abortion, followed by 62% of white Catholics and 57% of Hispanic Catholics. 	<div class="newsroomSidebarContainer ">
	<div class="newsroomSidebar">Religious views on abortion vary greatly in Virginia. According to a 2014 <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/religious-landscape-study/database/state/virginia/views-about-abortion/#demographic-information" target="_blank">Pew Research Center survey</a> of Virginia adults, mainline protestants — including methodists, lutherans, episcopalians, presbyterians and other denominations — appeared to be the most accepting of abortion rights, with 62% believing abortion should be legal in all or most cases.</p>
<div></div>
<div>Catholic Virginians were split on the topic, with 48% agreeing that abortion should be legal in all or most cases, and 48% disagreeing on the same point.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Evangelical protestants seemed the least accepting of abortion access, with 41% of baptist, pentecostal, non denominational and other congregations believing abortion should be legal in all or most cases.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Of the Virginia citizens surveyed who identified as unaffiliated with any religious group, 70% believed abortion access should be legal all or most of the time.</div>
</div>
	</div>
	
<p>The findings show that interfaith views on abortion may not be as simple as they appear during political debate, where the voices of white evangelical legislators and advocates can be the loudest.</p>
<p>States Newsroom spoke with Abrahamic religious scholars — specifically, experts in Catholicism, Islam and Judaism — and reproductive rights advocates about varying perspectives on abortion and their history.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Abortion views in America before Roe v. Wade</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/05/religious-right-real-origins-107133/" target="_blank">Moral Majority</a> — a voting bloc of white, conservative evangelicals who rose to prominence after the U.S. Supreme Court Roe v. Wade ruling in 1973 — is often associated with spearheading legislation to restrict abortion.</p>
<p>Gillian Frank is a historian specializing in religion, gender and sexuality who teaches at the Stevens Institute of Technology in New Jersey. Frank said evangelical views on abortion were actually more ambivalent before the early ’70s Roe decision established the federal right to terminate a pregnancy. (The Supreme Court upended that precedent about two years ago.)</p>
<p>“What we have to understand is that evangelicals, alongside mainline Protestants and Jews of various denominations, supported what was called therapeutic abortion, which is to say abortion for certain exceptional causes,” Frank said, including saving the life or health of the mother, fetal abnormalities, rape, incest and the pregnancy of a minor. Religious bodies like the Southern Baptist Convention and the National Association of Evangelicals said abortion was OK in certain circumstances, he added.</p>
<p>Evangelical Protestants before Roe did not endorse “elective abortions,” Frank said, or what they called “abortion on demand,” a phrase invoked by abortion-rights opponents today that he said entered the American lexicon around 1962.</p>
<p>The 1973 ruling was seismic and led organizations opposing abortion, such as the National Right to Life Committee — formed by the Conference of Catholic Bishops — to sprout across the country, according to an article published four years later in <a href="https://www.facingsouth.org/2022/06/archives-right-life-southern-strategy" target="_blank">Southern Exposure</a>. Catholic leaders often lobbied other religious groups — evangelicals, Mormons, orthodox Jews — to join their movement and likened abortion to murder in their newspapers.</p>
<p>After Roe, “abortion is increasingly associated with women’s liberation in popular rhetoric in popular culture, because of the activism of the women’s movement but also because of the ways in which the anti-abortion movement is associating abortion with familial decline,” Frank said. Those sentiments, he said, were spread by conservative figures like Phyllis Schlafly, a Catholic opposed to feminism and abortion, who campaigned against and managed to block the Equal Rights Amendment in the 1970s.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Polls suggest the views of Catholic clergy and laypeople diverge</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Catholicism is generally synonymous with opposition to abortion. According to the <a href="https://www.usccb.org/issues-and-action/human-life-and-dignity/abortion/respect-for-unborn-human-life" target="_blank">United States Conference of Catholic Bishops</a>, the church has stood against abortion since the first century. The conference <a href="https://bible.usccb.org/bible/jeremiah/1" target="_blank">points</a> to Jeremiah 1:5 in the Bible to back up arguments that pregnancy termination is “contrary to the moral law.”</p>
<p>But nearly 6 in 10 American Catholics believe abortion should be mostly legal, according to a <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/04/12/9-facts-about-us-catholics/" target="_blank">Pew Research Center</a> report released last month.</p>
<p>Catholics for Choice spokesperson Ashley Wilson said that there’s a disconnect between the church as an institution and its laity. “We recognize that part of the problem is that the Catholic clergy, and the people who write the official teaching of the church, are all or mostly white male — my boss likes to say ostensibly celibate men — who don’t have wives,” Wilson said. “They don’t have daughters. They have no inroads into the lives of laypeople.”</p>
<p>Her group plans on going to Vatican City in Rome this fall to lift up stories of Catholics who’ve had abortions. The organization is also actively involved in efforts to restore abortion access — <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/see-data-reproductive-rights" target="_blank">14 states have near-total bans</a> — through direct ballot measures in <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/its-not-extraordinary-its-health-care-says-leader-colorado-abortion-ballot-initiative" target="_blank">Colorado</a>, <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/fl-supreme-court-allows-rigid-6-week-abortion-ban-clears-abortion-rights-amendment-ballot" target="_blank">Florida</a> and <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/more-380000-missourians-sign-initiative-petition-put-abortion-ballot" target="_blank">Missouri</a> this year.</p>
<p>Catholic dioceses and fraternities are often behind counter-efforts to proposed ballot questions. They poured <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/abortion-2024-ballot-campaigns-could-see-millions-funding-familiar-players" target="_blank">millions</a> into campaigns in <a href="https://www.facingsouth.org/kentucky-abortion-ballot-measure-money" target="_blank">Kansas and Kentucky</a> in 2022 to push anti-abortion amendments, and also in <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/ohio-catholic-bishops-spent-big-failed-effort-defeat-abortion-rights-amendment" target="_blank">Ohio</a> last year to defeat a reproductive rights ballot measure but they failed in each state.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Ensoulment and mercy in Islam</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Tenets of Islam — the second largest faith in the world — often make references to how far along a person’s pregnancy is and whether there are complications. University of Colorado Law professor Rabea Benhalim, an expert of Islamic and Judaic law, said there’s a common belief that at 40 days’ gestation, the embryo is akin to a drop of fluid. After 120 days, the fetus gains a soul, she said.</p>
<p>While the Quran doesn’t specifically speak to abortion, Benhalim said <a href="https://islamicstudies.info/reference.php?sura=23&amp;verse=12-14#:~:text=(23%3A12)%20We%20created,then%20We%20caused%20it%20to" target="_blank">Chapter 23: 12-14</a> is considered a description of a fetus in a womb. The verses are deeply “important in the development of abortion jurisprudence within Islamic law, because there’s an understanding that life is something that is emerging over a period of stages.”</p>
<p>In some restrictive interpretations of Islam, there’s a limit on abortion after 40 days, or seven weeks after implantation, Benhalim said. In other interpretations, because <a href="https://bmcmedethics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1472-6939-15-10" target="_blank">ensoulment</a> doesn’t occur until 120 days of gestation, abortion is generally permitted in some Muslim communities for various reasons, she said. After ensoulment, abortion is allowed if the mother’s life is in danger, according to religious doctrine.</p>
<p>Sahar Pirzada, the director of movement building at HEART, a reproductive justice organization focused on sexual health and education in Muslim American communities, confirmed that some Muslims believe in the 40-day mark, while others adhere to the 120-day mark when weighing abortion.</p>
<p>“How can you make a black-and-white ruling on something that is going to be applied across the board when everyone’s situation is different?” she asked. “There’s a lot of compassion and mercy with how we’re supposed to approach matters of the womb.”</p>
<p>The issue is personal for Pirzada, who had an abortion in 2018 after her fetus received a fatal diagnosis of <a href="https://wapo.st/4a8wMWO" target="_blank">trisomy 18</a> when she was 12 weeks pregnant. “I wanted to terminate within the 120-day mark, which gave me a few more weeks,” she said.</p>
<p>She consulted scholars and Islamic teachings before making the decision to end her pregnancy, she said, and mentioned the importance of rahma — mercy — in Islam. “I tried to embody that spirit of compassion for myself,” she said.</p>
<p>Pirzada, who is now a mother of two, had the procedure at exactly 14 weeks on a day six years ago that was both Ash Wednesday and Valentine’s Day. She said she felt loved and surrounded by people of faith at the hospital, where some health care workers had crosses marked in ash on their foreheads. “I felt very appreciative that they were offering me care on a day that was spiritual for them,” she said.</p>
<p>Seeing the stories of people with pregnancy complications in the period since the Supreme Court overturned the federal right to an abortion has left her grief stricken. For instance, Kate Cox, a Texas woman whose fetus had the same diagnosis as Pirzada’s, was denied an abortion by the state Supreme Court in December. Cox had to travel elsewhere for care, <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/texas-supreme-court-blocks-order-allowing-abortion-woman-who-sought-it-leaves-state" target="_blank">Texas Tribune</a> reported.</p>
<p>Benhalim, the University of Colorado expert, said teachings in Islam and Judaism offer solace to followers who are considering abortion, as they can provide guidance during difficult decisions.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">No fetal personhood in Judaism </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>In Jewish texts, the embryo is referred to as water before 40 days of gestation, according to the <a href="https://www.ncjw.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Judaism-and-Abortion-FINAL.pdf" target="_blank">National Council of Jewish Women</a>. Exodus: 21:22-23 in the <a href="https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/shemot-exodus-chapter-21" target="_blank">Torah</a> mentions a hypothetical situation where two men are fighting and injure a pregnant woman. If she has a miscarriage, the men are only fined. But if she is seriously injured and dies, “the penalty shall be a life for a life.”</p>
<p>This part of the Torah is interpreted to mean that a fetus does not have personhood, and the men didn’t commit murder, according to the council. But this may not be a catchall belief — Benhalim noted that denominations of Judaism have different opinions on abortion.</p>
<p>Today, Jewish Americans have been at the forefront of legal challenges to abortion bans based on religious freedom in <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/religion-based-claims-are-piling-against-floridas-15-week-abortion-ban" target="_blank">Florida</a>, <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/indiana-court-appeals-affirms-rfra-based-abortion-ban-challenge" target="_blank">Indiana</a> and <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/jewish-women-cite-kentuckys-religious-freedom-law-contesting-state-abortion-ban" target="_blank">Kentucky</a>. Many of the lawsuits have interfaith groups of plaintiffs and argue that restrictions on termination infringe on their religion.</p>
<p>The legal challenge in Indiana has been the most successful. Hoosier Jews for Choice and five anonymous plaintiffs sued members of the state medical licensing board in summer 2022, when Indiana’s near-total abortion ban initially took effect.</p>
<p>Plaintiffs argued that the ban violated the state’s Religious Freedom Restoration Act, and the court later let the claim receive class-action status. Several Jewish Hoosiers said they believe life begins after a baby’s first breath, and that abortion is required to protect the mother’s health and life, according to court documents.</p>
<p>Last month, the Indiana Court of Appeals <a href="https://www.aclu-in.org/sites/default/files/field_documents/2024.04.24_-_decision.pdf" target="_blank">ruled</a> that the plaintiffs have the right to sue the state but sent the request for a temporary halt on the ban back to a lower court.</p>
<p>While the decision was unanimous, Judge Mark Bailey issued a separate concurring opinion explaining his reasoning and criticizing lawmakers — “an overwhelming majority of whom have not experienced childbirth” — who assert they are protectors of life from the point of conception.</p>
<p>“In my view, this is an adoption of a religious viewpoint held by some, but certainly not all, Hoosiers,” he wrote. “The least that can be expected is that remaining Hoosiers of child bearing ability will be given the opportunity to act in accordance with their own consciences and religious creeds.”</p>

(Sofia Resnick/States Newsroom)</p><p>U.S. Supreme Court justices spent two hours Wednesday morning debating whether a federal law about emergency treatment encompasses abortion care even in states with strict abortion bans, with no clear indication of how they may ultimately rule.</p>
<p>A decision could come as soon as the end of June whether Idaho’s near-total abortion ban means doctors who might need to terminate a pregnancy during a health emergency would be protected from prosecution under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, or EMTALA, a federal law that requires hospitals to treat patients who come to an emergency room regardless of their ability to pay. That includes treatment to prevent serious damage to bodily functions.</p>
<p>If the court decides the law does not provide that protection, then hospitals and doctors in Idaho have said they will have to continue <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/loss-federal-protection-idaho-spurs-pregnant-patients-plan-emergency-air-transport" target="_blank">transferring patients out of state</a> for that treatment. Since January, when the court decided to take the case and struck down an injunction that provided protection under EMTALA, transfers out of state for pregnancy complications that may require termination increased from one in 2023 to six over the course of four months.</p>
<p>The court’s liberal wing — Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson — ​​questioned Idaho Deputy Attorney General Josh Turner about what EMTALA explicitly says about stabilizing treatment and whether abortion procedures fall into that definition when complications occur before a fetus can survive outside of the womb.</p>
<p>Turner argued that Idaho’s law should supersede federal law in the case of abortion procedures, even if it goes against commonly accepted medical care standards.</p>
<p>Sotomayor rejected that argument.</p>
<p>“There is no state licensing law that would permit the state to say, ‘Don’t treat diabetics with insulin. Treat them only with pills,’” Sotomayor said. “Federal law would say you can’t do that.”</p>
<p>She said federal law requires treatment of a person who is at risk of serious medical complications without that treatment, but Idaho’s law does not provide that much leeway.</p>
<p>“Idaho law says the doctor has to determine not that there’s really a serious medical condition, but that the person will die. That’s a huge difference, counsel,” she said.</p>
<p>Idaho’s abortion ban went into effect in August 2022, a few months after the U.S. Supreme Court issued its Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision that overturned Roe v. Wade, ending federal protection for abortion access and allowing states to regulate it instead. Providers who are prosecuted for performing an abortion are subject to two to five years in prison plus the loss of their medical license, and they are also subject to civil enforcement laws by any family members related to the person who had the abortion.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Doctors are subject to prosecutorial discretion in Idaho, deputy AG says </h4>

	
<p>The justices repeatedly asked Turner to identify situations where a doctor might provide an abortion as part of stabilizing care and it would not be allowed under Idaho law. He continued to point to the state’s exception to save a patient’s life and referred to a doctor’s “good faith medical judgment” being enough to avoid prosecution.</p>
<p>The government listed nine emergency medical conditions where termination of the pregnancy may be the recommended treatment to stabilize a patient’s condition, including when the water breaks before a fetus is viable or when a patient experiences uncontrolled high blood pressure or bleeding. Idaho doctors identified one recent “traumatic” case when a patient had to wait until advanced infection set in before the doctor felt secure enough to end the pregnancy. Others are sending patients out of state as soon as termination might be needed to avoid having to wait until they meet qualifications under Idaho’s exception to prevent death.</p>
<p>Justice Amy Coney Barrett, considered one of the court’s more conservative members, said Turner was hedging in his answers and asked what happens if another doctor or prosecutor reaches a contrary conclusion about what the appropriate medical treatment should have been.</p>
<p>“That, your honor, is the nature of prosecutorial discretion,” Turner said.</p>
<p>Barrett also asked if Idaho had released any legal guidance about its abortion laws, the way a federal health agency might issue guidance. Turner said the “guiding star” is the Idaho Supreme Court’s opinion from August 2022 interpreting the abortion statute, where it said the law does not require imminence of death or medical certainty for a physician to intervene. The Idaho court also said another doctor’s opinion would only be considered if they accused the doctor who performed the abortion of acting in bad faith.</p>
<p>U.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar said for those reasons, women in Idaho are not getting the treatment they need, often in already-tragic situations where a wanted pregnancy is lost because of complications.</p>
<p>“They are getting airlifted to Salt Lake City and to neighboring states where there are health exceptions in their laws,” she said. “The doctors can’t provide the care until they can conclude that a prosecutor looking over their shoulder won’t second guess that maybe it wasn’t really necessary to prevent death.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Conservatives ask about conscience objections</h4>

	
<p>The more conservative justices offered mixed questions to Prelogar, who argued on behalf of the government. Justice Neil Gorsuch posed questions related to the federal Supremacy Clause about when federal law can override state law in the context of medicine, while Barrett asked whether conscience exceptions exist for doctors who don’t feel comfortable terminating a pregnancy even in emergency situations. Or if a hospital did not want to provide the procedure, such as a Catholic hospital, would be exempt under EMTALA for conscience reasons. One of Idaho’s largest hospital systems, Saint Alphonsus, is a Catholic hospital.</p>
<p>Prelogar confirmed that yes, individual doctors and entire medical entities qualify for those conscience objections and are therefore not required to perform an abortion under EMTALA. But at a hospital that did not have a blanket objection, they would take individual objections into consideration for appropriate staffing so that there is always someone available to provide that care if necessary.</p>
<p>“If the question is, could you force an individual doctor to step in over a conscience objection, the answer is no, and I want to be really clear about that,” Prelogar said.</p>
<p>Justice Sam Alito also asked Prelogar if EMTALA could be understood to apply to other emergency situations such as a mental health emergency, if someone was expressing suicidal thoughts and wanted to end their pregnancy to resolve those thoughts. Idaho’s legal representation, conservative religious law firm Alliance Defending Freedom, argued in its brief to the court that a ruling in favor of EMTALA protection would allow such situations to occur. Prelogar said no, the proper treatment would be to administer medications to alleviate the suicidal thoughts.</p>
<p>“There can be grave mental health emergencies, but EMTALA could never require pregnancy termination as the stabilizing care … because that wouldn’t do anything to address the underlying brain chemistry issue that’s causing the mental health emergency in the first place,” Prelogar said. “If she happens to be pregnant, it would be incredibly unethical to terminate her pregnancy. She might not be in a position to give any informed consent.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Demonstrators, legislators from Idaho comment on court case</h4>

	
<p>Hundreds of abortion rights advocates, medical professionals and two Idaho legislators gathered outside the U.S. Supreme Court building in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday morning before the arguments advocating for the court to uphold EMTALA as a guiding principle regardless of state abortion laws. On the anti-abortion rights side, Idaho-based crisis pregnancy center Stanton Healthcare argued the case was about forcing states with abortion bans to perform them. Danielle Versluys, the organization’s chief operating officer, said women with complications should deliver a baby naturally, regardless of the circumstances.</p>
<p>“The outcome is the same — a dead baby — but the difference is one is natural, and the other is not,” she said. “And one allows the woman the natural process to give birth and to grieve, and the other one is unnatural.”</p>
<p>Rep. Ilana Rubel, a Democrat and the legislature’s minority leader, told States Newsroom the case is a waste of state taxpayer dollars.</p>
<p>“It is, frankly, stunning that leaders in our state think that this is something they want so badly they were willing to take it to the Supreme Court to deprive women of appropriate care in medical emergencies,” Rubel said. And with the Idaho Legislature adjourned for the year, she added, “If the Supreme Court does not give us EMTALA back, there will be no lifeline for women at least until 2025.”</p>

Under the <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/statutes/pregnant-workers-fairness-act" target="_blank">statute</a>, employers with 15 or more workers must grant pregnant workers’ requests for accommodations, as long as the changes don’t pose “undue hardship” on the employer.</p>
<p>Congress passed the PWFA in December 2022, and the law took effect in <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/pregnant-workers-have-new-protections-heres-what-expect-your-boss" target="_blank">June 2023</a>. But the EEOC allowed considerable time for public comment on proposed rules.</p>
<p>Roughly 100,000 comments were submitted to the commission, including about 54,000 urging the agency to exclude abortion from the definition of “pregnancy, childbirth or related medical conditions,” and some 40,000 supporting the inclusion of abortion.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the commission decided to include abortion as a condition for which workers can seek accommodations, such as time off. The decision was based on the plain text of the measure, according to a 400-page <a href="https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2024-07527.pdf" target="_blank">document</a> explaining PWFA guidance. The rules will be published in the <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/public-inspection/2024-07527/implementation-of-the-pregnant-workers-fairness-act" target="_blank">Federal Register</a> on April 19, but they don’t take effect until 60 days later.</p>
<p>“The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act is a win for workers, families, and our economy. It gives pregnant workers clear access to reasonable accommodations that will allow them to keep doing their jobs safely and effectively, free from discrimination and retaliation,” said Charlotte Burrows, the EEOC chair, in a statement.</p>
<p>Under the law, pregnant workers and prospective employees should be allowed: water breaks, food breaks, restroom breaks, a stool to sit on while working, time off for doctors’ appointments, temporary reassignments and remote work, for example. Americans with jobs can also ask for accommodations when they’re recovering from abortion, lactation, infertility treatments, miscarriages and stillbirths.</p>
<p>Organizations that support gender equality in the workplace celebrated the rules’ finalization.</p>
<p>“The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act is a life-changing protection for pregnant and postpartum workers nationwide, ensuring they aren’t forced off the job or denied the accommodations they need for their health,” <a href="https://www.abetterbalance.org/press-release-a-better-balance-applauds-the-eeoc-for-announcing-robust-final-rule-for-the-implementation-of-the-pregnant-workers-fairness-act/" target="_blank">said</a> Dina Bakst, co-president of A Better Balance, in a statement. Bakst’s group has pushed for the legislation’s passage for more than a decade.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/pregnant-workers-have-new-protections-heres-what-expect-your-boss" target="_blank">States Newsroom</a> economy reporter Casey Quinlan previously reported that the law was crafted to address gaps in the civil rights measures, such as the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, which prohibits discrimination against pregnant employees but requires someone to find a colleague who was given similar accommodations for comparison. A 2022 <a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/blog/bpc-morning-consult-pregnancy-discrimination/" target="_blank">poll</a> found that 1 in 5 mothers have experienced pregnancy discrimination at work.</p>
<p>“This is an important moment for pregnant workers, those with pregnancy difficulties or complications, and those who are considering having a baby,” <a href="https://nationalpartnership.org/news_post/npwf-commends-rule-finalizing-strong-protections-for-2-8-million-pregnant-workers/?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=source&amp;utm_campaign=ej_pwfa" target="_blank">said</a> Jocelyn Frye, president of the National Partnership for Women and Families.</p>
<p>​​Frye said the rules will strengthen “protections for millions of workers, in spite of recent extreme partisan attempts to overturn this bipartisan law.” Abortion rights opponents criticized the determination that abortion counts as a pregnancy-related condition.</p>

<p>“Adding this controversial provision into the PWFA is wrong. Period,” said U.S. Rep. Virginia Foxx, a North Carolina Republican, in a <a href="https://edworkforce.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=410447" target="_blank">statement</a> last week. “Abortion is not a medical condition related to pregnancy; it is the opposite.” Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative law firm, <a href="https://adflegal.org/press-release/biden-admin-hijacks-pregnant-workers-law-impose-illegal-abortion-mandate" target="_blank">said</a> in August that the inclusion of abortion as a reasonable accommodation was “federal overreach.”</p>
<p>The law has also been subject to litigation. A federal judge recently blocked the enforcement of the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act in Texas after Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton sued President Joe Biden’s administration over its passage and other provisions in a 2022 $1.7 trillion spending package. Paxton argued that the act was unconstitutional because it was passed by proxy votes, <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/federal-judge-rules-against-pregnant-workers-win-paxton?emci=3328f72b-73d6-ee11-85f9-002248223794&amp;emdi=00497b0b-fad6-ee11-85f9-002248223794&amp;ceid=526826" target="_blank">Texas Tribune</a> reported.</p>
<p>Adam Cyr, a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Justice, declined to comment Wednesday on whether the agency will appeal the decision to the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals.</p>
<p>“Texas: Won’t let you have an abortion but also won’t do anything to help you have a safe and healthy pregnancy,” U.S. Sen. Bob Casey, a Pennsylvania Democrat, said in a statement to the <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/pregnant-workers-fairness-act-blocked-texas-unconstitutional" target="_blank">Pennsylvania Capital-Star</a> in February after the ruling. Casey co-sponsored the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act and first introduced the bill in 2012.</p>

Glenn Youngkin recently took action on a flurry of Virginia legislators’ measures related to reproductive health, mostly blocking bills designed to preserve the public’s access to abortions and birth control as these same issues roil national debates and as other states pass laws that restrict womens’ bodily autonomy and roll back decades of abortion protections. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, a surprising signoff: Youngkin, a Republican, </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB78" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">signed a bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Del. Vivian Watts, D-Fairfax, that prevents electronic menstrual data — often collected in period-tracking digital apps — from being subject to search warrants, subpoenas or court orders. Watts said in a phone interview Wednesday that her bill is a “preventative measure” that, considering the social climate of the nation, is warranted.</span></p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;The 1864 abortion ban is a feature, not a bug, of the GOP&#8217;s assault on reproductive rights&#8221; &#8212; Arizona Mirror" src="https://azmirror.com/2024/04/10/the-1864-abortion-ban-is-a-feature-not-a-bug-of-the-gops-assault-on-reproductive-rights/embed/#?secret=xix0dTUif4#?secret=bAa0vHLXBJ" data-secret="bAa0vHLXBJ" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Arizona Supreme Court just allowed a law that goes back to the 1800s to override a law passed within the last decade,” Watts said, referencing the state’s recent decision to uphold a 160-year-old statute that bans virtually all abortions and reject a 2022 law that allowed abortions up to the 15th week of pregnancy. When the newly-reenacted antebellum era law was first created, Arizona wasn’t a state, women couldn’t vote, and slavery was an ongoing American tradition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arizona’s near-total abortion ban is the latest example of how access to abortions has been increasingly limited since the Supreme Court of the United States overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, removing Constitutional protections for the procedure that is often </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1N2TC0VD/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">necessary</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to save womens’ lives or health. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My surprise at Youngkin greenlighting Watts’ bill isn’t based on the common sense merit of the measure. Protecting individuals’ private health information should be the standard of any state that respects its citizens. And it’s just downright creepy to imagine a Virginia judge or law enforcement officer scrutinizing the date and duration of peoples’ periods.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That Youngkin advanced that bill while vetoing several other reproductive health measures is what seemed like an unexpected mixed message to me, Virginia abortion </span><a href="https://x.com/ProtectChoice/status/1776404452678783176" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">advocates</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and Watts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am amazed that there&#8217;s the recognition of the importance of privacy as a basic human right,” Watts said of Youngkin signing her bill, “that&#8217;s not being recognized in the other abortion-related legislation, where the right of a private decision is not being respected.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which pieces of related legislation did the governor reject or alter?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He shot down a </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB15" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> carried by Sen. Barbara Favola, D-Arlington, to prevent the extradition of people who come to Virginia for an abortion from other states where the procedure is illegal, should that person face related criminal charges in their home state. The bill’s extradition protection would have extended to doctors and medical workers who performed or assisted with out-of-state patients’ Virginia abortions, too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“By vetoing this bill, the governor has refused to provide a layer of protection that Virginia healthcare professionals believe is necessary to ensure that they can provide abortion care without the fear of prosecution,” Favola</span><a href="https://x.com/BarbaraFavola/status/1776595597404917998" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> posted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on social media platform X. Doctors and women seeking abortions in the state “deserve the peace of mind this bill would’ve provided,” she added.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB716" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bills</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Del. Candi Mundon King, D-Dumfries, and Sen. Jennifer Carroll Foy, D-Prince William, </span><b> </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">that would have protected medical professionals who provide abortion care from disciplinary actions by the Board of Medicine also met Youngkin’s ax.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said no to a </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB1098" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Del. Sam Rasoul, D-Roanoke, mandating companies with 50 or more employees provide workers up to 10 days of unpaid bereavement leave after a family members’ death, but also, importantly, after a miscarriage, an unsuccessful “reproductive technology” procedure like in vitro fertilization, a stillbirth or following a medical diagnosis that “negatively impacts pregnancy or fertility.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB609" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Del. Marcia Price, D-Newport News to establish a right to access and use birth control regardless of the American Constitution’s requirements was, like Watts’ bill, an effort to protect reproductive health care from future federal restrictions that may be on the horizon. Youngkin </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+ful+HB609H1" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">amended</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and weakened, the bill by predicating Virginians’ right to contraceptives on landmark Constitutional contraceptive protections, ones that could be overturned just like Roe. v. Wade. By doing so, he took the teeth right out of it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin didn’t fully reject a </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB819" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">measure</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Sen. Ghazala F. Hashmi, D-Richmond, and King to mandate insurance companies cover birth control; he amended it by adding a loophole allowing insurers to be exempt based on their religious or ethical beliefs. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2016/06/21/where-major-religious-groups-stand-on-abortion/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Religious beliefs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about the God-given sanctity of life are the bedrock of America’s anti-abortion movement. Some use their religious beliefs to </span><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/06/20/lgbtq-people-americans-largely-oppose-religious-based-discrimination/70335484007/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">discriminate against LGBTQ+ people</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Slaveowners used their religious beliefs to condone owning human beings, even </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/the-bible-was-used-to-justify-slavery-then-africans-made-it-their-path-to-freedom/2019/04/29/34699e8e-6512-11e9-82ba-fcfeff232e8f_story.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reading Bible passages</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about servants obeying their masters to enslaved Black people. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The problem with the governor tacking on a religious beliefs exemption to Hashmi’s bill is that, historically and presently, religious beliefs have been a convenient way for some people to excuse their bad behavior, spread prejudices and enforce their agendas at the expense of others’ lives, liberty and wellbeing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia is the last Southern state to preserve access to abortion with no new restrictions after Roe’s overturning. Our commonwealth is now a sanctuary of last resort for people who can’t get abortion care that they desperately need where they live. As the reproductive health culture wars rage on, it’s imperative that Virginia’s laws reflect what citizens need and want: laws that support their health and ensure the best quality of life possible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Immediately after torching most abortion bills and diluting one to cement birth control as a human right, Youngkin started touting his </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/news-releases/2024/april/name-1025084-en.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">revised budget</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as a way for state lawmakers and their constituents to reach “common ground.” But by rejecting the legislature’s reproductive health measures, our governor also rejects the rights and will of many Virginians and contributes to the deepening political and cultural divides fracturing our country.</span></p>

<p>Kelly Shannon was grieving a pregnancy she would need to terminate because of multiple fetal anomalies when she got the call that Alabama doctors wouldn’t approve an abortion procedure despite exceptions in the law. That meant she would have to leave the state.</p>
<p>Shannon, 36, was about 16 weeks along in January 2023 when genetic testing – and confirmation from an amniocentesis – showed her fetus likely had Trisomy 21, better known as Down syndrome. It didn’t take long for the doctor to determine the fetus likely wouldn’t survive to term. There was fluid buildup in the head and body, evidence of a heart defect, and a tumor on the abdomen that was roughly one-third the size of its entire body.</p>
<p>“There was so much decision-making and processing, and you’re still feeling the baby kick the whole time,” Shannon said. “And every time she would kick, I was just sitting there like, ‘I’m so sorry. I wish I got to be your mom, but I don’t get to be your mom.’”</p>
<p>Three years before the U.S. Supreme Court issued the Dobbs decision in June 2022 and returned the ability to regulate abortion to the states, Alabama had already passed an abortion ban. Gov. Kay Ivey said at the time she signed the bill that even though it was likely unenforceable since abortion was still legal nationally, it was a signal to the courts to overturn Roe v. Wade. A group of physicians challenged the Alabama law in court and received a preliminary injunction that had barred its enforcement for years. But when Dobbs took effect, the injunction was lifted. Doctors are now subject to felony charges with punishment of up to life in prison.</p>
<p>Alabama is one of few states with an abortion ban at any stage of pregnancy that also contains an exception for lethal fetal anomalies. In the law, it’s defined as a condition from which the fetus would die after birth or shortly thereafter, or be stillborn. There are also exceptions for performing an abortion to save a pregnant patient’s life or preserve their health. However, according to the latest WeCount report of abortions performed since Dobbs, Alabama has recorded zero abortion procedures. Activists have argued that exceptions in abortion bans are meaningless because there is too much fear and uncertainty about what circumstances will qualify for an exception.</p>
<p>Down syndrome is the most common chromosomal abnormality, and more often occurs when the pregnant person is over the age of 35. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, infants with Down syndrome and a heart defect are five times more likely to die in their first year of life than those without.</p>
<p>Each abnormality on its own would possibly have been manageable, Shannon said, but the maternal-fetal medicine specialist told her the combination meant she would likely either miscarry at some point during the pregnancy or her daughter’s life would be short and punctuated by multiple surgeries. Shannon and her husband made the difficult decision at that point to terminate.</p>
<p>“That made the decision easier because it was like, well now if I know I’m going to lose her regardless, I can lose her on a controlled timeline, protect my health, start the grieving process, get healthy and then still be able to have another child,” she said.</p>
<p>Shannon filled out paperwork and made a termination appointment pending approval from the other maternal-fetal medicine specialists at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Her doctor felt confident that given the severity of the anomalies, the abortion would be allowed.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘I don’t think I would’ve taken that risk on me’ </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>A few days later, in the car on her way to meet her husband and toddler at a local dog park, the doctor called back.</p>
<p>“I knew why she was calling me. I knew that was the day the (second) committee was supposed to meet and she’d be calling me with their decision,” Shannon said.</p>
<p>Shannon scheduled the Jan. 24  termination date, made arrangements to take leave from work and had decided on cremation. But with one phone call, all the decisions she’d made had to change.</p>
<p>The termination had easily been approved by the first committee, and it seemed like the higher-level committee would sign off too. But in a halting manner, the doctor explained the committee had decided since each condition by itself was survivable, it didn’t meet the criteria for termination. She told Shannon it was the hardest phone call she’d made in her professional career.</p>
<p>The only way the committee might approve the request was if the fetus also developed a condition called hydrops fetalis, an excessive buildup of fluid that is often fatal. Shannon said that put her in a strange place of having some kind of hope that her pregnancy was even worse than originally thought. But she wasn’t upset with the doctors themselves.</p>
<p>“I mostly just felt sorry for them, even at the time,” she said. “As angry as I was that I wasn’t going to get to handle my pregnancy and my termination in the way that made the most sense to me … if I had been in their shoes and thought well, is this one case worth my license and jail time and prosecution? Her life’s not in danger, her baby’s probably going to die. I don’t think I would’ve taken that risk on me.”</p>
<p>The manager of public relations at the University of Alabama at Birmingham said no one was available to speak with States Newsroom for this story.</p>
<p>She had one more ultrasound at 17 weeks, where her providers checked for hydrops, but there was no presence of it. As the pregnancy had progressed further since the last ultrasound,  multiple holes between the chambers of the fetus’s heart were clearly visible, and the tumor had grown .7 centimeters. Despite the increased severity of those issues, without hydrops, she still had to go out of state.</p>
<p>A scheduling error meant Shannon had to wait two more weeks before she could get an appointment at a hospital in Richmond, Virginia — an 11-hour drive. Rather than bring her husband and toddler along for the ordeal, Shannon’s parents accompanied her. It was the first night she’d ever spent away from her toddler.</p>
<p>She chose to be induced for the procedure. After a long day of waiting, Shannon gave birth a few minutes before midnight and got to hold her daughter.</p>
<p>“I kept her with me until about 2 or 3 in the morning,” she said.</p>
<p>The logistics of what to do with the remains became more complicated since she was now more than 700 miles away from home and wouldn’t be able to visit a burial site in Virginia the way she could have in Alabama. She opted to have her daughter buried with other babies that had died because of miscarriage, termination or other premature causes.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Baby boy born in mid-March </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>In mid-March, Shannon gave birth to a healthy baby boy that was a surprise pregnancy. She had been aiming for her next pregnancy to happen over the summer, when she wasn’t teaching.</p>
<p>“When I found out I was pregnant, I just started crying. Instead of being excited, the trauma came back,” she said. “And I felt like, I want to be excited and happy, but I’m not there yet because I don’t know if we get to keep this one yet either.”</p>
<p>She said she wants her story to make a difference, in hopes that another person doesn’t have to go through the same pain.</p>
<p>“I get angry whenever I see people with the ‘choose life’ bumper stickers and license plates, because they’re not thinking about me. They’re not recognizing that it’s not a black and white issue, it’s nothing but shades of gray when you’re dealing with pregnancy, particularly high-risk pregnancy,” Shannon said. “I am a married, white, straight, Christian, grew-up-in-the-church woman who was attempting to grow her family within the bounds of marriage, and I just keep thinking, if anybody is going to be able to change a mind about this issue, shouldn’t it be me?”</p>

(Photo by Jane Norman/States Newsroom)</p><p>WASHINGTON — The same U.S. Supreme Court that overturned the constitutional right to an abortion will hear oral arguments Tuesday over access to mifepristone, a pharmaceutical used in both medication abortion and miscarriage care.</p>
<p>The nine justices will then decide whether to leave access to the drug intact or require the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to revert prescribing instructions to what were in place before 2016.</p>
<p>The court decision will affect the entire country, including states that have sought to shore up access to reproductive rights following the Dobbs ruling less than two years ago.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court opinion, likely not to come until late spring, will land in the middle of a presidential campaign in which Democrats are elevating the question of reproductive rights. The debate is also likely to affect GOP efforts to grow their majority in the U.S. House and flip the Senate red.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Trend toward medication abortion</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Medication abortion, a two-drug regimen that uses mifepristone and misoprostol, was used in 63% of abortions in the United States during 2023, according to a <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/2024/03/medication-abortion-accounted-63-all-us-abortions-2023-increase-53-2020?utm_source=Guttmacher+Email+Alerts&amp;utm_campaign=afd25dbc2c-march_provision_study_gupdate&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_9ac83dc920-afd25dbc2c-%5BLIST_EMAIL_ID%5D" target="_blank">report</a> released earlier this month by the Guttmacher Institute.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="OdrO3BOL4w"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/03/20/medication-abortion-rates-grew-10-over-the-last-few-years-report-shows/">Medication abortion rates grew 10% over the last few years, report shows</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Medication abortion rates grew 10% over the last few years, report shows&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/03/20/medication-abortion-rates-grew-10-over-the-last-few-years-report-shows/embed/#?secret=L0bJ5qCEsS#?secret=OdrO3BOL4w" data-secret="OdrO3BOL4w" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p>The new data shows a continued trend away from procedural abortions and toward medication abortion, which is approved up to 10 weeks gestation, that has been steadily increasing since the FDA originally approved mifepristone in 2000.</p>
<p>Medication abortions accounted for about 6% of pregnancy terminations in 2001, rising to 24% in 2011, before reaching 53% in 2020, according to Guttmacher.</p>
<p>During the last calendar year, the report says there were 1,026,690 abortions throughout the country, with 642,700 of those being medication abortions.</p>
<p>The numbers may not represent the full picture, however.</p>
<p>“The medication abortion counts for 2023 do not include self-managed medication abortions that take place outside of the formal health care system or abortion medication mailed to people in states with total abortion bans,” the Guttmacher report states. “While there are no comprehensive data on the number of self-managed medication abortions in the United States, evidence suggests they have been increasing in the past several years.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Alliance Defending Freedom suit</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The case about to go in front of the Supreme Court, Food and Drug Administration v. Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, began in November 2022 when Alliance Defending Freedom sued the FDA on behalf of four anti-abortion medical organizations and four anti-abortion doctors.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/federal-judge-could-decide-soon-february-yank-abortion-pill-nationwide" target="_blank">original lawsuit</a> and numerous briefs since then, ADF argued that mifepristone leads to problematic situations for doctors who have to assist patients with complications from medication abortions. They’ve also made claims about safety, which have been repeatedly refuted by major medical organizations.</p>
<p>The lawsuit had called for the judicial system to overturn the FDA’s original 2000 approval of mifepristone, which U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas Judge Matthew Joseph Kacsmaryk essentially agreed with, in his April 2023 <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/biden-administration-appeals-judges-ruling-ordering-abortion-pill-us-market" target="_blank">ruling</a>.</p>
<p>The 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans, Louisiana, heard <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/three-judge-panel-us-appeals-court-hears-arguments-abortion-pill-case" target="_blank">oral arguments in the federal government’s appeal</a> of that ruling in May 2023 before issuing its decision a few months later in August.</p>
<p>That <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/abortion-pill-stay-market-until-us-supreme-court-ruling-after-appeals-court-order-0" target="_blank">three-judge panel said</a> mifepristone could stay on the market, but that when and how patients can access the drug should go back to what was in place before the FDA began making changes in 2016.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Telehealth and prescriptions</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>That would lower the maximum gestational age for using mifepristone from 10 weeks to seven weeks as well as remove the option for patients to get the prescription via telehealth and have it mailed to their homes.</p>
<p>Only doctors would be able to prescribe mifepristone, not health care professionals authorized to prescribe pharmaceuticals, like physician’s assistants or nurse practitioners.</p>
<p>Patents would have to go back to attending three, in-person doctor’s appointments in order to complete the process.</p>
<p>The dosage of mifepristone and the second pharmaceutical used in medication abortions, misoprostol, were different before the changes began to take effect.</p>
<p>The lower courts’ rulings never took effect and the appeals court’s ruling will remain on hold until the Supreme Court issues its opinion in the case, likely this summer.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Briefs filed</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Dozens of organizations, attorneys general and lawmakers have filed briefs with the Supreme Court seeking to inform the justices’ thinking in the case ahead of Tuesday’s oral arguments.</p>
<p>More than 15 major medical organizations, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association, sought to reinforce the FDA’s determination that mifepristone is safe and effective in their brief.</p>
<p>“Restricting access to mifepristone will not only jeopardize health, but worsen racial and economic inequities and deprive women of the choices that are at the very core of individual autonomy and wellbeing,” the medical organizations wrote.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="CnhXHuTOGQ"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/05/08/abortion-providers-sue-fda-over-abortion-pill-restrictions-in-virginia-montana-kansas/">Abortion providers sue FDA over abortion pill restrictions in Virginia, Montana, Kansas</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Abortion providers sue FDA over abortion pill restrictions in Virginia, Montana, Kansas&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/05/08/abortion-providers-sue-fda-over-abortion-pill-restrictions-in-virginia-montana-kansas/embed/#?secret=9FbAdDizul#?secret=CnhXHuTOGQ" data-secret="CnhXHuTOGQ" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p>They noted that “major adverse events occur in less than 0.32% of patients,” and that the “risk of death is almost non-existent.”</p>
<p>About 145 Members of Congress from 36 states urged the court to restrict access to mifepristone in a separate brief filed with the court.</p>
<p>“Since 2016, the FDA has only required adverse events reporting for deaths resulting from chemical abortion drugs; reporting is otherwise voluntary,” the members of Congress wrote, making the argument that reports are not required for injuries or impairment. “This action was not only arbitrary and capricious, but it also raised safety concerns for women seeking chemical abortion drugs.”</p>

<p>There were an estimated 1,026,690 abortions — the most in over a decade — performed in the formal health care system in 2023, according to a <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/2024/03/medication-abortion-accounted-63-all-us-abortions-2023-increase-53-2020" target="_blank">report</a> released Tuesday by the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive health research organization.</p>
<p>The data provides a quantitative look at abortion care the first full year after the U.S. Supreme Court’s Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization ruling in June 2022.</p>
<p>Medication abortions increased by 10% from 2020 to 2023. About 642,700 medication abortions were provided in the country last year, the data shows.</p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;U.S. Supreme Court schedules March 26 oral arguments in abortion pill access case &#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/01/29/u-s-supreme-court-schedules-march-26-oral-arguments-in-abortion-pill-access-case/embed/#?secret=koauhwZNVO#?secret=MVc3WfDTLS" data-secret="MVc3WfDTLS" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p>“Improved access to medication abortion is a positive development, but it is not a panacea,” said Rachel Jones, Guttmacher principal research scientist, in a news release. “As abortion restrictions proliferate post-Dobbs, medication abortion may be the most viable option — or the only option — for some people, even if they would have preferred in-person procedural care.”</p>
<p>The findings were published one week before the U.S. Supreme Court is set to hear arguments in a <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-supreme-court-schedules-march-26-oral-arguments-abortion-pill-access-case" target="_blank">pivotal lawsuit</a> that could severely limit access to medication abortion.</p>
<p>Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, an anti-abortion rights group, and other doctors who oppose abortion are asking the court to <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/who-wants-us-supreme-court-limit-abortion-pill-access-heres-list" target="_blank">restrict</a> access to mifepristone, one of two drugs used to terminate pregnancies. The Biden administration is urging the justices to <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/dozens-friend-court-briefs-backing-abortion-pill-access-arrive-supreme-court" target="_blank">maintain</a> the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s current regulations on mifepristone.</p>
<p>“As our latest data emphasize, more than three out of five abortion patients in the United States use medication abortion,” said Amy Friedrich-Karnik, Guttmacher’s director of federal policy.</p>
<p>“Reinstating outdated and medically unnecessary restrictions on the provision of mifepristone would negatively impact people’s lives and decrease abortion access across the country,” Friedrich-Karnik said.</p>

<p>Most states without near-total bans saw upticks in abortions.</p>
<p>Despite the patchwork of abortion laws in the nation — <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/see-data-reproductive-rights" target="_blank">14 states have near-total bans</a>, while Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Nebraska, the Carolinas and Utah restrict abortion after 18 weeks’ gestation or earlier — Americans terminated pregnancies at the highest number and rate seen in a decade, according to a <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/2024/03/despite-bans-number-abortions-united-states-increased-2023" target="_blank">policy analysis</a> by Isaac Maddow-Zimet, a data scientist, and Candace Gibson, director of state policy at Guttmacher.</p>
<p>The rate was 15.7 abortions per 1,000 women of reproductive age last year. Over 160,000 people traveled out of state in 2023 to seek abortion care, the report stated.</p>
<p>According to Maddow-Zimet and Gibson, several factors likely contributed to the increase in abortions last year, including the rise of telehealth, financial support from abortion funds and <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/2023/12/state-policy-trends-2023-first-full-year-roe-fell-tumultuous-year-abortion-and-other" target="_blank">shield laws</a> in 22 states and Washington, D.C., that protect providers and patients from out-of-state investigations or prosecutions concerning reproductive health.</p>
<p>“This increase in abortions does not diminish the impact of Dobbs on people’s lives,”  Maddow-Zimet and Gibson wrote. “Instead, the data provide important evidence that people will continue to seek abortion care in spite of the policy barriers that anti-abortion policymakers impose.”</p>
<p>States that share borders with states that enacted bans post-Dobbs saw a 37% increase in abortions between 2020 and 2023. Illinois had the highest total surge with 38,010 more abortions than in 2020, a 72% increase over three years. New Mexico (15,090 more abortions, 257% increase), Virginia (14,190 more abortions, 76% increase) and North Carolina (12,970 more abortions, 41% increase) followed suit.</p>
<p>The Guttmacher Institute classified the following states as border states in the current abortion policy landscape: Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Illinois, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, North Carolina, New Mexico, Ohio, South Carolina and Virginia.</p>
<p>Almost every state without a near-total ban saw increases in abortion. But Arizona, Georgia, Indiana and Wisconsin all saw declines. Arizona has a 15-week ban, Georgia has a six-week ban, while near-total bans were in effect in Indiana and Wisconsin at certain periods in 2023.</p>

Last Monday, the Democrats decided to play political hardball with an issue that is increasingly toxic to the GOP, especially in suburban districts: abortion. Conservative Republican Del. Tim Griffin from Bedford had introduced a bill would have denied public funding to clinics and hospitals that perform abortions, even if women had been victims of rape or incest, or their lives were endangered. And the Democrats pounced.</span></p>

House GOP forced to reject own member’s anti-abortion bill</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;‘A slap in the face’: Va. House GOP forced to reject own member’s anti-abortion bill&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/02/12/a-slap-in-the-face-va-house-gop-forced-to-reject-own-members-anti-abortion-bill/embed/#?secret=si5GsJZWWE#?secret=1uFGAkEOtr" data-secret="1uFGAkEOtr" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since Democrats are now in the majority in the Virginia legislature, they easily had the votes to kill the bill quietly in committee. But they had other plans in mind, and chose instead to utilize a rarely used parliamentary rule to force the measure directly to the House floor. They didn’t just want to embarrass the newly-elected patron, whose bill was so draconian in its prohibitions on abortion that it appeared to be a “messaging bill,” a measure typically introduced by a member to placate a base constituency even though it has little chance to pass. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More importantly, putting the bill on the floor would place Republicans in a dilemma. They could vote against the bill and draw a primary challenge from the right, or support the measure and have it used against them in the next general election. </span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Republicans created the rule</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans were incensed by this tactic, which they claimed to be unfair and inconsistent with the traditions of the oldest democratic body in the western world. What the public did not know, however, is that  Republicans were the source of the rule in the first place. Democratic protestations notwithstanding, the rule was adopted in 2008 and never rescinded during the next twelve years, when the GOP controlled the House.  And only Republicans had ever used the rule.  If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, Republicans should have been honored by the tactic. They were not.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The similarities between last week’s debate and the last time this rule was used are unmistakable. In 2008, Republicans forced</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?081+sum+HB852." target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">a bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> onto the floor that they defined as pro-union. They knew they could defeat the measure but wanted a floor vote to force Democrats to either reject their labor allies or, as former Republican Majority Leader Morgan Griffith proclaimed at the time,  “vote with the unions” and face the impacts at the polls. During floor debate, Republicans broke with the traditional deference accorded patrons to “strike” or remove the bill from consideration, arguing that once any measure is introduced, it is no longer  controlled by the patron but instead becomes the property of the entire House, which can then determine how best to handle it. Democrats valiantly fought the GOP tactics on the floor, but after receiving signals from organized labor that no retribution would come from opposing the measure, most ultimately voted “no” and Republicans never obtained their “pro-union” vote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, took the same position last week as his predecessor did fifteen years ago. He denied Del. Griffin’s motion to strike his bill. He ruled every motion made by the minority as “out of order.” This prompted Gilbert to attempt the unthinkable by challenging the ruling of the Chair.  He lost that vote too.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All that remained were the ironic warnings spoken by longtime </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Bobby Orrock, R-Caroline, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to “understand the consequences that may come home to roost for all the rest of us.”  And just as Republicans joined Democrats in defeating the 2008 proposal, the anti-abortion bill this year was dispatched as well. </span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Gotcha moments may be overrated</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each state legislative session has them – the moment when one party thinks they have the other party on the ropes and one single vote will make all the difference in the next election and whether they gain or lose the majority.  It almost never ends that way. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rarely does a state election turn on a vote on one bill, especially in today’s environment where all elections are increasingly nationalized. It is useful to draw contrasts and test the accountability of elected officials by having them vote on the significant issues of the day. And in Virginia, plenty of these contrasts will soon be drawn, as Democrats will send to the governor’s desk numerous bills on gun safety, minimum wage increases and reproductive rights that will likely prompt vetoes by Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin. But there are many instances where the only thing that survives so-called “gotcha moments” is the enmity that partisans feel toward each other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Democrats in 2008 and Republicans in 2024 both argued, some political actions are not easily forgotten, and today’s victory may easily become tomorrow’s defeat.</span></p>
