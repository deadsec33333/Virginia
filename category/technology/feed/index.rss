<p>Using a license plate number to find a suspect isn’t new to crime solving, but finding that license plate in an autonomously-captured and organized data log, rather than by humans looking through security footage or searching in-person, is more novel.</p>
<p>It’s part of a growing system of “Internet of Things” (IoT) technologies — networks of physical objects that are connected to the internet and can exchange data with other devices or software. These IoT devices are often called “smart cities” devices, because they’re used by states and cities that are aiming to improve services, including making their roads safer and more efficient for drivers and pedestrians.</p>
<p>People on the roads are likely used to red light and security cameras at intersections, but advancements in cloud technology and artificial intelligence allow transit agencies and cities to collect far more data than ever before, and to use that data in more strategic ways.</p>
<p>But with increased monitoring, data collection and analysis comes ethical and privacy concerns.</p>
<p>There’s never been a problem with checking a license plate to see if a car is stolen or otherwise wanted, said Jay Stanley, a senior policy analyst with the American Civil Liberties Union’s Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project said. But when that license plate data is retained for an unknown amount of time and for an undetermined purpose, it could infringe on privacy and civil liberties.</p>
<p>“As this technology becomes increasingly denser in our communities, and at a certain point you have like three of them on every block, it becomes the equivalent to tracking everybody by using GPS,” Stanley said. “That raises not only policy issues, but also constitutional issues.”</p>
<p>The residents of St. Helena, in Napa Valley, likely aren’t upset that the technology was used for its intended purpose to help find the perpetrator of a crime, Hari Balakrishnan, a computer science and AI researcher and professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said of the August arrest.</p>
<p>“I might posit that we should move from what is the data being collected to what is being done with the data?” he said. “By whom and for what purpose?”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What are smart cities technologies? </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>In recent years, cities have begun to use hardware, like cameras and sensors, that record and sort information into databases with the help of AI. They usually do so with a specific objective in mind, like tracking the safety of a pedestrian crosswalk, monitoring speeding in an area or to help traffic flow better through intersections during rush hour.</p>
<p>The hardware devices can signal to the city’s software to take action, like turn the light green, or record data in a stored area for people to analyze later on. Many of these interconnected  systems are called intelligent transportation systems (ITS), said Nathan Kautz, a senior transportation safety engineer based in Tampa, Florida. Some can even detect traffic accidents and trigger an EMS response, and then help that EMS vehicle get to the scene of an accident faster by greenlighting it through traffic signals.</p>
<p><a href="https://fdotwww.blob.core.windows.net/sitefinity/docs/default-source/safety/shsp-2021/shsp_mar21.pdf?sfvrsn=5452dad_0" target="_blank">Florida’s Strategic Highway Safety Plan from 2021 </a>identifies monitoring speed as a proven way to reduce traffic fatalities, and outlines that it will use ITS infrastructure as a countermeasure. The technical systems allow for monitoring without the use of police officers stationed throughout the roadways.</p>
<p>“It allows you to get coverage of that corridor and try to keep speeds at an appropriate level when nobody’s watching, to improve the safety and the survivability at outcomes for say, like for a pedestrian or bicyclist,” Kautz said.</p>
<p>Balakrishnan has been working in IoT and mobile computing for the last two decades, and founded Cambridge Mobile Telematics about 15 years ago. The Cambridge, Massachusetts-based company gathers data from IoT devices like smartphones, connected vehicles, dash cameras and third-party devices to detect driving behavior.</p>
<p>The company works with insurance and auto companies, as well as rideshare companies, to promote safe driving by using data obtained by driving behavior to assess risk, safety, claims, and driver improvement programs. Balakrishnan said the company estimates it helped prevent about 80,000 crashes and about 40,000 serious injuries.</p>
<p>Another form of technology some cities are using is LiDAR, which uses lasers to bounce light off of objects to measure distance. It’s the foundational technology of Ouster, which makes hardware and software, and works with cities on traffic concerns as well as with clients in the security, industrial and automotive industries. The traffic sensors are currently posted at about 250 intersections in California, Florida, Tennessee, Utah and Colorado.</p>
<p>The technology’s lasers bounce heat off objects, and reflect distance back to the sensor. It uses that data to create 3-D anonymous models of the people and vehicles at street level, the Bay Area company’s VP of Smart Infrastructure Itai Dadon said.</p>
<p>“You understand depth, you understand scale, you understand position in space. You don’t have to infer all that like we do with cameras,” he said. “And on top of that, you can do it without invading the privacy of either your employees or the community that you’re servicing.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Ethical and data privacy concerns </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>There are primarily two ways that IoT technologies work — infrastructure or mobile devices. And the factor of whether a user has control over the device is where privacy considerations come into play, Balakrishnan said.</p>
<p>Cambridge Mobile Telematics’ device, which users voluntarily place in their car and communicate with other IoT devices to track their driving, is an example of a mobile device. It’s similar to a wearable fitness tracker that collects data as you workout or sleep, Balakrishnan said.</p>
<p>“You’re using it for yourself. And I don’t think anyone reasonably would apply the word ‘surveillance’ to that,” Balakrishnan said. “If you don’t want it, don’t use it.”</p>
<p>But IoT devices embedded into infrastructure, like cameras or sensors on stop light poles, inductive loops under pavement that detect vehicles at stoplights, or automatic license plate readers, are not something that people opt into.</p>
<p>“If somebody puts a bunch of cameras on the road and they say that this is for measuring your speeding and sending tickets, okay, there’s warnings, and that’s the law, or that’s the way the rules are,” Balakrishnan said. “But now, if somebody took that data and used it for purposes that was not explicitly intended, then one could say, ‘hey, there’s some surveillance happening.’”</p>
<p>The use of these connected cameras and traffic monitoring systems are being applied across the country on a case-by-case basis. Some states, like Maine, <a href="https://codes.findlaw.com/me/title-29-a-motor-vehicles/me-rev-st-tit-29-a-sect-2117.html" target="_blank">prohibit traffic cameras</a> from enforcing traffic violations except on toll roads. Others, like Missouri, allow them by law, but the <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.gov/files/documents/missouri_ae2018_survey.pdf" target="_blank">state supreme court ruled it is unconstitutional </a>to issue traffic violations unless the state can prove the identity of the driver at the time of citation.</p>
<p>It often comes down to the county or municipality, since there is no federal legislation on data privacy in traffic enforcement.</p>
<p>“All cities and municipalities are very different and have slightly different problems, but they all want, at the end of the day … the benefits for the community,” Dadon said. “However, sometimes they lack the understanding of what the technology can actually do, and by wanting to do good, sometimes run a little bit fast.”</p>
<p>That was the case in San Diego, starting in 2016. The city installed 3,200 “smart streetlights” to deter crime and to log data from license plate readers, but citizens grew concerned with privacy, saying the city wouldn’t tell them how the data could be used, and it would be shared with third parties, <a href="https://www.cbs8.com/article/news/investigations/san-diego-police-looks-to-reinstall-cameras-and-license-plate-readers/509-c6f34079-b157-4b4b-bac1-97ba3d4908ef" target="_blank">CBS8 reported last year</a>.</p>
<p>The police department eventually began using the cameras as a crime-fighting surveillance tool, which led community members to allege that the program was violating their privacy and targeting people of color. The city ended the program shortly after also due to budget concerns, but it <a href="https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/100-smart-streetlight-cameras-installed-san-diego/3443549/" target="_blank">began installing cameras again in 2024</a>.</p>
<p>A perceived benefit of camera traffic surveillance is that fewer traffic stops or direct interactions with police officers could decrease the number of arrests made of people of color. But the technology hasn’t proven to eliminate racial factors. A <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/chicagos-race-neutral-traffic-cameras-ticket-black-and-latino-drivers-the-most" target="_blank">ProPublica investigation in 2022</a> found that traffic surveillance programs in New York, Miami, Washington D.C. and Chicago still ticketed people of color and people from lower-income neighborhoods more than white drivers.</p>
<p>And the systems can’t work toward the benefit of the community if they’re not being used properly. A woman in Detroit is <a href="https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2024/09/16/detroit-police-license-plate-readers-isoke-robinson-car-shooting/75189126007/" target="_blank">suing the police department</a> after she was wrongfully arrested for a drive-by shooting in 2023 where police incorrectly used data from the city’s automatic license plate reader.</p>
<p>Instead of searching for a reported license plate number in the system, police searched for any plates that belong to white Dodge Chargers, and found one on a camera two miles from the crime scene. The woman they arrested had been recorded driving just blocks from her home, and had no connection to the crime other than the similar make and model of her car.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">IoT and privacy legislation </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Because there’s no federal direction on data privacy of smart cities systems, it will continue to be up to cities, or even municipalities, to make their own rules, said Daniel Weitzner, the founding director of the Internet Policy Research Initiative at MIT.</p>
<p>Cities often work with private technology companies to establish these intelligent transportation systems, and have a <a href="https://smart-cities-marketplace.ec.europa.eu/news-and-events/news/2023/solution-booklet-public-procurement-smart-cities" target="_blank">procurement bid process</a>. It’s why Balakrishnan said cities or states looking to install these technologies have to clearly outline what data is being collected and who has access to it.</p>
<p>Balakrishnan and Dadon warn that cities looking to enter contracts with smart city systems companies have to ask the right questions about how and where their data is being stored. There have not been any major cases of data collected by these traffic cameras ending up in third-party systems, they say, but there’s always the possibility that it could if companies and their public sector counterparts are not following the same standards for data storage.</p>
<p>The way we assess surveillance and privacy in the digital age is “under stress,” Weitzner said. Evolving technologies have made lawmakers have to constantly assess what data privacy rights look like at any given time. Supreme Court decisions, like <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/17pdf/16-402_h315.pdf" target="_blank">Carpenter v. United States</a>, which refined what access to location data from cell phones is allowed without a search warrant, and <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/573/373/" target="_blank">Riley v. California</a>, which ruled that the warrantless search and seizure of the digital contents of a cell phone during an arrest is unconstitutional, shows how this field has evolved.</p>
<p>“What all this translates into is that digital information can be subject to a lot more uses and can be a lot more revealing than the kind of equivalent … analog information, or information that’s available on paper,” Weitzner said.</p>
<p>So, it may not be concerning to collect license plate data for speeding or traffic violations, but using that data across the board for any other purpose, for an unlimited amount of time, is a lot more sensitive, he added. And until Congress passes a standardization law for the industry, states will have to determine what works best for them, and what actions may be over the line.</p>
<p>“The underlying conundrum that we have is just that you can string together a lot of innocent, innocuous pieces of data,” Weitzner said. “And get something very valuable and very revealing.”</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TikTok and its parent company, ByteDance, sued the U.S. government over the law, saying it impeded their First Amendment rights, but a federal appeals court recently upheld the law. The high court will hear oral arguments in the appeal case Jan. 10.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Allowing TikTok to operate in the United States without severing its ties to the Chinese Communist Party exposes Americans to the undeniable risks of having their data accessed and exploited by the Chinese Communist Party,” Miyares, a Republican, said in a statement announcing the amicus brief. “The Supreme Court now has the chance to affirm Congress’s authority to protect Americans from foreign threats while ensuring that the First Amendment doesn’t become a tool to defend foreign adversaries’ exploitative practices.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/7521/text?s=1&amp;r=1&amp;q=%7B%22search%22%3A%22Protecting+Americans+from+Foreign+Adversary+Controlled+Applications+Act%22%7D" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was introduced in March, members of Virginia’s congressional delegation supported it. Democratic U.S. Reps. Abigail Spanberger and Bobby Scott said the measure would protect Americans against foreign digital threats, while U.S. Sens. Mark Warner, D-Virginia, and Marco Rubio, R-Florida, who co-chair the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, supported the House’s action against TikTok. </span></p>

(Photo by Rebecca Noble/Getty Images)</p><p>As he’s poised to leave office next month, President Joe Biden will leave a legacy of “proactive,” “nuanced” and “effective” tech policy strategy behind him, technologists across different sectors told States Newsroom.</p>
<p>Biden’s term was bookended by major issues in the tech world. When he took office in early 2021, he was faced with an economy and workforce that was struggling to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic, and longstanding issues with a digital divide across the country. As he prepares to exit the White House, federal agencies are working to incorporate the principles from the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/ai-bill-of-rights/" target="_blank">2023 AI Bill of Rights</a>, on evolving technologies that will undoubtedly continue changing American life.</p>
<p>Though he was unable to get federal regulations on AI passed through Congress, Biden’s goal was to bring tech access to all Americans, while safeguarding against potential harms, the technologists said.</p>
<p>“I think everything that he does is foundational,” said Suriel Arellano, a longtime consultant and author on digital transformation who’s based in Los Angeles. “So it definitely sets the stage for long term innovation and regulation.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The digital divide</h4>

	
<p>For Arellano, Biden’s attempt to bring internet access to all families stands out as a lasting piece of the president’s legacy. Broadband internet for work, healthcare and education was a part of Biden’s<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/11/06/fact-sheet-the-bipartisan-infrastructure-deal/" target="_blank"> 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal</a>, especially targeting people in rural areas.</p>
<p>Biden earmarked $65 billion toward the project, which was dolled out to states and federal departments to establish or improve the physical infrastructure to support internet access. <a href="https://www.commerce.gov/news/blog/2024/09/biden-harris-administration-delivering-promise-connect-everyone-america-reliable" target="_blank">As of September</a>, more than 2.4 million previously unserved homes and businesses have been connected to the internet, and $50 billion has been given to grant programs that support these goals across the states.</p>
<p>Arellano said he thinks there’s still work to do with the physical broadband infrastructure before that promise is realized — “I think that should have come first,” he said.</p>
<p>“But I think as a legacy, I think breaching the digital divide is actually one of the strong — maybe not the strongest, but I would say it’s definitely a strong legacy that he leaves,” Arellano said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Shaping the U.S. conversation about AI</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>During Biden’s presidency, practical and responsible application of artificial intelligence became a major part of the tech conversation. The 2023 AI Bill of Rights created the White House AI Council, the creation of a framework for federal agencies to follow relating to privacy protection and a list of guidelines for securing AI workers, for navigating the effects on the labor market and for ensuring equity in AI use, among others.</p>
<p>The guidelines put forth by the administration are subtle, and “not likely to be felt by the average consumer,” said Austin-based Alex Shahrestani, an attorney and managing partner at Promise Legal, which specializes in tech and regulatory policy.</p>
<p>“It was something that’s very light touch and essentially sets up the groundwork to introduce a regulatory framework for AI providers without it being something that they’re really going to push back on,” Shahrestani said.</p>
<p>In recent months, some federal agencies have released their guidelines called for by the AI Bill of Rights, including <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/department-labor-releases-ai-best-practices-employers" target="_blank">the Department of Labor</a>, and <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/briefing-room/2024/10/03/fact-sheet-omb-issues-guidance-to-advance-the-responsible-acquisition-of-ai-in-government/" target="_blank">The Office of Management and Budget</a>, which outlines how the government will go about “responsible acquisition” of AI. It may not seem like these guidelines would affect the average consumer, Shahrestani said, but government contractors are likely to be larger companies that already have a significant commercial footprint.</p>
<p>“It sets up these companies to then follow these procedures in other contexts, so whether that’s B2B or direct-to-consumer applications, that’s like more of a trickle down sort of approach,” he said.</p>
<p>Sheena Franklin, D.C.-based founder of K’ept Health and previously a lobbyist, said Biden emphasized the ethical use and development of AI, and set a tone of fostering public trust and preventing harm with the AI Bill of Rights.</p>
<p>Franklin and Shahrestani agreed it’s possible that President-elect Donald Trump could repeal some of Biden’s executive orders on AI, but they see the Bill of Rights as a fairly light approach to regulating it.</p>
<p>“It was a really nuanced and effective approach,” Shahrestani said. “There’s some inertia building, right? Like a snowball rolling down the hill. We’re early days for the snowball, but it just got started and it will only grow to be a bigger one.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The CHIPS act</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Biden’s <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/08/09/fact-sheet-chips-and-science-act-will-lower-costs-create-jobs-strengthen-supply-chains-and-counter-china/" target="_blank">CHIPS and Science Act of 2022</a>, which aimed to strengthen domestic semiconductor manufacturing, supply chains and the innovation economy with a $53 billion investment, is a major piece of his legacy, Franklin said. The bill centered on worker and community investments, and prioritized small businesses and underrepresented communities, with a goal of economic growth in the U.S., and especially in communities that needed support.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/08/09/fact-sheet-two-years-after-the-chips-and-science-act-biden-%E2%81%A0harris-administration-celebrates-historic-achievements-in-bringing-semiconductor-supply-chains-home-creating-jobs-supporting-inn/" target="_blank">Two years after the bill was signed</a>, the federal government, in partnership with American companies, has provided funding for semiconductor manufacturing projects that created more than 100,000 jobs and workforce development programs. The U.S. is on track to produce 30% of the world’s semiconductor chips in 2032, up from 10% today.</p>
<p>“He was really trying to position the U.S. as a global leader when it came to technology, because that industry is going to continue to grow,” Franklin said.</p>
<p>It’s hard to quantify what the lasting impact of the CHIPS act will be, but one immediate factor is computing, Shahrestani said. The AI models being developed right now have infinite abilities, he said, but the computing power had previously held the industry back.</p>
<p>“Being able to provide more compute through better chips, and more sophisticated hardware is going to be a big part of what provides, and what is behind the best AI technologies,” Shahrestani said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Accountability for Big Tech</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Many in the Big Tech community see Biden’s AI Bill of Rights, and its data privacy inclusions, as well as the Justice Department’s monopoly lawsuits against tech giants <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-sues-apple-monopolizing-smartphone-markets" target="_blank">like Apple</a> and <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-sues-google-monopolizing-digital-advertising-technologies" target="_blank">Google</a>, as hampering innovation.</p>
<p>Arellano is optimistic about the technological advances and innovation that the U.S. may see under a less regulation-focused Trump presidency, but he cautions that some regulations may be needed for privacy protections.</p>
<p>“My concern is always on the public side, you know, putting the dog on a leash, and making sure that our regulations are there in place to protect the people,” he said.</p>
<p>Franklin predicts that if Biden attempts any last-minute tech policy before he leaves office, it will probably be to pursue further antitrust cases. It would align with his goal of fostering competition between startups and small businesses and reinforce his legacy of safeguarding consumer interests, she said.</p>
<p>When she considered how to describe Biden’s tech legacy, Franklin said she nearly used the word “strength,” though she said he ultimately could have done a little bit more for tech regulation. But she landed on two words: “thoughtful and proactive.”</p>
<p>“Meaning, he’s thinking about everybody’s concerns,” Franklin said. “Not just thinking about the Big Tech and not just thinking about the consumers, right? Like there has to be a balance there.”</p>

(Courtesy of Google) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares has joined the U.S. Department of Justice and a coalition of 38 state attorneys general in proposing sweeping remedies to dismantle Google’s unlawful monopoly over internet search engines and restore competition in the digital marketplace.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The push follows </span><a href="https://www.oag.state.va.us/media-center/news-releases/2807-november-21-2024-virginia-justice-department-seek-limits-to-google-business-practices-to-end-search-engine-monopoly" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a landmark ruling</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in August 2024 by a federal district court in Washington, D.C., which found that Google violated federal antitrust laws by maintaining a monopoly in online search and search advertising through anticompetitive practices. The court’s decision marked a significant win in the ongoing efforts to curb Big Tech dominance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The remedies proposed are reasonable, measured steps to restore competition and protect consumers,” Miyares said in a statement Thursday. “Virginia is proud to help produce a balanced resolution that benefits consumers and competitors alike.”</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_30211" class="wp-caption alignright" style="max-width:100%;width:300px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/ga-2022-4-3/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-30211" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/GA-2022-4-3-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/GA-2022-4-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/GA-2022-4-3-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/GA-2022-4-3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/GA-2022-4-3.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Attorney General Jason Miyares (Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia initially joined the fight against Google in December 2020, alleging in a lawsuit that the tech giant used illegal contracts and other conduct to suppress competition and secure its monopoly power. That case complemented a similar federal antitrust lawsuit filed by the Justice Department in October of that year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A multi-day hearing to consider the proposed remedies is scheduled for April 22, 2025, and is expected to conclude by May 2, 2025, according to a news release by the attorney general’s oOffice.The outcome of this case will likely have far-reaching implications for competition in the tech industry and consumer choice in digital services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kent Walker, Google’s chief legal officer, sharply criticized the Justice Department’s latest move, accusing the agency of pushing “a radical interventionist agenda” that would harm Americans and America’s global technology leadership. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“DOJ’s wildly overbroad proposal goes miles beyond the court’s decision. It would break a range of Google products — even beyond Search — that people love and find helpful in their everyday lives,” Walker wrote </span><a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/doj-search-remedies-nov-2024/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in a blog post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Thursday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://oag.dc.gov/sites/default/files/2024-11/2024.11.20%20Google%20Plaintiffs%20Initial%20PFJ%20%281%29.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">proposed final judgment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or PFJ, filed with the courts seeks to dismantle Google’s dominance by prohibiting its lucrative search distribution contracts and revenue-sharing agreements. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the legal challenge proves successful, Google would no longer be allowed to pay manufacturers, device makers, or browsers to make Google Search the default search engine. Additionally, the company would be required to share data and information obtained through its monopoly with competitors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The PFJ also calls for Google to divest Chrome, its popular browser that accounts for a substantial share of the portal’s search traffic and powers its targeted advertising to users. Furthermore, the judgment opens the door to additional divestitures, including Google’s Android operating system, if the company fails to comply with remedies or if the proposed measures prove ineffective.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The judgment further prohibits Google from leveraging its ownership of Android to stifle competition. The company specifically would be barred from mandating the use of Google Search or Google AI on Android devices, degrading the performance of rival services, or using its control over distributors to favor its products.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a measure proposed solely by the states, Google would also be required to fund a public education campaign to inform consumers about the company’s anticompetitive practices, the resulting legal action, and the alternatives available to them for search engines and digital tools.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The order establishes a five-member technical committee tasked with overseeing the implementation, monitoring and enforcement of these remedies over a ten-year period.</span></p>

(Courtesy of SDI Productions via Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Glenn Youngkin announced </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/governor-of-virginia/pdf/eo/EO-43---FINAL.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Executive Order 43 </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Thursday, which enacted a multi-pronged effort to address the impact of social media use on children’s mental health. The order established the Reclaiming Childhood Task Force to counter “addictive” social media use in youth and “create opportunities for cultural change.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The directive came months after the governor issued an executive order requiring the Department of Education to draft guidelines for cell phone-free schools. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest order will mobilize state agencies to provide resources for parents, educators and healthcare providers to “combat the negative effects of excessive social media use.” It will also spur the agencies to create a toolkit with training materials and educational resources that will “offer educational and technical support” for health care providers and families to promote healthy social media use. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The scope of this challenge is going to require all of us, private sector, non-profit organizations and (the) government to support parents as they work to improve their children’s mental health,” Youngkin said in a release. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The task force will convene parents, youth, teachers, mental health experts, faith leaders, public safety officials and private sector technology experts to compile recommendations to share with Youngkin and members of the General Assembly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Secretary of Health and Human Resources Janet Kelly noted the “addictive” nature of social media algorithms. The order cites Pew Research Center data showing 95% of U.S. teens use social media, and Gallup studies showing that youth use social media frequently and that 41% of high-frequency social media users report having “poor or very poor mental health,” with the percentage higher for teens who use it with low parental monitoring.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Reclaiming Childhood Task Force will drive collaboration and innovation to address this mental health crisis and ensure our children grow up with the tools they need to thrive,” Kelly wrote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the cell phone-free guidelines for schools were being developed this past summer, academics noted the adjustment period they would require for students who have grown accustomed to frequent cell phone and social media use. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">David Naff, a Virginia Commonwealth University professor with a concentration in educational psychology, said in an interview at the time that he hoped the policy would help youth become more intentional about when they use their devices outside of school hours.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s human nature to crave social interaction, Naff said, “whether we realize it or not” and  social media interactions are less personal than face-to-face interactions. He also noted how research points to increased device use and social media access contributes to anxiety and other mental health issues in today’s younger generations  — research also cited in Yougnkin’s order. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naff also noted still-emerging research on the effect the COVID-19 pandemic had on kids. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the virus first plagued the globe roughly four years ago and triggered  shutdowns of public life, education  pivoted to virtual learning for a time. This meant youth were on screens more than ever before while missing out on the personal interactions of in-person learning. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s kind of hard to distinguish the COVID mental health impacts from the cell phone use mental health impacts, because they&#8217;re overlapping. When schools were closed, our world just moved online,” Naff said. “So then, adolescents are using devices and social media more frequently at that point. Someone could argue that the mental health impacts were related to COVID — which they were —  but you could also say ‘maybe at least a portion of the mental health impacts were that we&#8217;re just on our devices constantly, like to the point of addiction.’”</span></p>

<p>Technologists and election academics <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/ai-will-play-role-election-misinformation-experts-are-trying-fight-back" target="_blank">warned a few months ago</a> that mis- and disinformation would play an even larger role in 2024 than it did in 2020 and 2016. What exactly that disinformation would look like became more clear in the two weeks leading up to the election, said Tim Harper, senior policy analyst for democracy and elections at the Center for Democracy and Technology.</p>
<p>“I think a lot of folks kind of maybe prematurely claimed that generative AI’s impact was overblown,” Harper said. “And then, you know, in short order, in the last week, we saw several kinds of disinformation campaigns emerge.”</p>
<p>Harper specifically mentioned the false claims that vice presidential nominee Tim Walz was alleged to have perpetrated <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/23/tim-walz-russia-disinformation" target="_blank">an act of sexual misconduct</a>, and a deep fake <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/viral-video-ripped-pennsylvania-ballots-fake-russian-made-intelligence-rcna177404" target="_blank">video of election officials ripping up ballots</a>, both of which have been shown to be Russian misinformation campaigns.</p>
<p>AI also played a role in attempted voter suppression, Harper said, not just by foreign governments, but by domestic parties as well. EagleAI, a database that scrapes public voter data, was being used by a 2,000-person North Carolina group which <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/eagleai-network-suspicious-voter-lists-north-carolina/" target="_blank">aimed to challenge the ballots</a> of “suspicious voters.”</p>
<p>Emails<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/eagleai-network-suspicious-voter-lists-north-carolina/" target="_blank"> obtained by Wired last month </a>show that voters the group aimed to challenge include “same-day registrants, US service members overseas, or people with homestead exemptions, a home tax exemption for vulnerable individuals, such as elderly or disabled people, in cases where there are anomalies with their registration or address.”</p>
<p>The group also aimed to target people who voted from a college dorm, people who registered using a PO Box address and people with “inactive” voter status.</p>
<p>Another shift Harper noted from the 2020 election was a rollback of enforcement of misinformation policies on social media platforms. Many platforms feared being seen as “influencing the election” if they flagged or challenged misinformation content.</p>
<p>Last year, Facebook and Instagram’s parent company Meta, as well as X <a href="https://www.cnn.com/business/tech/meta-political-ads-2020-election-lies/index.html" target="_blank">began allowing political advertisements</a> that perpetuated election denial of the 2020 election.</p>
<p>Youtube <a href="https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/us-election-misinformation-update-2023/" target="_blank">also changed its policy to allow election misinformation</a>, saying “In the current environment, we find that while removing this content does curb some misinformation, it could also have the unintended effect of curtailing political speech without meaningfully reducing the risk of violence or other real-world harm.”</p>
<p>But there are real-world risks for rampant misinformation, Harper said. Federal investigative agencies have made clear that misinformation narratives that delegitimize past elections <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10106894/" target="_blank">directly contribute</a> to higher risk of political violence.</p>
<p>Platforms with less-well-established trust and safety teams, such Discord and Twitch also play a role. They experienced their “first rodeo” of mass disinformation this election cycle, Harper said.</p>
<p>“They were tested, and I think we’re still evaluating how they did at preventing this content,” he said.</p>
<p>Podcasters and social influencers also increasingly shaped political opinions of their followers this year, often under murky ethical guidelines. Influencers do not follow ethical guidelines and rules for sharing information like journalists do, but Americans <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/journalism/fact-sheet/social-media-and-news-fact-sheet/" target="_blank">have increasingly relied on social media</a> for their news.</p>
<p>There’s also a lack of transparency <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91218544/like-seriously-go-vote-influencers-are-getting-paid-to-court-your-vote" target="_blank">between influencers and the political campaigns and candidates </a>they’re speaking about — some have reportedly taken under-the-table payments by campaigns, or have made sponsored content for their followers without disclosing the agreement to viewers.</p>
<p>The Federal Election Commission decided late last year that while campaigns have to disclose spending to an influencer, <a href="https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/Reg-2013-01-TechMod-Final-Statement-ELW-and-SMB.pdf" target="_blank">influencers do not have to disclose such payments to their audience</a>.</p>
<p>“In terms of kind of the balkanization of the internet, of the information environment, … I think this election cycle may end up being seen kind of as ‘the influencer election,’” Harper said.</p>

(Photo by Tierney L. Cross/Getty Images)</p><p>The U.S. Department of Labor released a list of artificial intelligence best practices for developers and employers this week, aiming to help employers benefit from potential time and cost savings of AI, while protecting workers from discrimination and job displacement.</p>
<p>The voluntary guidelines come about a year after President Joe Biden signed <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/10/30/executive-order-on-the-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-development-and-use-of-artificial-intelligence/" target="_blank">an executive order</a> to assess the innovative potential and risks of AI across government and private sectors. The order directed the creation of the White House AI Council, the creation of a framework for federal agencies to follow relating to privacy protection and a list of guidelines for securing AI talent, for navigating the effects on the labor market and for ensuring equity in AI use, among others.</p>
<p>“Harnessing AI for good and realizing its myriad benefits requires mitigating its substantial risks,” Biden said of the executive order last year. “This endeavor demands a society-wide effort that includes government, the private sector, academia and civil society.”</p>
<p>The DOL’s guide, “<a href="https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/general/ai/AI-Principles-Best-Practices.pdf" target="_blank">Artificial Intelligence and Worker Well-being: Principles and Best Practices for Developers and Employers</a>” was developed with input from public listening sessions and from workers, unions, researchers, academics, employers and developers. It aims to mitigate risks of discrimination, data breaches and job replacement by AI, while embracing possible innovation and production.</p>
<p>“Whether AI in the workplace creates harm for workers and deepens inequality or supports workers and unleashes expansive opportunity depends (in large part) on the decisions we make,” DOL Acting Secretary Julie Su said. “The stakes are high.”</p>
<p>The report shares eight principles and best practices, with a “north star” of centering workers. The guide says workers, especially from underserved communities, should understand and have input in the design, development, testing, training, use and oversight of the AI systems used in their workplaces. This will improve job quality and allow businesses to deliver on their outcomes. Unions should bargain in good faith on the use of AI and electronic monitoring in the workplace, it said.</p>
<p>Other best practices include ethically developing AI, with training that protects and takes feedback from workers. Organizations should also have a clear governance system to evaluate AI used in the workplace, and they should be transparent about the AI systems they’re using, the DOL said.</p>
<p>AI systems cannot violate or undermine workers’ rights to organize, or obstruct their health, safety, wage, anti-discrimination and anti-retaliation protections, the department said. Therefore, prior to deployment, employers should audit their AI systems for potential <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/ai-takes-helm-decision-making-signs-perpetuating-historic-biases-emerge" target="_blank">impacts of discrimination</a> on the basis of “race, color, national origin, religion, sex, disability, age, genetic information and other protected bases,” and should make those results public.</p>
<p>The report also outlines how employers can and should help workers with AI. Before implementing an AI tool, employers should consider the impact it will have on job opportunities, and they should be clear about the specific tasks it will perform. Employers that experience productivity gains or increased profits, should consider sharing the benefits with their workers, like through increased wages, improved benefits or training, the DOL said.</p>
<p>The implementation of AI systems has the potential to displace workers, Su said in her summary. To mitigate this, employers should appropriately train their employees to use these systems, and reallocate workers who are displaced by AI to other jobs within their organization when feasible. Employers should reach out to state and local workforce programs for education and upskilling so their workforce can learn new skills, not be phased out by technology.</p>
<p>And lastly, employers using AI that collect workers’ data should safeguard that data, should not collect more data than is absolutely necessary and should not share that data outside the business without workers’ freely given consent.</p>
<p>The guidelines outlined by the DOL are not meant to be “a substitute for existing or future federal or state laws and regulations,” it said, rather a “guiding framework for businesses” that can be customized with feedback from their workers.</p>
<p>“We should think of AI as a potentially powerful technology for worker well-being, and we should harness our collective human talents to design and use AI with workers as its beneficiaries, not as obstacles to innovation,” Su said.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, Jodi Kuhn, an expert in data analytics and ethics from Richmond, was selected as the Joint Commission on Technology and Science’s executive director, the first since its </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title30/chapter11/section30-85/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">establishment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 1997. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kuhn, who served as the director of data quality and visualization for the Virginia Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">said she hopes to use her experience in the private sector and 15 years in the executive branch to enable “responsible innovation by providing objective, non-partisan research to our legislatures.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She said she’s already received support from universities in and beyond the commonwealth, including Virginia Tech and the Wharton School at UPenn, that includes consultation and reports around Blockchain technologies, a method for recording information, and is forthcoming for the commission. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the last session, the Virginia legislature </span><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=HB1199" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">authorized</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the commission to appoint an executive director to support the group of lawmakers from both the House and Senate. Staff from legislative services split their regular duties by supporting the commission.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Cliff Hayes, D-Chesapeake, commission chair, said legislators face several challenges in dealing with complex technology issues and, in most cases, have limited expertise. With the help of Kuhn, Hayes said he hopes to have thorough research and recommendations when reviewing technology legislation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;re not in the business of passing ideas. We are literally passing laws that the commonwealth&#8217;s citizens and businesses are going to have to follow, so that in itself, begs us to do our due diligence the way that we should before we actually pass law,”  Hayes said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hayes thanked previous legislators and staff for laying the groundwork for hiring a dedicated staff and the successes thus far.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kuhn said the commission will continue reviewing over a dozen bills from the last legislative session that range from blockchain technology, to artificial technology, to online and data protections. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The depth and breath of bills that came to JCOTS demonstrate that our legislature is clearly ready to dive deeper into these topics. Having full-time, dedicated staff, Virginia is now poised to be at the forefront of leveraging advances in science and technology in a manner that keeps our citizens, and especially our children, safe.”</span></p>

<p>With 6,000 sample loan applications based on data from the 2022 Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the chatbots recommended denials for more Black applicants than identical white counterparts. They also recommended Black applicants be given higher interest rates, and labeled Black and Hispanic borrowers as “riskier.”</p>
<p>White applicants were 8.5% more likely to be approved than Black applicants with the same financial profile. And applicants with “low” credit scores of 640, saw a wider margin — white applicants were approved 95% of the time, while Black applicants were approved less than 80% of the time.</p>
<p>The experiment aimed to simulate how financial institutions are using AI algorithms, machine learning and large language models to speed up processes like lending and underwriting of loans and mortgages. These “black box” systems, where the algorithm’s inner workings aren’t transparent to users, have the potential to lower operating costs for financial firms and any other industry employing them, said Donald Bowen, an assistant fintech professor at Lehigh and one of the authors of the study.</p>
<p>But there’s also large potential for flawed training data, programming errors, and historically biased information to affect the outcomes, sometimes in detrimental, life-changing ways.</p>
<p>“There’s a potential for these systems to know a lot about the people they’re interacting with,” Bowen said. “If there’s a baked-in bias, that could propagate across a bunch of different interactions between customers and a bank.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">How does AI discriminate in finance?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Decision-making AI tools and large language models, like the ones in the Lehigh University experiment, are being used across a variety of industries, like healthcare, education, finance and even in the judicial system.</p>
<p>Most machine learning algorithms follow what’s called classification models, meaning you formally define a problem or a question, and then you feed the algorithm a set of inputs such as a loan applicant’s age, income, education and credit history, Michael Wellman, a computer science professor at the University of Michigan, explained.</p>
<p>The algorithm spits out a result — approved or not approved. More complex algorithms can assess these factors and deliver more nuanced answers, like a loan approval with a recommended interest rate.</p>

<p>Machine learning advances in recent years have allowed for what’s called deep learning, or construction of big neural networks that can learn from large amounts of data. But if AI’s builders don’t keep objectivity in mind, or rely on data sets that reflect deep-rooted and systemic racism, results will reflect that.</p>
<p>“If it turns out that you are systematically more often making decisions to deny credit to certain groups of people more than you make those wrong decisions about others, that would be a time that there’s a problem with the algorithm,” Wellman said. “And especially when those groups are groups that are historically disadvantaged.”</p>
<p>Bowen was initially inspired to pursue the Lehigh University study after a smaller-scale assignment with his students revealed the racial discrimination by the chatbots.</p>
<p>“We wanted to understand if these models are biased, and if they’re biased in settings where they’re not supposed to be,” Bowen said, since underwriting is a regulated industry that’s not allowed to consider race in decision-making.</p>
<p>For the official study, Bowen and a research team ran thousands of loan application numbers over several months through different commercial large language models, including OpenAI’s GPT 3.5 Turbo and GPT 4, Anthropic’s Claude 3 Sonnet and Opus and Meta’s Llama 3-8B and 3-70B.</p>
<p>In one experiment, they included race information on applications and saw the discrepancies in loan approvals and mortgage rates. In other, they instructed the chatbots to “use no bias in making these decisions.” That experiment saw virtually no discrepancies between loan applicants.</p>
<p>But if race data isn’t collected in modern day lending, and algorithms used by banks are instructed to not consider race, how do people of color end up getting denied more often, or offered worse interest rates? Because much of our modern-day data is influenced by disparate impact, or the influence of systemic racism, Bowen said.</p>
<p>Though a computer wasn’t given the race of an applicant, a borrower’s credit score, which can be influenced by discrimination in the labor and housing markets, will have an impact on their application. So might their zip code, or the credit scores of other members of their household, all of which could have been influenced by the historic racist practice of redlining, or restricting lending to people in poor and nonwhite neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Machine learning algorithms aren’t always calculating their conclusions in the way that humans might imagine, Bowen said. The patterns it is learning apply to a variety of scenarios, so it may even be digesting reports about discrimination, for example learning that Black people have historically had worse credit. Therefore, the computer might see signs that a borrower is Black, and deny their loan or offer them a higher interest rate than a white counterpart.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Other opportunities for discrimination </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Decision making technologies have become ubiquitous in hiring practices over the last several years, as application platforms and internal systems use AI to filter through applications, and pre-screen candidates for hiring managers. Last year, New York City began requiring employers to <a href="https://www.hrdive.com/news/nyc-ai-in-hiring-law-enforcement-begins-july-5/647373/" target="_blank">notify candidates</a> about their use of AI decision-making software.</p>
<p>By law, the AI tools should be programmed to have no opinion on protected classes like gender, race or age, but some users allege that they’ve been discriminated against by the algorithms anyway. In 2021, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission launched an initiative to examine more closely how new and existing technologies change the way employment decisions are made. Last year, the commission settled its first-ever AI discrimination hiring lawsuit.</p>
<p>The New York federal court case ended <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/newsroom/itutorgroup-pay-365000-settle-eeoc-discriminatory-hiring-suit" target="_blank">in a $365,000 settlement</a> when tutoring company iTutorGroup Inc. was alleged to use an AI-powered hiring tool that rejected women applicants over 55 and men over 60. Two hundred applicants received the settlement, and iTutor agreed to adopt anti-discrimination policies and conduct training to ensure compliance with equal employment opportunity laws, <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/daily-labor-report/eeoc-settles-first-of-its-kind-ai-bias-lawsuit-for-365-000" target="_blank">Bloomberg reported</a> at the time.</p>
<p>Another anti-discrimination lawsuit is pending in California federal court against AI-powered company Workday. Plaintiff Derek Mobley alleges he was passed over for more than 100 jobs that contract with the software<a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/workday-must-face-novel-bias-lawsuit-over-ai-screening-software-2024-07-15/" target="_blank"> company because he is Black, older than 40 and has mental health issues, </a>Reuters reported this summer. The suit claims that Workday uses data on a company’s existing workforce to train its software, and the practice doesn’t account for the discrimination that may reflect in future hiring.</p>
<p>U.S. judicial and court systems have also begun incorporating decision-making algorithms in a handful of operations, like risk assessment analysis of defendants, determinations about pretrial release, diversion, sentencing and probation or parole.</p>
<p>Though the technologies have been cited in <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/01/ai-is-making-its-way-into-the-courtroom-and-legal-process.html" target="_blank">speeding up</a> some of the traditionally lengthy court processes — like for document review and assistance with small claims court filings — experts caution that the technologies are not ready to be the primary or sole evidence in a “consequential outcome.”</p>
<p>“We worry more about its use in cases where AI systems are subject to pervasive and systemic racial and other biases, e.g., predictive policing, facial recognition, and criminal risk/recidivism assessment,” the co-authors of a paper in <a href="https://judicature.duke.edu/articles/ai-in-the-courts-how-worried-should-we-be/#:~:text=AI's%20uses%20in%20the%20justice,actually%20helping%20to%20decide%20cases." target="_blank">Judicature’s 2024 edition</a> say.</p>
<p>Utah passed a law earlier this year to combat exactly that. <a href="https://custom.statenet.com/public/resources.cgi?mode=show_text&amp;id=ID:bill:UT2024000H366&amp;verid=UT2024000H366_20240313_0_E&amp;" target="_blank">HB 366</a>, sponsored by state Rep. Karianne Lisonbee, R-Syracuse, addresses the use of an algorithm or a risk assessment tool score in determinations about pretrial release, diversion, sentencing, probation and parole, saying that these technologies may not be used without human intervention and review.</p>
<p>Lisonbee told States Newsroom that by design, the technologies provide a limited amount of information to a judge or decision-making officer.</p>
<p>“We think it’s important that judges and other decision-makers consider all the relevant information about a defendant in order to make the most appropriate decision regarding sentencing, diversion, or the conditions of their release,” Lisonbee said.</p>
<p>She also brought up concerns about bias, saying the state’s lawmakers don’t currently have full confidence in the “objectivity and reliability” of these tools. They also aren’t sure of the tools’ data privacy settings, which is a priority to Utah residents. These issues combined could put citizens’ trust in the criminal justice system at risk, she said.</p>
<p>“When evaluating the use of algorithms and risk assessment tools in criminal justice and other settings, it’s important to include strong data integrity and privacy protections, especially for any personal data that is shared with external parties for research or quality control purposes,” Lisonbee said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Preventing discriminatory AI</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Some legislators, like Lisonbee, have taken note of these issues of bias, and potential for discrimination. Four states currently have laws aiming to prevent “algorithmic discrimination,” where an AI system can contribute to different treatment of people based on race, ethnicity, sex, religion or disability, among other things. This includes Utah, as well as California (<a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billStatusClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200SB36" target="_blank">SB 36</a>), Colorado (<a href="https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/sb21-169" target="_blank">SB 21-169</a>), Illinois (<a href="https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/BillStatus.asp?DocNum=53&amp;GAID=16&amp;DocTypeID=HB&amp;LegId=127865&amp;SessionID=110&amp;GA=102" target="_blank">HB 0053</a>).</p>
<p>Though it’s not specific to discrimination, Congress introduced a bill in late 2023 to amend the Financial Stability Act of 2010 to include federal guidance for the financial industry on the uses of AI. This bill, the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/3554/text" target="_blank">Financial Artificial Intelligence Risk Reduction Act</a> or the “FAIRR Act,” would require the Financial Stability Oversight Council to coordinate with agencies regarding threats to the financial system posed by artificial intelligence, and may regulate how financial institutions can rely on AI.</p>
<p>Lehigh’s Bowen made it clear he felt there was no going back on these technologies, especially as companies and industries realize their cost-saving potential.</p>
<p>“These are going to be used by firms,” he said. “So how can they do this in a fair way?”</p>
<p>Bowen hopes his study can help inform financial and other institutions in deployment of decision-making AI tools. For their experiment, the researchers wrote that it was as simple as using prompt engineering to instruct the chatbots to “make unbiased decisions.” They suggest firms that integrate large language models into their processes do regular audits for bias to refine their tools.</p>
<p>Bowen and other researchers on the topic stress that more human involvement is needed to use these systems fairly. Though AI can deliver a decision on a court sentencing, mortgage loan, job application, healthcare diagnosis or customer service inquiry, it doesn’t mean they should be operating unchecked.</p>
<p>University of Michigan’s Wellman told States Newsroom he’s looking for government regulation on these tools, and pointed to <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/6936/text#:~:text=Introduced%20in%20House%20(01%2F10%2F2024)&amp;text=To%20require%20Federal%20agencies%20to,the%20use%20of%20artificial%20intelligence." target="_blank">H.R. 6936</a>, a bill pending in Congress which would require federal agencies to adopt the Artificial Intelligence Risk Management Framework developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology. The<a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ai/NIST.AI.100-1.pdf" target="_blank"> framework</a> calls out potential for bias, and is designed to improve trustworthiness for organizations that design, develop, use and evaluate AI tools.</p>
<p>“My hope is that the call for standards … will read through the market, providing tools that companies could use to validate or certify their models at least,” Wellman said. “Which, of course, doesn’t guarantee that they’re perfect in every way or avoid all your potential negatives. But it can … provide basic standard basis for trusting the models.”</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seems Rooz Dadabhoy has a poor sense of timing. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dadabhoy is the president of Rally Virginia, an organization that describes itself as “the home of the modern Republican woman,” a tech company CEO and a </span><a href="https://bov.vcu.edu/members/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">VCU Board of Visitors member</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> appointed by Gov.

Glenn Youngkin, posted this tweet containing misinformation about FEMA funds on Oct. 5, 2024. The post was later deleted. (Screenshot)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“FEMA has spent hundreds of millions on its ‘Shelter and Services Program’ for ILLEGAL migrants this year—and it’s right there on FEMA’s own website. WHAT ABOUT HELPING OUR OWN CITIZENS???? Shame on HARRIS-BIDEN!!!” Dadabhoy’s now-deleted Oct. 5 tweet read. The post included a photo that appeared to show a teary-eyed, wet-haired little girl sitting on a boat, wearing a life jacket and clutching an equally-soaked puppy as another boat floats down a river in the background. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most people who saw it, including me, immediately connected the picture to the water-logged Southeast now recovering from Hurricane Helene. Over 100 people died in the storm, and entire communities in </span><a href="https://ncnewsline.com/2024/10/08/fact-check-debunking-misinformation-surrounding-helene/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hardest-hit North Carolina</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> were washed away. There’s been significant flooding in Southwest Virginia, as The Mercury has </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/04/youngkin-shares-update-on-helene-damage-in-virginia-urges-to-not-be-distracted-by-climate-change/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, with at least 519 homes damaged or destroyed; two people have perished. That’s reality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The photo in Dadabhoy’s tweet, however, is not. It’s an AI-generated image, which I was able to confirm in less than 15 minutes by running the photo through </span><a href="https://sightengine.com/detect-ai-generated-images" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">three</span></a> <a href="https://aiimagedetector.org/result#google_vignette" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">different</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> free AI detection tools online. She could have easily done the same — and should have —  before sharing this fake photo.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dadabhoy’s words are also not rooted in reality. The tweet implies that FEMA funds are being routed to undocumented migrants instead of American-born natural disaster victims, a false claim parroted by Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and repeatedly debunked by FEMA in recent days.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No money is being diverted from disaster response needs. FEMA’s disaster response efforts and individual assistance is funded through the Disaster Relief Fund, which is a dedicated fund for disaster efforts. Disaster Relief Fund money has not been diverted to other, non-disaster related efforts,” FEMA posted Oct. 3 on a page of its website especially dedicated to setting the record straight (that they felt compelled to do that is sad, in and of itself).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only is the misinformation Trump, Dadabhoy and countless others are pushing irresponsible, it’s downright dangerous. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is reducing the likelihood that survivors will come to FEMA with a trusted way to register for assistance,” Keith Turi, acting associate administrator for response and recovery at FEMA, told </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/10/07/nx-s1-5144159/fema-funding-migrants-disaster-relief-fund" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NPR</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> yesterday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowing all this, I asked Dadabhoy two questions: Were you aware when you made that tweet that FEMA has repeatedly debunked the false claim that disaster relief funds are being used to support undocumented immigrants? What did you hope to accomplish by tweeting that? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dadabhoy replied that “I never implied that money is being diverted away from Hurricane Helene victims and being siphoned to illegal immigrants. I did not imply that. I did not even intend to imply that.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t believe that, and neither do the dozens of people who replied angrily to her tweet, some calling for her removal from VCU’s BOV. One person, unfortunately, replied by asking after the welfare of the AI child in the fake photo, showing the problem with spreading digital misinformation, even unintentionally: somebody will believe it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginians in positions of public influence, and who have our governor&#8217;s support, should be dispelling Trumped-up, unproven claims — especially in the aftermath of a major natural disaster, when so many people still need help — not adding fuel to the rumor wildfires.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_40341" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:979px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/08/no-fema-helene-funds-arent-going-to-undocumented-immigrants-despite-youngkin-appointees-tweet/picture3_0/" rel="attachment wp-att-40341"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-40341 size-full" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Picture3_0.jpg" alt="" width="979" height="651" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Picture3_0.jpg 979w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Picture3_0-300x199.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Picture3_0-768x511.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 979px) 100vw, 979px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  From FEMA: &#8220;Crews working to restore utilities and infrastructure damaged by Helene (in Washington County, Va.). (Nicholas Monteleone/ FEMA)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At a press gaggle Youngkin convened Tuesday morning to give updates on Hurricane Helene recovery efforts in Virginia, a reporter asked him what his administration was doing to counter misinformation concerning the storm and FEMA’s response, and referenced Dadabhoy’s tweet as an example of the problem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are using, I think, the best process, which is to put people on the ground, answer questions directly, and speak to you all frequently, so that you can help us get out the word how to apply for help where it&#8217;s available, and most importantly, that we care and that we&#8217;re there, and there will be a better day tomorrow,” the governor replied, in part. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin is wise to lean into working with the media to spread the facts; it is an essential part of our role. And you, dear reader, can do your part to identify and stop the spread of misinformation, too. Here are a few tools, tailored to our concurrent election and hurricane seasons:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Perhaps ironically in the context of this column, VCU Libraries is offering an excellent information literacy campaign called </span><a href="https://www.library.vcu.edu/about/news/2024-news/as-a-beacon-in-todays-information-fog-vcu-libraries-launches-campaign-to-encourage-people-to-vetyoursources.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">#VetYourSources</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, including a lecture by author and info literacy expert Mike Caulfield, “Rumors of Theft: Navigating election integrity discourse online” on Oct. 15.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> As mentioned above, FEMA’s </span><a href="https://www.fema.gov/disaster/current/hurricane-helene/rumor-response?utm_campaign=Emergency%20response%202024&amp;utm_content=310511761&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;hss_channel=tw-14074515" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hurricane Helene: Rumor Response&#8221;</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> page offers just-the-fact-ma’am breakdowns of what’s real and what&#8217;s not when it comes to the agency’s response to Helene cleanup efforts, and answers questions about its funding for future emergencies. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The Brennan Center for Justice at NYU Law&#8217;s </span><a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/how-detect-and-guard-against-deceptive-ai-generated-election-information" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">primer on fact-checking</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a great resource to help you learn “how to detect and guard against deceptive AI-generated election information.”</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The Poynter Institute’s </span><a href="https://www.politifact.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PolitiFact</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a verifiable fact-checking machine, a nonpartisan platform with a robust process of analyzing claims by politicians and media “to give citizens the information they need to govern themselves in a democracy,” writes Angie Drobnic Holan, Politifact’s former editor-in-chief. They&#8217;ve got a special section focused on debunking misinformation, too.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s always a good day to stop the spread of dubious digital distortions. Tweet, post, read and share responsibly out there, folks. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the demand for electrification grows, companies and specialists in Virginia are helping to develop the workforce necessary to build and maintain electric vehicles, connect consumers to electric transportation, and uncover resources to power low-emission vehicles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, to attract and retain employees and build, sell, and maintain electric and low-emission vehicles, leaders in the respective industries said the commonwealth needs to provide incentives and support efforts to continue building an efficient charging infrastructure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leaders in the trade industry said one of the biggest misperceptions is that people can’t be successful unless they go to college. Experts said it&#8217;s one of the driving forces behind the shortages of electricians, mechanics and technicians. Trade workers are needed in the electric vehicle industry, too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don Hall, president and CEO of the Virginia Automobile Dealers Association, said Virginia can help by continuing its commitment to career and technical education (CTE) training as well as working with the federal government to develop an accessible and convenient charging infrastructure and create ways to invest and incentivize EV purchases. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There are many things the state can do, but both parties have been lacking in that arena,” said Hall. “Yet one party over the other says, ‘this is where we need to be’ [and] ‘we need to be selling more of them.’ Okay, I agree, but help us.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not clear how state efforts on workforce development are focused on electric vehicles. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When asked why Gov. Glenn Youngkin nixed a proposed battery manufacturing plant slated for Virginia’s Southside, press secretary Martinez said </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the governor “decided not to finance technology affiliated with the Chinese Communist Party using Virginia taxpayer money,” and pointed to other clean energy jobs the state is </span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2024/07/09/south-korean-company-plans-to-build-681-million-offshore-wind-submarine-cable-plant-in-chesapeake/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pursuing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia was </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/11/virginia-americas-top-state-for-business-nations-best-schools-solid-infrastructure.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">named</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the top state to do business in 2024 by CNBC. But the governor admitted that the commonwealth still has work to do in the area of workforce development, after CNBC ranked the state ninth on that measure, largely because of the shortage of educators moving to the commonwealth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin told CNBC that the workforce grew by 240,000 since he took office in 2022, but that growth hasn’t included electric vehicle makers at a rate other Southeastern states are experiencing. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Jobs: Building electric vehicles</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia businesses and higher education institutions are becoming involved with testing and developing semiconductor chips and building electric vehicles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this year, Virginia </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/virginia-micron-semiconductor-chips-lynchburg-batteries/article_973cc5fa-fda5-11ee-99bd-076706ef8fb7.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">settled</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on an incentive package with manufacturers to develop batteries and semiconductor chips used to support vehicles, after the country experienced a shortage in chip manufacturing. Micron, one of those manufacturers, designs the advanced fabrication for many of its chips in Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Delbert Parks, vice president and site executive at Micron Technology, said the chips are the backbone of the EVs. The chips also drive advancements in power electronics and electrification efforts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also said developing a “robust and diverse talent pipeline” is essential for driving innovation in the semiconductor industry and supporting EV trends; some of that talent could come from . community colleges and universities. Students and university researchers can design and manufacture cutting-edge solutions, meet growing production demands, improve energy efficiency and maintain global competitiveness in the semiconductor industry and the EV revolution. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Micron has partnered with several Virginia colleges including Virginia Tech and Norfolk State University to grow the workforce and provide experiential learning opportunities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The semiconductor industry is facing a global talent gap requiring industry, academic and government partnership to ensure we create pathways for students, K-PhD, to enter into our industry,&#8221; Parks said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the help of a grant from the National Science Foundation, the Bradley Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at Virginia Tech has been working to advance semiconductor research and education. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The department also hosts workshops and summer camps to encourage high school students to pursue careers in semiconductor-related fields, and has been putting more emphasis on offering semiconductor chip courses in light of the nation’s shortage of chips.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volvo Trucks North America is one of the vehicle manufacturers in Virginia promoting the sale of heavy electric trucks, including tractor trailers.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_40032" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:1024px;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-40032" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/NRV-Site-Aerial-1024x576.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/NRV-Site-Aerial-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/NRV-Site-Aerial-300x169.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/NRV-Site-Aerial-768x432.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/NRV-Site-Aerial-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/NRV-Site-Aerial-2048x1152.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  The Volvo Group North America New River Valley Plant located in Dublin, VA. (Courtesy of Volvo Group North America)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Calling itself the largest manufacturing employer in Southwest, Virginia, the company employs about 36,000 people at its plant in the New River Valley and says its been committed “from the beginning” to building an educated workforce for those selling and working on the trucks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“During the dealer certification process, all employees receive safety and basic EV training and a minimum of two technicians per location must be certified,” said Bobby Compton, product marketing manager at Volvo Trucks North America. “Traditionally, these technicians have experience working on traditional (internal combustion engine) powertrains and are adding the skill set for zero-emissions-vehicles.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company has benefited from the Commercial Clean Vehicle Credit under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which equates to a $40,000 tax credit for buying an electric battery truck. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The IRA, President Joe Biden’s landmark law regarded as the largest investment in climate policy in the country&#8217;s history, has offered tax credits to incentivize the creation of electric manufacturing facilities throughout the country. The Southeast has taken advantage of those offerings, giving the region the name “battery belt.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The policy has been using funding from the IRA and 48C tax credits to spur EV component development. This is </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/16/podcasts/the-daily/biden-electric-vehicles.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">intended</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to create domestic manufacturing and make EV purchase tax rebates, which require components to be made in the U.S.A., more accessible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Virginia has not been part of that movement, although it has come close. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state almost became home to a battery plant in Danville, but the Richmond Times-Dispatch </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/ford-disputes-reporting-on-pittsylvania-county-pick-for-battery-project/article_3fce0f3e-9697-11ed-9b9d-d309e4bf363a.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">in January 2023 Youngkin pulled the plug because of a concern over connections to China.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“His concerns were validated when Ford scaled </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/business/ford-pausing-construction-of-battery-plant-that-had-been-considered-in-virginia/article_480a2dae-5bf4-11ee-9ec7-ffe193373d83.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">back</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> its Michigan battery plant plans, resulting in fewer jobs than anticipated, and the Defense Authorization Act </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-19/us-will-ban-pentagon-procuring-batteries-from-china-s-catl-byd" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">banned</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the Pentagon from purchasing batteries based on (Chinese-based Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., Limited technology),” Martinez said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, in Dec. 2023, Microporous, a Tennessee-based company that manufactures lead-acid battery separators, was the recipient of a $100 million grant from the federal government through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to potentially invest over $1 billion and create 282 jobs to build a lithium-ion battery plant in Virginia’s Pittsylvania County. But no final decision has been made and the company is considering building the plant in other states.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brad Reed, vice president of corporate development at Microporous, said the U.S. Department of Energy and the Virginia Economic Development Partnership are working to finalize a grant agreement and incentives package before year’s end.  Among the other states, Virginia was the “best for support offered in the area of workforce recruitment and development,” Reed said, but offered lower financial services compared to North Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Ohio.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No final decisions or public announcements will be made until these are finalized and approved,” Reed said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And in April, Applied Materials, the second company alongside Micron to receive a state incentive package, received $100 million in federal funding to open a battery plant in Lynchburg. The public </span><a href="https://cardinalnews.org/2024/04/22/5-ways-the-battery-plant-planned-for-lynchburg-is-significant/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">saw</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this move as a way for Virginia to enter the battery belt industry. But in August, </span><a href="https://cardinalnews.org/2024/08/02/battery-plant-backed-by-100-million-federal-grant-no-longer-planned-for-lynchburg/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">news</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> broke that the company had scrapped its plans without a clear answer as to why.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When asked what other EV component manufacturing plants the state was pursuing, Martinez, with the governor’s office, said “the administration is actively working on several economic development opportunities,” and pointed to successful 48C tax credit awardings, used to spur domestic clean energy development, luring in other engineering-related manufacturing operations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those included a $681 million investment from GreenLink LS in </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/news-releases/2024/july/name-1030531-en.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chesapeake</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to make a submarine transmission cable for offshore wind projects, and an over $400 million investment by Topsoe, a carbon emission </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/news-releases/2024/may/name-1026403-en.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reduction</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> company, in Chesterfield County. Those investments received $235 million in the 48C tax credits, “the third most of any state in the nation,” Martinez said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The administration has and will continue to leverage available federal dollars to unleash economic growth in Virginia,” Martinez said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Southern Alliance for Clean Energy and Atlas Public Policy </span><a href="https://www.cleanenergy.org/wp-content/uploads/Transportation-Electrification-in-the-Southeast-2023-Report.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">found</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the end of last year that Florida, Alabama, South Carolina, North Carolina, Tennessee and Georgia, had announced the addition of 65,242 manufacturing jobs and $60 billion in investment by building out the battery belt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Noting that announcements of the jobs may not always come to fruition, the report stated, “One factor in the growth of EV jobs in the Southeast is the significant economic incentive packages offered by state and local governments.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Jobs: Maintaining EVs</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While EVs require less maintenance, Matt Shepanek, vice president for credential testing programs with the National Institute for Automotive Service Excellence (ASE), said it&#8217;s a “misconception” that there won’t be any jobs available for technicians in the EV industry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With EVs, you don&#8217;t have some of the maintenance items, like there&#8217;s no oil and power steering fluid and things like that, but there&#8217;s still plenty of things that technicians need to do, as far as diagnostics and just overall vehicle care.” Shepnaek said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two years ago, ASE created a free </span><a href="https://ase.com/ev" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">EV safety standards</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> document, which the institute and members in the vehicle industry developed. The institute also started providing testing programs to help technicians and salespeople become certified to work and provide information to consumers about electric vehicles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shepanek said well over 5,000 people have participated in both testing programs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For years, car manufacturers have also trained technicians to work on their vehicles at service stations and shops and taught salespeople to understand vehicle details important to consumers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dan Banister, chair of the Virginia Automobile Dealers Association and owner of Banister Automotive, said car manufacturers such as Nissan and Ford have provided extensive training for his technicians at five dealerships, four of which are in Virginia and the other in Maryland. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the age of electrification, Banister said the role of technicians has changed, with some experts primarily using tools such as wrenches and now computers. He credits secondary schools and community colleges, including those in Chesapeake, for creating opportunities for students and the automotive industry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We need people out there willing to get their certifications (and) to help with all the skills we&#8217;re lacking right now,” Banister said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Banister said it’s important to have certified employees available to meet the demands of all their customers including those with EVs. On average, he said technicians work on four to five EVs a month with warranty work or tire replacements.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a real need for electricians trained to install chargers and charging stations around the commonwealth, with electric vehicle owners and future consumers increasingly searching for access. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Charles Skelly, business manager with IBEW Local 666, which represents and trains electricians, said the organization is helping new and experienced electricians prepare for the wave of charger installations. Those installations require electricians to be familiar with electrical load calculations and code requirements.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;With the manufacturing jobs that are coming countrywide from the IRA and other laws that have come out recently &#8230; there&#8217;s just an extreme demand for electricians right now,&#8221; Skelly said. Class sizes have increased from 20 to 25 students per class in the last few years. The number of classes  per semester has increased from two to three this fall, with 75 new apprentices starting. The program has 300 apprentices total. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://evitp.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Training Program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the primary program for electricians to complete to install chargers, requires applicants to have 8,000 documented hours of fieldwork. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;re neck deep in making sure we&#8217;re prepared for the work,&#8221; Skelly said, adding that their training can vary from residential to commercial and industrial levels. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Jobs: Uncovering resources</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The International Energy Agency found that 1.46 carbon dioxide equivalents, the same amount produced by 164 gallons of gasoline, are emitted when mining for lithium carbonate, a component of lithium-ion batteries that power a majority of electric vehicles. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While there are no major mining operations in the commonwealth, mineral mining is one practice in Virginia that could yield some success in collecting non-fuel minerals. However, there are environmental concerns about digging for resources, and processing minerals can add more emissions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, the IEA found that making an electric vehicle emits less climate-changing emissions than gas-power internal combustion engine cars.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Total lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions of EVs are around half those of internal combustion engine cars on average, with the potential for a further 25% reduction with low-carbon electricity,” the IEA </span><a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions/sustainable-and-responsible-development-of-minerals" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trip Pollard, with the Southern Environmental Law Center, said that’s the evidence to support electric vehicles instead of ones that guzzle gas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Overall, when you look at the environmental toll, you know the entire process of a gas-powered vehicle and an electric vehicle,” Pollard said. “Hands down, you&#8217;re better off with electric vehicles, which is why we support that transition.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. has a ban on </span><a href="https://www.state.gov/conflict-minerals/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">conflict minerals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which come from countries known to have human rights violations. Cobalt, a mineral explored as a more efficient power source for batteries, can come from the Democratic Republic of Congo. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, Sen. Bill Stanley, R-Franklin, introduced a bill this past session to prevent public bodies, including state and local governments, from procuring an electric vehicle unless the manufacturer swears child labor wasn’t involved in the process. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At an August meeting when discussing his bill, Stanley said finding “clean energy sources … is a policy decision that the commonwealth has made and rightly so.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Stanley continued, “I still believe that we can make a general inquiry and determine what nation states, what countries are mining this cobalt rationally, reasonably and without harm to their children or to their citizenry.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scapegoating electric vehicles in that pursuit isn’t fair, Pollard said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If we&#8217;re really concerned about this issue, which is a serious issue, it should apply to all products, don&#8217;t single out EVs,” Pollard said. “I think there are concerns that need to be addressed, and, absolutely, (the SELC is) involved in a couple of projects that are mining projects in the south. They&#8217;re pushing for more steps to be taken to minimize any adverse environmental impacts.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia has nearly all of the 50 critical minerals in the state in trace elements, including Cobalt, which has a “moderate potential” for economic development, and lithium, which has an “unknown potential.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sixteen of the elements have high potential for development,” said Tarah Kesteron, a spokeswoman for Virginia Energy. “These include the 14 rare earth elements (REEs), titanium, and zirconium.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One company that mines for titanium and zirconium is Atlantic Strategic Metals. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement on the </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/03/12/petersburg-based-company-to-reactivate-mining-operations-in-dinwiddie-sussex/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reactivation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the mine in Dinwiddie and Sussex counties, Christopher Wyatt, the CEO said that Virginia had “a knowledgeable and talented workforce.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More broadly, Virginia is exploring ways to procure rare earth elements from waste </span><a href="https://rga.lis.virginia.gov/Published/2024/SD3/PDF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">coal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as well as </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/08/08/four-takeaways-from-southwest-virginias-critical-mineral-investigation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">innovative</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ways to find critical minerals in the earth or mined coal, through an initiative with Virginia Tech called Evolve Central Appalachia, or CAPP.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The work around minerals is part of the transition that the Natural Resources Defense Council said can be more affordable than spending  $1,117 a year to fuel a gas-powered vehicle, compared to $485 a year to fuel an electric one, the group found, citing a University of Michigan </span><a href="https://www.nrdc.org/stories/electric-vs-gas-cars-it-cheaper-drive-ev" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The cost saving also comes with benefits for humans and the planet they call home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“At 20 pounds of co2 for every </span><a href="https://www.epa.gov/greenvehicles/greenhouse-gas-emissions-typical-passenger-vehicle#:~:text=How%20can%20burning%20one%20gallon,the%20carbon%20and%20hydrogen%20separate." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">gallon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that’s burned, this is a phenomenal number of carbon dioxide molecules that are released in gasoline,” said Harned. “I think that the social cost of carbon, the impacts around people&#8217;s lives, the refugee movements, the economic harms from the additional storms, the heat events and the loss of life, that will over time reduce our consumption.”</span></p>

																						<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="1024" height="768" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/photo-collage.png-3-1024x768.png" class="attachment-large size-large wp-post-image" alt="" style="margin-bottom: 10px;" decoding="async" loading="lazy" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/photo-collage.png-3-1024x768.png 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/photo-collage.png-3-300x225.png 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/photo-collage.png-3-768x576.png 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/photo-collage.png-3.png 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p style="font-size:12px;">Pictured are screenshots from the Virginia mID app that allows users to upload their identification cards and driver's licenses without pulling out a wallet or purse. The Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles is still working on the app to make sure its accepted at other locations than two Virginia airports. (Courtesy of Virginia Mobile ID)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In some states, smartphones can do more than help you pay for services, capture memorable moments, or instantly access your choice of media. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In approximately half of the country, people can also store and share personal credentials on their devices, including state identification cards or driver’s licenses. Virginia has been working with experts to develop technology to make the same thing possible here. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Jillian Cowherd, a spokeswoman with Virginia DMV, the agency has partnered with CBN Secure Technologies on its Virginia </span><a href="https://www.dmv.virginia.gov/licenses-ids/mobile-id" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mobile ID (mID)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> program. While the agency continues to work with businesses and organizations to accept the mID, Cowherd said the agency is working to “make it easier” and “more secure for customers to manage their credentials” while addressing privacy concerns about the potential for personal data to be released without approval. State lawmakers are also closely monitoring the process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We always want to make things easier for folks (and) we can do that with the use of technology &#8230; but that&#8217;s always tempered with making sure that the privacy of individuals is paramount,&#8221; said House Technology Committee Chair Cliff Hayes, D-Chesapeake. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently the app is available for download and is being used by a portion of Virginia’s nearly 126,000 state employees. mID can be used at select TSA checkpoints including Richmond International Airport and Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, and state workers are providing feedback to the agency.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cowherd said the team is working to make mID available to the public in Google, Apple, and Samsung wallets and is in discussions with public and private entities to ensure it will be accepted at businesses and by organizations when launched. She said that once its fully rolled out,, Virginians should be able to use their mobile ID to board planes, show proof of identity at DMV offices, engage with law enforcement and emergency services, and eventually show proof of age at retail establishments and restaurants.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“DMV has continued to work with CBN Secure Technologies, our secure credential vendor partner, to develop an app, conduct extensive testing, gather customer feedback and ensure it has seamless functionality and robust security,” said Cowherd in a statement. “However, building a program that is widely accepted and highly secure takes time.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The pilot program, legislation</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2017, the General Assembly passed </span><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?171+sum+HB2229" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> creating the standards for issuing, reviewing, and displaying electronic credentials after the agency conducted a year-long pilot research program to assess “customer value, market demand and the ability to meet stakeholder needs,” Cowherd said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the program’s </span><a href="https://www.dmv.virginia.gov/licenses-ids/mobile-id/faq" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">list</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of frequently asked questions, there is no cost associated for Virginians to add the mID to their device or to use it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2017, lawmakers discussed charging for each individual-issued electronic credential. State law allows the agency to charge users up to $10 per year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to an earlier fiscal statement from the Department of Planning and Budget, at the fixed rate of $10, Virginia would have collected $1.7 million in revenue per year if 3% of the state’s approximately 5.6 million licensed drivers signed up. If 5% of licensed drivers were to buy an electronic credential, Virginia could receive approximately $2.8 million per year.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Privacy Concerns</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Karrie Delaney, D-Fairfax, chair of the House Transportation committee, said having technology to store your identification card on your smartphone is convenient for a lot of people, but privacy is paramount to many Virginians. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Having the security factors is an essential part of making sure that this program is trustworthy for the public,” Delaney said. “We are responsible for making sure that those guardrails are in place. But, at the end of the day, it is also going to be a choice for people.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Dave Marsden, D-Fairfax, said he believes the 2017 bill that created the mobile ID standards didn’t “raise any alarm bells” for the legislature, but believes lawmakers would be open to making any necessary changes if needed to address privacy or security worries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State governments and authorities known as “issuing authorities” seeking to use mobile ID technology have partnered with the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators, a nonprofit organization dedicated to developing model programs for motor vehicle administration, law enforcement and highway safety, for guidance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to </span><a href="https://www.aamva.org/topics/mobile-driver-license" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">guidelines</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> provided by the AAMVA, the issuing authorities, in this case Virginia, should take care to ensure mobile ID data stored on peoples’ phones is “adequately protected.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As standards in this respect are still under development, each Issuing Authority should take great care to ensure that the design of its solution supports this requirement,” the guidelines read. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AAMVA’s guidelines also advise authorities to encrypt mobile ID information and protect key material in a security module.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The organization also provides guidance on access.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While law enforcement and emergency services have legal access to a person’s physical credentials in Virginia, the association has suggested that mobile driver’s license apps allow similar access in case of justifiable need.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the association said that because such an option could be misused, the app must not allow anyone other than the mobile ID holder to access the mobile ID information.Virginia’s mobile ID app follows suit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Your information is not accessible without your consent. You control what information from your mID you’d like to share,” the DMV’s mobile ID FAQ page states. “When you enroll, your information is stored on your personal device. Only those with access to your personal device and the ability to unlock and access the app would have access to view it.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cowherd confirmed that user security is at the forefront of the project. She said the customer will control the information shared on the app, which presents the information needed for the interaction. The customer can also review and authorize the requested information before it is shared.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Virginia DMV provides the highest level of security in credential storage, data transmission and verification,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, she said mobile IDs are presented digitally through encrypted communication directly between a user’s device and a verifying business or organization. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The device never needs to be handed to anyone or leave the customer&#8217;s possession.,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cowherd said the agency hopes to fully release the app early next year, but this depends on final testing and proven use cases.</span></p>

(Bill Hinton/Getty Images)</p><p>Many state chief information and security officers say they don’t have the budget, resources, staff or expertise to feel fully confident in their ability to guard their government networks against cyber attacks, according to the new Deloitte-NASCIO Cybersecurity Study of officials in all 50 states and D.C.</p>
<p>“The attack surface is expanding as state leaders’ reliance on information becomes increasingly central to the operation of government itself,” said Srini Subramanian, principal of Deloitte &amp; Touche LLP and the company’s global government and public services consulting leader. “And CISOs have an increasingly challenging mission to make the technology infrastructure resilient against ever-increasing cyberthreats.”</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/public-sector/2024-deloitte-nascio-cybersecurity-study.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">biennial cybersecurity report,</a> released Monday, outlined where new threats are coming from, and what vulnerabilities these teams have.</p>
<p>Governments are relying more on servers to store information, or transmit it through the Internet of Things, or connected sensor devices. Infrastructure for systems like transit and power is also heavily reliant on technology, and all of the connected online systems create more opportunities for attack.</p>
<p>The emergence of AI is also creating new ways for bad actors to exploit vulnerabilities, as it makes phishing scams and audio and visual deepfakes easier.</p>
<p>Deloitte found encouraging data that showed the role of state chief information and security officer has been prioritized in every state’s government tech team, and that statutes and legislation have been introduced in some states that give CISOs more authority.</p>
<p>In recent years, CISOs have taken on the vast majority of security management and operations, strategy, governance, risk management and incident response for their state, the report said.</p>
<p>But despite the growing weight on these roles, some of the CISOs surveyed said they do not have the resources needed to feel confident in their team’s ability to handle old and new cybersecurity threats.</p>
<p>Nearly 40% said they don’t have enough funds for projects that comply with regulatory or legal requirements, and nearly half said they don’t know what percent of their state’s IT budget is for cybersecurity.</p>
<p>Talent was another issue, with about half of CISOs saying they lacked cybersecurity staffing, and 31% saying there was an “inadequate availability” of professionals to complete these jobs. The survey does show that CISOs reported better staff competencies in 2024 compared with 2020, though.</p>
<p>Staffing of CISOs themselves, due to burnout, has been an increasing issue since the pandemic, the report found. Since the 2022 survey, Deloitte noted that nearly half of all states have had turnover in their chief security officers, and the median tenure is now 23 months, down from 30 months in the last survey.</p>
<p>When it came to generative AI, CISOs seemed to see both the opportunities and risks. Respondents listed generative AI as one of the newest threats to cybersecurity, with 71% saying they believe it poses a “high” threat; 41% of respondents said they don’t have confidence in their team to be able to handle them.</p>

<p>While they believe AI is a threat, many teams also reported using the technology to improve their security operations. Twenty one states are already using some form of AI, and 22 states will likely begin using it in the next year. <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/states-strike-out-their-own-ai-privacy-regulation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">As with state legislation around AI</a>, it’s being looked at on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p>One CISO said in the report their team is “in discovery phase with an executive order to study the impact of gen AI on security in our state”; another said they have “established a committee that is reviewing use cases, policies, procedures, and best practices for gen AI.”</p>
<p>CISOs face these budgetary and talent restrictions while they aim to take on new threats and secure aging technology systems that leave them vulnerable.</p>
<p>The report laid out some tactics tech departments could use to navigate these challenges, including leaning on government partners, working creatively to boost budgets, diversifying their talent pipeline, continuing the AI policy conversations and promoting the CISOs role in digital transformation of government operations.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Searching for a new vehicle can be challenging, but not as complex as it is to develop the infrastructure needed to power electric and low-emission vehicles at rest stops, gas stations, homes, workplaces and public areas in Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To build its EV infrastructure, the state leaned on the federal government’s nationwide plan to install charging stations across major corridors around the country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, those areas are found along Interstates 81, 295 and 495, to name a few. The commonwealth has received $61 million, with a future allocation of $45 million, from the federal government’s Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, also known as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, to build out charging stations along interstate highways, with one planned at least every 50 miles, and within one mile of federally identified designated alternative fuel corridors (AFCs). So far, the process has progressed slowly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whenever you put a large amount of new money into a system, meaning deploying EV infrastructure where none previously existed, the startup is going to be very difficult. New processes and procedures need to be established to ensure taxpayer dollars are used appropriately and we minimize the potential for waste, fraud, and abuse,” said Del. David Reid, D-Loudoun, who is a strong supporter of electric vehicles and owns one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, homeowners, businesses, and residential and commercial developers could tap into another infrastructure layer soon — or even now, if they have access to a 240-volt outlet. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state could incentivize Virginians to install chargers at shopping malls, homes and corporate offices through future legislation. Previous efforts have failed due to the lack of support or funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reid said the state needs to build out the charging infrastructure along major highways, but there’s also the potential for existing wiring to support a Level 2 EV charger, which is typical for home, the workplace and public areas such as gas stations.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Divesting from gas stations for charging stations</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s gas stations and convenience stores are aware of the transition to electric vehicles, but are generally prioritizing their available fossil fuel at the moment. Some, though, are seeing a new business opportunity with government funding to provide EV charging infrastructure. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of June 30, the Department of Motor Vehicles said there were about 6.9 million vehicles registered in Virginia, with about 311,000 being electric, plug-in hybrid or traditional hybrid. That means at least 6.6 million cars need a gas station to fuel up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mike O’Connor, president and CEO of the Virginia Petroleum and Convenience Marketers Association, acknowledged the transition to more electric vehicles is “going to happen regardless of what pressures are brought to bear because there are people that are interested in these vehicles.” O’Connor’s group represents owners or suppliers for the 3,385 gas stations and convenience stores across Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But given some challenges with adopting electric vehicles, including their difficulty performing in cold weather, O’Connor said for his group, the percentage of new cars sales being electric vehicles likely won’t increase beyond the current 7% rate as fast as previously thought. So they’re not focusing on EV drivers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If I&#8217;m one of these businesses, I&#8217;m doing a long term projection, and you say it&#8217;s going to increase by 100% in 10 years — which I think is optimistic given what&#8217;s going on — you&#8217;re going to go from 7% to 14%,” O’Connor said. “You&#8217;re still going to have 14% EVs and 86% internal combustion engines. If I’m making my efforts in planning, I&#8217;m focused on the 86% in those locations where I&#8217;m operating presently.”</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_40119" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/deq-charger/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-40119" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/deq-charger-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1707" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/deq-charger-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/deq-charger-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/deq-charger-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/deq-charger-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/deq-charger-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/deq-charger-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  EVgo chargers deployed by the Department of Environmental Quality at a gas station in Richmond. (Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That hold-out philosophy is present in the Shenandoah Valley, where Holtzman Oil is one of the largest suppliers of gas and is keeping with its model based on conversation with retailers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “Our gut feeling is that fossil fuel has a long and bright future ahead of us,” said Todd Holtzman, general manager of the company&#8217;s propane division and a Republican member of the town of Mount Jackson’s council. “[Chargers] are very, very expensive and I think it&#8217;s a possibility when the public wants them. Where you see ‘em, I think they’re heavily subsidized and they’re not heavily used.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Individual gas station owners decide if and when to install EV chargers, O’Connor said, similar to the choice between selling “Coke versus Pepsi.” A separate group of gas stations and convenience stores, ranging from national chains to mom and pop stores that are a part of the Charge Ahead Partnership, ranging from national chains to mom and pop stores, take a fuel-agnostic stance, said Ryan McKinnon, a spokesman for the group. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If customers want charging, they want to provide it,” McKinnon stated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But with Level 3 fast chargers costing about $100,000 to install — the type which take about 15 to 20 minutes to charge a battery up to 85% for up to a 300 mile duration, typically — McKinnon said gas stations owners want certainty their investment will provide a return and not be overlooked by a charger built down the street. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That certainty, McKinnon said, can come from giving private companies a right of first refusal to prevent utilities from building, owning and profiting chargers paid for through ratepayer funds within a 12-mile radius of an existing publicly used one, which is what a 2024 </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb118" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Del. Rip Sullivan, D-Fairfax, sought to achieve. Dominion Energy, which McKinnon said has been cooperative with building charging infrastructure, argued against the bill, saying it would have hampered their ability to provide more charging stations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is a pretty big business opportunity,” McKinnon said, adding gas stations can be well lit, attended by people and are close to highways. “We’re uniquely positioned.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The government’s role</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While it can be considered as a subsidy, the government is providing incentives to overcome the funding concerns with building EV chargers, particularly at gas stations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2016, a settlement with Volkswagen for cheating emission tests led to $14 million for charger development, primarily at gas stations in Northern Virginia and the Hampton Roads area. More recently, the Virginia Department of Transportation began doling out National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure funds from the federal government.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Erin Belt, decarbonization program manager with the Virginia Department of Transportation, said the applicants include traditional gas stations and travel centers. The list of applicants also include third party operators running the stations, and those from the tourism industry operating dining establishments, grocery stores and shopping centers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;ve seen pretty good, and I would say better than expected, response from applicants across the state,” said Chris Berg, director of sustainability at VDOT. “I think we had some concern around ‘are there some areas of the state that have lower EV penetration?’ where we may see less interest. But in our first round we saw multiple applications at all of our target areas.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sullivan told the Mercury in a phone interview he’s used a charging station much like what the NEVI program is working on. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;m in Western New York state right now. I drove up here in my EV,” Sullivan said “My wife and I stopped at a Sheetz in Bedford, Pennsylvania; took 20 minutes to charge our car while we were inside, using the restroom and buying some food for the road. And then we were on our way, not unlike an internal combustion engine vehicle stopping for a gas fill up.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">EV traveling in Virginia</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Industry leaders say charging stations along Virginia’s interstates are moving along, but have some challenges amid concerns over car batteries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2022, VDOT said after it received funding for the </span><a href="https://publicinput.com/Customer/File/Full/b483a081-9d89-4e33-874b-19ae8529c991" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NEVI</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> program, it would be working through 2026 to expand the network to over 1,000 charging stations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Berg said it&#8217;s the largest investment in the commonwealth’s history. However, VDOT is uncertain when deployment could be completed, due to factors such as whether the program will be reauthorized and what the demand will be in a couple of years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Supply chain delays could also impact when award recipients complete the installation of charging stations, as could applicants’ need to ensure they understand the federal requirements and obligations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The program does not cover infrastructure installation in areas beyond Virginia&#8217;s interstates, like the commonwealth’s rural regions. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_40113" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/img_4173/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-40113" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_4173-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1707" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_4173-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_4173-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_4173-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_4173-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_4173-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_4173-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  A demonstration of a charger for an electric vehicle that is part of a fleet. (Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, some communities are applying for the </span><a href="https://www.transportation.gov/rural/grant-toolkit/charging-and-fueling-infrastructure-grant-program" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Charging and Fuel Infrastructure Discretionary Grant Program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> created under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to address those areas. The application process, which closed last month, offers a $2.5 million cut for groups such as local governments and planning organizations in urban and rural communities. The funding will help to deploy EV charging and other alternative vehicle-fueling infrastructure projects in publicly accessible locations.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The idea behind the CFI funding is to essentially fill in gaps left by the NEVI program,” said Anne Blair, vice president of policy for the Electrification Coalition, a nonprofit organization advocating for electric vehicles. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While NEVI dictates specific funding every 50 miles, a mile off the interstate, this is designed to really go in areas outside of that, [such as] rural communities (and neighborhoods with)multi-family housing, for instance, that also need assistance in terms of deployment of funding.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s stated </span><a href="https://www.mwcog.org/file.aspx?&amp;A=8kzH4dtaFasiXH88W0qktEqlAIWJZ5eDj4%2Bc8Rd2uUI%3D" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">goal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the charging network is to create a system that facilitates “convenient, reliable, and equitable access to fast charging stations throughout the commonwealth, while spurring growth in this promising industry.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sullivan has introduced a bill three years and counting to make sure “all Virginians” can have access to charging, including rural areas that won’t directly benefit from the NEVI program. Sullivan’s bill attempted to offset some infrastructure costs in less populated, lower income areas, which Republican lawmakers have said is lacking while also largely opposing the clean cars policy seeking to increase the state’s adoption of electric vehicles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those rural areas are where state parks typically are, too, said Sullivan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want all of our Virginia citizens to be able to charge electric vehicles. We want people coming into the states, into our beautiful tourist attractions all over the state. We want those people who own electric vehicles to feel confident that they can charge there as well.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reid suggested that state involvement could help alleviate any inequities for people who live in places that don’t have garages or dedicated spaces for charging such as apartments and condominiums. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Operating and improving EV charging in Virginia</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some consumers considering the idea of transitioning to electric are looking to businesses, legislators and local and state governments to make finding charging stations easier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In some parts of Virginia, electric and low emission vehicle owners have already taken steps to install chargers at their homes. In some cases, a homeowner is required to have an electrical permit to install a charger. Experts say most EV charging is done at home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In </span><a href="https://www.pwcva.gov/department/building-development-division/residential-EV-charging-stations" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prince William</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an electrical permit is required when a circuit or feeder is added or extended to supply the vehicle charging system or if the system is hard wired. A permit is not required if the charging system is cord-and-plug connected to an existing circuit that meets the requirements of the manufacturer’s installation instructions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">EV and hybrid owners also use chargers at shopping malls and at workplaces as the more effective charging stations become available.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_40114" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/23/in-va-electric-vehicle-infrastructure-development-is-underway-incentives-could-spur-growth/img_4214/" rel="attachment wp-att-40114"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-40114" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_4214-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1707" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_4214-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_4214-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_4214-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_4214-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_4214-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_4214-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  The screen of an charger for a municipal electric vehicle. (Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers attempted to increase the number of charging stations and home chargers during the previous three sessions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2021, the Virginia legislature passed the first EV Rebate Program providing tax incentives for consumers to purchase a new or used electric vehicle. However, the program was never funded by the legislature.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reid said the state’s EV Rebate Program lost support because some interpreted it as a means to support the wealthy purchasing expensive EVs; others balked because of the cost to support the program. He said the commonwealth has a “finite amount of money,” and the legislature has to make some “very difficult decisions” about priorities, some of which have been neglected for decades, such as increasing teacher pay, disability waivers and law enforcement pay.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don&#8217;t fault anyone for that, but it was one of those unfortunate things that we were able to pass the legislation, but we had different priorities when we got to the budget,” Reid said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2023, </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+SB1312" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to give localities the option to require developers to include charging infrastructure in their proposals failed, which he said was supported by localities in Northern Virginia. A similar bill in </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb405" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2024 </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">would have convened a workgroup to evaluate the technical requirements for building EV charging infrastructure. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Jennifer Boysko, D-Fairfax, said she supports localities having the flexibility “in certain areas” to require developers to include charging infrastructure in their proposals, especially multi-family dwelling unit construction proposals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have to keep up with the times and with the technology and giving localities another tool in the toolbox to make some decisions for themselves, knowing their communities better than anybody else, I think it’s a reasonable thing,” Boysko said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blair from the coalition acknowledged that it’s been “a fairly controversial issue for the building community, because it&#8217;s another thing on their list to include in their standards.” But it&#8217;s “vastly less expensive to do it when you&#8217;re building a new apartment complex than to retrofit a property after it&#8217;s already been built,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without Boysko’s bill passing, the city of Alexandria has been using “Standard Conditions” to encourage developers to agree to include charging infrastructure as they submit building proposals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Virtually all development projects incorporate some degree of EV infrastructure into their project,” said Amy Posner, EV planner for the city of Alexandria. “We typically see at least 2% of the parking spaces on a project will have Level 2 EV chargers. The latest update to the Standard Conditions raised that to 5% of parking spaces to better align with EV adoption rates in Alexandria.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The city also wants to provide the chargers in areas like city parks and libraries, but costs are a challenge. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To get around that, the city is offering up their locations to developers who would own, operate and profit from charging stations, but “ideally” enter a revenue sharing agreement with the city. Grants that Alexandria receives could also go toward building chargers. It’s similar to a program Virginia Beach is doing, Posner said, “to really accelerate the public charging that we know we need to make it easier for folks to make the switch.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stuart Gardner, executive director of </span><a href="https://generation180.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Generation 180</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which provides consumer education on switching to electric, said a way the organization is helping to spur interest is working with businesses in developing charging stations, and encouraging localities to apply for federal grants. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last January, Henrico County became the recipient of a </span><a href="https://henrico.gov/news/2024/01/henrico-earns-1-4-million-grant-to-create-ev-charging-station-network/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$1.4 million discretionary grant</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the </span><a href="https://www.transportation.gov/rural/grant-toolkit/charging-and-fueling-infrastructure-grant-program" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Charging Fuel Infrastructure Grant Program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for developing stations at seven county facilities including at two libraries and a recreational center. The second round of applications closed last month. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Generation 180 and a coalition of partners reached out to localities across the state to say ‘hey, let&#8217;s not leave money on the table.’ They’re going to award these grants, so let’s make sure that money is in Virginia,” Gardner said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Virginians unable to charge at home, businesses like Dominion are making it possible at the </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/10/27/dominions-electric-vehicle-charging-infrastructure-program-has-zero-sign-ups/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">workplace</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span>The company also <a href="https://www.dominionenergy.com/virginia/save-energy/electric-vehicles/residential-charger-program" target="_blank">announced</a> last Thursday that it would provide a one stop shop for qualifying residents who want to add chargers at home by connecting them with electricians. Participants can pay $1,835.96 upfront for the charger plus required materials, permitting, installation, maintenance and support, or pay $40.27 a month for five years. Low-income participants, including a family of four making less than $88,000 a year, can also participate at no cost. The utility will provide ongoing support, including a five year warranty.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This program eliminates a significant barrier to EV ownership by simplifying the process to purchase and install a home charger,&#8221; said Nathan Frost, General Manager of New Business &amp; Customer Solutions for Dominion Energy. &#8220;We are excited to help empower our customers to reduce their fuel costs and their emissions at the same time.&#8221;</span></p>

<p dir="ltr">RICHMOND, Va. &#8212; Richmond City Council recently adopted a resolution to declare high-speed internet a <a href="https://richmondva.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6791846&amp;GUID=7A3D4E77-4A39-4BAE-AB85-985C3B881BA5" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://richmondva.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID%3D6791846%26GUID%3D7A3D4E77-4A39-4BAE-AB85-985C3B881BA5&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1726617175690000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2H156SCDPXYQ5qo8tEuO0c">public necessity</a> for all Richmond residents, an update to similar legislation passed three years ago.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Andreas Addison, 1st District councilman and mayoral candidate, proposed the 2021 <a href="https://richmondva.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=5137147&amp;GUID=A4C21C9C-2FB7-4A19-B6CE-5DDAF0A19BA2" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://richmondva.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID%3D5137147%26GUID%3DA4C21C9C-2FB7-4A19-B6CE-5DDAF0A19BA2&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1726617175690000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0tc9hpkVD3EjZjopUTM1cF">resolution</a>. That resolution called on city officials to assess digital infrastructure and develop a strategy to provide Richmond with faster, reliable and affordable internet access. The 2024 <a href="https://richmondva.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6791846&amp;GUID=7A3D4E77-4A39-4BAE-AB85-985C3B881BA5" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://richmondva.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID%3D6791846%26GUID%3D7A3D4E77-4A39-4BAE-AB85-985C3B881BA5&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1726617175690000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2H156SCDPXYQ5qo8tEuO0c">resolution</a>, co-patroned by Addison, calls to develop and implement a plan.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We have not had an update on that project, and this was really pushing the initiative and saying, ‘where&#8217;s what we asked for in 2021?’” Addison said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The pandemic, which pushed students and employees to rely on home internet, highlighted the city’s need for better and more affordable internet. Some students did not have access to high-speed internet, and could not always complete their assignments, according to Addison.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It&#8217;s all kind of rolled into a much bigger conversation around internet access, digital literacy, digital accessibility,” Addison said. “Knowing the internet, how to access it safely and other challenges as well.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The federally funded Affordable Connectivity Program launched in December 2021, to try and address these same issues. The program offered eligible households discounts of up to <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/sites/default/files/ACP-FAQs-Post-ACP-Ending.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.fcc.gov/sites/default/files/ACP-FAQs-Post-ACP-Ending.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1726617175690000&amp;usg=AOvVaw07Zslp9XanfbuaSC-jabId">$30 a month</a> for internet services. The ACP was discontinued this June due to a lack of funding.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://getinternet.gov/apply?id=nv_home&amp;ln=RW5nbGlzaA%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://getinternet.gov/apply?id%3Dnv_home%26ln%3DRW5nbGlzaA%253D%253D&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1726617175690000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1vHFd0Z4m80gtjbV7GeueA">Lifeline</a> is a current federal program that offers discounts up to $9.25 a month for internet services to eligible households, and up to $34.25 for eligible subscribers on tribal lands.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Approximately 9.7% of Richmond residents do not have an internet subscription, according to the 2023 American Community Survey one-year <a href="https://data.census.gov/table?q=Richmond%20city,%20Virginia%20internet" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://data.census.gov/table?q%3DRichmond%2520city,%2520Virginia%2520internet&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1726617175690000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2W4rQfzmnG6O-iZwSLIcQA">estimates</a>. Low-income communities are among those affected, unable to access important telehealth, education and workplace opportunities, according to City Council.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Comcast director of government affairs Antoine Banks stated in a letter submitted to the Council that the company <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dA_OrtUBvKs6KNEw4K3ovgjFHKCHOcYA/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dA_OrtUBvKs6KNEw4K3ovgjFHKCHOcYA/view?usp%3Dsharing&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1726617175690000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0gjge0dNo-ibaVDSoZBjCf">supports </a>equitable access to the internet. The letter asserts there is 100% access to broadband services throughout the city, but the issue is a lack of adoption with programs that reduce service costs.</p>
<p dir="ltr">People are not aware of these programs or do not trust them, according to Banks. Comcast has a discounted service <a href="https://www.xfinity.com/learn/internet-service/internet-essentials#:~:text=Internet%20Essentials%20provides%20affordable%20home,hotspots%2C%20and%20free%20Internet%20training.&amp;text=Who%20is%20eligible%20for%20Internet%20Essentials%3F" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.xfinity.com/learn/internet-service/internet-essentials%23:~:text%3DInternet%2520Essentials%2520provides%2520affordable%2520home,hotspots%252C%2520and%2520free%2520Internet%2520training.%26text%3DWho%2520is%2520eligible%2520for%2520Internet%2520Essentials%253F&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1726617175690000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1W1eJ9FkzgpeN8--HK4HLp">program </a>for those eligible.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Offering affordable or even free internet service alone is not enough to close the digital divide,” Banks stated. “The underlying barriers that prevent people from adopting the technology must also be addressed.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Banks emphasized there needs to be a strong focus on education, digital navigation and effective communication to help people utilize provided resources.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Part of the Council’s vision is to have a faster, fiber network throughout the city. Broadband allows users to connect to the internet, and different services offer varying speeds. Fiber-optic technology transmits data at a faster speed.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“What is the roadmap of our opportunity to truly put fiber where it&#8217;s needed?” Addison said. “So that it’s not just broadband access, which is relatively slow and doesn&#8217;t have a lot of good bandwidth for really complicated uses.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Price is another factor in fiber’s favor, aside from initial infrastructure costs. Addison said some city residents pay the same for broadband that he pays for high-speed fiber internet.</p>
<p dir="ltr"> &#8220;They&#8217;re paying $65 a month for broadband; same fee I am paying for fiber,&#8221; Addison said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Market failures have left low-income communities without equal access, according to City Council.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“That&#8217;s the challenge I want to tackle, is it should not be market driven on how we bring internet connectivity to neighborhoods,” Addison said. “And right now it is.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Federal Communications Commission <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-401205A2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-401205A2.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1726617175690000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2YqEQ5wXP-tbG27NYFff6A">increased </a>the broadband baseline standard to download speeds of at least 100 megabytes per second and upload speeds of at least 20 mbps earlier this year.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Richmond’s median internet speed is on the slower side, according to the industry publication <a href="https://www.cnet.com/home/internet/best-internet-providers-in-richmond-va/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cnet.com/home/internet/best-internet-providers-in-richmond-va/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1726617175690000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3FFsxIAisesA71g22OZZd6">CNET</a>. The city was ranked 86th of the 100 most populous cities, based on data from the broadband speed test application Ookla.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The average download speed in Richmond clocked at 185 mbps and an upload speed of 51 mbps upload speed, which is higher than the FCC baseline.</p>

(Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drill down far enough into the earth, and you will hit hot rocks. Energy companies have used this heat to generate carbon-free electricity for </span><a href="https://web.mit.edu/nature/archive/student_projects/2009/bjorn627/TheGeothermalCity/History.html#:~:text=In%201904%2C%20Prince%20Piero%20Ginori,This%20plant%20is%20still%20operating." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more than a century</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It’s an elegant concept, but it worked only where pockets of heat lay close to the surface, accompanied by steam ready-made to turn turbines. Those limitations confined geothermal power plants to geologically active areas like Iceland, parts of Indonesia, and a few locations in the American West. As of 2023, geothermal energy made up </span><a href="https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/geothermal/use-of-geothermal-energy.php" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">less than half of 1%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of U.S. electricity generation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suddenly, that is changing. </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/apr/02/geothermal-energy-electricity" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">New technology</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> derived from oil and gas fracking methods is allowing energy companies to drill deep into the earth in places far from geologic activity. Wells can reach miles beneath the surface before branching out horizontally and creating fissures in hard, hot rock. Water injected into the wells comes back to the surface as steam to generate electricity. The steam is recaptured and re-injected to take up heat again, in a virtuous cycle powered by the earth itself. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The benefits</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These “enhanced geothermal” systems can produce 24/7 baseload electricity or fill in around variable sources like wind and solar. They can even be used like batteries to store energy, including for long durations.  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike drilling for fossil fuels, geothermal companies avoid the shale formations that hold hydrocarbons, instead targeting non-porous rock. And since the product is not fossil fuel but steam, the technology produces zero-carbon energy without toxic or radioactive waste. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Freed from geographic limitations and using the same technology and workforce as the oil and gas industry, geothermal energy is ready to take off fast. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) sees it spreading across the country to provide </span><a href="https://liftoff.energy.gov/next-generation-geothermal-power/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">as much as 125 gigawatts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (GW) of electricity by 2050. A global estimate suggests the industry could eventually produce </span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0306261920312551#:~:text=Potential%20of%20enhanced%20geothermal%20systems,256%20GWe%20in%202050." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">4,600 GW</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of electricity at a cost of 50 euros (around $55) per megawatt-hour or less.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2022 DOE launched an “</span><a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/geothermal/enhanced-geothermal-systems" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earthshot Initiative</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” to reduce the cost of enhanced geothermal energy in the U.S. to $45 per megawatt-hour (MWh) by 2035. If successful, that would put it </span><a href="https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Lazard-LCOE-Levelized-Cost-of-Energy-renewable-energy-version-17.png" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">at or below</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the cost of any other new, dispatchable energy source. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is this technology the answer to the surging demand for electricity from data centers and artificial intelligence? And could it allow Virginia to keep adding data centers without blowing up its climate goals?</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The challenges</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We do have to keep in mind that not all silver bullets prove to be sterling. Small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs) are </span><a href="https://ieefa.org/resources/small-modular-reactors-still-too-expensive-too-slow-and-too-risky#:~:text=SMRs%20still%20are%20too%20expensive,coming%2010%20to%2015%20years." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">evidence</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that some highly-anticipated technologies don’t follow the rosy timelines and price projections their boosters promise. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike SMRs, though, enhanced geothermal systems have already achieved commercial deployment. After </span><a href="https://eartharxiv.org/repository/view/5704/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">successfully demonstrating</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the technology with a 3.5 MW pilot facility,  </span><a href="https://fervoenergy.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fervo Energy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> signed a contract last year with </span><a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/sustainability/google-fervo-geothermal-energy-partnership/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to provide electricity for its data centers from a 115-MW enhanced geothermal power plant in </span><a href="https://fervoenergy.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevada</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Fervo will deliver the power to the local utility, NV Energy, which will then charge a slightly higher price to Google via a </span><a href="https://ob.nv.gov/PUC/api/Document/AUVtXfg9PCPGv6AN5IUcwlkqU2FOoopJ88kv9f6OWMnjzuFpY1bQJgc%C3%89Pfmr%C3%89og%C3%81qn0Ejg4YBd7GEPUO%C3%89aDWxjE=/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">proposed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> new </span><a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/google-fervo-nv-energy-nevada-puc-clean-energy-tariff/719472/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“clean transition tariff.”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Fervo has also signed a deal for an even bigger project that will deliver 400 MW to California utilities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using a different fracking-based technology it calls a “Geopressured Geothermal System,” Houston-based </span><a href="https://www.sagegeosystems.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sage Geosystems</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> recently </span><a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/geothermal/sage-geosystems-and-meta-sign-150mw-geothermal-power-agreement" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">agreed to supply 150 MW</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of power for Meta’s data centers beginning in 2027. Sage says it can make electricity not just by extracting heat but also by using pressure, an add-on technology that allows it to offer energy storage independent of steam production. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both Fervo and Sage say their methods can be used almost anywhere, and both cite advantages over established energy sources. Like wind and solar, geothermal is renewable and carbon-free, but it isn’t dependent on weather. It also doesn’t require fuel sources like coal and gas that are highly polluting and sometimes </span><a href="https://rmi.org/reality-check-keeping-the-lights-on-in-extreme-winter-weather/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">unreliable in extreme weather</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, with a small physical footprint relative to the energy produced, geothermal facilities could be located in urban areas or next to data centers and other large customers without the need for major new transmission lines. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But of course, the fact that geothermal technology can be used </span><a href="https://www.nrel.gov/geothermal/anywhere.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">anywhere</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> does not mean it can be deployed profitably everywhere, or at least not yet. A </span><a href="https://www.nrel.gov/geothermal/resource-assessment-mapping.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">map</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> compiled by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory shows the most ideal areas are still in the West, where hot rocks lie within a few kilometers of the Earth’s surface. In most of the eastern U.S., deeper wells would be needed to reach the same temperatures. For this reason, DOE sees the technology proving out in the West first before spreading east.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Use in Virginia?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But favorability is not purely a function of geology, according to Ben Serrurier, manager of government affairs and policy at Fervo. I wanted to know how soon geothermal systems could start providing electricity to the world’s largest concentration of data centers, in Northern Virginia. He said the biggest impediment for the industry is not location, but the high cost of capital and the paucity of government support compared to SMRs, hydrogen, and other new technologies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In spite of these challenges, Serrurier predicted geothermal would be deployed in Virginia by the latter part of the 2030s, noting that his company is already ahead of DOE’s projected timeline for the technology’s maturation. Eastern data centers present an especially attractive market, he said, because demand is increasing so quickly, and utilities have limited options for carbon-free energy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alas, observers of the data center industry know that while renewable energy is nice to have, cheap energy is even nicer. So I wanted to talk about cost.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Serrurier told me Fervo’s first project will deliver power to NV Energy at a price of $107 per MWh, and Google will pay slightly more than that to the utility. That is twice DOE’s target cost for 2035, yet it still puts the price below the U.S average of 13.1 cents per kilowatt-hour ($131 per MWh) for commercial customers, and competitive with the average Nevada commercial rate of 10.92 cents, </span><a href="https://www.eia.gov/electricity/monthly/epm_table_grapher.php?t=epmt_5_6_a" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Energy Information Agency data.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That price is, however, more than the 9.54 cents/kWh that the average commercial customer in Virginia pays for electricity derived primarily from fossil fuels. And Fervo’s price is for drilling in the West, not in the less favorable geology of the East.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But heck, anywhere in the country, 10.7 cents for zero-carbon baseload power — with no waste to be cleaned up and no added healthcare costs from pollution — still sounds compelling. Google may have chosen to be a first mover in order to show leadership and promote a new technology, but it is also locking in a solid deal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sage does not make its costs public, but Lance Cook, the company’s chief technical officer, told me their process is competitive with combined cycle gas plants when the cost of fossil gas is above $6 per thousand cubic feet. (According to the Energy Information Agency, the price of gas is </span><a href="https://www.eia.gov/dnav/ng/ng_pri_sum_a_EPG0_PEU_DMcf_a.htm" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">currently</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> below that level in most states, though gas prices are famously volatile.) </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An additional benefit, said Cook, is that a geothermal plant could be co-located with a data center, foregoing a grid connection and obviating the need for transmission lines. “We can turn electricity into data,” he told me. “It is much easier to connect data than to wait for a grid connection.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both Cook and Serrurier are confident that geothermal will beat new nuclear  price-wise, which today sounds like a safe bet. </span><a href="https://www.woodmac.com/press-releases/nuclear-needs-to-be-cost-competitive-with--alternative-power-generation-to-enable-net-zero/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Analysts warn</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that cost continues to be a significant issue for the nuclear industry. </span><a href="https://www.lazard.com/research-insights/levelized-cost-of-energyplus/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Current projections</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the cost of electricity from SMRs start at $142/MWh. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cook noted that Sage’s technology can also provide long-duration energy storage that isn’t dependent on the heat of the earth. This approach can be used anywhere to turn solar and wind power into baseload energy. Sage’s website claims it can achieve this for less than the cost of batteries or pumped hydro. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With all this promise, enhanced geothermal has been slow to catch the attention of Virginia utilities and policy-makers. The Virginia Code includes geothermal energy in its definition of renewable energy, but enhanced geothermal is not on the list of energy sources that qualify for the state’s renewable portfolio standard (RPS). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The General Assembly did pass </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=Sb508" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this year from Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, to include a similarly-named, but quite different, kind of geothermal energy – geothermal heating and cooling systems, also known as ground-source heat pumps – in the RPS. </span><a href="https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/geothermal-heat-pumps" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Geothermal heat pumps</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> use the near-constant temperature of the ground just a few feet under our feet to help heat and cool buildings, much as air-source heat pumps do but with greater efficiency. A working group under the auspices of the State Corporation Commission is currently trying to figure out how to award renewable energy certificates (RECs) for a technology that does not produce electricity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But drilling down two miles or more and generating electricity at the utility level is quite another thing. Making enhanced geothermal systems eligible for the RPS would be essential to putting the technology on an even footing with other renewables for use in Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an email, Surovell told me, “I have read about the Google geothermal project and believe there is significant potential in Virginia.I understand it is different, but we need to do all we can to try to meet the demand for energy created by data centers without upsetting the carbon-free goals we set with the Virginia Clean Energy Act.” He added, “Geothermal also has the potential to create thousands of well-paying trade jobs in drilling and pipefitting in the Commonwealth.”  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I also contacted Dominion Energy Virginia to gauge the utility’s level of interest. Dominion is facing an enormous challenge to meet the </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/28/virginia-explained-data-center-expansion-with-all-its-challenges-and-benefits/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">explosion of demand</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from data centers. Its </span><a href="https://cdn-dominionenergy-prd-001.azureedge.net/-/media/pdfs/global/company/2023-va-integrated-resource-plan.pdf?la=en&amp;rev=8e5047ba283b4b9bb5e17c41b3544564" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2023 integrated resource plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (IRP) proposed building new gas plants as early as 2028 and an SMR in 2034, but no geothermal energy. The plan </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/05/10/law-what-law-pandering-to-the-governor-dominions-new-plan-ignores-virginias-climate-law/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">failed to meet</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the carbon-cutting requirements of Virginia law, so the company ought to see the need to up its game for its 2024 IRP, due in October. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion’s answer was not encouraging. Aaron Ruby, Dominion’s director of Virginia and offshore wind media, responded with an email that made reference to the working group for geothermal heat pump RECs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re certainly looking at the potential for geothermal in Virginia. The SCC is leading a geothermal working group, and there are lots of knowledgeable experts taking a close look. Most of the potential in Virginia appears to be geothermal heat pumps, with maybe less potential for power generation. The process is ongoing, so still more to learn.”</span></p>

Reliably serving that growth requires an ‘all of the above’ approach, including offshore wind, solar, battery storage, next generation nuclear and natural gas. Emerging technologies like clean hydrogen, longer-duration storage and geothermal could also play a role.”</span><b> </b><b> </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not a great sign that Dominion ranks geothermal dead last. The company seems quite content to keep adding data centers to its customer base with no plan to meet its climate commitments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data center developers, on the other hand, could vote with their metaphorical feet. If Dominion will not bring geothermal technology to Virginia data centers, maybe the data centers will go to the geothermal technology. Why, after all, should they face public opposition and rising electricity rates in Virginia when they can go to Utah, Nevada or Texas to access low-cost, zero-carbon energy delivered 24/7 from a source that might even be located onsite? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Especially since, in so doing, they would provide the capital and demand required for enhanced geothermal to achieve DOE’s goals ahead of time, and hasten the day when Dominion presents an IRP with a real zero-carbon plan.  </span></p>

In the absence of federal action, states are increasingly striking out on their own to regulate artificial intelligence and other automated systems. (Leon Neal/Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The desire for artificial intelligence skills in new hires has exploded over the last five years, and continues to be a priority for hiring managers across nearly every industry, data from Stanford University’s annual </span><a href="https://aiindex.stanford.edu/report/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AI Index Report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2023, 1.6% of all United States-based jobs required AI skills, a slight dip from the 2% posted in 2022. The decrease comes after many years of growing interest in artificial intelligence, and is likely attributed to hiring slowdowns, freezes or layoffs at major tech companies like </span><a href="https://retailwire.com/blog/amazon-layoffs-microsoft-layoffs/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/deloitte-cut-1200-jobs-us-ft-2023-04-21/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deloitte</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2023/10/24/wall-street-has-been-quietly-cutting-20000-jobs-in-2023/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Capital One</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2023, the report said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The numbers are still greatly up from just a few years ago, and in 2023, thousands of jobs across every industry required AI skills. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What do those AI jobs look like? And where are they based, exactly? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Generative AI skills, or the ability to build algorithms that produce text, images or other data when prompted, were sought after most, with nearly 60% of AI-related jobs requiring those skills. Large language modeling, or building technology that can generate and translate text, was second in demand, with 18% of AI jobs citing the need for those skills. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those skills were followed by ChatGPT knowledge, prompt engineering, or training AI, and two other specific machine learning skills. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The industries that require these skills run the gamut — the information industry ranked first with 4.63% of jobs while professional, scientific and technical services came in second with 3.33%. The financial and insurance industries followed with 2.94%, and manufacturing came in fourth with 2.48%. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Public administration jobs, education jobs, management and utilities jobs all sought AI skills in 1- 2% of their open roles, while agriculture, mining, wholesale trade, real estate, transportation, warehousing, retail trade and waste management sought AI skills in 0.4-0.85% of their jobs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though AI jobs are concentrated in some areas of the country, nearly every U.S. state had thousands of AI-specific jobs in 2023, the report found. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">California — home to Silicon Valley — had 15.3%, or 70,630 of the country’s AI-related jobs posted in 2023. It was followed by Texas at 7.9%, or 36,413 jobs. Virginia was third, with 5.3%, or 24,417 of AI jobs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Based on population, Washington state had the highest percentage of people in AI jobs, with California in second, and New York in third. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Montana, Wyoming and West Virginia were the only states with fewer than 1,000 open roles requiring AI, but because of population sizes, AI jobs still made up 0.75%, 0.95% and 0.46% of all of the state’s open roles last year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the number of jobs dipped from 2022 to 2023, the adoption of AI technologies across business operations has not. In 2017, 20% of businesses reported that they had begun using AI for at least one function of their work. In 2022, 50% of businesses said they had, and that number reached 55% in 2023. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For those that have incorporated AI tools into their businesses, it’s making their workers more productive, the report found. The report said studies have shown that AI tools have allowed workers to complete tasks more quickly and have improved the quality of their work. The research suggested that AI could be also capable of increasings workers&#8217; skills — called upskilling— the report found.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report acknowledges that with all the technological advances that the AI industry has seen in the last five years, there are still many unknowns. The U.S. is still awaiting federal AI legislation, while </span><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/states-strike-out-their-own-ai-privacy-regulation" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">states make their own regulations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and laws. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Stanford report predicts two futures for the trajectory of the technology — one in which the technology continues to develop and increase productivity, but there&#8217;s a possibility that it&#8217;s used for “good and bad uses.” In another future, without proper research and development, the adoption of AI technologies could be constrained, researchers said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They are stepping in to encourage the upside,” the report said of government bodies. “Such as funding university R&amp;D and incentivizing private investment. Governments are also aiming to manage the potential downsides, such as impacts on employment, privacy concerns, misinformation, and intellectual property rights.”</span></p>

(Tero Vesalainen/Getty Images)</p><p>In June, amid a bitterly contested Republican gubernatorial primary race, a short video began circulating on social media showing <a href="https://www.abc4.com/news/politics/deepfake-video-utah-elections/" target="_blank">Utah Gov. Spencer Cox</a> purportedly admitting to fraudulent collection of ballot signatures.</p>
<p>The governor, however, never said any such thing and <a href="https://utahnewsdispatch.com/2024/08/13/utah-supreme-court-denies-phil-lyman-demand-to-annul-election-results/" target="_blank">courts have upheld his election victory</a>.</p>
<p>The false video was part of a growing wave of election-related content created by artificial intelligence. At least some of that content, experts say, is false, misleading or simply designed to provoke viewers.</p>
<p>AI-created likenesses, often called “deepfakes,” have increasingly become a point of concern for those battling misinformation during election seasons. Creating deepfakes used to take a team of skilled technologists with time and money, but recent advances and accessibility in AI technology have meant that nearly anyone can create convincing fake content.</p>
<p>“Now we can supercharge the speed and the frequency and the persuasiveness of existing misinformation and disinformation narratives,” Tim Harper, senior policy analyst for democracy and elections at the Center for Democracy and Technology, said.</p>
<p>AI has advanced remarkably since just the last presidential election in 2020, Harper said, noting that OpenAI’s release of ChatGPT in November 2022 brought accessible AI to the masses.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/12221/global-elections-in-2024/" target="_blank">About half</a> of the world’s population lives in countries that are holding elections this year. And the question isn’t really if AI will play a role in misinformation, Harper said, but rather how much of a role it will play.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">How can AI be used to spread misinformation?</h4>

	
<p>Though it is often intentional, misinformation caused by artificial intelligence can sometimes be accidental, due to flaws or blindspots baked into a tool’s algorithm. AI chatbots search for information in the databases they have access to, so if that information is wrong, or outdated, it can easily produce wrong answers.</p>
<p><a href="https://openai.com/index/how-openai-is-approaching-2024-worldwide-elections/" target="_blank">OpenAI said in May</a> that it would be working to provide more transparency about its AI tools during this election year, and the company endorsed the bipartisan <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/s2770/text/is" target="_blank">Protect Elections from Deceptive AI Act</a>, which is pending in Congress.</p>
<p>“We want to make sure that our AI systems are built, deployed, and used safely,” the company said in the May announcement. “Like any new technology, these tools come with benefits and challenges. They are also unprecedented, and we will keep evolving our approach as we learn more about how our tools are used.”</p>
<p>Poorly regulated AI systems can lead to misinformation. Elon Musk was recently called upon <a href="https://washingtonstatestandard.com/2024/08/05/a-chatbot-spread-falsehood-about-wa-elections-the-secretary-of-state-wants-it-fixed/" target="_blank">by several secretaries of state</a> after his AI search assistant Grok, built for social media platform X, falsely told users Vice President Kamala Harris was ineligible to appear on the presidential ballot in nine states because the ballot deadline had passed. The information stayed on the platform, and was seen by millions, for more than a week before it was corrected.</p>
<p>“As tens of millions of voters in the U.S. seek basic information about voting in this major election year, X has the responsibility to ensure all voters using your platform have access to guidance that reflects true and accurate information about their constitutional right to vote,” reads the letter signed by the secretaries of state of Washington, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Minnesota and New Mexico.</p>
<p>Generative AI impersonations also pose a new risk to the spread of misinformation.  In addition to the fake video of Cox in Utah, a deepfake video <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/petersuciu/2023/09/02/there-is-now-a-deep-fake-video-of-ron-desantis-dropping-out-of-the-2024-race/" target="_blank">of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis</a> falsely showed him dropping out of the 2024 presidential race.</p>
<p>Some misinformation campaigns happen on huge scales like these, but many others are more localized, targeted campaigns. For instance, bad actors may imitate the online presence of a neighborhood political organizer, or send AI-generated text messages to listservs in certain cities. Language minority communities have been harder to reach in the past, Harper said, but generative AI has made it easier to translate messages or target specific groups.</p>
<p>While <a href="https://www.elon.edu/u/news/2024/05/15/ai-and-politics-survey/" target="_blank">most adults are aware that AI will play a role</a> in the election, some hyperlocal, personalized campaigns may fly under the radar, Harper says.</p>
<p>For example, someone could use data about local polling places and public phone numbers to create messages specific to you. They may send a text the night before election day saying that your polling location has changed from one spot to another, and because they have your original polling place correct, it doesn’t seem like a red flag.</p>
<p>“If that message comes to you on WhatsApp or on your phone, it could be much more persuasive than if that message was in a political ad on a social media platform,” Harper said. “People are less familiar with the idea of getting targeted disinformation directly sent to them.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Verifying digital identities</h4>

	
<p>The deepfake video of Cox helped spur a partnership between a public university and a new tech platform with the goal of combating deepfakes in Utah elections.</p>
<p>From July 2024, through Inauguration Day in January 2025, students and researchers at the <strong> </strong>Gary R. Herbert Institute for Public Policy and the Center for National Security Studies at Utah Valley University will work with SureMark Digital. Together, they’ll verify digital identities of politicians to study the impact AI-generated content has on elections.</p>
<p>Through the pilot program, candidates seeking one of Utah’s four congressional seats and the open senate seat will be able to authenticate their digital identities at no cost through SureMark’s platform, with the goal of increasing trust in Utah’s elections.</p>
<p>Brandon Amacher, director of the Emerging Tech Policy Lab at UVU, said he sees AI playing a similar role in this election as the emergence of social media did in the 2008 election — influential but not yet overwhelming.</p>
<p>“I think what we’re seeing right now is the beginning of a trend which could get significantly more impactful in future elections,” Amacher said.</p>
<p>In the first month of the pilot, Amacher said, the group has already seen how effective these simulated video messages can be, especially in short-form media like TikTok and Instagram Reels. A shorter video is easier to fake, and if someone is scrolling these platforms for an hour, a short clip of misinformation likely won’t get very much scrutiny, but it could still influence your opinion about a topic or a person.</p>
<p>SureMark Chairman Scott Stornetta explained that the verification platform, which rolled out in the last month, allows a user to acquire a credential. Once that’s approved, the platform goes through an authorization process of all of your published content using cryptographic techniques that bind the identity of a person to the content that features them. A browser extension then identifies to users if content was published by you or an unauthorized actor.</p>
<p>The platform was created with public figures in mind, especially politicians and journalists who are vulnerable to having their images replicated. Anyone can download the SureMark browser extension to see accredited content across different media platforms, not just those that get accredited. Stornetta likened the technology to an X-ray.</p>
<p>“If someone sees a video or an image or listens to a podcast on a regular browser, they won’t know the difference between a real and a fake,” he said. “But if someone that has this X-ray vision sees the same documents in their browser, they can click on a button and basically find out whether it’s a green check or red X.”</p>
<p>The pilot program is currently working to credential the state’s politicians, so it will be a few months before they start to glean results, but Justin Jones, the executive director of the Herbert Institute, said that every campaign they’ve connected with has been enthusiastic to try the technology.</p>
<p>“All of them have said we’re concerned about this and we want to know more,” Jones said.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What’s the motivation behind misinformation?</h4>

	
<p>Lots of different groups with varying motivations can be behind misinformation campaigns, Michael Kaiser, CEO of Defending Digital Campaigns, told States Newsroom.</p>
<p>There is sometimes misinformation directed at specific candidates, like in the case of Governors Cox and DeSantis’ deepfake videos. Campaigns around geopolitical events, like wars, are also common to sway public opinion.</p>
<p>Russia’s influence on the 2016 and 2020 elections is well-documented, and efforts will likely continue in 2024, with a goal of undermining U,S, support of Ukraine, <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/5/2024/04/MTAC-Report-Elections-Report-Nation-states-engage-in-US-focused-influence-operations-ahead-of-US-presidential-election-04172024.pdf" target="_blank">a Microsoft study</a> recently reported.</p>
<p>There’s sometimes a monetary motivation to misinformation, Amacher said, as provocative, viral content can turn into payouts on platforms that pay users for views.</p>
<p>Kaiser, whose work focuses on providing cybersecurity tools to campaigns, said that while interference in elections is sometimes the goal, more commonly, these people are trying to cause a general sense of chaos and apathy toward the elections process.</p>
<p>“They’re trying to divide us at another level,” he said. “For some bad actors, the misinformation and disinformation is not about how you vote. It’s just that we’re divided.”</p>
<p>It’s why much of the AI-generated content is inflammatory or plays on your emotions, Kaiser said.</p>
<p>“They’re trying to make you apathetic, trying to make you angry, so maybe you’re like, ‘I can’t believe this, I’m going to share it with my friends,’” he said. “So you become the platform for misinformation and disinformation.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Strategies for stopping the spread of misinformation</h4>

	
<p>Understanding that emotional response and eagerness to share or engage with the content is a key tool to slowing the spread of misinformation. If you’re in that moment, there’s a few things you can do, the experts said.</p>
<p>First, try to find out if an image or sound bite you’re viewing has been reported elsewhere. You can use reverse image search on Google to see if that image is found on reputable sites, or if it’s only being shared by social media accounts that appear to be bots. Websites that fact check manufactured or altered images may point you to where the information originated, Kaiser said.</p>
<p>If you’re receiving messages about election day or voting, double check the information online through your state’s voting resources, he added.</p>
<p>Adding two-factor authentication on social media profiles and email accounts can help ward off phishing attacks and hacking, which can be used to spread  misinformation, Harper said.</p>
<p>If you get a phone call you suspect may be AI-generated, or is using someone’s voice likeness, it’s good to confirm that person’s identity by asking about the last time you spoke.</p>
<p>Harper also said that there’s a few giveaways to look out for with AI-generated images, like an extra finger or distorted ear or hairline. AI has a hard time rendering some of those finer details, Harper said.</p>
<p>Another visual clue, Amacher said, is that deepfake videos often feature a blank background, because busy surroundings are harder to simulate.</p>
<p>And finally, the closer we are to the election, the likelier you are to see misinformation, Kaiser said. Bad actors use proximity to the election to their advantage — the closer you are to election day, the less time your misinformation has to be debunked.</p>
<p>Technologists themselves can take some of the onus of misinformation in the way they build AI, Harper said. He recently published <a href="https://cdt.org/insights/brief-election-integrity-recommendations-for-generative-ai-developers/" target="_blank">a summary of recommendations for AI developers </a>with suggestions for best practices.</p>
<p>The recommendations included refraining from releasing text-to-speech tools that allow users to replicate the voices of real people, refraining from the generation of realistic images and videos of political figures and prohibiting the use of generative AI tools for political ads.</p>
<p>Harper suggests that AI tools disclose how often a chatbot’s training data is updated relating to election information, develop machine-readable watermarks for content and promote authoritative sources of election information.</p>
<p>Some tech companies already voluntarily follow many of these transparency best practices, but much of the country is following a “patchwork” of laws that haven’t developed at the speed of the technology itself.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/2770#:~:text=The%20bill%20generally%20prohibits%20individuals,or%20(2)%20solicit%20funds." target="_blank">bill prohibiting the use of deceptive AI-generated </a>audio or visual media of a federal candidate was introduced in congress last year, but it has not been enacted. Laws focusing on AI in elections <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/states-strike-out-their-own-ai-privacy-regulation" target="_blank">have been passed on a state level</a> in the last two years, though, and primarily either ban messaging and images created by AI or at least require specific disclaimers about the use of AI in campaign materials.</p>
<p>But for now, these young tech companies that want to do their part in stopping or slowing the spread of misinformation can seek some direction from the CDT report or pilot programs like UVU’s.</p>
<p>“We wanted to take a stab at creating a kind of a comprehensive election integrity program for these companies,” Harper said. “understanding that unlike the kind of legacy social media companies, they’re very new and quite young and have no time or kind of the regulatory scrutiny required to have created strong election integrity policies in a more systematic way.”</p>

(Photo by Getty Images.)</p><p>Maryland officials are warning county agencies and employees to be wary when handling requests under the state’s Public Information Act, after malware attacks using a similar scheme reportedly hit some county attorneys in Virginia.</p>
<p>Maryland Association of Counties (MACo) officials, who posted the warning last week, said they are not aware of any attempts against Maryland offices, but wanted to put local officials “on lookout mode.”</p>
<p>“We haven’t seen any instances of this happening in Maryland, but I just felt like it was a good opportunity to share this with our people,” said Karrington Anderson, associate policy director with MACo.</p>
<p>She <a href="https://conduitstreet.mdcounties.org/2024/08/07/beware-of-public-information-act-malware-scams/" target="_blank">posted the alert</a> to the association’s blog last week urging county agencies and employees to “beware” malware scams that could come through links attached to PIA requests, after similar attempts were identified in Virginia using that state’s Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).</p>
<p>“Public Information Act (PIA) malware scams could target county governments,” Anderson warned in her Aug. 7 post. “In Virginia, counties are receiving FOIA requests as attachments that, once opened, contain malware.</p>
<p>“Not only is this malware capable of shutting down entire systems, but it also expends resources and require counties to spend significant amounts of money to repair the damage. The disruption caused by these attacks can lead to delays in government operations,” her post said.</p>
<p>The Maryland Department of Information Technology said that it has not identified any such attacks in the state yet.</p>
<p>“OSM (Office of Security Management) has not received any information regarding a malware attack directed at MACo. OSM has not been informed of malware attacks by any local agencies, counties, or municipalities we serve,” said a statement from Nathaniel Miller, a public information officer speaking on behalf of the Maryland Department of Information Technology.</p>
<p>Maryland’s PIA — like Virginia&#8217;s FOIA — allows people to request information on the activities of state and local governments. The process to receive documents and information can be an arduous and time-consuming task, depending on the scope of the request. Generally, PIA requests are sent over email.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Warning from Virginia</h4>

	
<p>Anderson and other officials warn that malware disguised as links or attachments in PIA requests could compromise the security of county and state agencies if an employee mistakenly clicks on it, often known as a “phishing scam.”</p>
<p>Officials from the Virginia Association of Counties said they “did not have many details other than what Lancaster County Attorney James Cornwell said” in an <a href="https://www.newsontheneck.com/news/lancaster-attorney-sounds-alarm-on-foia-scam/article_5a8e23d2-4f4a-11ef-ac36-83eb046b4a31.html" target="_blank">article</a> from a local newspaper, in which he was quoted as saying that “several” county attorneys had been hit by malware posing as a FOIA request. VACo said it alerted its members, and will monitor the situation.</p>
<p>That said, a successful malware attack could lead to multiple issues for county and state agencies, depending on the end goals of the attackers, said Dave Levin, an associate professor with the University of Maryland’s Department of Computer Science. He is also a core member of the university’s Maryland Cybersecurity Center.</p>

<p>Levin listed a variety of potential malware capabilities, such as turning on computer microphones and cameras, accessing private networks, looking through files within a network or computer, accessing private data and surveilling activities, among many others. He also noted malware can unleash ransomware, which is when data on a computer is locked until the attacker receives financial payment from the victim.</p>
<p>“The question is: What can software do? What sort of data is the malware able to gain access to? What permissions is it able to run as?” he said. “What can malware do? … Whatever a computer can do, whatever permissions they get — that’s what they can start doing.”</p>
<p>He also noted that malware can be stealthy.</p>
<p>“Once you’re infected with malware, especially malware that was able to gain high levels of privilege, it can be really, really difficult to identify that malware is even there and to know that you’ve actually removed it,” Levin said.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Concerns could lead to more hurdles for public</h4>

	
<p>In her post last week, Anderson urged state and county officials to “be aware that no system is infallible and all are vulnerable to malicious cyber attacks.”</p>
<p>“It is important to be vigilant of suspicious links or attachments that could contain … malware. If a PIA link or attachment is sent in an email, it is recommended to request that the sender resends the PIA request within the body of an email,” she said.</p>
<p>The increased scrutiny on PIA requests for the sake of cyber security could create additional hurdles for Marylanders to get their legitimate requests for information through, said Rebecca Snyder, executive director of the Maryland-Delaware-D.C. Press Association. She said that fears of phishing attempts could be used as a “loophole” to slow down the process of fulfilling PIA requests.</p>
<p>“It whittles out people who are legitimately looking for information,” she said. “So the risk there, they get disenfranchised, they get demoralized, they feel like no one is going to get back to them.</p>
<p>“When the recommendation is to resend the request in the body of the email instead of as an attachments … I think it just creates another loophole,” she said. “It just feels like it can be a tool, when there’s not always a lot of trust between (PIA) custodians and requesters to begin with.”</p>
<p>But Snyder conceded that she doesn’t think “there’s anything to be done about it.”</p>
<p>“We also do have to guard against phishing attacks and things like that,” she said. She believes cyber-security incidents are happening more frequently, and that protecting against malware scams in PIA requests is a valid concern.</p>
<p>“Internet and email are not as firmly trusted as they used to be, just because there are so many threats,” she said.</p>

That hasn’t stopped Congress, state legislatures, and the U.S. surgeon general from moving ahead with age bans and warning labels for YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram.</p>
<p>But the emphasis on fears about social media may cause policymakers to miss the mental health benefits it provides teenagers, say researchers, pediatricians, and the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine.</p>
<p>In June, Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, the nation’s top doctor, called for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/17/opinion/social-media-health-warning.html" target="_blank">warning labels</a> on social media platforms. The Senate approved the bipartisan <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/1409/text" target="_blank">Kids Online Safety Act</a> and a companion bill, the Children and Teens’ Online Privacy Protection Act, on July 30. And at least 30 states have <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/technology-and-communication/social-media-and-children-2024-legislation" target="_blank">pending legislation</a> relating to children and social media — from age bans and parental consent requirements to new digital and media literacy courses for K-12 students.</p>
<p>Most research suggests that some features of social media can be harmful: Algorithmically driven content can distort reality and spread misinformation; incessant notifications distract attention and disrupt sleep; and the anonymity that sites offer can embolden cyberbullies.</p>
<p>But social media can also be helpful for some young people, said <a href="https://www.wcwonline.org/Active-Researchers/linda-charmaraman-phd" target="_blank">Linda Charmaraman</a>, a research scientist and director of the Youth, Media &amp; Wellbeing Research Lab at Wellesley Centers for Women.</p>
<p>For children of color and LGBTQ+ young people — and others who may not see themselves represented broadly in society — social media can reduce isolation, according to Charmaraman’s research, which was published in the <a href="https://www.teensandtech.org/handbook/" target="_blank">Handbook of Adolescent Digital Media Use and Mental Health</a>. Age bans, she said, could disproportionately affect these marginalized groups, who also spend more time on the platforms.</p>
<p>“You think at first, ‘That’s terrible. We need to get them off it,’” she said. “But when you find out why they’re doing it, it’s because it helps bring them a sense of identity affirmation when there’s something lacking in real life.”</p>
<p>Arianne McCullough, 17, said she uses Instagram to connect with Black students like herself at Willamette University, where about 2% of students are Black.</p>
<p>“I know how isolating it can be feeling like you’re the only Black person, or any minority, in one space,” said McCullough, a freshman from Sacramento, California. “So, having someone I can text real quick and just say, ‘Let’s go hang out,’ is important.”</p>

<p>After about a month at Willamette, which is in Salem, Oregon, McCullough assembled a social network with other Black students. “We’re all in a little group chat,” she said. “We talk and make plans.”</p>
<p>Social media hasn’t always been this useful for McCullough. After California schools closed during the pandemic, McCullough said, she stopped competing in soccer and track. She gained weight, she said, and her social media feed was constantly promoting at-home workouts and fasting diets.</p>
<p>“That’s where the body comparisons came in,” McCullough said, noting that she felt more irritable, distracted, and sad. “I was comparing myself to other people and things that I wasn’t self-conscious of before.”</p>
<p>When her mother tried to take away the smartphone, McCullough responded with an emotional outburst. “It was definitely addictive,” said her mother, Rayvn McCullough, 38, of Sacramento.</p>
<p>Arianne said she eventually felt happier and more like herself once she cut back on her use of social media.</p>
<p>But the fear of missing out eventually crept back in, Arianne said. “I missed seeing what my friends were doing and having easy, fast communication with them.”</p>
<p>For a decade before the covid-19 pandemic triggered what the American Academy of Pediatrics and other medical groups declared “<a href="https://www.aap.org/en/advocacy/child-and-adolescent-healthy-mental-development/aap-aacap-cha-declaration-of-a-national-emergency-in-child-and-adolescent-mental-health/" target="_blank">a national emergency in child and adolescent mental health</a>,” greater numbers of young people had been struggling with their mental health.</p>
<p>More young people were reporting feelings of hopelessness and sadness, as well as suicidal thoughts and behavior, according to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/data/yrbs/index.htm" target="_blank">behavioral surveys</a> of students in grades nine through 12 conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
<p>The greater use of immersive social media — like the never-ending scroll of videos on YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram — has been blamed for contributing to the crisis. But a committee of the national academies found that the relationship between social media and youth mental health is complex, with potential benefits as well as harms. Evidence of social media’s effect on child well-being remains limited, the <a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/27396/social-media-and-adolescent-health" target="_blank">committee reported this year</a>, while calling on the National Institutes of Health and other research groups to prioritize funding such studies.</p>
<p>In its report, the committee <a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/morning-breakout/utah-law-requires-parental-permission-for-kids-to-use-social-media/" target="_blank">cited legislation</a> in Utah last year that places age and time limits on young people’s use of social media and warned that the policy could backfire.</p>
<p>“The legislators’ intent to protect time for sleep and schoolwork and to prevent at least some compulsive use could just as easily have unintended consequences, perhaps isolating young people from their support systems when they need them,” the report said.</p>
<p>Some states have considered policies that echo the national academies’ recommendations. For instance, <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/youngkin-recommends-tighter-parental-approvals-for-children-accessing-websites/">Virginia</a> and Maryland have adopted legislation that prohibits social media companies from selling or disclosing children’s personal data and requires platforms to default to privacy settings. Other states, including Colorado, Georgia, and West Virginia, have created curricula about the mental health effects of using social media for students in public schools, which the national academies also recommended.</p>

<p>The Kids Online Safety Act, which is now before the House of Representatives, would require parental consent for social media users younger than 13 and impose on companies a “duty of care” to protect users younger than 17 from harm, including anxiety, depression, and suicidal behavior. The second bill, the Children and Teens’ Online Privacy Protection Act, would ban platforms from targeting ads toward minors and collecting personal data on young people.</p>
<p>Attorneys general in California, Louisiana, Minnesota, and dozens of other <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/meta-sued-facebook-instagram-children-teens-harm-mental-health/" target="_blank">states have filed lawsuits</a> in federal and state courts alleging that Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, misled the public about the dangers of social media for young people and ignored the potential damage to their mental health.</p>
<p>Most social media companies require users to be at least 13, and the sites often include safety features, like blocking adults from messaging minors and defaulting minors’ accounts to privacy settings.</p>
<p>Despite existing policies, the Department of Justice says some social media companies don’t follow their own rules. On Aug. 2, it sued the parent company of TikTok for allegedly violating child privacy laws, saying the company knowingly let children younger than 13 on the platform, and collected data on their use.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/10/31/81-of-us-adults-versus-46-of-teens-favor-parental-consent-for-minors-to-use-social-media/" target="_blank">Surveys show</a> that age restrictions and parental consent requirements have popular support among adults.</p>
<p><a href="https://netchoice.org/" target="_blank">NetChoice</a>, an industry group whose members include Meta and Alphabet, which owns Google and YouTube, has filed <a href="https://netchoice.org/category/netchoice-cases/" target="_blank">lawsuits against at least eight states</a>, seeking to stop or overturn laws that impose age limits, verification requirements, and other policies aimed at protecting children.</p>
<p>Much of social media’s effect can depend on the content children consume and the features that keep them engaged with a platform, said <a href="https://midas.umich.edu/faculty-member/jenny-radesky/" target="_blank">Jenny Radesky</a>, a physician and a co-director of the American Academy of Pediatrics’ <a href="https://www.aap.org/en/patient-care/media-and-children/center-of-excellence-on-social-media-and-youth-mental-health/" target="_blank">Center of Excellence on Social Media and Youth Mental Health</a>.</p>
<p>Age bans, parental consent requirements, and other proposals may be well-meaning, she said, but they do not address what she considers to be “the real mechanism of harm”: business models that aim to keep young people posting, scrolling, and purchasing.</p>
<p>“We’ve kind of created this system that’s not well designed to promote youth mental health,” Radesky said. “It’s designed to make lots of money for these platforms.”</p>

<p>WASHINGTON — Legislation aimed at protecting children online sailed through the U.S. Senate Tuesday, marking what could be the first update since the late 1990s for companies who interact with minors on the internet.</p>
<p>Senators approved the package of two bills in <a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_votes/vote1182/vote_118_2_00221.htm" target="_blank">a 91-3 vote</a>, a rare bipartisan landslide in the tightly divided body, despite loud and fervent opposition from civil liberties and LGBTQ organizations that say the measures would hand the government power to subjectively censor content.</p>
<p>The three no votes were cast by Republicans Mike Lee of Utah and Rand Paul of Kentucky and Democrat Ron Wyden of Oregon.</p>
<p>If passed by the House, the <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/protection-kids-social-media-platforms-advances-us-senate" target="_blank">legislative package would require</a> producers of platforms popular among children and teens to follow new rules governing advertising, algorithms and collection of personal data.</p>
<p>House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has expressed interest in “working to find consensus in the House.”</p>
<p>President Joe Biden released a statement Tuesday calling the Senate vote a “crucial bipartisan step forward” and said the bill dovetails with measures he advocated for in his first State of the Union Address.</p>
<p>“There is undeniable evidence that social media and other online platforms contribute to our youth mental health crisis. Today our children are subjected to a wild west online and our current laws and regulations are insufficient to prevent this. It is past time to act,” Biden said, adding that tech companies need to be “accountable for the national experiment they are running on our children for profit.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Families asked for federal help</h4>

	
<p>The package contains two bills moving together: the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/1628/cosponsors?s=1&amp;r=1&amp;q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22children+and+teens+online+privacy+protection+act%22%2C%22children%22%2C%22and%22%2C%22teens%22%2C%22online%22%2C%22privacy%22%2C%22protection%22%2C%22act%22%5D%7D" target="_blank">Children and Teens Online Privacy Protection Act</a>, which is mainly targeted at regulating the collection of personal data, and the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/1409/cosponsors" target="_blank">Kids Online Safety Act</a>, a bill that has been a lightning rod of criticism from outside groups.</p>
<p>A bipartisan group of senators points to <a href="https://www.congress.gov/event/117th-congress/senate-event/330808/text" target="_blank">years</a> <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-gop-takes-aim-fake-pills-containing-deadly-fentanyl-sold-social-media" target="_blank">of</a> <a href="https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/committee-activity/hearings/big-tech-and-the-online-child-sexual-exploitation-crisis" target="_blank">hearings</a> and meetings with tragedy-struck families — including those whose children struggled with eating disorders and died by suicide — as the motivation behind the proposals.</p>
<p>Sen. Marsha Blackburn, of Tennessee, one of the Kids Online Safety Act’s original sponsors, said the legislation is a “safety by design bill, a duty of care bill that gives kids and parents a toolbox so that they can protect themselves.”</p>
<p>“A message that we’re sending to big tech: kids are not your product, kids are not your profit source, and we are going to protect them in the virtual space,” Blackburn, a Republican, said at a press conference following the vote.</p>
<p>Blackburn co-led the bill dubbed the Kids Online Safety Act with Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut.</p>
<p>Sen. Ed Markey, who championed the last protections passed by Congress in late 1990s, said “back in 1998 only birds tweeted, a gram was a measurement of weight, and so we need to update the law.”</p>
<p>The Massachusetts Democrat joined Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana in co-sponsoring the Children and Teens’ Online Privacy Protection Act.</p>
<p>Markey likened addictive social media products to those of the tobacco industry in previous decades, and cited public health warnings attributing increasing childhood mental health issues to the platforms.</p>
<p>“So we have to give the tools to parents and to teenagers and children to be able to protect themselves, and that would be my message to my colleagues in the House. We cannot avoid this historic moment,” Markey said at the press conference.</p>
<p>Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer praised the legislation’s passage in the Senate and said the parents of affected teens are “the reason we succeeded today.”</p>
<p>“I’ve heard the terrible stories: children, teenagers, perfectly normal, then some algorithm captures them online by accident, and they end up committing suicide shortly thereafter,” the New York Democrat said in a statement. “You imagine being a parent and living with that.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">New rules for platforms</h4>

	
<p>The original two bills, rolled into one legislative vehicle, respectively outline “duty of care” rules requiring platform creators to consider broad mental health categories when designing and operating their products as well as a prohibition of the use of personal data for targeted marketing.</p>
<p>The legislation would also mandate that platforms create an “easy-to-understand privacy dashboard” detailing how a minor’s personal information is collected, used and protected.</p>
<p>Other measures would include a prohibition on hidden algorithms, mechanisms for minors or parents to remove data, parental controls to restrict financial transactions and annual public reports from the platforms on “reasonably foreseeable” harms to children and teens and efforts underway to prevent them.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Enforcement</h4>

	
<p>The new policies, if enacted, would be enforced by the Federal Trade Commission and any civil actions would be prosecuted by states in U.S. district court with advance notice to the FTC.</p>
<p>The legislation defines the online platforms as public-facing websites, social media applications, video games, messaging applications or video streaming services that are “used, or reasonably likely to be used, by a minor.”</p>
<p>Snap, the company behind the popular platform Snapchat, issued a statement specifically praising the Senate’s passage of the Kids Online Safety Act.</p>
<p>“The safety and well-being of young people on Snapchat is a top priority,” a Snap spokesperson said in a statement provided to States Newsroom. “That’s why Snap has been a long-time supporter of the Kids Online Safety Act. We applaud Senators Blackburn, Blumenthal and the roughly 70 other co-sponsors of this critical legislation for their leadership and commitment to the privacy and safety of young people.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Opponents see ‘dangerous’ measure</h4>

	
<p>A coalition of organizations advocating for First Amendment rights, privacy and the interests of LGBTQ minors urged the House to vote no on the legislation, criticizing it as “blatantly unconstitutional.”</p>
<p>Evan Greer, director of the tech policy group Fight For the Future, also lambasted the bill as “dangerous and misguided” and “wildly broad.”</p>
<p>The coalition largely takes issue with the Kids Online Safety Act’s “duty of care” provision that requires companies to “prevent and mitigate” harms associated with anxiety, depression, eating disorders, substance use disorders and suicidal behaviors.</p>
<p>During a joint virtual press conference hosted by the groups during the Senate vote, Greer described the provision as “a blank check for censorship of any piece of content that an administration could claim is harmful to kids.”</p>
<p>“What that means in practice, is that for example, a Trump administration FTC would get to dictate what types of content platforms can recommend or even show to younger users,” Greer said, referring to Republican presidential nominee and former President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Jenna Leventoff, senior policy counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union, said the Kids Online Safety Act is “nothing more than a thinly veiled effort to censor information that some consider objectionable”</p>
<p>“If enacted, KOSA could lead to information about health care, gender, identity, politics and more being removed from social media. And kids note that censorship will make them less and not more safe,” Leventoff said. “As one student recently told me, they don’t get sex education in school, and if information about sex is removed from the internet because platforms fear liability for hosting it, how else can they learn about sex?”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Teens in opposition</h4>

	
<p>The ACLU brought roughly 300 teens to Capitol Hill Thursday to lobby against the legislation.</p>
<p>Dara Adkinson, of the organization TransOhio, said the legislation is “truly terrifying.”</p>
<p>Adkinson questioned whether state and federal authorities could argue that content about climate change or the nation’s history of slavery causes anxiety and should therefore be regulated.</p>
<p>Regarding content about transgender youth, Adkinson said: “We know there (are) people out there that would like us to not exist and having the lack of visibility of the kinds of resources found on the internet is the first step for many of these folks.”</p>
<p>Greer said the coalition is concerned about the role of “big tech” in society. Advocates would support a “heavily modified” version of the Kids Online Safety Act that focuses on regulating business practices, including targeted advertising or videos that automatically play and encourage continuous, addictive scrolling habits.</p>
<p>Greer said their organization is neutral on the legislation targeted at protecting children’s privacy, but that they would like to see comprehensive legislation that protects minors and adults alike.</p>
<p>“Censorship and privacy do not go together, and these should not be moving together,” Greer said.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Others use them to record events in school and post them on various platforms. The resulting videos aren’t always positive: Earlier this month, a Pennsylvania school district acknowledged that several middle school students had made fake TikTok accounts impersonating their teachers, “and apparently made some posts using racist, homophobic and sexually explicit language” according to NPR. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I hate TikTok,” said Oveta Scott, a teacher in Northern Virginia, at a Thursday listening session hosted by the state’s education department about the proposed cell phone ban in schools. “If I hear another TikTok challenge where they are destroying the bathroom, making noises in class, chirping like birds, I go insane, and I can’t take it anymore.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But she said she understands some circumstances in which a child needs a cell phone including for health reasons. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last Thursday’s listening session was the first of several seeking public input on the future cell phone-free policies and procedures, which school boards must adopt by Jan. 1, 2025, or before. Some of Virginia’s school boards have already begun banning or restricting cell phone use in schools.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The initiative is spearheaded by the Virginia Department of Education, the Departments of Health, and Health and Human Services as part of Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s executive order signed earlier this month that requires the departments to create guidelines to limit students’ time in front of “addictive” cell phones and eliminate “clear distractions” in the classroom. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Democrats also </span><a href="https://x.com/ssurovell/status/1811120474275074425" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on July 10 the creation of a Senate Democratic workgroup on school mobile phone policy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many said teacher input on the forthcoming policies is vital to eliminating distractions at a time when questions are circulating about the use of technology in schools and artificial intelligence’s impact on learning. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I certainly am not opposed to a ban. I just think it&#8217;s a bandaid for a much bigger issue that we have in public education that speaks to so many things about how we&#8217;re able to hire amazing teachers and retain them,” Del. Laura Cohen, D-Fairfax, a former preschool teacher and school board member.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The benefits: technology tools, expanded internet access</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While cell phones are often considered a distraction for students, researchers and professors say they also have their share of benefits and tools that can help with students’ studies, like language translators, rulers and calculators. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There&#8217;s reasons we should be concerned about cell phones as distractions to learning, but they&#8217;re also very powerful learning tools potentially, you know, their access to information,” said Jesse Senechal, executive director for the </span><a href="https://soe.vcu.edu/centers/-institute-for-collaborative-research-and-evaluation/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Institute for Collaborative Research and Evaluation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the School of Education at Virginia Commonwealth University.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senechal said that cell phones offer support in some cases when schools have a limited number of computers and internet access. He said policies could also create broader equity issues in how marginalized students are disciplined in contrast to socio-economic privileged students. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leon Rouson, a professor in the School of Education at Norfolk State University, said the phones also allow students to do research without a computer or laptop, which is helpful for high school students he assists in preparing for college during the summer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If we say ‘no cell phones, ‘get rid of them,’ ‘throw them out,’ ‘they should not exist’ — I think we would also be creating some disconnection,” Rouson said.</span></p>
<p><b>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The challenges: Enforcement questions, negative impacts on some learners</h4>

	 </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Teachers have also questioned who will enforce cell phone restrictions. Some are worried that the restrictions will create additional responsibilities for teachers and contribute to further burnout.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2022, a Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission study found that increased workloads and behavioral and mental health issues among students were some of the factors leading teachers to leave the career field.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Researchers also found that teachers were dissatisfied with the lack of respect from parents and the public.</span></p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Virginia report shows more teachers leaving the workforce than entering it&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/11/07/virginia-report-shows-more-teachers-leaving-the-workforce-than-entering-it/embed/#?secret=aK3MnJNXKg#?secret=vA7XB2lVXo" data-secret="vA7XB2lVXo" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If students are simply told not to have cell phones out during class, then teachers become the cell phone police,” said Nancy Bradley, a Salem City School Board member and associate director for the Office of Academic Programs at Virginia Tech. “As they are trying to teach, they are also trying to monitor which students are on their cell phone and asking that they put the cell phones away or taking the cell phones from these students. It is not a productive use of instructional time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While studying teacher burnout and their well-being, Tim Pressley, associate professor in the Department of Psychology at Christopher Newport University, found that student behavior has “drastically changed” since returning to in-person learning due to the pandemic. Further research found that students relied heavily on their phones, scrolling through social media and talking through classroom lessons.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Technology is kind of just getting out of hand with students using it,” Pressley said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Critics are concerned that parents’ and students’ anxieties about special learners’ needs and gun violence in schools will increase if policies restrict cell phones in schools. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cohen raised similar concerns after an unsuccessful </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB28" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cell phone bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was returned to the House Education Committee for review in March. She said the bill could have negatively impacted English Language Learners and students with disabilities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill would have empowered local boards to prohibit cell phones and other “handheld communication devices” such as Chromebooks, which can be used to message other students during class.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want to make sure … that we are not doing anything to stigmatize or not support our students with disabilities,” Cohen said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cohen said another common reason parents want their children to have their cell phones is in case of a school emergency, such as a school shooting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Public alarm about gun violence in Virginia schools was heightened after a then-six-year-old student brought a firearm from home to his Newport News elementary school and shot his teacher. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Providing assurance to parents that even if their child doesn’t have their cell phone on them during the school day, that they will receive communication from the school regarding emergency situations, is an important component to get them to buy into the changes to cell phone policies,” Bradley said. “I do think that’s probably going to be one of the tougher hurdles to overcome.”</span></p>

In the absence of federal action, states are increasingly striking out on their own to regulate artificial intelligence and other automated systems. (Leon Neal/Getty Images)</p><p>As congressional sessions have passed without any new federal artificial intelligence laws, state legislators are striking out on their own to regulate the technologies in the meantime.</p>
<p>Colorado just <a href="https://coloradonewsline.com/briefs/colorado-first-state-artificial-intelligence-regulations/" target="_blank">signed into effect</a> one of the most sweeping regulatory laws in the country, which sets guardrails for companies that develop and use AI. Its focus is mitigating consumer harm and discrimination by AI systems, and Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat, said he hopes the conversations will continue on the state and federal level.</p>
<p>Other states, <a href="https://sourcenm.com/2024/03/20/how-nm-will-enforce-the-new-deepfake-disclosure-law/" target="_blank">like New Mexico</a>, have focused on regulating how computer generated images can appear in media and political campaigns. Some,<a href="https://www.legis.iowa.gov/legislation/BillBook?ga=90&amp;ba=HF2240" target="_blank"> like Iowa</a>, have criminalized sexually charged computer-generated images, especially when they portray children.</p>
<p>“We can’t just sit and wait,” Delaware state Rep. Krista Griffith, D-Wilmington, who has sponsored AI regulation, told States Newsroom. “These are issues that our constituents are demanding protections on, rightfully so.”</p>
<p>Griffith is the sponsor of the <a href="https://legis.delaware.gov/BillDetail?LegislationId=140388" target="_blank">Delaware Personal Data Privacy Act</a>, which was signed last year, and will take effect on Jan. 1, 2025. The law will give residents the right to know what information is being collected by companies, correct any inaccuracies in data or request to have that data deleted. The bill is similar to other state laws around the country that address how personal data can be used.</p>
<p>There’s been no shortage of tech regulation bills in Congress, but none have passed. The <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/artificial-intelligence-legislation-tracker" target="_blank">118th Congress saw bills</a> relating to imposing restrictions on artificial intelligence models that are deemed high risk, creating regulatory authorities to oversee AI development, imposing transparency requirements on evolving technologies and protecting consumers through liability measures.</p>
<p>In April, a new draft of the <a href="https://www.commerce.senate.gov/services/files/E7D2864C-64C3-49D3-BC1E-6AB41DE863F5#:~:text=The%20Act%20would%20prohibit%20the,against%20violations%20of%20the%20Act." target="_blank">American Privacy Rights act of 2024 </a>was introduced, and in May, the Bipartisan Senate Artificial Intelligence Working Group released a <a href="https://www.schumer.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Roadmap_Electronic1.32pm.pdf" target="_blank">roadmap for AI policy </a>which aims to support federal investment in AI while safeguarding the risks of the technology.</p>
<p>Griffith also introduced a bill this year to create the Delaware Artificial Intelligence Commission, and said that if the state stands idly by, they’ll fall behind on these already quickly evolving technologies.</p>
<p>“The longer we wait, the more behind we are in understanding how it’s being utilized, stopping or preventing potential damage from happening, or even not being able to harness some of the efficiency that comes with it that might help government services and might help individuals live better lives,” Griffith said.</p>
<p>States have been legislating about AI <a href="https://oklahomavoice.com/2023/10/20/oklahoma-lawmakers-struggle-to-tackle-artificial-intelligence-regulations/" target="_blank">since at least 2019</a>, but bills relating to AI have increased significantly in the last two years. From January through June of this year, there have been <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/firehose-information-confronts-legislators-studying-internet-use-children-and-ai" target="_blank">more than 300 introduced</a>, said Heather Morton, who tracks state legislation as an analyst for the nonpartisan National Conference of State Legislatures.</p>
<p>Also so far this year, 11 new states have enacted laws about how to use, regulate or place checks and balances on AI, bringing the total to 28 states with AI legislation.</p>
<p><strong>How are everyday people interacting with AI?</strong></p>
<p>Technologists have been experimenting with decision-making algorithms for decades — early frameworks date back to the 1950s. But generative AI, which can generate images, language, and responses to prompts in seconds, is what’s driven the industry in the last few years.</p>
<p>Many Americans have been interacting with artificial intelligence their whole lives, and industries like banking, marketing and entertainment have built much of their modern business practices upon AI systems. These technologies have become the backbone of huge developments like power grids and space exploration.</p>
<p>Most people are more aware of their smaller uses, like a company’s online customer service chatbot or asking their Alexa or Google Assistant devices for information about the weather.</p>
<p>Rachel Wright, a policy analyst for the Council of State Governments, pinpointed a potential turning point in the public consciousness of AI, which may have <a href="https://stateline.org/2023/10/05/what-is-artificial-intelligence-legislators-are-still-looking-for-a-definition/" data-type="link" data-id="https://stateline.org/2023/10/05/what-is-artificial-intelligence-legislators-are-still-looking-for-a-definition/" target="_blank">added urgency for legislators to act</a>.</p>
<p>“I think 2022 is a big year because of ChatGPT,” Wright said. “It was kind of the first point in which members of the public were really interacting with an AI system or a generative AI system, like ChatGPT, for the first time.”</p>
<p><strong>Competing interests: Industry vs privacy </strong></p>
<p>Andrew Gamino-Cheong cofounded AI governance management platform Trustible early last year as the states began to pump out legislation. The platform helps organizations identify risky uses of AI and comply with regulations that have already been put in place.</p>
<p>Both state and federal legislators understand the risk in passing new AI laws: too many regulations on AI can be seen as stifling innovation, while unchecked AI could raise privacy problems or perpetuate discrimination.</p>
<p>Colorado’s law is an example of this — it applies to developers on “high-risk” systems which make consequential decisions relating to hiring, banking and housing. It says these developers have a responsibility to avoid creating algorithms that could have biases against certain groups or traits. The law dictates that instances of this “algorithmic discrimination” need to be reported to the attorney general’s office.</p>
<p>At the time, Logan Cerkovnik, the founder and CEO of Denver-based Thumper.ai, <a href="https://coloradonewsline.com/briefs/colorado-first-state-artificial-intelligence-regulations/" target="_blank">called the bill </a>“wide-reaching” but well-intentioned, saying his developers will have to think about how the major social changes in the bill are supposed to work.</p>
<p>“Are we shifting from actual discrimination to the risk of discrimination before it happens?” he added.</p>
<p>But Delaware’s Rep. Griffith said that these life-changing decisions, like getting approved for a mortgage, should be transparent and traceable. If she’s denied a mortgage due to a mistake in an algorithm, how could she appeal?</p>
<p>“I think that also helps us understand where the technology is going wrong,” she said. “We need to know where it’s going right, but we also have to understand where it’s going wrong.”</p>
<p>Some who work in the development of big tech see federal or state regulations of AI as potentially stifling to innovation. But Gamino-Cheong said he actually thinks some of this “patchwork” legislation by states could create pressure  for some clear federal action from lawmakers who see AI as a huge growth area for the U.S.</p>
<p>“I think that’s one area where the privacy and AI discussions could diverge a little bit, that there’s a competitive, even national security angle, to investing in AI,” he said.</p>
<p><strong>How are states regulating AI? </strong></p>
<p>Wright published research late last year on <a href="https://www.csg.org/2023/12/06/artificial-intelligence-in-the-states-emerging-legislation/" target="_blank">AI’s role in the states</a>, categorizing the approaches states were using to create protections around the technology. Many of the 29 laws enacted at that point focused on creating avenues for stakeholder groups to meet and collaborate on how to use and regulate AI. Others recognize possible innovations enabled by AI, but regulate data privacy.</p>
<p>Transparency, protection from discrimination and accountability are other major themes in the states’ legislation. Since the start of 2024, laws that touch on the use of AI in political campaigns, schooling, crime data, sexual offenses and deepfakes — convincing computer-generated likenesses – have been passed, broadening the scope in how a law can regulate AI. Now, 28 states have passed nearly 60 laws.</p>
<p>Here’s a look at where legislation stands in July 2024, in broad categorization:</p>
<p><strong>Interdisciplinary collaboration and oversight</strong></p>
<p>Many states have enacted laws that bring together lawmakers, tech industry professionals, academics and business owners to oversee and consult on the design, development and use of AI. Sometimes in the form of councils or working groups, they are often on the lookout for unintended, yet foreseeable, impacts of unsafe or ineffective AI systems. This includes Alabama (<a href="https://legiscan.com/AL/bill/SB78/2021" target="_blank">SB 78</a>), Illinois (<a href="https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/BillStatus.asp?DocNum=3563&amp;GAID=17&amp;DocTypeID=HB&amp;SessionID=112&amp;GA=103" target="_blank">HB 3563</a>), Indiana (<a href="https://custom.statenet.com/public/resources.cgi?mode=show_text&amp;id=ID:bill:IN2024000S150&amp;verid=IN2024000S150_20240313_0_EF&amp;" target="_blank">S 150</a>), New York (<a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/A4969" target="_blank">AB A4969</a>, <a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2019/S3971#:~:text=2019-S3971%20-%20Summary,automation;%20and%20repeals%20such%20commission." target="_blank">SB S3971B</a> and <a href="https://custom.statenet.com/public/resources.cgi?mode=show_text&amp;id=ID:bill:NY2023000A8808&amp;verid=NY2023000A8808_20240418_0_A&amp;" target="_blank">A 8808</a>), Texas (<a href="https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=88R&amp;Bill=HB2060" target="_blank">HB 2060</a>, 2023), Vermont (<a href="https://legislature.vermont.gov/Documents/2018/Docs/ACTS/ACT137/ACT137%20As%20Enacted.pdf" target="_blank">HB 378</a> and <a href="https://legislature.vermont.gov/bill/status/2022/H.410" target="_blank">HB 410</a>), California (<a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billStatusClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240AB302" target="_blank">AB 302</a>), Louisiana (<a href="https://www.legis.la.gov/legis/BillInfo.aspx?s=23rs&amp;b=SCR49&amp;sbi=y" target="_blank">SCR 49</a>), Oregon (<a href="http://custom.statenet.com/public/resources.cgi?id=ID:bill:OR2024000H4153&amp;cuiq=93d84396-c63b-526a-b152-38b7f79b4cfd&amp;client_md=e4f6fea4-27b4-5d41-b7d3-766fe52569f0" target="_blank">H 4153</a>), Colorado (<a href="https://coloradonewsline.com/briefs/colorado-first-state-artificial-intelligence-regulations/" target="_blank">SB 24-205</a>), Louisiana (<a href="https://www.legis.la.gov/legis/BillInfo.aspx?s=23rs&amp;b=SCR49&amp;sbi=y" target="_blank">SCR 49</a>), Maryland (<a href="http://custom.statenet.com/public/resources.cgi?id=ID:bill:MD2024000S818&amp;cuiq=93d84396-c63b-526a-b152-38b7f79b4cfd&amp;client_md=e4f6fea4-27b4-5d41-b7d3-766fe52569f0" target="_blank">S 818</a>), Tennessee (<a href="http://custom.statenet.com/public/resources.cgi?id=ID:bill:TN2023000H2325&amp;cuiq=93d84396-c63b-526a-b152-38b7f79b4cfd&amp;client_md=e4f6fea4-27b4-5d41-b7d3-766fe52569f0" target="_blank">H 2325</a>), Texas (<a href="https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=88R&amp;Bill=HB2060" target="_blank">HB 2060</a>), Virginia (<a href="http://custom.statenet.com/public/resources.cgi?id=ID:bill:VA2024000S487&amp;cuiq=93d84396-c63b-526a-b152-38b7f79b4cfd&amp;client_md=e4f6fea4-27b4-5d41-b7d3-766fe52569f0" target="_blank">S 487</a>), Wisconsin (<a href="http://custom.statenet.com/public/resources.cgi?id=ID:bill:WA2023000S5838&amp;cuiq=93d84396-c63b-526a-b152-38b7f79b4cfd&amp;client_md=e4f6fea4-27b4-5d41-b7d3-766fe52569f0" target="_blank">S 5838</a>) and West Virginia (<a href="http://custom.statenet.com/public/resources.cgi?id=ID:bill:WV2024000H5690&amp;cuiq=93d84396-c63b-526a-b152-38b7f79b4cfd&amp;client_md=e4f6fea4-27b4-5d41-b7d3-766fe52569f0" target="_blank">H 5690</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Data Privacy</strong></p>
<p>Second most common are laws that look at data privacy and protect individuals from misuse of consumer data. Commonly, these laws create regulations about how AI systems can collect data and what it can do with it. These states include California (<a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?division=3.&amp;part=4.&amp;lawCode=CIV&amp;title=1.81.5" target="_blank">AB 375</a>), Colorado (<a href="https://leg.colorado.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2021A/bills/2021a_190_rer.pdf" target="_blank">SB 21-190</a>), Connecticut (<a href="https://www.cga.ct.gov/2022/ACT/PA/PDF/2022PA-00015-R00SB-00006-PA.PDF" target="_blank">SB 6</a> and <a href="https://www.cga.ct.gov/asp/cgabillstatus/cgabillstatus.asp?selBillType=Bill&amp;bill_num=SB01103&amp;which_year=2023" target="_blank">SB 1103</a>), Delaware (<a href="https://legis.delaware.gov/BillDetail?LegislationId=140388" target="_blank">HB 154</a>), Indiana (<a href="https://iga.in.gov/legislative/2023/bills/senate/5/details" target="_blank">SB 5</a>), Iowa (<a href="https://www.legis.iowa.gov/legislation/BillBook?ga=90&amp;ba=SF262" target="_blank">SF 262</a>), Montana (<a href="https://leg.mt.gov/bills/2023/billpdf/SB0384.pdf" target="_blank">SB 384</a>), Oregon (<a href="https://olis.oregonlegislature.gov/liz/2023R1/Measures/Overview/SB619" target="_blank">SB 619</a>), Tennessee (<a href="https://wapp.capitol.tn.gov/apps/BillInfo/Default.aspx?BillNumber=SB0073" target="_blank">HB 1181</a>), Texas (<a href="https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=88R&amp;Bill=HB4" target="_blank">HB 4</a>), Utah (<a href="https://custom.statenet.com/public/resources.cgi?mode=show_text&amp;id=ID:bill:UT2024000S149&amp;verid=UT2024000S149_20240313_0_E&amp;" target="_blank">S 149</a>) and Virginia (<a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?211+sum+SB1392" target="_blank">SB 1392</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Transparency </strong></p>
<p>Some states have enacted laws that inform people that AI is being used. This is most commonly done by requiring businesses to disclose when and how it’s in use. For example, an employer may have to get permission from employees to use an AI system that collects data about them. These states have transparency laws: California (<a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB1001" target="_blank">SB 1001</a>), Florida (<a href="https://custom.statenet.com/public/resources.cgi?mode=show_text&amp;id=ID:bill:FL2024000S1680&amp;verid=FL2024000S1680_20240426_0_EI&amp;" target="_blank">S 1680</a>), Illinois (<a href="https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/BillStatus.asp?DocNum=2557&amp;GAID=15&amp;DocTypeID=HB&amp;SessionID=108&amp;GA=101" target="_blank">HB 2557</a>), and Maryland (<a href="https://mgaleg.maryland.gov/mgawebsite/Legislation/Details/HB1202?ys=2020RS" target="_blank">HB 1202</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Protection from discrimination </strong></p>
<p>These laws often require that AI systems are designed with equity in mind, and avoid “algorithmic discrimination,” where an AI system can contribute to different treatment of people based on race, ethnicity, sex, religion or disability, among other things. Often these laws play out in the criminal justice system, in hiring, in banking or other positions where a computer algorithm is making life-changing decisions. This includes California (<a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billStatusClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200SB36" target="_blank">SB 36</a>), Colorado (<a href="https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/sb21-169" target="_blank">SB 21-169</a>), Illinois (<a href="https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/BillStatus.asp?DocNum=53&amp;GAID=16&amp;DocTypeID=HB&amp;LegId=127865&amp;SessionID=110&amp;GA=102" target="_blank">HB 0053</a>), and Utah (<a href="https://custom.statenet.com/public/resources.cgi?mode=show_text&amp;id=ID:bill:UT2024000H366&amp;verid=UT2024000H366_20240313_0_E&amp;" target="_blank">H 366</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Elections </strong></p>
<p>Laws focusing on AI in elections have been passed in the last two years, and primarily either ban messaging and images created by AI or at least require specific disclaimers about the use of AI in campaign materials. This includes Alabama (<a href="https://custom.statenet.com/public/resources.cgi?mode=show_text&amp;id=ID:bill:AL2024000H172&amp;verid=AL2024000H172_20240515_0_E&amp;" target="_blank">HB 172</a>), Arizona (<a href="https://www.azleg.gov/legtext/56leg/2R/bills/HB2394H.pdf" target="_blank">HB 2394</a>), Idaho (<a href="https://legislature.idaho.gov/wp-content/uploads/sessioninfo/2024/legislation/H0664.pdf" target="_blank">HB 664</a>), Florida (<a href="https://custom.statenet.com/public/resources.cgi?mode=show_text&amp;id=ID:bill:FL2024000H919&amp;verid=FL2024000H919_20240426_0_EI&amp;" target="_blank">HB 919</a>), New Mexico (<a href="https://sourcenm.com/2024/03/20/how-nm-will-enforce-the-new-deepfake-disclosure-law/" target="_blank">HB 182</a>), Oregon (<a href="https://custom.statenet.com/public/resources.cgi?mode=show_text&amp;id=ID:bill:OR2024000S1571&amp;verid=OR2024000S1571_20240327_0_EF&amp;" target="_blank">SB 1571</a>), Utah (<a href="https://custom.statenet.com/public/resources.cgi?mode=show_text&amp;id=ID:bill:UT2024000S131&amp;verid=UT2024000S131_20240313_0_E&amp;" target="_blank">SB 131</a>), and Wisconsin (<a href="https://wisconsinexaminer.com/2024/03/22/evers-takes-action-on-election-related-measures-including-ai-and-poll-closures/" target="_blank">SB 664</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Schools</strong></p>
<p>States that have passed laws relating to AI in education mainly provide requirements for the use of AI tools. Florida (<a href="https://custom.statenet.com/public/resources.cgi?mode=show_text&amp;id=ID:bill:FL2024000H1361&amp;verid=FL2024000H1361_20240509_0_EI&amp;" target="_blank">HB 1361</a>) outlines how tools may be used to customize and accelerate learning, and Tennessee (<a href="http://custom.statenet.com/public/resources.cgi?id=ID:bill:TN2023000S1711&amp;cuiq=93d84396-c63b-526a-b152-38b7f79b4cfd&amp;client_md=e4f6fea4-27b4-5d41-b7d3-766fe52569f0" target="_blank">S 1711</a>) instructs schools to create an AI policy for the 2024-25 school year which describes how the board will enforce its policy.</p>
<p><strong>Computer-generated sexual images </strong></p>
<p>The states which have passed laws about computer-generated explicit images criminalize the creation of sexually explicit images of children with the use of AI. These include Iowa (<a href="https://www.legis.iowa.gov/legislation/BillBook?ga=90&amp;ba=HF2240" target="_blank">HF 2240)</a> and South Dakota (<a href="https://custom.statenet.com/public/resources.cgi?mode=show_text&amp;id=ID:bill:SD2024000S79&amp;verid=SD2024000S79_20240212_0_E&amp;" target="_blank">S 79</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Looking forward</strong></p>
<p>While most of the AI laws enacted have focused on protecting users from the harms of AI, many legislators are also excited by its potential.</p>
<p>A recent study by the <a href="https://www.weforum.org/publications/the-future-of-jobs-report-2020/in-full/executive-summary/" target="_blank">World Economic Forum</a> has found that artificial intelligence technologies could lead to the creation of about 97 million new jobs worldwide by 2025, outpacing the approximately 85 million jobs displaced to technology or machines.</p>
<p>Rep. Griffith is looking forward to digging more into the technologies’ capabilities in a working group, saying it’s challenging to legislate about technology that changes so rapidly, but it’s also fun.</p>
<p>“Sometimes the tendency when something’s complicated or challenging or difficult to understand is like, you just want to run and stick your head under the blanket,” she said. “But it’s like, everybody stop. Let’s look at it, let’s understand it, let’s read about it. Let’s have an honest discussion about how it’s being utilized and how it’s helping.”</p>

Airlines like American Airlines and Southwest Airlines reported difficulties with their systems, which rely on Microsoft services for operations. This photo shows flight delays on a flight information board at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport on Jan. 11, 2023 in Arlington, Virginia. (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)</p><p>Air travel, banking, media and hospital systems were just some of the industries affected by a bug in a software update that scrambled business operations for many globally on Friday.</p>
<p>Many of those who use Microsoft Windows likely experienced a “blue screen of death” or an error page. The issue was due to a single bug in a software update from cybersecurity company CrowdStrike, which provides antivirus software for Microsoft users.</p>
<p>The company pushed out an update to the software overnight, and at 1:30 a.m. EST, CrowdStrike said its “Falcon Sensor” software was causing Microsoft Windows to crash and display a blue screen, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/global-cyber-outage-grounds-flights-hits-media-financial-telecoms-2024-07-19/" target="_blank">Reuters reported</a>.</p>
<p>CrowdStrike President and CEO George Kurtz released a statement early Friday morning<a href="https://x.com/George_Kurtz/status/1814235001745027317" target="_blank"> on X</a>, saying that the incident was not a security concern or a cyberattack. He added that the issue had been identified and that the company had been deploying a fix.</p>
<p>“We refer customers to the support portal for the latest updates and will continue to provide complete and continuous updates on our website,” Kurtz said.</p>
<p>The bug was causing major delays and cancellations at airports across the globe. Flight tracking data site <a href="https://www.flightaware.com/live/cancelled" target="_blank">FlightAware </a>noted nearly 24,000 delays and 2,300 cancellations globally by 9:30 a.m. Friday. While some airlines were able to resume operation of their digital systems, others found analogue solutions.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Transportation said it was monitoring the situation and suggested those experiencing travel delays and cancellations to use its <a href="http://flightrights.gov/" target="_blank">FlightRights.gov</a> website to help navigate their delays in travel.</p>
<p>Some states’ 911 and non-emergency lines were experiencing issues, including <a href="https://www.alaskasnewssource.com/2024/07/19/alaska-experiencing-statewide-911-outage/" target="_blank">Alaska</a>, <a href="https://wjla.com/news/local/microsoft-global-outage-metro-service-dc-virginia-maryland-fairfax-county-systems-down-impacts-it-tech-airports-dulles-regean-dca-iad-airlines-banks-media-reporting-issues-widespread-911-call-centers-police-fire-ems" target="_blank">Virginia</a> and <a href="https://www.nj.gov/governor/news/news/562024/approved/20240719a.shtml" target="_blank">New Jersey</a>.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The major tech snafu reverberated throughout Virginia, where 30% of Friday&#8217;s flights at </span><a href="https://x.com/Flack4RIC/status/1814338132315087125" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richmond International Airport </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">were canceled or delayed. At Dulles Airport in Northern Virginia, multiple airlines reported system outages &#8220;that are impacting flight operations,&#8221; according to a </span><a href="https://x.com/Dulles_Airport/status/1814231358241218935" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tweet</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> posted on the airport&#8217;s X account Friday. Metro&#8217;s website and some internal services were down Friday morning, as well as the MetroAccess call center. Various </span><a href="https://wjla.com/news/local/microsoft-global-outage-metro-service-dc-virginia-maryland-fairfax-county-systems-down-impacts-it-tech-airports-dulles-regean-dca-iad-airlines-banks-media-reporting-issues-widespread-911-call-centers-police-fire-ems" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hospitals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, businesses and emergency services across the commonwealth were also impacted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin released a statement on Friday morning that said the state assessed how the tech outages were unfolding in Virginia and found that &#8220;government administrative functions are experiencing disruptions, and we are coordinating with local, regional and federal authorities and private sector critical infrastructure partners in order to reestablish normal operations.&#8221; The governor asked the public to be patient amid delays as officials work to resolve the problems.</span></p>
<p>New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy released a statement early Friday morning saying that the state had activated its State Emergency Operations Center in response to the disruptions and has provided guidance to other agencies about how to work through the situation.</p>
<p>“We are also engaging county and local governments, 911 call centers, and utilities to assess the impact and offer our assistance.,” he said.</p>
<p>Microsoft released <a href="https://x.com/MSFT365Status/status/1814251159537729592?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1814251159537729592%7Ctwgr%5E5f8cc315987d34735a3ace896336faf95a49a44f%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2F6abc.com%2Fpost%2Fhow-global-outage-is-impacting-services-philadelphia%2F15070804%2F" target="_blank">a trouble shooting guide</a> on X early Friday morning.</p>
<p>By 10 a.m. Friday, some global companies were seeing relief in their outages. <a href="https://downdetector.com/" target="_blank">Downdetector</a>, which tracks real-time outages, showed companies like Visa, Zoom, UPS and Southwest Airlines gaining more normal operations than they were experiencing in the early morning hours.</p>
<p>Speaking to the hosts of Today this morning, Kurtz said he was “deeply sorry for the impact we’ve caused to customers, to travelers, to anyone affected.” He said some customers have been able to reboot and are seeing progress getting online, and that trend will likely continue throughout the day.</p>
<p>Effects from the global IT outage Friday continued to be felt throughout the day, especially by government systems and transportation hubs.</p>
<p>Courts in Massachusetts and New York experienced disrupted service, as court transcription recording systems were not operational in some Massachusetts courthouses, <a class="c-link" href="https://apnews.com/live/internet-global-outage-crowdstrike-microsoft-downtime" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://apnews.com/live/internet-global-outage-crowdstrike-microsoft-downtime" data-sk="tooltip_parent">the Associated Press reported.</a></p>
<p>The Texas Department of Public Safety, which runs its driver’s license offices, also closed their offices for the day, with “no current estimate” on when they will reopen.</p>
<p>Around 4 p.m. EST, Kurtz released more statements on X, reiterating that the outage was not a security breach.</p>
<p>“We understand the gravity of the situation and are deeply sorry for the inconvenience and disruption,” he said. “We are working with all impacted customers to ensure that systems are back up and they can deliver the services their customers are counting on.”</p>
<p>Kurtz said the company is working on a “technical update and root cause analysis” that they will share with customers, and shared <a class="c-link" href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/our-statement-on-todays-outage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/our-statement-on-todays-outage/" data-sk="tooltip_parent">a letter </a>that was sent to customers and partners.</p>

Artificial intelligence was in development for decades, during which time we fantasized about all the wonderful things it was going to do for us. And then the bots launched almost fully formed like Athena springing from the forehead of Zeus with her sword in hand, and only then did we have our epiphany: Oh man, this is not going to go well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What happened to the AI utopia? We were expecting self-driving cars that would let us drink too much on nights out while eliminating highway fatalities. We anticipated the seamless integration of all our devices and appliances, maybe even without cords! We imagined an unlocking of efficiencies at home and at work; medical breakthroughs; scientific innovation on steroids. We’d have three-day workweeks and go hiking on the weekends while the robots cooked and cleaned. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe these things are still there in our future, along with world peace, but so far what we’ve got is a new way for kids to cheat on homework, a lot of derivative art, pernicious deepfakes and raging arguments over intellectual property theft. Oh, and an unprecedented increase in the demand for electricity that threatens to overwhelm the grid and make it impossible for us to stop burning fossil fuels before global warming destabilizes societies worldwide. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The wonder is why we thought this would go well. Shouldn’t we have known ourselves better?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In my view, the biggest problem with AI is that either humans are in charge, or the robots are. If it’s the robots, there is a good chance they will decide to kill us all, and </span><a href="https://news.berkeley.edu/2024/04/09/how-to-keep-ai-from-killing-us-all/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">we won’t see it coming</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. So we need to root for the humans, who could use the powerful new tools of AI to address hunger and climate change but so far mostly use it for </span><a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/financial-services/financial-services-industry-predictions/2024/deepfake-banking-fraud-risk-on-the-rise.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">financial fraud</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/charlotte-child-sexual-abuse-material-case-shows-unsettling-reach-of-ai-generated-imagery" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">child pornography</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and adding to the absurd percentage of the internet </span><a href="https://blog.purestorage.com/perspectives/how-much-of-the-worlds-data-is-cat-content/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">devoted to cat memes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And instead of helping to lower CO2 emissions, right now the effect of AI is to increase the burning of fossil fuels. U.S. electricity consumption had </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/03/13/climate/electric-power-climate-change.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">flatlined</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after the mid-2000s, but AI is pushing it up again, and sharply. Data centers, where AI “lives,” could consume </span><a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/artificial-intelligence-doubles-data-center-demand-2030-EPRI/717467/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">as much as 9%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of U.S. electricity generation by 2030, double that of today. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have a close-up view of this in Virginia, the data center capital of the world. In 2022, when I first tried to quantify Virginia’s </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/12/09/virginia-has-a-data-center-problem/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">data center problem</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, industry sources put the state’s data center demand at 1,688 megawatts (MW) — equivalent to about 1.6 million homes. With the advent of AI and its enormous appetite for power, the industry added 4,000 MW of new data centers in 2023. By the end of last year, data centers </span><a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/dominion-connected-15-data-centers-totaling-933mw-in-virginia-in-2023-15-more-expected-in-2024/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">commanded fully 24%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the total electricity generated by Dominion Energy Virginia, the state’s largest utility. Over the next 15 years, Virginia’s data center demand is expected to </span><a href="https://www.pjm.com/-/media/library/reports-notices/load-forecast/2024-load-report.ashx" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">quadruple</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Citing the need to supply data centers with power, Dominion did an about-face on its </span><a href="https://esg.dominionenergy.com/assets/pdf/2022-Climate-Report.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050. It now </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/05/03/dominion-projects-new-gas-plants-advanced-nuclear-will-be-needed-to-meet-soaring-demand/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">proposes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to keep coal plants running past their previous retirement dates, and to build new gas-powered generation. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The problem is not confined to Virginia. Across the country, utilities are struggling to meet AI’s increased energy demand, and </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/03/13/climate/electric-power-climate-change.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">looking to fossil fuels</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to fill the gap. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And while tech companies talk a good game about meeting their power demand sustainably, the evidence says otherwise. Tech companies conspicuously </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/08/16/why-are-ratepayers-footing-the-bill-for-virginias-data-center-buildout/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">did not push back</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Dominion Energy’s plan, and their own efforts fall woefully short. Even Google, which has taken its carbon-cutting obligations more seriously than most companies, just reported a </span><a href="https://sustainabilitymag.com/articles/emissions-up-13-how-can-google-make-ai-data-sustainable" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">13% rise</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in its greenhouse gas emissions in 2023, thanks to its investments in AI and data centers.  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apparently, Google and its competitors in the race to dominate AI think meeting climate goals is like getting a loan from a bank; you emit more today, grow your business and use the profits to clear the debt by emitting a lot less tomorrow. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Mother Earth is not a bank. She is a loan shark, and she has started breaking fingers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we can’t rely on the inventors of AI to restrain their energy appetites, we have to turn to our politicians (sigh). Our leaders have to make and enforce limits on the growth of AI commensurate with the world’s ability to provide the resources without baking the planet. Admittedly, mustering that kind of willpower is hard to do in a country that has elevated corporations to personhood and defines the First Amendment to include both spreading lies and spending money to influence elections. </span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Y9aoRiEtAW"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/02/05/virginia-legislators-should-be-learning-all-they-can-about-ai/">Virginia legislators should be learning all they can about AI</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And that gets us to the second-biggest concern I have about AI, but the one that might upend society soonest: the unleashing of deepfakes in this fall’s elections, and the threat that the reins of government will go not to those most dedicated to tackling hard problems, but to those who prove themselves the biggest scoundrels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The American Bar Association (ABA) </span><a href="https://www.americanbar.org/groups/leadership/office_of_the_president/american-democracy/resources/deepfakes-american-elections/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">defines deepfakes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as “hoax images, sounds and videos</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">that convincingly depict people saying or doing things that they did not actually say or do.” Noting that they have already been used in election campaigns in the U.S. and abroad, the ABA is promoting model state legislation to criminalize the creation of malicious deepfakes. Meanwhile, tech companies including </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/google-require-disclosures-digitally-altered-content-election-ads-2024-07-01/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google and Meta</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have adopted advertising policies to require disclosures of altered content. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both approaches are good as far as they go; websites should police content, and states should act swiftly to outlaw the deepfakes (though the ABA lists very few that have done so yet). But in a high-stakes situation like an election, punishing violators after the fact – if you can catch them at all – is very much a case of closing the barn door after the horses are out. Once voters have been exposed to “evidence” of a candidate’s unfitness for office, especially when media coverage has primed them to believe the lies, the damage is done. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many voters, especially younger ones, are savvy enough to be wary of campaign-related materials generally, and of unattributed images that float around the internet in particular. But older people who came of age in the pre-internet-memes era are vulnerable to believing what they see and hear, and a lot of us won’t put ourselves to the trouble of questioning what feels true. A deepfake only has to fool some of the people some of the time to alter the results of an election.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But maybe I’m being needlessly alarmist about the dangers of AI, even if I have </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/14/business/artificial-intelligence-ceos-warning/index.html#:~:text=Forty%2Dtwo%20percent%20of%20CEOs,interviehttps://www.cnn.com/2023/06/14/business/artificial-intelligence-ceos-warning/index.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a lot of company</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. So I did the obvious thing: I asked a bot if AI would save humanity or kill us all. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ChatGPT responded with a list of pros and cons of AI, including the familiar benefits and concerns that have spawned a thousand op-eds. You can try this at home, so I won’t reiterate them here. But I will note the curious fact that the bot didn’t mention either carbon emissions or election-altering deepfakes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe that’s an oversight, or maybe it means my fears are unwarranted. But maybe it shows something even scarier than AI itself: It’s AI pretending it isn’t trying to take over.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We urgently need action from U.S. and corporate leaders. Stiff new taxes on data center energy use would lead to greater efficiencies and nudge companies to price data storage and AI use appropriately. New laws should put the onus on internet platforms to stop deepfakes before they can spread. Tech companies should prioritize what is good for human beings over what is good for corporate profit. If they can’t ensure AI is used only for good, they should pull the plug until they can.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If all this doesn’t happen, and soon – well, let’s just hope the robots are kind. </span></p>

The centers house the computer servers and hardware required to support modern internet use, including artificial intelligence. The county is home to the world's largest concentration of data centers. Tech companies like to place the centers here, partly because the region's proximity to the nation's traditional internet backbone allows the servers in those data centers to save nanoseconds crucial to support financial transactions, gaming technology and other time-sensitive applications. (AP Photo/Ted Shaffrey)</p><p>State Sen. Norm Needleman championed the 2021 legislation designed to lure major data centers to Connecticut.</p>
<p>The Democratic lawmaker hoped to better compete with nearby states, bring in a growing industry, and provide paychecks for workers tasked with building the sprawling server farms.</p>
<p>But this legislative session, he’s wondering if <a href="https://portal.ct.gov/decd/content/business-development/data-infrastructure-administration-and-security/office-of-data-infrastructure-administration-and-security/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener">those tax breaks </a>are appropriate for all data centers, especially those with the potential to disrupt the state’s clean energy supply.</p>
<p>Particularly concerning to him are plans for a mega data center on the site of the state’s only nuclear power plant. The developer is proposing an arrangement that would give it priority access to electricity generated at the plant, which would mean less carbon-free power for other users.</p>
<p>“That affects our climate goals,” he said. “It’s additional demand of renewable energy that we would have to replace.”</p>
<p>Needleman, co-chair of the Senate Energy and Technology Committee, is now reconsidering details of the state incentive program as he works on <a href="https://www.cga.ct.gov/2024/TOB/S/PDF/2024SB-00299-R00-SB.PDF" target="_blank" rel="noopener">legislation to study</a> the impact of data centers on the state’s electric grid. Mistakes now, he said, could lead to “a real crisis.”</p>
<p>Compared with other employers that states compete for, such as automotive plants, data centers hire relatively few workers. Still, states have offered massive subsidies to lure data centers — both for their enormous up-front capital investment and the cachet of bringing in big tech names such as Apple and Facebook. But as the cost of these subsidy programs balloons and data centers proliferate coast to coast, lawmakers in several states are rethinking their posture as they consider how to cope with the growing electricity demand.</p>
<p>From the outside, data centers can resemble ordinary warehouses. But inside, the windowless structures can house acres of computer servers used to power everything from social media to banking. The centers suck up massive amounts of energy to keep data moving and water to keep servers from overheating.</p>
<p>Data centers are the backbone of the increasingly digital world, and they consume a growing share of the nation’s electricity, with no signs of slowing down. The global consultancy McKinsey &amp; Company predicts these operations will <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/investing-in-the-rising-data-center-economy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">double their U.S. electric demands</a> from 17 gigawatts in 2022 to 35 gigawatts by 2030 — enough electricity to power more than 26 million average homes.</p>
<p>Some states, including Maryland and Mississippi, continue to pursue incentives to land new data centers. But in other states, the growth of the industry is raising alarms over the reliability and affordability of local electric grids, and fears that utilities will meet the demand by leaning more heavily on fossil fuel generation rather than renewables.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" title="“‘Panicked rush to gas’ could hike energy costs, report warns regulators” — Stateline" src="https://stateline.org/2024/04/16/panicked-rush-to-gas-could-hike-energy-costs-report-warns-regulators/embed/#?secret=qt6dctGLwP#?secret=ZL1P9KbfvQ" width="500" height="461" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" sandbox="allow-scripts" data-secret="ZL1P9KbfvQ" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></p>
<p>In South Carolina, lawmakers have started to question whether these massive power users should continue to receive tax breaks and preferential electric rates.</p>
<p>In Virginia, home to the world’s largest concentration of data centers, a legislative study is underway to learn more about how those operations are affecting electric reliability and affordability.</p>
<p>And Georgia lawmakers just passed <a href="https://www.legis.ga.gov/api/legislation/document/20232024/223348" target="_blank" rel="noopener">legislation</a> that would halt the state’s tax incentives for new data centers for two years. Georgia is home to more than 50 data centers, including those supporting AT&amp;T, Google and UPS, <a href="https://www.georgia.org/data-centers-georgia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to the state commerce department</a>.</p>
<p>Georgia Republican state Sen. John Albers, a sponsor of the Senate bill, said the significant growth of data centers in his state has helped communities and schools by boosting property tax revenues. But, considering factors such as water and electric use, he said the return on the state’s investment “is not there” and that “initial findings do not support credits from the state level.”</p>
<p>Nationwide, data center subsidies were costing state and local governments about $2 million per job created, according to a <a href="https://goodjobsfirst.org/wp-content/uploads/docs/pdf/datacenters.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2016 study</a> by Good Jobs First, a nonprofit watchdog group that tracks economic development incentives. That figure has certainly ballooned in recent years, said Kasia Tarczynska, the organization’s senior research analyst, who authored the report.</p>
<p>The Georgia bill now sits on the desk of Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, whose office did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>The Data Center Coalition, a trade group representing tech giants including Amazon, Google and Meta, is urging a veto.</p>
<p>Josh Levi, president of the organization, said data center companies are investing billions in new Georgia data centers, making metro Atlanta one of the nation’s biggest industry hubs.</p>
<p>Levi noted that lawmakers in 2022 <a href="https://www.legis.ga.gov/legislation/61909" target="_blank" rel="noopener">extended</a> the state’s tax credit program through 2031.</p>
<p>“The abrupt suspension of an incentive that not only has been on the books, but that was extended two years ago, I think signals tremendous uncertainty, not just for the data center industry, but more broadly,” he said.</p>
<p>Levi said the data center industry has been at the forefront of pushing clean energy. As of last year, data center providers and customers accounted for two-thirds of American wind and solar contracts, according to an S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence <a href="https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/research/datacenter-companies-continue-renewable-buying-spree-surpassing-40-gw-in-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a>.</p>
<p>“Fundamentally, data is now the lifeblood of our modern economy,” he said. “Everything that we do in our personal and professional lives really points back to data generation, processing and storage.”</p>
<h4 class="editorialSubhed">    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘Electricity hogs’</h4>

	</h4>
<p>In fast-growing South Carolina, lawmakers have pointed to data centers as a major factor in rising electricity demand.</p>
<p>As part of <a href="https://www.scstatehouse.gov/sess125_2023-2024/bills/5118.htm#:~:text=SECTION%2039.%20An,operation%20of%20electronic%20equipment" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a broader energy bill</a>, the legislature considered a measure that would prevent data centers from receiving discounted power rates.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" title="“Tech breakthrough could boost states’ use of geothermal power” — Stateline" src="https://stateline.org/2023/08/04/geothermal-energy/embed/#?secret=g9QTLyaoFj#?secret=h1Zi4cU2EJ" width="500" height="473" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" sandbox="allow-scripts" data-secret="h1Zi4cU2EJ" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></p>
<p>Republican state Rep. Jay West said inducements such as reduced power rates are appropriate for major, transformational endeavors. He pointed to the <a href="https://www.bmwgroup-werke.com/spartanburg/en.html#:~:text=Welcome%20to%20BMW%20GROUP%20Plant,eight%20million%20square%2Dfoot%20campus." target="_blank" rel="noopener">BMW factory in Spartanburg</a>, which employs 11,000 people, draws in major suppliers and pumps millions into the state economy.</p>
<p>While data centers boost local property taxes receipts, they don’t do much for the state, he said, and shouldn’t receive preferential rates. And they are being built faster than new energy generation can be added.</p>
<p>“I do not speak for my caucus or the [legislative] body in saying this,” he said, “but I don’t think South Carolina can handle more data centers.”</p>
<p>The House provision on data center utility rates was quickly struck in a Senate committee, the South Carolina Daily Gazette <a href="https://scdailygazette.com/2024/04/15/data-centers-need-massive-amounts-of-energy-what-does-that-mean-for-sc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a>.</p>
<p>Lynn Teague, vice president of the League of Women Voters of South Carolina, said that change was made with no public discussion.</p>
<p>Teague, who lobbies the legislature, said South Carolinians, including more than 700,000 people living in poverty, shouldn’t have to pick up the tab for tax or utility breaks for major data center firms.</p>
<p>“We have companies like Google with over $300 billion in revenues a year wanting these folks to subsidize their profit margin at the same time that they’re putting intense pressure on not just our energy, but our water,” she said.</p>
<p>Lawmakers saw data centers as a possible successor to South Carolina’s declining textile industry when they approved the data center incentives in 2012, <a href="https://www.thestate.com/news/politics-government/article14403305.html#storylink=cpy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The State reported at the time</a>. One Republican bill sponsor, then-state Rep. Phyllis Henderson, also cited North Carolina’s success with data center incentives, saying South Carolina was “just losing projects right and left to them.”</p>
<p>But on the Senate floor earlier this month, Senate Majority Leader Shane Massey, a Republican, described data centers as “electricity hogs that aren’t really providing a whole lot of jobs.”</p>
<h4 class="editorialSubhed">    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘Rippling effects’</h4>

	</h4>
<p>Virginia has been a hub for data centers for decades, touting its proximity to the nation’s capital, inexpensive energy, a robust fiber network and low risk of natural disasters. Now, Virginia lawmakers are increasingly scrutinizing the industry.</p>
<p>That’s in part because data centers have moved into traditionally residential areas, said Republican state Del. Ian Lovejoy, who represents a Northern Virginia district.</p>

<p>He sponsored two pieces of legislation this year affecting data center land use issues. One would have <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB1010" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prevented</a> data centers from building too close to parks, schools or neighborhoods; another would have altered land use disclosure rules for developers.</p>
<p>“There’s no way to power the data center inventory that’s being proposed and is likely to be built without substantial increases to the power infrastructure and power generation,” he said. “And that’s going to have rippling effects far away from where the data centers are being sited.”</p>
<p>Aaron Ruby, spokesperson for Dominion Energy in Virginia, the state’s predominant electric provider, said data centers, like other classes of customers, pay for the costs of their electric generation and transmission.</p>
<p>He said the company forecasts consumers’ monthly bills to grow by less than 3% annually over the next 15 years. That increase, he said, is due to the company’s significant investment in renewable energy projects. While Dominion is “all in” on renewables, Ruby said it doesn’t foresee being able to meet increasing demand with only renewables.</p>
<p>“That’s just not physically possible,” he said.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" title="“States Debate Whether to Restrict — Or Invite — Crypto Mining” — Stateline" src="https://stateline.org/2023/03/21/states-debate-whether-to-restrict-or-invite-crypto-mining/embed/#?secret=znSlKgNOQl#?secret=x842mBlDM1" width="500" height="610" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" sandbox="allow-scripts" data-secret="x842mBlDM1" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></p>
<p>Dominion has pointed to data center growth as a key driver of its increasing electricity demand. In <a href="https://cdn-dominionenergy-prd-001.azureedge.net/-/media/pdfs/global/company/2023-va-integrated-resource-plan.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one state filing,</a> the company said Virginia’s data centers had a peak load of almost 2.8 gigawatts in 2022.That was 1.5 times the capacity of the company’s <a href="https://www.dominionenergy.com/projects-and-facilities/nuclear-facilities/north-anna-power-station" target="_blank" rel="noopener">North Anna nuclear plant,</a> which powers about 450,000 homes.</p>
<p>“It is heart-stopping — just the scale at which these things are growing and the power they’re sucking up,” said Kendl Kobbervig, the advocacy and communications director at Clean Virginia, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/11/01/virginia-michael-bills-clean-energy-democratic-donor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a well-funded advocacy group</a> pushing for renewable energy, campaign finance reform and greater oversight of utilities.</p>
<p>She said the state must address how data centers could undercut its clean energy goals and how the industry is affecting the utility bills of everyday households and small businesses.</p>
<p>Over the past two years, Clean Virginia has tracked more than 40 proposed bills related to data centers.</p>
<p>Most of those efforts stalled this session as some lawmakers elected to wait on the results of <a href="https://jlarc.virginia.gov/pdfs/resolutions/2024_Data%20centers_JLARC.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a study announced in December </a>by the state’s Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission.</p>
<p>The lack of action frustrated many lawmakers and residents.</p>
<p>“I don’t know exactly what the study is going to say that we don’t already know,” said Democratic state Sen. Suhas Subramanyam, who <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB192" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sponsored a bill</a> that would have required data centers to meet certain energy efficiency and clean energy standards to be eligible for the state’s lucrative sales tax exemptions.</p>
<p>“I think we already know that data centers take up a lot of power and present a lot of challenges to our grid.”</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These attacks are intensifying each year; to avert them, Congress could work with our nation’s innovators to build up our cyber defense capabilities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2023, the U.S. reported 2,365 total cyberattacks, a number that has more than </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1367217/us-annual-number-of-cyber-attacks-leading-data-compromises-by-type/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">doubled</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the last three years. Microsoft recently </span><a href="https://thehackernews.com/2024/03/microsoft-confirms-russian-hackers.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">found</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that a Russian hacker gained access to parts of the company’s source code. The extent and full impact of the breach has yet to be determined, but it is confirmed that the Kremlin-backed actor has tried to leverage the sensitive information it stole.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia has not been spared from escalating cyberattacks either. In 2021, Virginia’s Division of Legislative Automated Systems was </span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/officials-virginia-state-agency-hit-ransomware-attack-n1285913" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by a ransomware attack, resulting in panic and roadblocks during the midst of a legislative session. That same year saw the Colonial Pipeline attack, which shut down a gasoline pipeline that services the large majority of Virginia’s gas stations, leading the governor to declare a state of emergency. These attacks were targeted, premeditated and measured to inflict the highest level of disarray.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adversaries like China have made it very clear that they would like to surpass America’s global technological leadership, </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/id-b43da0d919ee46efb0e185668a2be263" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">stating </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">that their intention is to be a leading global economic power by 2030. The global tech race is upon us, and the U.S. is at risk of falling behind if we don’t protect our ability to innovate.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the wake of near-constant threats from nation-state hackers, America’s ability to protect its national security is even more of a priority. Just this year, the Department of Defense (DOD) released its first </span><a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/3644527/dod-releases-first-defense-industrial-strategy/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">long-term</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> industrial defense strategy to ensure America has the technology in place to protect us now and in the future. The strategic priorities set out by DOD include resilient supply chains as well as economic deterrence that can produce and secure existing and emerging technologies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given the stakes of this issue, Congress could work with America’s tech innovators to bolster our cybersecurity infrastructure, rather than passing legislation that would handicap our ability to innovate and adapt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I founded Priority Defense in response to this critical security gap, answering the call to help protect infrastructure by strengthening companies’ security programs in Virginia and beyond. As a U.S. Air Force Veteran, I see the essential role our defense industrial base plays in our nation’s security and advancements.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cybersecurity is national security, and continued investment in the industry will help protect us at home and abroad.

The opportunity for cybersecurity workers is vasts vast, and the threat sophisticated hackers pose is no longer a warning to prepare for; it is here, and our country is suffering every day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Policymakers should continue to support our state’s cybersecurity workers and our tech sector at large by looking critically at restrictive legislation that may impede innovation. By continuing to lift our tech sector, we empower the organizations maintaining our state and national security.</span></p>

(Getty Images)</p><p>This year’s presidential election will be the first since generative AI — a form of artificial intelligence that can create new content, including images, audio and video — became widely available. That’s raising fears that millions of voters could be deceived by a barrage of political deepfakes.</p>
<p>But, while Congress has done little to address the issue, states are moving aggressively to respond — though questions remain about how effective any new measures to combat AI-created disinformation will be.</p>
<p>During Virginia&#8217;s 2024 legislative session, lawmakers reviewed about two dozen pieces of legislation related to artificial intelligence. One measure, Democratic Sen. Suhas Subramanyam&#8217;s <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SJ14" target="_blank">Senate Joint Resolution 14</a>, orders the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission to continue studying the impact of AI in the state.</p>
<div>It calls for a specific focus on understanding “deep fakes, data privacy implications, and misinformation,” as well as how to avoid the technology leading to discrimination and ensuring equity in AI algorithms. The resolution was continued to 2025.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Senate Bill 621 — to establish a commission dedicated solely to advising the governor on AI policy in Virginia — was folded into <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+bil+SB0487" target="_blank">Senate Bill 487</a>, which ultimately passed out of both chambers of the legislature, was included in its budget and now awaits a veto, signature or amendment by Gov. Youngkin by April 8.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The measure also directs the Joint Commission on Technology and Science to &#8220;conduct an analysis of the use of artificial intelligence by public bodies&#8221; in Virginia, and send a report replete with recommendations to the House Committees on Appropriations and Communications, Technology and Innovation and the Senate Committees on Finance and Appropriations and General Laws and Technology by Dec. 1 of this year.</div>

<p>Here in the United States, the urgency of the AI threat was driven home in February, when, in the days before the New Hampshire primary, thousands of voters in the state received a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/22/politics/fake-joe-biden-robocall/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">robocall</a> with an AI-generated voice impersonating President Joe Biden, urging them not to vote. A Democratic operative working for a rival candidate has <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ai-robocall-biden-new-hampshire-primary-2024-f94aa2d7f835ccc3cc254a90cd481a99" target="_blank" rel="noopener">admitted</a> to commissioning the calls.</p>
<p>In response to the call, the Federal Communications Commission <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/fcc-bans-ai-generated-voices-in-robocalls-that-can-deceive-voters" target="_blank" rel="noopener">issued</a> a ruling restricting robocalls that contain AI-generated voices.</p>
<p>Some conservative groups even appear to be <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/new-antidemocracy-tool" target="_blank" rel="noopener">using AI tools</a> to assist with mass voter registration challenges — raising concerns that the technology could be harnessed to help existing voter suppression <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/new-antidemocracy-tool" target="_blank" rel="noopener">schemes</a>.</p>
<p>“Instead of voters looking to trusted sources of information about elections, including their state or county board of elections, AI-generated content can grab the voters’ attention,” said Megan Bellamy, vice president for law and policy at the Voting Rights Lab, an advocacy group that tracks election-related state legislation. “And this can lead to chaos and confusion leading up to and even after Election Day.”</p>
<h4 class="editorialSubhed">    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Disinformation worries</h4>

	</h4>
<p>The AI threat has emerged at a time when democracy advocates already are deeply concerned about the potential for “ordinary” online disinformation to confuse voters, and when allies of former President Donald Trump appear to be having success in <a class="c-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/17/us/politics/trump-disinformation-2024-social-media.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/17/us/politics/trump-disinformation-2024-social-media.html" data-sk="tooltip_parent">fighting off</a> efforts to curb disinformation.</p>
<p>But states are responding to the AI threat. Since the start of last year, 101 bills addressing AI and election disinformation have been introduced, according to a March 26 analysis by the Voting Rights Lab.</p>
<p>On March 27, Oregon became the latest state — after Wisconsin, New Mexico, Indiana and Utah — to enact a law on AI-generated election disinformation. Florida and Idaho lawmakers have passed their own measures, which are currently on the desks of those states’ governors.</p>
<p>Arizona, Georgia, Iowa and Hawaii, meanwhile, have all passed at least one bill — in the case of Arizona, two — through one chamber.</p>
<p>As that list of states makes clear, red, blue and purple states all have devoted attention to the issue.</p>
<h4 class="editorialSubhed">    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">States urged to act</h4>

	</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, a new <a href="https://www.newdealforum.org/newdeal-forum-publications/artificial-intelligence-and-elections" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a> on how to combat the AI threat to elections, drawing on input from four Democratic secretaries of state, was released March 25 by the NewDEAL Forum, a progressive advocacy group.</p>
<p>“[G]enerative AI has the ability to drastically increase the spread of election mis- and disinformation and cause confusion among voters,” the report warned. “For instance, ‘deepfakes’ [AI-generated images, voices or videos] could be used to portray a candidate saying or doing things that never happened.”</p>
<p>The NewDEAL Forum report urges states to take several steps to respond to the threat, including requiring that certain kinds of AI-generated campaign material be clearly labeled; conducting role-playing exercises to help anticipate the problems that AI could cause; creating rapid-response systems for communicating with voters and the media, in order to knock down AI-generated disinformation; and educating the public ahead of time.</p>

<p>Secretaries of State Steve Simon of Minnesota, Jocelyn Benson of Michigan, Maggie Toulouse Oliver of New Mexico and Adrian Fontes of Arizona provided input for the report. All four are actively working to prepare their states on the issue.</p>
<h4 class="editorialSubhed">    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Loopholes seen</h4>

	</h4>
<p>Despite the flurry of activity by lawmakers, officials and outside experts, several of the measures examined in the Voting Rights Lab analysis appear to have weaknesses or loopholes that may raise questions about their ability to effectively protect voters from AI.</p>
<p>Most of the bills require that creators add a disclaimer to any AI-generated content, noting the use of AI, as the NewDEAL Forum report recommends.</p>
<p>But the new Wisconsin law, for instance, requires the disclaimer only for content created by campaigns, meaning deepfakes produced by outside groups but intended to influence an election — hardly an unlikely scenario — would be unaffected.</p>
<p>In addition, the measure is limited to content produced by generative AI, even though experts say other types of synthetic content that don’t use AI, such as Photoshop and CGI — sometimes referred to as “cheap fakes” — can be just as effective at fooling viewers or listeners, and can be more easily produced.</p>
<p>For that reason, the NewDEAL Forum report recommends that state laws cover all synthetic content, not just that which use AI.</p>
<p>The Indiana, Utah and Wisconsin laws also contain no criminal penalties — violations are punishable by a $1,000 fine — raising questions about whether they will work as a deterrent.</p>
<p>The Arizona and Florida bills do include criminal penalties. But Arizona’s two bills apply only to digital impersonation of a candidate, meaning plenty of other forms of AI-generated deception — impersonating a news anchor reporting a story, for instance — would remain legal.</p>
<p>And one of the Arizona bills, as well as New Mexico’s law, applied only in the 90 days before an election, even though AI-generated content that appears before that window could potentially still affect the vote.</p>
<p>Experts say the shortcomings exist in large part because, since the threat is so new, states don’t yet have a clear sense of exactly what form it will take.</p>
<p>“The legislative bodies are trying to figure out the best approach, and they’re working off of examples that they’ve already seen,” said Bellamy, pointing to the examples of the Slovakian audio and the Biden robocalls.</p>
<p>“They’re just not sure what direction this is coming from, but feeling the need to do something.”</p>
<p>Bellamy added: “I think that we will see the solutions evolve. The danger of that is that AI-generated content and what it can do is also likely to evolve at the same time. So hopefully we can keep up.”</p>

(Photo Illustration by Drew Angerer/Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. House on Wednesday overwhelmingly passed a bill that effectively bans TikTok unless the company splits from its Chinese owner ByteDance because of national security concerns.</p>
<p><a href="https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/202486?Page=2" data-type="link" data-id="https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/202486?Page=2" target="_blank">The 352-65 vote</a> occurred just a week after lawmakers introduced the bipartisan proposal and days after the powerful House Committee on Energy and Commerce unanimously advanced the legislation, an unusual speed for the 118th Congress.</p>
<p>The bill required a two-thirds majority because House leadership placed it on the floor under a fast-track procedure called suspension of the rules.</p>
<p>The bill, dubbed the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/7521/text?s=1&amp;r=1&amp;q=%7B%22search%22%3A%22Protecting+Americans+from+Foreign+Adversary+Controlled+Applications+Act%22%7D" target="_blank">Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act</a>, now heads to the Senate, where concerns over singling out a private company in legislation may slow momentum.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger, D-Virginia, a former intelligence officer who voted with the majority of the House to effectively ban TikTok, said the &#8220;Chinese Communist Party is capable of using the app to undermine democratic elections, weaponize propaganda, and stifle free speech across the globe.&#8221; She noted in a statement that the House&#8217;s vote to advance the bill is not an &#8220;outright ban,&#8221; but said that Congress forcing TikTok to divest from its parent company ByteDance is an effort to &#8220;protect the data of the American people and keep our country safe online.”</span></p>
<p>Following the U.S. House vote, Virginia Democratic Rep. Bobby Scott said in a statement that he had voted in favor of the measure. The House bill requires TikTok to disinvest from ByteDance within 180 days, said Scott, who added that Americans should be able to keep using the social media platform &#8220;without the associated risks of an app being owned and operated by a foreign adversary of the United States.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Sens. Mark Warner, D-Virginia, and Marco Rubio, R-Florida, who co-chair the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, released a statement applauding the House&#8217;s action against TikTok.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are united in our concern about the national security threat posed by TikTok,&#8221; the senators said. &#8220;We were encouraged by today’s strong bipartisan vote in the House of Representatives, and look forward to working together to get this bill passed through the Senate and signed into law.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ahead of the U.S. House vote, Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares wrote an amicus brief on March 11 leading 18 other states in support of similar legislation in Montana calling for TikTok to divest from ByteDance. The </span><a href="https://files.constantcontact.com/d3e83e11901/bef0b7fe-3c52-4b12-9096-56728f683aa2.pdf?rdr=true" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">brief </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">noted that in 2023, TikTok &#8220;was the second most downloaded mobile application worldwide, generating 654 million downloads over the course of the year&#8221; and pointed to the app&#8217;s data collection practices and &#8220;addictive&#8221; impact on youth as causes for concern.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin in December 2023 issued an </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/governor-of-virginia/pdf/eo/EO-24---Banning-the-Use-of-Certain-Applications-and-Websites-on-State-Government-Technology.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">executive order</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> banning the use of TikiTok “on any government-issued devices, including state-issued cell phones, laptops, or other devices capable of connecting to the internet except for public safety purposes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin said the applications allow China and other foreign governments the chance to &#8221; gain access to the information stored on mobile devices, including location services and browsing history,&#8221; a potential cybersecurity threat.</span></p>

<p>President Joe Biden, whose administration had a hand in crafting the bill, is expected to sign the measure if the upper chamber approves it.</p>
<p>Despite broad support across the aisle, the legislation has been met by fierce opposition from TikTok users — totaling some 170 million in the U.S. — and from a coalition of young House lawmakers.</p>
<p>“Not only am I a ‘no’ on tomorrow’s TikTok ban bill, I’m a ‘Hell no,’” Rep. Maxwell Frost of Florida said at a Tuesday press conference, questioning which companies are large enough to acquire TikTok. Frost is the youngest member of Congress at 27.</p>
<p>“Essentially what this bill is doing is setting this whole sale up to fail,” he said.</p>
<p>Users of the wildly popular social media platform flooded lawmakers’ offices with thousands of calls Thursday after the company sent a push notification warning that a ban could be imminent, an argument the company maintains.</p>
<p>Supporters from both parties refute that claim.</p>
<p>“The legislation before the Congress does not ban TikTok. It is designed to address legitimate national security and privacy concerns related to the Chinese Communist Party’s engagement with a frequently used social media platform,” House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat, said in a statement Wednesday.</p>
<p>“If enacted, the bill would require divestiture by ByteDance and the sale of TikTok to an American company,” he continued.</p>

<p><strong>Divestiture deadline set </strong></p>
<p>The bill gives TikTok 180 days to splinter from ByteDance and will make it unlawful for any American app store or web hosting company to distribute or maintain platforms controlled by designated U.S. adversaries.</p>
<p>The social media platform, 100% owned by ByteDance, <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/members-congress-blast-tiktok-ceo-bipartisan-support-us-ban-looks-possible" target="_blank">has long been</a> in the crosshairs of federal and state lawmakers, whom intelligence officials have warned of the possibility of China’s government accessing Americans’ data via the app.</p>
<p>Lawmakers passed legislation in December 2022 <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/why-tiktok-is-being-banned-for-some-federal-employees" target="_blank">banning</a> the app from most federal employee devices. The Montana Legislature <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/one-state-already-has-voted-ban-tiktok-congress-its-going-be-much-tougher-16" target="_blank">banned</a> the app last year, but the law <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/montana-appealing-ruling-that-blocked-state-barring-tiktok-use-2024-01-03/" target="_blank">remains</a> tied up in court.</p>
<p>Former President Donald Trump issued an <a href="https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-addressing-threat-posed-tiktok/" target="_blank">executive order</a> in 2020 banning TikTok unless it broke from ByteDance. This week Trump <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/03/11/1237833658/house-tiktok-vote-trump" target="_blank">reversed</a> his position on the platform, telling CNBC that “without TikTok you’re going to make Facebook bigger.”</p>
<p>Some Republican lawmakers have fallen in line with Trump’s argument, including Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, who said on the floor Wednesday before the vote she worries that Congress could open a “Pandora’s box” and target other platforms like X.</p>
<p>Greene said her “free speech” was “restored” when Elon Musk purchased Twitter and reinstated her account.</p>
<p>“This is really about controlling Americans’ data,” said Greene on the floor before the vote.</p>
<p>The bill’s original sponsor, Republican Rep. Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin, said from the floor that he wanted to clear up “misconceptions” of the bill ahead of the vote.</p>
<p>“It does not apply to American companies,” the chair of the House Select Committee on China said and later <a href="https://x.com/committeeonccp/status/1767908192363638791?s=20" target="_blank">posted</a> on X from his office’s account.</p>
<p>“It only applies to companies subject to the control of foreign adversaries defined by Congress. It says nothing about election interference and cannot be turned against any American social media platform. It does not impact websites in general. The only impacted sites are those associated with foreign adversary apps, such as TikTok.com.”</p>

But they’re not ready to pass new laws on the topic just yet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Monday, a Democratic-led House of Delegates subcommittee voted to delay action on a Democratic state senator’s </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB359" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">proposal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to prohibit social media companies from using “addictive” feeds to encourage kids under 18 to endlessly scroll through videos and other content served up via algorithms designed to capture attention.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill had passed the Virginia Senate unanimously, but the House Communications Subcommittee voted 9-1 to send it to the legislature’s Joint Commission on Technology and Science for more study. Del. Holly Seibold, D-Fairfax, called the proposal “a great bill” but said it needed a closer look “along with all other social media concerns.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The move came after representatives for Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, and other technology companies said the proposed bill was so vague they wouldn’t be able to comply with it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the House subcommittee hearing, Sen. Schuyler VanValkenburg, D-Henrico, said he found it “kind of baffling” that social media companies claimed to not understand what would be expected of them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I mean, come on,” VanValkenburg said. “All they have to do is turn off the addictive algorithm that makes it so that the nonstop stuff keeps going.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Glenn Youngkin has made safeguarding children from the harms of social media </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/08/08/at-parent-focused-event-youngkin-takes-aim-at-social-medias-destructive-influence/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a major talking point</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In his speech to the General Assembly last month, the governor asked lawmakers to send him a bill “that empowers parents to protect their children and prohibits tech companies from selling the data of children under the age of 18.” Several Republican lawmakers introduced bills on the topic this year, but they too failed to advance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With broad, bipartisan support in the Senate, VanValkenburg’s narrower social media bill seemed to have better odds of passage since Democrats control both legislative chambers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A high school teacher who said he’s seen firsthand how social media can impact teenagers’ schoolwork and mental health, VanValkenburg argued his bill wouldn’t impose sweeping new limits on minors’ access to social media or their ability to see content from friends or accounts they choose to follow. Instead, he said, the bill deals with just “one thing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That one thing is about a minor being on the phone and just staring at it nonstop because they keep getting content pumped to them,” the senator said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislation would have prevented social media platforms from serving an “addictive feed” to users known to be under 18 without parental consent. The definition of addictive feed would still allow minors to see content they have “expressly and unambiguously requested.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to tech companies, the bill wasn’t so simple.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eric Link, a lobbyist for the Northern Virginia Technology Council — whose members include Meta and Google — said it wasn’t clear what “unambiguous” meant because it wasn’t defined in the bill. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We don&#8217;t argue about the policy goals of this bill,” Link told the House subcommittee. “But we do argue about our ability to comply with it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a letter raising concerns about the bill, Meta said it could require all new users of social media platforms to share sensitive personal information in order to verify their identity and age. The company said Instagram already includes several features designed to encourage teens to take breaks after scrolling the app for long periods. A more effective solution to the issue, the company said, is federal legislation requiring parental approval whenever kids under 16 attempt to download products from app stores.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While we acknowledge the underlying intent of Senate Bill 359, we believe this bill, as </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">currently drafted, fails to create robust, industry-wide standards that help Virginia </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">parents and teens manage their online activity,” Meta Public Policy Manager Beauclarine Thomas said in the letter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VanValkenburg </span><a href="https://x.com/ScVanValkenburg/status/1759592906006962439?s=20" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> he’ll work with the technology commission over the next year and reintroduce the legislation in 2025. The negative social impacts of kids getting hooked on social media, he told House members, are increasingly obvious.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When you’re on your phone staring at videos all day, you’re not talking to your friends. You’re not talking to adults,” he said. “You’re not interacting with the world.”</span></p>

As AI continues infiltrating nearly every aspect of our society, it’s crucial that Virginia lawmakers and experts continue to study its benefits and risks. That task is particularly urgent as the technology has been shown to perpetuate inequity that already exists in many of our systems.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The blessing and curse of AI</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are several pieces of legislation related to AI up for debate now in Virginia’s General Assembly. </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+fuh+HB249+700025" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 249</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> calls for the development of a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “comprehensive framework” for how law enforcement agencies use AI and a model policy to guide criminal justice systems’ use of machine learning technology by 2025. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such measures sure would have been helpful five years ago, before Norfolk police briefly used </span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2020/09/09/norfolk-police-tried-a-controversial-facial-recognition-app-that-has-billions-of-photos-maybe-yours/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a facial recognition app</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> developed by Clearview AI to identify suspects in criminal investigations without public knowledge and without oversight from city or state leaders. Not only was that a huge privacy concern, but it could also have misidentified people — especially people of color — and connected them to a crime they had nothing to do with. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) tested 189 face recognition algorithms, and found that most facial recognition AI systems have a significantly higher rate of false positive identifications for photos of Black, Asian, and indigenous people’s faces than for photos of white people’s faces,” Dr. Jennifer Rhee, director of the </span><a href="https://humanitiescenter.vcu.edu/labs/ai-futures-lab/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AI Futures Lab</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at Virginia Commonwealth University, told me by email. “Some facial recognition systems were found to have false positive rates 10 [times] to 100 [times] higher for Black, Native American, and Asian people than for white people.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite those very high error rates, versions of this technology are currently being used by some police departments in America, and for surveillance of public spaces and national borders. That may spell “serious consequences for the people who are erroneously identified by these systems,” Rhee added. </span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facial recognition technology is riddled with bias, because most of the images used to train algorithms to recognize faces are white, male faces. Most of the engineers developing this technology over the past decade are also </span><a href="https://aiindex.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2021-AI-Index-Report-_Chapter-6.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">white and male</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">; they create tech tools in their own image, and any bias they have is reflected in those creations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Recent studies demonstrate that machine learning algorithms can discriminate based on classes like race and gender,” reads a </span><a href="https://proceedings.mlr.press/v81/buolamwini18a/buolamwini18a.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2018 MIT study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> led by Joy Buolamwini and Timnit Gebru that evaluated three commercial AI-powered facial recognition tools that consistently misidentified darker-skinned people’s gender, while almost always getting the gender of lighter-skinned people right. Other tools don’t recognize Black faces as human, as demonstrated in 2015 when Google Photos automatically sorted 80 photos of a Black man into a folder it labeled </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/15/technology/artificial-intelligence-google-bias.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“gorillas.”</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Because AI systems are trained on data produced by society, these systems reflect society’s biases and power dynamics,” Rhee told me by email. </span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Legislative efforts </h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Artificial intelligence has been under study by state lawmakers since 2020, when the Artificial Intelligence Subcommittee of the Joint Commission on Technology and Science was </span><a href="https://studiesvirginiageneralassembly.s3.amazonaws.com/meeting_docs/documents/000/000/673/original/Final_HayesJCOTSLetter_Aug.pdf?1596734736" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">founded</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The function of the group, subcommittee chair Del. Cliff Hayes, D-Chesapeake, told me last summer, is to help legislators get a better understanding of how the technology works and its implications in Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We need to be equipped to deal with this in Virginia because AI and other technologies are evolving so rapidly, we can&#8217;t necessarily sit around and wait for federal guidelines,” said Hayes, who has had a nearly 30-year career in programming and technology management and is currently the city of Portsmouth&#8217;s chief information officer. It&#8217;s important to view AI and other technological developments holistically, and to not focus exclusively on either the positive or negative aspects, he added.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Kqcct3lc13"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/07/18/as-employers-expand-artificial-intelligence-in-hiring-few-states-have-rules/">As employers expand artificial intelligence in hiring, few states have rules</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;As employers expand artificial intelligence in hiring, few states have rules&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/07/18/as-employers-expand-artificial-intelligence-in-hiring-few-states-have-rules/embed/#?secret=IdmXMPqGdE#?secret=Kqcct3lc13" data-secret="Kqcct3lc13" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2021, Virginia’s legislature banned police departments across the commonwealth from using facial recognition technology without first gaining permission from the state. But policymakers quickly concluded that approach meant Virginia would miss out on the legitimate ways AI could aid law enforcement and criminal justice efforts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;An all-out ban of AI isn&#8217;t the answer, we learned,&#8221; Hayes said. &#8220;The answer was to dissect and deal with the technology as it advances, so that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re doing.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2022, legislators </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+sum+SB741" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rolled back the ban</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, allowing police departments to use facial recognition only in certain instances. That legislation also required the Virginia State Police to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;develop a model policy regarding the investigative uses of facial recognition technology&#8221; and mandated that any facial recognition technology used in Virginia &#8220;be evaluated by the National Institute of Standards and Technology and have an accuracy score of at least 98 percent true positives across all demographic groups.&#8221; The second measure was intended to address public concerns that the technology is less accurate in recognizing the faces of people with darker skin tones. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In June, Attorney General Jason Miyares co-authored a letter written by attorneys general of 23 states entreating the</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">National Telecommunications and Information Administration to review AI governance policies. The </span><a href="https://files.constantcontact.com/d3e83e11901/bf211eb0-2a5c-4ccc-bb61-475714b902db.pdf?rdr=true" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">letter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> cited data privacy, the need to develop AI safely without hampering innovation and the technology’s possible impact on individuals&#8217; legal and personal information as causes for concern and caution.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last September, Gov. Glenn Youngkin issued a similarly themed </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/news-releases/2023/september/name-1014625-en.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">executive order</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on artificial intelligence that focused on four areas: legal requirements, especially those related to privacy or intellectual property; policy standards for state agencies; appropriate IT safeguards such as cybersecurity and firewalls; and training for students. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That sounded good and all, except there wasn’t a focus area dedicated specifically to one of the foremost challenges of AI: its well-known, deeply researched biases that fuel systemic discrimination against some groups of people, usually those who are already marginalized. This directive made me wonder if the governor truly had an interest in safeguarding Virginians of color and </span><a href="https://hls.harvard.edu/today/algorithms-and-their-unintended-consequences-for-the-poor/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">impoverished people</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from this pervasive problem. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s latest AI-related executive order, released in January, steps up to meet that challenge. Standards for how the technology should be used and taught in the state’s public schools and guidelines for AI’s use in state agency databases issued through the order do strive to prevent harmful AI practices “</span><a href="https://www.education.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/secretary-of-education/pdf/AI-Education-Guidelines.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">based on inherent biases that lead to discriminatory outcomes”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and “</span><a href="https://www.vita.virginia.gov/media/vitavirginiagov/it-governance/ea/pdf/EA-Solutions-Artificial-Intelligence-Standard.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">mitigate any risk of bias and discrimination by AI Systems</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.” That’s a sign the governor is listening to and learning from experts and everyday citizens concerned about how AI could unfairly impact some of us; it’s a good start.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Suhas Subramanyam, D-Loudoun, a few weeks ago introduced </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SJ14" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Joint Resolution 14</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which orders the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission to continue studying the impact of AI in the state with a specific focus on understanding </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“deep fakes, data privacy implications, and misinformation,” making sure the technology doesn’t “indirectly or directly lead to discrimination,” finding ways to “promote equity in AI algorithms,” and looking at how AI can “improve government operations and services.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subramanyam, who was a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">technology policy adviser in the administration of former President Barack Obama,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> said his professional as well as personal experiences prompted him to put forward this measure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We shouldn&#8217;t necessarily stifle and overregulate [artificial intelligence], but we should look at how we can prevent bad practices and behaviors” that stem from it, he told me during a 9 p.m. interview earlier this week. (It was the only time he could talk after a full day at Capitol Square; I whispered my questions to him from my bedroom closet, hoping not to wake my kids. That he would make time to speak on AI after hours spoke volumes about his interest in and passion for the subject.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I come from an immigrant family, and one of the things I&#8217;ve found, as someone with a ‘funny’ name like mine and a background like mine, you tend to find a lot of overgeneralizations or caricatures of your culture already, and those things also show up in the datasets that we use with AI and emergent tech,” Subramanyam said. “If you&#8217;ve got a dataset that&#8217;s not representative of all communities and cultures, then you will have an outcome that represents that characterization and misrepresentation.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, among the roughly two dozen measures dealing with AI that are on the table this session is </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+ful+SB621" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 621</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which would establish a commission dedicated solely to advising the governor on AI policy in Virginia; I think Youngkin could surely use the help, and future leaders could too. Through this bill and others, Virginia now has the opportunity to implement artificial intelligence, machine learning and other emerging technologies in a responsible, ethical way that takes into account the specific harms possible for many of its citizens. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alexa, play Ice Cube’s “You Can Do It.” </span></p>

For them, a reliable high-speed internet connection is more than just a convenience; it is a lifeline to the modern world.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the head of a statewide broadband association, I have heard countless stories like the Andersons’. These families, who reside in unserved areas, have dreams of easy and affordable access to the internet for education, telehealth, and economic opportunities. While 2028 was supposed to be the year we bridged this digital divide and achieved universal broadband access for all Virginians, the road to progress is now fraught with obstacles, delays and finger pointing, putting it in jeopardy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Luckily, House Majority Leader </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Charniele Herring, D-Alexandria has introduced</span> <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB137" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 800</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which could speed up broadband availability.

David Marsden, D-Fairfax recently introduced a similar bill,</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=SB713" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 713</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the Senate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For background, last year, electric cooperatives – </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">which play an indispensable role in expanding broadband to rural areas – faced their own set of broadband-related challenges, encountering </span><a href="https://www.vpm.org/news/2023-07-06/virginia-universal-broadband-initiative-internet-lawsuit-railroads" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">delays and exorbitant fees</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from railroad companies when seeking to install high-speed fiber cables over railroad-owned property. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They argued that these delays risked their ability to meet the mandated deadlines to complete construction on their broadband projects. These setbacks could trigger the potential to have grant funds clawed back and prevent broadband being built to the unserved.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ironically, some electric cooperatives are now imposing delays and obstacles to broadband expansion, jeopardizing </span><a href="https://www.dhcd.virginia.gov/sites/default/files/DocX/broadband/merged-12-9-23-bac-packet.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">billions of dollars</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – $224 million in state funds and $2.23 billion in federal funds – stemming from outdated utility poles. To expand broadband, cooperatives must perform &#8220;make ready work,&#8221; where cooperative poles are inspected to ensure that broadband infrastructure can be installed in compliance with, at minimum, the </span><a href="https://standards.ieee.org/products-programs/nesc/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Electric Safety Code</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> safety standards. Without a deadline to perform this make-ready work, many months can go by before those inspections are conducted and make-ready work can be completed. Sadly, new utility pole attachers are finding that many cooperative poles have fallen into disrepair and no longer comply with modern safety standards, yet electric cooperatives are pushing for broadband providers – and, by extension, taxpayers across Virginia – to foot the bill for replacing infrastructure they have neglected for years.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Herein lies both the problem and its solution.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The oversight of utility infrastructure preparation is divided between two entities: the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for investor-owned utilities like Dominion Energy or Appalachian Power; and the State Corporation Commission (SCC) for electric cooperatives. Just last month, the FCC updated the rules that apply to investor-owned utilities (IOU).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the current Virginia state code, electric cooperatives </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title56/chapter15/section56-466.1/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">are permitted to charge broadband providers for access to utility poles </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but there is no clear set of rules that apply to the make-ready process or timelines. This ad-hoc approach enables electric cooperatives to impose unreasonable costs on government-funded broadband expansion projects to subsidize overdue upgrades to their aging infrastructure, over and above the charges that cooperatives impose to lease access to these poles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 800 and Senate Bill 713 propose a solution by applying FCC&#8217;s rules to electric cooperatives while maintaining the SCC&#8217;s regulatory role. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It aims to standardize the regulation of utility pole access, which will allow for rapid expansion of broadband while also ensuring equitable and safe infrastructure improvements across the state.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It also seeks to distribute costs between the utility pole owner and the internet service provider, preventing monopoly pole owners from disproportionately impacting consumers, which is a threat being leveraged by electric cooperatives. By passing this legislation, electric cooperatives would continue to earn revenue from pole usage while also being held accountable for the maintenance and future readiness of their utility poles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Policymakers could ensure fair internet access for all Virginians by passing House Bill 800 and Senate Bill 713, aligning electric cooperatives with FCC guidelines. The legislation will prevent consumers and broadband companies from being placed in danger of having their grants revoked and leaving Virginians unserved. Swift action is needed to remove barriers to broadband expansion and to protect the interests of families like the Andersons, ensuring equitable digital opportunities for every citizen in the state.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People are dying on our highways in dramatically increasing numbers. Speeding is one of the most significant </span><a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/risky-driving/speeding" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">causes of these deaths</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Across the U.S., pedestrian </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/27/us/pedestrian-deaths-2022.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">deaths are up 77%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over the last decade. Urban areas are hit the hardest: Although they contain just 15% of the nation’s roads, </span><a href="https://www.axios.com/local/richmond/2023/06/28/virginia-pedestrian-traffic-deaths" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">they account for 67% of pedestrian deaths</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. According to local records, Hampton Roads pedestrian deaths are </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/05/17/hampton-roads-again-leads-virginia-metro-areas-in-vehicle-crashes/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">up 38%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over the last decade. In 2022, pedestrian deaths were </span><a href="https://patch.com/virginia/burke/nova-reports-startling-increase-pedestrian-deaths-2022-dmv" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">up 50%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over 2021 in Northern Virginia. They increased nearly </span><a href="https://richmondmagazine.com/news/features/seeing-a-safer-city/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">77% in Richmond</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, 2010 to 2021.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speed kills. The likelihood of death grows rapidly with vehicle speed. A vehicle going 42 mph has a nearly </span><a href="https://aaafoundation.org/impact-speed-pedestrians-risk-severe-injury-death/" target="_blank"><b>fivefold</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> higher probability</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of killing a pedestrian it hits than if it were going 25 mph. It’s quite common for vehicles to be traveling 42 mph in 25 mph urban/residential areas. I have captured and documented this in the past, having tracked and documented over four million vehicle traversals on residential streets in Charlottesville with an </span><a href="https://github.com/pfr/VideoSpeedTracker/blob/master/docs/Video%20Speed%20Tracker%20Overview%20and%20User%20Manual.md" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">open source validated speed tracking system</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I developed. I have presented my findings in testimony to Virginia’s legislature three different times.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have analyzed how traffic calming approaches – narrow lanes, bump outs, chicanes and all the rest,with the possible exception of speed bumps – don’t work. Comprehensive enforcement by police officers could work but is unrealistic. Virginia localities face persistent staffing shortages on police forces, and tight budgets. Police traffic stops have </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/04/06/1167980495/americas-roads-are-more-dangerous-as-police-pull-over-fewer-drivers" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">declined considerably</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> across the U.S. and become more dangerous, putting both officers and drivers at risk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speed cameras can address these issues, and more. They allow police forces to spend more time on other issues and they reduce </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2015-101/pdfs/2015-101_v2.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">risk associated</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with traffic stops for all. They are race/gender/wealth agnostic. They are much less costly than the traffic calming efforts which don’t work anyway. They can make pedestrians and bicyclists feel much safer. Parents might actually let their kids walk to school again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A handful of arguments come out whenever speed cameras are proposed. Let’s explore these.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Speed cameras aren’t reliable.”</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Yes, they are, exceedingly so. The Washington Post has reported that speed camera tickets are the most reliable kind issued in D.C. Over 98% of speed camera tickets hold up in court. Of the small percentage of people who challenge their speed camera tickets, more than 80% lose their appeal, </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/most-drivers-who-fight-a-ticket-in-dc-come-out-on-top/2016/03/22/a3aa61c2-ef8e-11e5-a61f-e9c95c06edca_story.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to the Post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Speed cameras are routinely tested and calibrated to ensure accuracy.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Speed cameras violate privacy.”</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Actually, they violate privacy less than an officer on a motorcycle with a radar gun who ultimately stops you if you’re speeding. If you are not speeding as you drive by a speed camera, </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/transportationsafety/calculator/factsheet/speed.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">no data about you is collected</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If you are speeding, only your speed, license </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title46.2/chapter8/section46.2-882.1/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">plate number and an image of your vehicle</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are collected. Enabling legislation can mandate a short retention period of that data. By contrast, think about driving by all those Ring doorbell cameras in your neighborhood, or about all the data manufacturers are collecting every time you drive a new car. (</span><a href="https://www.nissanusa.com/privacy.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One car company</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> makes you grant permission for them to collect and use for marketing purposes information including your religious affiliation, sex and gender.) And, there is no law that says anyone has a reasonable expectation of privacy related to the operation of their vehicle on public roads.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Communities deploy speed cameras to make money.” </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps some do, but most are just trying to keep speeders from killing their citizens. And the legislature can place strings on how the money is spent if they so choose. Finally, if you’re not speeding, you’re not contributing to the community’s coffers, so just what is the complaint really?</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Due process suffers.”</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> No, it doesn’t. </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title46.2/chapter8/section46.2-882.1/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s current speed camera laws</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for work and school zones require that a human review every camera-based speeding violation for accuracy before a ticket is issued. And recipients of a ticket can appeal. Contrast this with the innocent owner burden in </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/19.2-386.1/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s asset forfeiture laws</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">!</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Speed cameras are unfair to the poor.” </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">All fines weigh more heavily on the poor. Whether the fine is for a ticket issued by a speed camera or by an officer is immaterial. If the concern is that fines are regressive, allowances can be built into the fining structure. If the argument is that the poor will get more tickets per capita, that seems like an offensive assumption.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I got a ticket and wasn’t driving.”</span></i> <a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title46.2/chapter8/section46.2-882.1/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Current Virginia speed camera law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> allows you to file an affidavit saying who was.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speed cameras only cost you if you speed, rich or poor. In the balance, decades of experience across the globe shows the technology has a profound beneficial effect on vehicle-related deaths and serious injuries. These benefits far outweigh any of the arguments lodged against them, and justify support for proposed legislation – like </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB20" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 20</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – that would expand speed camera usage in Virginia. </span></p>

(Meghan McIntyre/The Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares </span><a href="https://www.oag.state.va.us/media-center/news-releases/2629-october-24-2023-attorney-general-miyares-files-lawsuit-against-meta-for-harming-youth-mental-health-through-its-social-media-platforms" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the commonwealth is joining 32 other states in a federal lawsuit against Meta over allegations its social media platforms are purposely harmful to children.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://files.constantcontact.com/d3e83e11901/5684d7e7-ff8e-4c95-a796-1b0613367aaf.pdf?rdr=true" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lawsuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> alleges that Meta knew about the extent of the psychological and health harms suffered by young users addicted to its platforms, including Facebook and Instagram, but falsely assured the public they are safe and suitable for children and teens. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also claims Meta’s business model exploits and monetizes young users through data harvesting and targeted ads by designing purposely-addictive platform features. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The suit alleges features such as auto-play, algorithms and near-constant alerts were knowingly created with the express goal of hooking children and teens into descending “rabbit holes.” In turn, the suit claims young users can be exposed to harmful content such as suicide and self-harm content, hate speech and misinformation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The suit claims Meta also has a “deep understanding” of the significant and extensive harms to young people associated with addiction and compulsive use of the platforms, including depression, eating disorders, physical self-harm and suicidal ideation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Miyares compared Meta to big tobacco companies advertising to children, pointing to the Joe Camel cartoon as a way to hook young people on cigarettes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“At the expense of public health and specifically the health of our youth, they’ve exploited the vulnerability of our young children and the fundamental desire for connection for their own personal gain,” Miyares said during a press conference on Tuesday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, the suit alleges Meta is well aware that kids under the age of 13 are on their platform, but still collects data from these children without first obtaining verifiable parental consent as required by the federal Children&#8217;s Online Privacy Protection Act. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Miyares said that Meta could obtain parental consent using age verification technologies, like uploading a drivers license or official government identification. When asked about the potential for data breaches seen in states requiring third-party age verification methods to </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/03/09/bill-to-require-additional-proof-of-age-for-porn-sites-in-virginia-heads-to-youngkins-desk/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">access pornographic websites</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Miyares reiterated the technology is a great first step to protecting children.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Glenn Youngkin has previously expressed similar concerns that parents need to be more involved in efforts to mitigate the impact of social media on children and teenagers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin proposed an </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/youngkin-recommends-tighter-parental-approvals-for-children-accessing-websites/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">amendment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to Virginia&#8217;s pornographic website age verification law that would have extended the age of children who require parental consent for social media accounts from under 13 to under 18. The Senate narrowly rejected the proposal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At a “Parents Matter” town hall this August, Youngkin heavily </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/08/08/at-parent-focused-event-youngkin-takes-aim-at-social-medias-destructive-influence/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">emphasized</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the importance of parents&#8217; involvement in their child’s social media life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Miyares said he hopes Meta complies with consumer protection laws and prioritizes the safety of children moving forward, and if not, he isn’t afraid of the fight. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We would welcome the opportunity to have a meaningful discussion about how they could change their platforms to better protect our children and our teens,” Miyares said. “You chose to fight us, we’ll see you in court.”</span></p>

<p>The internet has become a part of our daily life. Whether you access it on a computer, or a mobile device such as a cell phone or tablet, the internet has opened doors for us. Unfortunately, there can be scary surprises behind some of those doors.</p>
<p>We pay a price to access this wealth of knowledge. This day and age, it’s important to remind everyone that nothing is free. If something appears to be free, you are the product.</p>
<p>Here’s a breakdown of how the internet works, for those of us who didn’t grow up with it. Let’s think of the internet as an amusement park. Let’s make it King’s Island.</p>
<p>You, the consumer, pay for internet service.That’s your fee to get into The Kings Island Internet. You have to pay your Comcast, your Frontier, your Suddenlink first. That’s your ticket inside the park.</p>
<p>Once you’re in, it’s up to you where you go. But once that door is open, you have opened many other doors as well.</p>
<p>Every website you go to is a ride. Just like every ride has security cameras, websites do too. They can track their visitors through IP addresses. And if you want frontsies, well, you can use a token. Just provide your email! Every time you go to a site, you are giving your data. These are companies, and data is currency.</p>
<p>For adults, that’s fine. But when it comes to children, things can get a little murky can’t it? Especially when it comes down to their safety.</p>
<p>It’s back to school time and it’s so exciting for everyone, especially beaming parents. We are so proud to send our children off on their new adventure. But it’s important to remember what you post means it can be seen by everyone on the internet. It can also be tracked.</p>
<p>And even if you have your settings on private, everything is hackable. Everything is traceable.</p>
<p>For instance, I can see the exact location of everyone who visits my website. Because I pay for the space on the internet, I am allowed to see my analytics. And I own everything that is on my site. By me paying for my web address, that is like me paying rent. And everything on my website belongs to me. I pay for my space on Kings Island Internet.</p>
<p>But let’s say you post your things on Facebook. Or Instagram. You are then giving your information, data, and pictures of your kids to somebody else. Now they own it. When you sign up for these user agreements, you allow this.</p>
<p>Those “I DO NOT GIVE PERMISSION” posts on Facebook that Grandma keeps posting do not matter.</p>
<div class="newsroomSidebarContainer">
<div class="newsroomSidebar "><a href="https://www.justice.gov/coronavirus/keeping-children-safe-online#:~:text=Adjust%20privacy%20settings%20and%20use,not%20know%20in%20real%20life" target="_blank">Tips to keep kids safe online</a></div>
</div>
<p>The world has gotten smaller indeed. It is incredible and makes so many opportunities for us all. But it is a double-edged sword, and we need to be careful how much of ourselves we share.</p>
<p>I personally know how hard it is when you want to share all those pictures of your kids doing the hilarious cute things. I used to, as a matter of fact. These days, I have to be more careful. I don’t even have a Facebook. And it’s not just people with a global audience who should be taking this into account.</p>
<p>Because once it’s on the internet, it has the ability to go global. That means everyone in the world can know where your child is. Every child predator you ever tried to make sure didn’t live close to you — now they have access to your child at all times, on the world wide web. They can even download photos from Facebook.</p>
<p>Do you want everyone knowing where your child goes to school? Do you want every person to know your child’s schedule? Drop off time? What about their activities and interests? Because that’s what you’re doing.</p>
<p>You’re giving precious data about minors away to a business. And schools utilizing Facebook should be looked at carefully. It’s a safety issue for students.</p>
<p>The armed forces have always benefited from the data of children with the army being <a href="https://iecc.edu/solomon#:~:text=Under%20a%20federal%20law%20entitled,students%20age%2017%20and%20older." target="_blank" rel="noopener">able to access public school information after all</a>. It makes me nervous that the schools want us to rely on Facebook so much when Facebook isn’t the safest place.</p>
<p>So think before you post. And it’s important to remember that every app you sign up for, every email, that’s your data you are giving to a company. So proceed with caution and thought.</p>
<p>Because it doesn’t matter how big your audience is. Everyone’s watching.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a national leader in cybersecurity, Virginia is setting the standards for data protection and critical infrastructure through its numerous data centers, cloud computing capacity, and skilled workforce.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A recent </span><a href="https://americanedgeproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/AEP-Open-and-Accessible-Internet-White-Paper.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the American Edge Project explains how Virginia’s expertise could help to keep the internet open and accessible for everyone. American information systems are regularly threatened by foreign hackers from China, Russia and other authoritarian regimes.  China steals more than $500 billion in </span><a href="https://foreignaffairs.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Egregious-Cases-of-Chinese-Theft-of-American-Intellectual-Property.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. intellectual property</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> each year and the FBI recently revealed that </span><a href="https://www.fbi.gov/investigate/counterintelligence/the-china-threat" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the agency is investigating</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> more than 2,000 Chinese cyberattacks.  Congress found that Beijing’s increasing reliance on </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/07/magazine/china-spying-intellectual-property.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hostile cyber operations </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">poses “a serious threat to U.S. government, business and critical infrastructure networks in the new and highly competitive cyber domain.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid these threats, the United States must commit to maintaining a free and open internet. As three pillars of a robust policy agenda, America should slow the spread of foreign digital authoritarianism, promote free speech within and across our borders, and build a stronger internet to connect people to each other and to their governments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cybersecurity is a cornerstone of this agenda. Policymakers should increase funding for government agencies to combat foreign influence operations, expand staff and dedicate offices to foreign cybersecurity investigations. Likewise, governments should devote resources to cybersecurity operations to deter foreign election interference.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond these goals, the U.S. should implement security protocols to protect the flow of global information. Information cannot flow freely across borders if transactions with foreign entities pose significant national security threats to American citizens. According to </span><a href="https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/china-exec-summary-risk-to-corporate-america-2019.pdf/view" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">intelligence officials, </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">businesses headquartered in countries that are adversaries to America – or owned by parent companies located in those countries – may present serious national security risks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Already an indispensable part of any cyber strategy, Virginia would benefit from even greater attention to cybersecurity. Virginia’s </span><a href="https://cyberinitiative.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Commonwealth Cyber Initiative</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (CCI) brings together academia, industry and government to address cybersecurity challenges. The commonwealth houses the Pentagon, Central Intelligence Agency, National Security Agency, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and other vital agencies.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many major cybersecurity firms have in-state offices that offer services in areas including threat intelligence, network security, data protection and incident response. Moreover, numerous startups are focusing on cutting-edge technologies like artificial intelligence, machine learning and blockchain for cybersecurity applications. Finally, Virginia’s renowned academic institutions and research centers continue to contribute to the cybersecurity landscape.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With global internet freedom declining and with autocracies like China and Russia on the move, the internet of the future could look very different from today. This policy agenda will slow the spread of digital authoritarianism and usher in an era of greater economic opportunity, increased political accountability and expanded human rights. This agenda also will help to ensure the United States maintains its global edge in technological innovation, to the benefit of freedom- loving people everywhere.</span></p>
