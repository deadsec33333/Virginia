<p>But have you never wondered how he became a man of so many names? From St. Nick to Santa to Kris Kringle, it’s a marvel that Rudolph isn’t completely confused about whom exactly he is working for.</p>
<p>So, <a href="https://www.valeriefridland.com/" target="_blank">as a linguist</a> who studies the social and historical paths that deliver the words we use, the season’s festive lights and boughs of holly inspired a deep dive into Santa’s past to uncover what name we should really be using for the man in red.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Ho, ho, ho</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>It might feel like he has been around as long as the North Pole, but the Santa Claus name so frequently mentioned by Americans to refer to old Saint Nicholas come Christmas Eve is a surprisingly recent moniker.</p>
<p>The first written citation for “Santa Claus” does not appear in the U.S. until the late 18th century, where it was alluded to in a mention of a religious event in the New York Gazette: “Last Monday the Anniversary of St. Nicholas, <a href="https://www.oed.com/dictionary/santa-claus_n" target="_blank">otherwise called St. A Claus</a>, was celebrated at Protestant-Hall.”</p>
<p>The fact that the first citation appeared in New York is not unusual, given New York’s history until 1664 <a href="https://www.nps.gov/mava/learn/historyculture/new-netherland.htm" target="_blank">as a Dutch colony</a> and the ongoing presence of Dutch settlers in that area. This Dutch background is key because Santa Claus is in fact <a href="https://www.oed.com/dictionary/santa-claus_n?tab=etymology" target="_blank">a borrowing into English of the Dutch </a>name Sinter Klaas, which sometimes dialectally appeared as Sante Klaas.</p>
<p>Still, before the 1830s, the substitution of Santa Claus for St. Nick was not in frequent use. In fact, prior to vastly increasing in general popularity toward the latter half of the 1800s, its use earlier that century was often to invoke Dutch heritage and culture, as in the <a href="https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/oa-edit/10.1201/9781315225340-37/contested-representation-dutch-americans-washington-irving-history-new-york-baga-budianta" target="_blank">satirical writings of Washington Irving</a>.</p>
<p>For instance, a <a href="https://archive.org/details/salmagundiorwhim00irvi/page/n9/mode/2up" target="_blank">New York-based satirical magazine</a> of the era had this to say in 1808: “The noted St. Nicholas, vulgarly called Santa claus − of all the saints in the kalendar the most venerated by true hollanders, and their unsophisticated descendants.”</p>
<p>But, by the 1820s, <a href="https://collections.library.yale.edu/catalog/2014510" target="_blank">a children’s book</a> introduced Sante Claus in a sleigh pulled by reindeer, suggesting that his modern reputation was established by then. His iconic attire, though, didn’t become his standard uniform until a <a href="https://www.coca-colacompany.com/about-us/history/haddon-sundblom-and-the-coca-cola-santas" target="_blank">Coca-Cola advertisement</a> depicted him in red-suited splendor over a century later in 1930. Before then, Santa’s outfits had spanned the range from green and yellow to even <a href="https://www.scrippsnews.com/life/holidays-and-celebrations/why-is-santa-claus-dressed-in-red" target="_blank">patriotic stars and stripes</a>.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Old Saint Nick</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The popular term for Santa prior to this period was Saint Nicholas, a name known from the religious observance of the Feast Day of St. Nicholas on Dec. 6. <a href="https://theindoproject.org/celebrating-sinterklaas-part-of-our-dutch-culture/" target="_blank">The Dutch name, SinterKlaas</a>, is actually a derivative of the name Saint Nicholas.</p>
<p>Historically speaking, <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Saint-Nicholas" target="_blank">the namesake of Saint Nicholas</a> was the highly charitable bishop of a Roman town called Myra during the fourth century. He had become the patron saint of children and was known as a man of great generosity. His background made him an easy candidate for later becoming associated with Christmas, even though he originally was celebrated on an entirely different day and for a different reason.</p>
<p>Whether going by St. Nick or Santa Claus, the man’s enormous celebrity as the grantor of tangible wishes also turned out to be another legacy of the Dutch, for it was their tradition <a href="https://www.stnicholascenter.org/around-the-world/customs/netherlands" target="_blank">to give small gifts or sweets</a> on St. Nicholas Day. And so, this Dutch tradition inspired the American mythologizing of a man with a sack of presents on his back to be delivered to children throughout the land.</p>

<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The Kringle wrinkle</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Another name for Santa Claus that grew in popularity in the 1800s was the name Kris Kringle. While Santa Claus was Dutch, Kris Kringle <a href="https://www.wordorigins.org/big-list-entries/kris-kringle" target="_blank">came by way of the Germans</a> who first settled in Pennsylvania and <a href="https://mki.wisc.edu/exhibits/virtual-exhibits-2/how-german-is-american-3/how-german-is-american-settling-in-america/#:%7E:text=According%20to%20the%20U.S.,as%20America's%20%22German%20Belt.%22" target="_blank">then spread out</a>, particularly in the late 1800s.</p>
<p>The name Kris Kringle, though, was unrelated to Saint Nicholas. Instead, it came from the <a href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/Kriss%20Kringle" target="_blank">German word Christkindlein</a>, meaning “Christ child,” referring to the baby in the manger. So, unlike St. Nicholas, Kris Kringle is more directly related to the Christian celebration of Christ’s birth.</p>
<p>Over time, however, the feast of St. Nicholas, also celebrated by German immigrants, became increasingly merged with the celebration of Christmas in the U.S. Given the German influx into the United States was much greater than the Dutch during the 1800s, it is not surprising that the German name competed with the Dutch term during much of that period before Americans eventually decided to settle mainly on Santa Claus.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">A man of many names</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>In the end, whether it’s St. Nick, Santa or Kris Kringle who rides his sleigh into the holidays, the history of how he got his name is one that illustrates a wonderful melding of languages and cultures – a reminder of how differences can merge into a rich and varied part of a culture, celebrated by many.</p>

(Gerville/Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is a truth universally acknowledged: a politician in possession of elected office must be in want of large economic development projects.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such is the power of this compulsion that it is proof against all reason. Certainly, it has been proof against everything critics of the data center buildout have said so far: that Virginia is catapulting itself into a costly energy crisis that will raise utility bills for residents; that the public shows no love for this industry; and that the benefits to be gained (mostly in the form of construction jobs) will continue only as long as new projects follow one another in perpetuity until the landscape is consumed by concrete and transmission wires. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To the credit of the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission (JLARC), however, it has tried to sound the alarm. JLARC’s </span><a href="https://jlarc.virginia.gov/pdfs/reports/Rpt598-2.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, “Data Centers in Virginia,” released December 9, describes the challenges facing the state as a result of the massive, ongoing buildout of this resource-intensive industry. Many of JLARC’s conclusions seem way too sanguine to me, especially around risks to regional water supplies and air pollution from diesel generators, and the policy options it offers don’t always hit the mark.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But on the threat to Virginia’s energy supply, JLARC is blunt: Building enough infrastructure to provide electricity for even just half the data centers projected for development across the state will be difficult, requiring far more generating facilities than are under development today. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for the current policy of allowing completely unconstrained data center growth – indeed, subsidizing it as we do now with tax exemptions to the tune of nearly a billion dollars per year – JLARC notes we are headed for a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/12/09/legislative-report-development-of-data-centers-could-triple-energy-demands-if-unconstrained/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tripling of the state’s electricity usage</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over just the next decade and a half.  Meeting that much demand, says the report, would be “very difficult to achieve,” even if the state jettisoned the carbon emission limits imposed by the Virginia Clean Economy Act (VCEA).</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="jDk3UxUAza"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/04/03/now-what-the-heck-do-we-do-about-data-centers/">Now what the heck do we do about data centers?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Now what the heck do we do about data centers?&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/04/03/now-what-the-heck-do-we-do-about-data-centers/embed/#?secret=xh3rFkhdl6#?secret=jDk3UxUAza" data-secret="jDk3UxUAza" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For those of you unfamiliar with the vocabulary of bureaucrats, “very difficult to achieve” is a term of art that translates roughly as, “This is nuts.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It might have been better if JLARC had employed the vernacular, because as it is, Virginia’s elected leaders will probably take “very difficult” to be a sort of heroic challenge, like beating the Russians to the moon, when what JLARC means is more like achieving lasting peace in the Middle East. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One problem is cost. The law of supply and demand dictates that a massive increase in energy demand that isn’t matched by an equally massive increase in energy supply will lead to higher prices for all customers. Yet new energy projects cost money, and under traditional ratemaking principles that also means higher rates for everyone. The result is that it will be impossible to protect residents from higher utility bills, unless changes are made to the way costs get allocated. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Figuring out how to protect residents and other non-data center customers is currently a focus of the State Corporation Commission, which held a technical conference on data centers on December 16</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Judging by what the experts it convened had to say, the SCC has its work cut out for it.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if ordinary residents could be protected, the bigger problem is that increasing the supply of energy to keep up with soaring data center demand will not be easy, fast or cheap. JLARC warns that providing enough low-cost energy requires that gas plants, solar facilities, battery projects and transmission lines all be built at a pace Virginia has never achieved before, along with onshore wind farms that have never found takers here (though that may be </span><a href="https://virginiabusiness.com/big-tech-company-to-buy-power-from-va-s-first-onshore-wind-farm/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">changing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">), offshore wind projects that currently lack a pathway to development, and starting ten years from now, new nuclear plants in the form of small modular reactors (SMRs) that haven’t yet achieved commercial viability.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="bC6aPdPSgo"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/12/02/data-centers-and-virginias-special-kind-of-denialism/">Data centers and Virginia’s special kind of denialism</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Data centers and Virginia’s special kind of denialism&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/12/02/data-centers-and-virginias-special-kind-of-denialism/embed/#?secret=nvV1Z3JuQf#?secret=bC6aPdPSgo" data-secret="bC6aPdPSgo" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, the new generation and transmission will have to overcome local opposition. On the gas side, Dominion Energy’s plans for a new plant in Chesterfield County face </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/30/chesterfield-community-convenes-peoples-hearing-absent-a-county-held-one/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fierce resistance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the local community, which argues it has been burdened by fossil fuel pollution for too many years already. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clean energy also struggles at the local level. Industry representatives told members of the Commission on Electric Utility Regulation (CEUR) on December 17 that more than 30 localities have effectively banned utility solar projects within their borders. Legislators are loath to override local government authority over permitting, even when counties that welcome data centers </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/12/03/data-centers-approved-solar-farms-rejected-what-is-going-on-in-rural-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">turn down</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the solar facilities needed to power them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And of course, these generation projects involve willing landowners. When it comes to transmission lines that are forced on property owners through eminent domain – many of which will be needed only to carry power to data centers – the public backlash may be brutal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given so much local resistance to new generation and transmission, the fact that so many legislators nonetheless remain wedded to the data center buildout testifies to the ability of the human mind to compartmentalize. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For legislators who care about climate, JLARC has more bad news: Fully half the new data center growth coming to Virginia is slated to occur in the territories of rural electric cooperatives, which are largely unaffected by VCEA limits. In addition, very large customers of Dominion and APCo have their own VCEA loophole: if they meet certain requirements, they can leave their utility to buy power from competitive service providers. Thus, if Virginia is serious about decarbonization, it will have to tighten, not loosen, the VCEA.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report comes with some caveats. JLARC used a team of consultants to model approaches to meeting the supply gaps, and a lot of assumptions go into the </span><a href="https://jlarc.virginia.gov/pdfs/presentations/JLARC%20Virginia%20Data%20Center%20Study_FINAL_12-09-2024.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">consultant’s report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> without a lot of details. The consultant group says it chose its mix of resources with a view to least cost, but it acknowledges that different assumptions would change the results. It may not have accounted for the fact that renewable energy and storage prices continue to drop; meanwhile, fossil gas</span><a href="https://rmi.org/the-myth-of-stable-and-affordable-natural-gas-prices/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> prices are so volatile </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">that the one certain  thing you can say about any price forecast is that it will be wrong. Moreover, it appears the effects of re-entering the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative were not modeled; nor were the social costs of carbon, both of which favor zero-emission sources over fossil fuel plants. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where there are details, some beg to be questioned. Both the consultants and JLARC take for granted that a shortage of generation in Virginia can be made up by importing electricity from other states. An easy way out, sure, but it works only if other states are producing a surplus. Unless tech companies are required to secure their own carbon-free energy supply, there is no way to guarantee imports will be available. Contrary to one of JLARC’s suggestions, then, retail choice should not be curtailed. The better move is to expand shopping options for large customers, so long as the electricity they buy is zero-carbon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even more suspect is the idea that, in order to comply with the VCEA, all gas plants will convert to burning green hydrogen in 2045. The report might as well say, “and then a miracle occurs.” A miracle would be more likely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However unserious, hydrogen as a placeholder for any hoped-for technology that isn’t available today demonstrates the fundamental problem confronting Virginia’s damn-the-torpedoes approach to data centers. A refusal to put constraints on the buildout means taking a leap into the unknown and hoping something will happen to save us from the consequences of our profligacy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And sure, maybe it will work out. Legislators tend to be optimists, and they are already betting on bright, shiny objects like SMRs, </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/12/18/virginia-to-host-worlds-first-fusion-power-plant/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fusion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and anything else not close enough for its costs and drawbacks to be fully evident. (Not that I’m immune, but personally I’m betting on </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/10/geothermal-energy-is-having-a-moment-could-it-power-virginias-data-centers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">advanced geothermal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which is not just bright and shiny but </span><a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/geothermal/was-2024-a-breakout-year-for-next-generation-geothermal-energy?utm_campaign=canary&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_PBgowoMiLVuB0gJvnCX8OnYRhNoz2UvuX652kq3S-jmEBgONlCzBP1Jp9a7hRErUG07g0KbCHTMz-ugwvauV_vGzK4ueJwmL6XDS0ZYvLfxlEzsA&amp;_hsmi=339495518&amp;utm_source=newsletter" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">already here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.) And hey, for all we know, artificial intelligence, the technology most culpable for today’s energy crisis, might even produce some unexpected new energy source.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or it might not. Given that most of the data center buildout will happen in just</span><a href="https://baxtel.com/news/will-2025-be-the-year-of-the-data-center-here-are-three-promising-facts-from-the-virginia-market" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the next five years</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we might need an actual miracle. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the flip side, maybe new technology will reduce the energy demand of data centers by </span><a href="https://cse.umn.edu/college/news/researchers-develop-state-art-device-make-artificial-intelligence-more-energy" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">orders of magnitude</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. That would be a fantastic outcome from the standpoint of climate, water and energy — though it would end the construction gravy train in Virginia and leave a wasteland of empty concrete warehouses and stranded energy infrastructure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Either way, the unconstrained buildout of data centers has handed Virginia leaders a problem that is, in the parlance of JLARC, “very difficult” indeed.</span></p>

(Roger Chesley/Virginia Mercury)
</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aunt Louise holds a special place of honor on my Christmas card list this year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She’s the last living aunt or uncle, for that matter — following the deaths of several family elders since the start of 2023. Aunt Lou is the Washington football franchise’s biggest fan, and the 96-year-old has the Commanders’ paraphernalia and knowledge of pigskin strategy to prove it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We snail mail cards to the homes of 90 relatives, longtime friends and journalism colleagues annually, sometimes with updates on the expanding careers of our adult children. Email missives and impersonal text chains just won’t do the trick for The Boss and me.</span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2012/10/13/a-holiday-card-truly-from-the-heart-requires-paper-postage/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Mailing cards</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, even with the ever-rising costs of stamps, has been a pleasant, longstanding ritual for us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Christmas card list also represents an evolving microcosm of our lives and relationships.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Relatives and friends who are now widowed dot the lineup. We acknowledge the deceased by supporting those still living and adapting to loss.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other spots, divorces mean we send out cards to different addresses where one previously sufficed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adult nieces and nephews — we have a bunch — now receive their own cards. Before, they were lumped in with their parents. How did one-time youngsters get so old, anyway?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve become more respectful of folks who aren’t Christian, be they Jews, Muslims, from other faiths or no faith at all. They get cards touting “Happy Holidays” and notes wishing them well in the season. I’m far from offended by this inclusive practice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Families with new children crop up on the list occasionally. That’s a rarity, though, since The Boss and I have attained AARP status.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So consider this my special card to all of you, even if it doesn’t arrive in your mailbox: Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays. May you have health, happiness and peace.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin is pitching a tax cut, and cites a hefty state budgetary surplus as justification. But surpluses can evaporate in a Mar-a-Largo minute, and the prospects of declining revenue flowing to Virginia because of cutbacks in federal employment and reductions in Medicaid reimbursements are making Virginia budget makers skittish about the future. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">We have seen the &#8216;Swamp&#8217;– and &#8216;they&#8217; is us</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump has stated his desire to fundamentally change the federal bureaucracy by eliminating civil servants either deemed expendable or who do not exhibit sufficient loyalty to the president. He could start by reinstituting</span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/15/us/politics/trump-biden-schedule-f.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Schedule F</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an executive order issued late in his first term (and rescinded by President Joe Biden) to strip job protections from many career federal employees and make them more like political appointees who can be fired at will. This would devastate the Commonwealth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More </span><a href="https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/data-analysis-documentation/federal-employment-reports/reports-publications/federal-civilian-employment/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">federal workers live here than in any other state</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">; 85,000 live in Northern Virginia and another </span><a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/SMU51472609091000001SA" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">60,000 make Hampton Roads</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> their home. Many earn a good salary and cuts in their positions would mean losing state revenue that comes both from their income taxes and the sales taxes generated from their purchases. Remember sequestration, when Virginia took a disproportionate hit from cuts in federal spending? Or the various government shutdowns? When the federal government sneezes, Virginia catches a cold.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Substantial cuts in federal employment might not dramatically affect the state budget until Youngkin has left office, but budget writers are justifiably concerned about future revenue shortfalls, thereby making any major tax cut problematic. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The Medicaid dilemma</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Trump’s attack on federal employees may garner the largest headlines, his plans for cutting Medicaid pose more serious fiscal challenges for the states. Since 1965, Medicaid has been the largest source of medical and health care funding for poor and disabled Americans, providing free health insurance to over 80 million people, many of whom are children. It is administered by the states, but major program funding is provided by the federal government. For every dollar a state spends on Medicaid, Washington provides a match to cover the costs. The </span><a href="https://www.kff.org/medicaid/state-indicator/federal-matching-rate-and-multiplier/?currentTimeframe=0&amp;sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">match rate differs by state</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In states with higher per capita incomes such as Virginia and New York, the federal match equals 50% of costs. For poorer states like Mississippi and Alabama, the match is over 70%. Yearly federal spending on Medicaid exceeds $880 billion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Big changes in the program have occurred since passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010, which initially required states to expand Medicaid to people with incomes of up to 138% of the federal poverty level (which today equals </span><a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/documents/7240229f28375f54435c5b83a3764cd1/detailed-guidelines-2024.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">about $35,600 for a family of 3</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). In 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court </span><a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/10.1377/hlthaff.2012.0766" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">made this optional</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but since the ACA required the federal government to pick up 100% of the state costs for the expansion population (gradually declining to 90%), many states concluded that expansion was a great way to provide insurance to those who could not afford it. </span><a href="https://www.kff.org/status-of-state-medicaid-expansion-decisions/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forty-one states plus D.C.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> eventually embraced the plan. Virginia joined in 2019, and its expansion population now numbers 758,000 of the 1,872,000 state residents in the program. Today, </span><a href="https://ihodvirginiageneralassembly.s3.amazonaws.com/agenda_block_docs/attaches/000/001/025/original/FINAL__Medicaid_Forecast_Presentation_11-19-24.pdf?1732028008" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Medicaid covers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> almost 13% of the state’s population, and it is the second largest expenditure in the state budget.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia budget writers were recently informed that there is a $632 million Medicaid shortfall that will require addressing in the next Assembly session. While that may be enough to throw a monkey wrench into the Governor’s plan for a tax cut, it is potentially only the tip of the iceberg.  Reducing Medicaid funding has been the target of conservatives for decades, and, with Republicans in control of the presidency and both chambers of Congress, a serious effort likely will be made to make cuts. The Heritage Foundation’s</span><a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24088042-project-2025s-mandate-for-leadership-the-conservative-promise" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Project 2025 report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the Republican Study Committee’s</span><a href="https://hern.house.gov/uploadedfiles/final_budget_including_letter_word_doc-final_as_of_march_25.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> budget plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the FY 2025 House budget</span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/congressional-report/118th-congress/house-report/568/1?outputFormat=pdf&amp;s=1&amp;r=4&amp;q=%7B%22search%22%3A%22HCR+117%22%7D" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> resolution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> all propose Medicaid cuts, including the reduction of the federal match for the expansion population. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican proposals to reduce the match rate would be a budgetary disaster for all states, including Virginia.  Ironically, many of the states who voted for Trump would take the largest hit because their federal match is so high.  In Virginia, a reduction in the match for the expansion population to 50% reimbursement would mean </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">$3 billion</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> less per year for our budget, making the present shortfall mild by comparison. The commonwealth would either need to find additional funds to fill the gap, or dramatically cut services to those most in need.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="INl8ozxXyw"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/12/11/9-states-including-virginia-poised-to-end-coverage-for-millions-if-trump-cuts-medicaid-funding/">9 states, including Virginia, poised to end coverage for millions if Trump cuts Medicaid funding</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;9 states, including Virginia, poised to end coverage for millions if Trump cuts Medicaid funding&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/12/11/9-states-including-virginia-poised-to-end-coverage-for-millions-if-trump-cuts-medicaid-funding/embed/#?secret=dWE8qgV4U0#?secret=INl8ozxXyw" data-secret="INl8ozxXyw" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it gets worse. Buried in the 2018 Virginia Medicaid expansion authorization is language that requires the state to</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/12/11/9-states-including-virginia-poised-to-end-coverage-for-millions-if-trump-cuts-medicaid-funding/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> unwind expansion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> if the federal match falls below 90%. Eight other states  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Arizona, Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Montana, New Hampshire, North Carolina, and Utah) have similar </span><a href="https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/medicaid-expansion-is-a-red-and-blue-state-issue/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">laws</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that require termination of expansion if the share of federal funding drops.  This would create a bureaucratic nightmare and remove 758,000 recipients.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This places Youngkin in a serious quandary.  Many of the people in the reddest counties in Virginia who voted for both him and Trump would likely be seriously harmed if they no longer qualified for Medicaid or their benefits were reduced. The Governor, could, of course, propose new language in his budget to eliminate the requirement that the commonwealth abandon expansion if the match declines. Or he could speak out against any proposed cuts. To do either would likely draw the ire of the MAGA faithful, a group the governor is attempting to court as he contemplates a run for higher office.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most likely, he does nothing, in hopes the U.S. Senate has enough spine to prevent anything serious from happening.  It isn’t exactly leadership, but it preserves his options for another day.</span></p>

																						<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="710" height="535" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Jonas-Salk.jpeg" class="attachment-large size-large wp-post-image" alt="" style="margin-bottom: 10px;" decoding="async" loading="lazy" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Jonas-Salk.jpeg 710w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Jonas-Salk-300x226.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 710px) 100vw, 710px" /><p style="font-size:12px;">Dr. Jonas Salk developed the polio vaccine, which has saved millions of lives. A simple story about a polio victim changed the writer’s mind. (Senator John Heinz History Center)

</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I remember, when I was maybe just 5 years old, chewing a sugar cube to ward off a horrible, deadly disease.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My father was with me in the long line some 60 years ago as we fought polio,</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2022/06/18/polio-vaccine-young-children-jfk/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">an affliction that killed people or left them paralyzed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Polio was — and to a small extent, still is — generally contracted by exposure in water that had fecal matter in it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We were in a large auditorium or maybe a community center in Washington, D.C. My dad and I each gulped down a cube that contained a weakened version of the live virus. No shots, no pain, just sweets. (An earlier vaccine developed in the mid-1950s</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2022/06/18/polio-vaccine-young-children-jfk/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">by Dr. Jonas Salk required a series of injections</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Decades ago, polio survivors often had to use iron lungs to help them breathe. Photos of the bulky metal contraptions, to this impressionable child, suggested spherical torture chambers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Polio is</span><a href="https://asm.org/articles/2024/september/polio-s-last-stand-the-global-fight-for-eradicatio" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">nearly eradicated today</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, endemic only in Pakistan and Afghanistan. Children now usually get a polio vaccine at 2, 4 and 6 months, and then a final dose at 4-6 years old, Dr. Leah Rowland, a pediatrician at Children’s Hospital of The King’s Daughters in Norfolk, told me by email.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The vaccine is “extremely effective, offering lifelong immunity of 99-100%,” Rowland said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fact that Americans rarely even talk about polio nowadays is a testament to the vaccine’s effectiveness and acceptance. It’s a huge success story.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which is why the possible elevation of vaccine critics</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/12/13/vaccines-protect-your-children-and-others-too/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2024/12/15/dave-weldon-trump-cdc-vaccine-skepticism/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Dave Weldon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — to head the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, respectively, in a second Trump administration — is so alarming.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If not outright insane.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., the chamber’s minority leader, is a polio survivor. He’s assailed Kennedy for seeking to rescind approval of the polio vaccine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Efforts to undermine public confidence in proven cures are not just uninformed — they’re dangerous,” McConnell said in a statement, according to Politico. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People my age probably have vague recollections of the earlier, unusual sugar rush of the polio vaccine. Such memories should remain ephemeral.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They won’t, however, if misguided officials encourage conspiracy theories over proven vaccines. We don’t need a resurgence of diseases that are so easily preventable.</span></p>

<p>Nearly 95% of people who have experienced loss report dealing with <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/il/news-releases/empathy-releases-annual-cost-of-dying-report-for-2024-302036982.html" target="_blank">at least one symptom of physical or mental distress</a>. Approximately 10% of them develop <a href="https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/prolonged-grief-disorder" target="_blank">prolonged grief disorder</a>, a persistent and debilitating form of grief that does not ease with time.</p>
<p>Often, this grief is due to the death of a loved one, but it may also be caused by the loss of a friendship, a divorce or even a job loss.</p>
<p>Grief affects not only <a href="https://www.webmd.com/balance/special-reports/grief-stages/20190711/the-grief-experience-survey-shows-its-complicated" target="_blank">mental health</a> but also <a href="https://doi.org/10.31887/DCNS.2012.14.2/tbuckley" target="_blank">physical well-being</a>, and it can increase the risk of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.111.061770" target="_blank">heart disease</a>, immune dysfunction and even death.</p>
<p>Holidays and special occasions, which often include family gatherings, traditions and reminders of what’s missing, can amplify this pain, leaving those grieving feeling isolated and overwhelmed.</p>
<p>As a clinical psychologist and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=f9DdtPUAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao" target="_blank">professor of psychiatry and neurobehavioral sciences</a> working with cancer patients and their families, I see the profound toll grief takes on people. I’ve also experienced grief personally, both when my mother died suddenly at the age of 66 and when my father passed after a long illness at the age of 84.</p>
<p>Those experiences, combined with my research, have driven me to dedicate much of my career to understanding grief and its effects, and to finding effective ways to support those who are struggling with it.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Mourning vs. prolonged grief</h4>

	
<p>Grief is a natural response to loss, encompassing emotional, cognitive, physical and social reactions. Common signs include sadness, withdrawal, difficulty concentrating, disrupted sleep and physical symptoms like fatigue or aches.</p>
<p>Grief is deeply personal, and while <a href="https://theconversation.com/processing-and-grieving-an-ongoing-loss-such-as-a-child-with-a-devastating-injury-or-disability-does-not-fit-neatly-into-traditional-models-of-grief-205459" target="_blank">there is no “right” way to grieve</a>, most people move through the process over time, finding a new equilibrium in their lives.</p>
<p>However, some people experience <a href="https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/prolonged-grief-disorder" target="_blank">prolonged grief disorder</a>, a condition newly recognized in psychiatry’s gold-standard manual, the <a href="https://www.psychiatry.org/psychiatrists/practice/dsm" target="_blank">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition</a>, in 2022.</p>
<p>This condition is characterized by intense yearning, sorrow or preoccupation with the deceased that persists for 12 months or more, significantly impairing daily functioning. People experiencing this disorder often feel disconnected from life and unable to find joy or meaning.</p>
<p>Unlike nonpathological grief, prolonged grief disorder is associated with chronic activation of the <a href="https://www.apa.org/news/podcasts/speaking-of-psychology/grieving-changes-brain" target="_blank">brain’s stress response system</a>, particularly in areas like the <a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/24894-amygdala" target="_blank">amygdala</a>. The amygdala is a small, almond-shaped cluster of neurons in the brain that plays a key role in processing emotions, especially fear, stress and threat-related responses. Prolonged grief disorder is also linked to <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/complicated-grief/symptoms-causes/syc-20360374" target="_blank">mental health conditions</a> such as depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD.</p>
<p>As you support a friend or family member in their grief, it’s important to watch for signs of prolonged grief disorder because it requires targeted interventions. Research, including my ongoing studies on the use of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/09540261.2024.2357668" target="_blank">psilocybin-assisted therapy</a> for the treatment of grief, highlights the importance of <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/interview-with-dr-kim-penberthy-of-dops/id1647611444?i=1000663669728" target="_blank">innovative approaches</a> to help those stuck in the cycle of prolonged grief.</p>
<p>If you suspect someone you love is struggling with prolonged grief, encouraging them to seek help and offering to support them in the process can be life-changing. Resources are available, from grief counseling to support groups. Organizations like <a href="http://grief.org/" target="_blank">the American Grief Foundation</a> and local mental health services can provide further guidance for helping a loved one get the treatment they require.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Caring for our own grief on holidays and special occasions</h4>

	
<p>Research supports several strategies for addressing grief, whether typical or prolonged:</p>
<ul>
<li>Express emotions: Suppressing grief can exacerbate mental and physical health issues. Talking with trusted friends, journaling and joining support groups <a href="https://www.betterhelp.com/advice/grief/what-does-inhibited-grief-look-like" target="_blank">can be therapeutic</a>.</li>
<li>Engage in rituals: Personal or cultural rituals, like lighting a candle, visiting a grave site or creating a memory book help integrate loss into one’s life.</li>
<li>Create new traditions as a way to honor your loss: If you’re mourning a death, consider integrating your loved one’s memory into the occasion by preparing their favorite dish, playing their favorite music or hanging an ornament in their honor.</li>
<li>Seek professional support: <a href="https://theconversation.com/cbt-dbt-psychodynamic-what-type-of-therapy-is-right-for-me-171101" target="_blank">Cognitive behavioral therapy</a> or complicated grief therapy <a href="https://www.psychiatrictimes.com/view/treating-prolonged-grief-disorder-innovations-and-future-directions" target="_blank">can be effective treatments</a> for prolonged grief disorder. Psychedelic-assisted therapy is also <a href="https://theconversation.com/psilocybin-legislation-is-helping-psychedelic-drugs-make-a-comeback-a-drug-researcher-explains-the-challenges-they-face-233854" target="_blank">emerging as a promising option</a>

<p>in clinical research.</li>
</ul>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Supporting someone as they grief</h4>

	
<p>For those grieving, holidays and special occasions like a birthday or Mother’s Day <a href="https://theconversation.com/for-many-who-are-suffering-with-prolonged-grief-the-holidays-can-be-a-time-to-reflect-and-find-meaning-in-loss-218906" target="_blank">can be especially difficult</a>. Here are some practical tips for supporting someone who is grieving during these times:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remember that grief is not a problem to be solved, but a process to be supported.</li>
<li>Be present. A common fear is saying the wrong thing to someone who is grieving. Often, it’s not about saying the “perfect” thing, but simply showing up and listening without judgment.</li>
<li>Acknowledge the loss. Saying “I’ve been thinking about (their loved one) and how much they meant to you” or “I want you to know that I’ve been thinking about you and the significance of what you’re experiencing right now” can be more comforting than avoiding the subject.</li>
<li>Offer practical help. Grief can be debilitating and exhausting. Assisting with tasks like cooking, shopping or child care can relieve some of the burden.</li>
<li>If you don’t know what to say, it’s OK to admit it. A simple “I don’t have the right words, but I’m here for you” can mean a great deal.</li>
<li>Avoid phrases like “They’re in a better place” or “Everything happens for a reason.” While the intentions behind them are often good, these platitudes can feel dismissive.</li>
<li>Focus on empathy and validation. Saying “This must be so hard for you” or “Tell me more about what you’re feeling” opens the door to meaningful conversation and helps make space for the complex emotions that grief brings.</li>
<li>Respect the boundaries of your loved one who’s grieving. Let them honor their emotions by going at their own pace.</li>
</ul>
<p>Navigating holidays and special occasions with those who have experienced a loss can be complicated. But your presence and compassion in these moments can support their healing.</p>

(Ned Oliver/ Virginia Mercury)</p><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh, East is East, and West is West and ne’er the twain shall meet,</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Till Earth and sky stand presently at God’s great Judgment Seat.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">                           —</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rudyard Kipling, “The Ballad of East and West”</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When this century began a generation ago, did you imagine that you’d see a time when one political party would refer to its opposition party as “the enemies of the people?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Did you think you’d see someone accused of gunning down an executive on a Manhattan sidewalk by shooting him in the back celebrated as a hero on social media?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, here we are.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia is an interesting microcosm of a nation fast cleaving itself into hostile tribes, ideologically, culturally and — perhaps most troubling — geographically. It’s playing out before us in our politics, our policy and how we relate to one another. Or, better yet, don’t relate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neither side in our widening cultural schism is willing to consider the other’s point of view. We are hardened by the echo chamber of social media and ideologically driven cable channels and podcasts to the point that losers resort to violence to keep or gain power. Those trend lines, taken to their conclusion, threaten to derail the governing structure of a freely elected republic now almost 250 years old.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Free, democratic societies are not immune from political disagreement. Rather, they feed on it. Unlike autocracies, we quarrel openly and enact policy through debate and compromise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nor are democracies static. Things change; sometimes,  as is the case in Virginia,  at a glacial pace.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sixty years ago, rural Virginia — in a time when farming, factories and coal mines still dominated the state’s economy — ruled politics. Governors and House speakers were routinely from places like the Southwest, Southside or the Valley. The state as a whole was still loyal to a Democratic Party that had championed racially segregated schools under its legally and morally bankrupt “Massive Resistance” doctrine. But Democratic control was slipping as the party morphed into today’s socially liberal party.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then came the upheavals of 1968 and Richard Nixon’s “Southern Strategy” which cynically leveraged white restiveness in the former Confederate states against rights Black Americans gained with the dismantling of Jim Crow, flipping the South irretrievably from Democratic to Republican in one four-year cycle. Virginia Republicans the next year broke the stranglehold Democrats had on state government since Reconstruction by electing Linwood Holton governor. Since then, both parties have intermittently swapped power.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia would vote Republican in presidential elections for 40 years until Barack Obama won the state’s 13 electoral votes in 2008. It has remained solidly Democratic in every presidential election since, including the one a few weeks ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along the way, we lost something. A lot, actually. And we’re poorer for it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">News media are diminished to the point where professional, vetted reporting is no longer how most </span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/journalism/2024/10/10/where-americans-turn-for-election-news/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">voters get their information</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It’s a complicated dynamic in which the financial and concomitant editorial atrophy of legacy print and broadcast journalism gets swamped by the unchecked proliferation of social media platforms, podcasts and cable stations where lies commonly go unrebutted even as verifiable fact struggles to be heard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not that major newspapers and the once-unchallenged networks were sacrosanct. Far from it; they were quite human. We made mistakes. (I certainly did.) We got things wrong, but the process was sufficiently transparent that errors were promptly and publicly corrected and the reporters and editors responsible were held accountable for it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, conspiracy fabulists run wild, misinforming and disinforming with impunity. They blast a firehose of disinformation that would rightly be dismissed as really bad science fiction in a more rational past, yet it finds an audience among the willfully gullible. For instance, enough people believe there are machines that control the weather that</span> <a href="https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/politics/2024/12/03/florida-ileana-garcia-weather-modification-chemtrails/76728150007/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation is pending in Florida</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to ban such a device.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The past half century has seen the rise of political professionals who have made campaigns into data-driven science, turned groups of Americans against one another for political gain, knocked down</span> <a href="https://www.bing.com/ck/a?!&amp;&amp;p=64d6e991925efab70c3a9fc17c5590612d4d22450b9471c2429d9cfd3bf567aeJmltdHM9MTczMzg3NTIwMA&amp;ptn=3&amp;ver=2&amp;hsh=4&amp;fclid=37df83b0-0435-6d9c-15d4-96b205326c44&amp;psq=campaign+finance+citizens+united&amp;u=a1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnJlbm5hbmNlbnRlci5vcmcvb3VyLXdvcmsvcmVzZWFyY2gtcmVwb3J0cy9jaXRpemVucy11bml0ZWQtZXhwbGFpbmVk&amp;ntb=1" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislative walls</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> intended to keep plutocrats from stealthily buying public offices and now rake in rock-star fees for practicing their dark arts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is no ethical bottom to today’s victory </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">über alles</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> electioneering and the just-finished election makes plain. But it delivers results, so don’t expect it to go away or even lighten up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Politics as it is now done fails us by exploiting and exacerbating cultural differences that a big country or commonwealth such as ours should not just tolerate but celebrate. And its practitioners are content to keep us suspicious and grudgeful of one another — the better to manipulate us every November.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re losing — if we haven’t already lost — the ability to reason among ourselves because we can’t agree on established facts where such a dialogue would begin. Much of society seems untethered to standards of decency and human empathy that once made ours a civil society. </span><a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/2024/12/11/altoona-police-mcdonalds-threats-luigi-mangione-arrest/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Threats</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have been made against those involved in apprehending the</span> <a href="https://apnews.com/article/unitedhealthcare-suspect-ceo-assassin-shooter-b5ff640798d799271ddd8db9f3d2a20e" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">alleged assassin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson at an Altoona, Pennsylvania, McDonald’s — that shows how low we’ve sunk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, the geography of the schism is easy to follow. It shows up in crimson and blue maps after every election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A crescent of suburban wealth — that loops loosely from Loudoun County and the Washington, D.C., bedroom communities south along Interstate 95 through commuter country to the affluent clusters around Richmond and then southeast down the Peninsula to Hampton Roads — is largely center-left and leans toward Democrats. They’re largely college-educated, two-income households whose kids attend well-funded schools and tend to be more socially liberal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">West and south of there are vast, often sparse populations in rural areas whose fortunes took a beating since the 1990s. Global trade agreements moved furniture and textile jobs offshore. Litigation against cigarette makers crippled tobacco farming and processing. Clean-air mandates, driven by climate science, undermined the coal industry that once brought decent wages to the corner of Virginia the farthest from the suburban crescent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When people with their conservative beliefs feel — and not without justification — that their communities and values are being ridiculed by comfortable elites in cozy subdivisions … well, you can see how it wouldn’t take much for those hard feelings to grow and ossify.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are differences that the long passage of time may or may not assuage. But the lack of communication we have here is untenable. It will eventually corrode our very ability to govern ourselves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forget about agreeing on everything. The first step is realizing that nobody has his or her way all the time, no matter how convinced you might be that yours is the only way. We must at least </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">hear</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> one another again, understand what the other guys are saying and even acknowledge from time to time that they may have a point. Even a stopped clock is right twice a day. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kipling’s paradigm about a perpetually separate east and west is not an option, certainly not in Virginia.</span></p>

(Parker Michels-Boyce for The Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Parents in Virginia who don’t vaccinate their young children,</span> <a href="https://www.axios.com/local/richmond/2024/11/20/school-vaccine-exemptions-virginia" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a percentage that’s grown over the past decade</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, are making a risky bet with their kids’ health – and maybe even their lives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a dangerous trend, perhaps attributable to the bleats of vaccine deniers who elevate misinformation, emotion and quackery over science.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some adults may be unaware of past scourges where children frequently became ill before vaccines were available. Many decades ago, polio sufferers had to depend on metal apparatuses called</span> <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/10/25/1047691984/decades-after-polio-martha-is-among-the-last-to-still-rely-on-an-iron-lung-to-br" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">iron lungs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> just to help them breathe. Today, because of vaccines, polio is</span> <a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/An-important-moment-in-the-fight-against-polio" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">nearly eradicated worldwide</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and iron lungs are primarily an eerie part of my youthful subconscious.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vaccines work. More Americans should know that fact. Refusal of vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic,</span><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0250123" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">often along partisan lines</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, makes the current challenge tougher.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.axios.com/local/richmond/2024/11/20/school-vaccine-exemptions-virginia" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Axios Richmond</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> recently noted the number of parents in Virginia now opting out of getting their children vaccinated. It reported the percentage of kindergartners with vaccine exemptions has quadrupled over the past 10 years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CDC statistics show 2.4%, or about 2,050 children out of 85,374 kindergartners in the commonwealth, had either medical or nonmedical vaccine exemptions in the 2023-24 school year. In 2014, that figure was 0.6%. (Nonmedical exemptions often involve religious reasons, though I suspect parents often cite them merely to refuse the injections.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s rate of exemptions was still below the national average of 3.3%, Axios reported. Parents nationwide also overwhelmingly support childhood vaccinations,</span> <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2023/05/16/americans-largely-positive-views-of-childhood-vaccines-hold-steady/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to the Pew Research Center</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those positive facts could be altered, however, because</span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/12/03/nx-s1-5198506/rfk-jr-anti-vaccine-chd-lawsuits" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is set to lead the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services under President-elect Donald Trump. Kennedy is a prominent anti-vaxxer and has been criticized as a</span><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/12/10/rfk-jr-faces-trouble-in-the-senate-00193579" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">“denier of science.”</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s another example of Trump</span><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-trumps-washington/the-scandal-of-trumps-cabinet-picks-isnt-just-their-personal-failings" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">using his picks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to undermine the health and safety of everyday Americans, while at the same time awarding his sycophants.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vaccine refusal disturbs epidemiologists like Carrie Dolan, an associate professor of kinesiology and public health at William &amp; Mary. She said the benefits of vaccines far, far outweigh the risks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They’re effective,” Dolan told me. “They’re safe. They’re reliable.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When people aren’t vaccinated, she added, the chance for an infected person to spread a contagious disease to someone else increases. Getting a little wonky – at least for me – Dolan explained something called an</span><a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/25/1/17-1901_article" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">“R0,” or basic reproduction number</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Measles has an R0 of 12 to 18, meaning one infected person could spread it to up to 18 others in an unvaccinated population, she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Before the vaccine, measles caused widespread outbreaks, often leading to complications like pneumonia and, in rare cases, brain swelling,” Dolan said by email. “Thanks to vaccination programs, measles cases have been drastically reduced worldwide. However, when vaccination rates drop, outbreaks can quickly return.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whooping cough, or pertussis, has an R0 of 12–17 and is especially dangerous for infants, who can have severe coughing fits that make breathing difficult. “Vaccination has greatly reduced the risk,” she said, but without it, “this disease could spread more easily, putting vulnerable groups like babies and the elderly at greater risk.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vaccinations also help protect children who, paradoxically, can’t take them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. John Harrington, a general pediatrician at Children’s Hospital of The King’s Daughters in Norfolk, told me that young oncology patients chronically on steroids are “unlikely to mount a response” to certain vaccines. In those instances, vaccines could be harmful.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_41481" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:150px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/12/13/vaccines-protect-your-children-and-others-too/harringtonjohn2015/" rel="attachment wp-att-41481"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-41481" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/HarringtonJohn2015-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Dr. John Harrington, general pediatrician at Children&#8217;s Hospital of The King&#8217;s Daughters in Norfolk, said vaccine-hesitant parents are often willing to listen to their doctors&#8217; advice about whether to get their children vaccinated. (Photo courtesy of CHKD)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The assumption is if everybody else is vaccinated, that protects” children with serious health problems, Harrington said. (This is also another way to define</span><a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/22599-herd-immunity" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">herd immunity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vaccine-hesitant parents tend to have heard or seen things on the internet or social media that influence their thinking, he said. Many, though, are willing to listen to their pediatricians or primary care physicians about the issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides, vaccines are overwhelmingly safe and effective, even if the total risk can’t be ruled out. Children are more likely to be protected, though, from diseases than if they hadn’t gotten the shots, Harrington said.</span></p>

	</div>
	</div>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Erica Hunter, immunization data and outreach manager in the Virginia Department of Health,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">told me the recent trends on refusing vaccines for young children “certainly raise concerns.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Most Virginians do vaccinate their children,” Hunter said, adding she had no information on what role vaccine denialism might have in contributing to the statistics. “We just try to provide the best and most accurate information we can.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She noted the state’s Vaccines for Children program provides free immunizations and has done so for decades. “These viruses have not gone anywhere,” Hunter said. “They can resurface when vaccination rates decline.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Non-COVID outbreaks have occurred in Virginia from time to time. For example, since June 2022,</span><a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/surveillance-and-investigation/meningococcal-disease-outbreak-response/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">41 confirmed cases</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of meningococcal disease associated with an outbreak of a specific bacterium have occurred. It killed eight people of all ages.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nationwide, 283 measles</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> cases were reported this year through Dec. 5, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported. Virginia had one reported case. Some 89% of the total cases were listed as unvaccinated or unknown.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not vaccinating children exasperates Dolan, the Willam &amp; Mary epidemiologist. She helps run an immunization project in Kenya, and this summer, she had just 14 vaccines to fight HPV.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some 300 girls sought the precious supply.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In America, she said, we forget how lucky we are to have access to vaccines. “It’s been weaponized politically,” Dolan noted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please vaccinate your children. Your actions will protect them and may help others, too.</span></p>

As a pediatric rheumatologist, I’ve witnessed families making hard choices when their prescriptions become too expensive. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s why I find it incredibly upsetting when some Virginia hospitals and healthcare systems exploit and profit from federal programs intended to provide underserved patients with financial relief while serving as a safety net for those struggling to afford medications. Increased transparency and oversight are required to ensure that these programs directly benefit patients – not increase the profits of hospitals and other health care corporations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 340B Drug Pricing Program, or 340B, was created by Congress in 1992 to help low-income and uninsured patients living with conditions requiring costly outpatient medications access these necessary treatments and is a prime example of an essential safety net program. Through 340B, qualifying hospitals and clinics serving a large number of vulnerable patients can purchase deeply discounted medicines directly from pharmaceutical manufacturers with the expectation that they use these savings to help patients to afford and access their necessary medications.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the past few years, many large hospitals and other corporations have turned the well-intentioned program into a profit-making scheme to improve their own bottom lines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At 340B hospitals, the average cost per prescription is more than </span><a href="https://phrma.org/Blog/New-year-same-exploitation-of-the-340B-program" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">150%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> higher for patients than at non-340B hospitals. Meanwhile, </span><a href="https://340breform.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Charity-Care-Report-Final-1.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">nearly 70%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of 340B hospitals that care for many vulnerable patients are providing below-average levels of lower-cost or free care. What was once a little-known program intended to help our community’s most vulnerable has now ballooned into the </span><a href="https://energycommerce.house.gov/posts/subcommittee-chair-griffith-opening-remarks-at-oversight-hearing-on-the-340-b-program" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">second largest</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> federal prescription drug program nationwide, with more and more hospitals profiting from 340B discounts. It has become a critical income source for hospitals — rather than an essential source of medications for eligible patients.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While many of the 340B entities — including federally qualified health centers (</span><a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama-health-forum/fullarticle/2824253?utm_source=costcurve.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=some-personal-news-i-m-going-to-start-working-with-tufts-cevr&amp;_bhlid=91205a215554a61da0f85920c70fb7faac7e3ea1" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FQHC)s</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Ryan White AIDS clinics, and other federal grantees — do an incredible job at caring for some of our state’s most vulnerable patients, patients and their physicians, including many of my Virginia colleagues, are concerned about ongoing abuse of the 340B program by large disproportionate share hospitals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These hospitals, which make up </span><a href="https://www.hrsa.gov/opa/updates/2023-340b-covered-entity-purchases?" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">78% of the entire program’s spending</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, purchase and significantly profit from discounted 340B medications. Large hospital systems are increasingly acquiring pharmacies, practices and smaller health centers, such as oncology and infusion clinics, to further capitalize on 340B discounts without lowering patients’ costs or providing higher quality care. In fact, between 2016 and 2022, larger 340B hospitals were responsible for </span><a href="https://avalere.com/insights/characteristics-of-hospitals-undergoing-mergers-and-acquisitions" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">about 80%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of hospital acquisitions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These troubling incentives for hospital acquisitions and cost-shifting are leading to small clinic closures and less health care options for patients across the country — even in our own backyard. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As reported by </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/24/health/bon-secours-mercy-health-profit-poor-neighborhood.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The New York Times</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2022, Bon Secours Mercy Health, a prominent nonprofit health system, acquired Richmond Community Hospital, a cash-strapped community hospital, in 1995. In the following decades, Bon Secours abused its ownership of Richmond Community Hospital and took advantage of 340B discounted purchases while cutting services at Richmond Community Hospital, according to The New York Times. Medications purchased using the 340B program were given to commercially insured patients throughout the region while billing the commercial rates, thereby pocketing the price differences. Meanwhile, Bon Secours has one of the highest profit margins of any hospital in Virginia, generating as much as </span><a href="https://www.vhi.org/Bon%2520Secours%2520Richmond%2520Community%2520Hospital.html?tab=&amp;?=h9880/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$100 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This program, originally intended to serve the most vulnerable patients, is now growing due to rampant abuse from hospital systems and for-profit corporations. In 2023 alone, 340B covered entities used the program to purchase over </span><a href="https://www.hrsa.gov/opa/updates/2023-340b-covered-entity-purchases" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$66 billion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in outpatient drugs — an over 23% increase from the year before. Much of this growth is due, in part, to 340B hospitals’ ability to also contract with an unlimited number of pharmacies — including those out-of-state — many of which are owned by the nation’s largest pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) and insurers. As a result, PBMs and 340B contract pharmacies share in the massive profits from discounted 340B medicines. In fact, </span><a href="https://www.drugchannels.net/2023/07/exclusive-for-2023-five-for-profit.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more than half</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the entire U.S. pharmacy industry is contracted to dispense steeply discounted 340B drugs. But hospitals are not required to share these discounted prices with patients.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The numbers are clear — 340B has become less about helping vulnerable patients and their families access the care they need and more about hospital systems and other corporations capitalizing on these federally mandated discounts to improve bottom lines, or </span><a href="https://www.adapadvocacy.org/pdf-docs/2024_ADAP_RW_340B_Project_Asset_6_ExecComp_FInal_Report_06-05-24.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">even boost</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> executive compensation at hospitals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While 340B is an important safety net in Virginia, it is in dire need of federal action to improve transparency and accountability measures to ensure it works as intended. Any proposed 340B policy that allows hospitals and other corporations to continue their rampant abuse must be reconsidered. Without action from Congress, hospitals, and corporations will continue to profit, while Virginia’s financially vulnerable patients and families are left without a functioning safety net to catch them. </span></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin and Democratic leaders in the General Assembly are aligned on one thing, it’s their enthusiasm for bringing more data centers to the commonwealth. Where they part ways is in how to provide enough electricity to power them. Youngkin and most Republican legislators advocate for an “all of the above” approach that includes fossil gas as well as renewables; Democrats are committed to staying the course on the transition to zero-carbon energy, with a near-term emphasis on low-cost solar. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data centers are making the transition harder, but so is local resistance to building solar. General Assembly members mostly understand the connection, leading to a lively debate in last year’s legislative session over whether to override some local permit denials for solar projects – and if so, how to ensure the localities still have some say. Though none of the legislative proposals moved forward last year, the topic has become a central one for the recently revamped Commission on Electric Utility Regulation (CEUR). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In January, the General Assembly is likely to consider legislation to override local solar permit denials in some cases, such as last year’s </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20251/HB636" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB636</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Del. Rip Sullivan, D-Fairfax, or another approach that would break the solar logjam. It remains to be seen, however,  whether legislators will take any action on data centers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The problem has grown only more urgent as localities have continued to approve new data center proposals with little thought given to where and how they will get the power to serve them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ann Bennett, Sierra Club Virginia’s data center chair, has been tracking data center permit applications across the state. She counts at least two dozen Virginia counties with data centers under development, including rural areas far outside the industry’s stronghold in suburban Northern Virginia. By Bennett’s calculation, data centers existing and under development in Virginia will consume at least 100,000 acres. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even as local governments woo data centers, many have become hostile to solar development. A </span><a href="https://apps.dlas.virginia.gov/User_db/frmView.aspx?ViewId=6339&amp;s=7" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">presentation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the Weldon Cooper Center at the University of Virginia, which tracks solar permitting across Virginia, shows that far more local permits for solar facilities have been denied or withdrawn than were approved this year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In some cases, county boards that approve data center development also reject permits for solar farms. Sometimes, it happens even at the same meeting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an effort to understand this paradox, I watched footage from two county board meetings in Hanover County, one in March of this year and the other in September. At the March meeting, county supervisors </span><a href="https://www.hanovercounty.gov/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=770" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">approved</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a 1,200-acre data center complex for an area north of Ashland. Later the same night, they denied a permit for a utility-scale solar project. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The parcels of land slated to be developed for the data center complex “included wooded areas, recently-logged areas, open fields, wetlands, ponds and stream corridors.” The developer plans to build about 30 data centers on the property, each 110 feet tall (about 10 stories), with setbacks from the property line ranging from 150 to 250 feet. The complex will require 700,000 gallons per day of cooling water. When fully developed, the data centers are expected to total a staggering 2,400 megawatts (MW) of power capacity, not far short of what </span><a href="https://dgtlinfra.com/data-centers-virginia-ashburn-loudoun/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">all of Loudoun County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> had in 2022. There was no discussion of where so much electricity would come from. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Public testimony was overwhelmingly negative. The objections echoed those that have been widely reported in </span><a href="https://www.insidenova.com/headlines/digital-gateway-data-center-opposition-escalates-in-prince-william-county/article_61124a3a-e506-11ed-8485-a77c6d7e7ff1.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">response</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to projects such as the Prince William Digital Gateway: noise, light, a massive increase in truck traffic, secrecy surrounding the project, air pollution from diesel back-up generators. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet the Hanover supervisors voted unanimously in favor of the project. It came down to money: the developer promised a tax benefit to the county over 20 years of $1.8 billion, plus upfront cash for road improvements and a $100,000 donation to a park. Supervisor Jeff Stoneman, who represents the Beaverdam district where the complex will be located, acknowledged his constituents’ concerns but noted that the revenue would be a “game-changer for this community.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even for me, as thoroughly aware as I am of all the downsides of data center sprawl, the negative impacts on communities, the risks to our water and energy security, the possibility that folks will be left with nothing but regrets – well, I just have to say: It’s really hard to argue with $1.8 billion. Rural leaders see Loudoun County </span><a href="https://www.loudounnow.com/news/business-leaders-tout-data-center-benefits-at-chamber-forum/article_f5148f4e-491f-11ef-acc5-a36d8b4e0299.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">raking in revenue</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from data centers, letting it cut taxes for everyone else. Why wouldn’t they want in on that?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I noted before, though, there was no discussion of how or where the enormous amount of electricity needed to power the data centers would be generated. This disconnect was underscored later in the same meeting when the supervisors voted to reject a 20 MW solar project on 100 acres of a 315-acre site, in the same district as the data center complex they had just approved. </span></p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Under pressure from the SCC, Dominion reveals the true cost of data centers&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/26/under-pressure-from-the-scc-dominion-reveals-the-true-cost-of-data-centers/embed/#?secret=s1eoTaSPZM#?secret=yIZWD5yzmk" data-secret="yIZWD5yzmk" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was especially hard to understand the denial of this particular permit. Supervisors agreed the project met all the terms of the county’s solar ordinance, including provisions for the use of native grasses and pollinator plants. Most of the property would remain untouched. The county would receive an upfront cash contribution of $438,600, in addition to the increased tax revenue from the project. The planning commission had recommended approval. No one testified against it; a number of people, including the farmer across the street, testified in its favor.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of the discussion of the project focused on screening the solar panels from view. Supervisors fussed that the trees to be planted at the entrance were too small, and worried that some of the existing mature trees along the road might die off over time and not be replaced. The developer agreed to put larger trees at the entrance, and even to walk the perimeter annually to monitor the health of the trees, and replace any if they needed to.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was no use. Two of the supervisors wanted to approve the project, but they were outvoted. Stoneman, the Beaverdam supervisor who had led the way in supporting the data center complex, said he worried that erosion might impair the creek on the property, in spite of ample natural buffers, and said he did not have a “comfort level” with the project.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Evidently, the county’s </span><a href="https://www.hanovercounty.gov/DocumentCenter/View/10092/Ord-23-14-Solar-Energy-Facilities" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">solar ordinance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, adopted in 2023, was irrelevant, or at least, misleading. Such objective standards make a developer think it will be worth their while to put in months of planning, public outreach, and working with county staff. But then it turns out that what actually matters is whether a supervisor can achieve a certain undefined “comfort level.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Six months after the approval of the 2,400 MW data center complex and the denial of the 20 MW solar facility, another solar project </span><a href="https://www.vpm.org/news/2024-09-26/hanover-county-beaverdam-solar-farm-strata-clean-energy-jeff-stoneman" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">met the same fate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, again with Stoneman making the motion to deny the permit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This time the project would take up 250 acres of a 1,500-acre site and produce 72 MW of electricity, achieved through stacking the panels to a double height. Again, the project more than met the requirements of the county solar ordinance. The land was described as currently consisting of managed pine forest, already subject to being cut over at any time, and fully 70% of the property would be preserved for conservation. Native grasses would be planted, and sheep would do most of the vegetation management. The shepherd, Marcus Gray of </span><a href="https://grayslambscaping.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gray’s Lambscaping</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, attended the hearing to describe the sheep operations he runs successfully at other solar sites. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Approval of the project would earn the county roughly $1.7 million upfront, and $300,000 in annual tax revenue. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Supervisors praised the developer for “a really good application” that “respected” the ordinance and the environment, for the company’s willingness to listen and respond to concerns, and for agreeing to build stormwater basins and sacrifice buildable space in favor of conservation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several members of the public testified in favor of the project, but this time there were also opponents. Some of them repeated common </span><a href="https://energysolutions-solar.com/busting-renewable-energy-myths/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">myths</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about solar panel toxicity and the risk of fires. One woman stated flatly, and obviously incorrectly, that it was not possible to raise sheep at a solar farm because they would die from the heat. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The supervisors themselves did not appear ill-informed or misinformed, though one expressed surprise that Gray could successfully sell his lamb at farmers markets when buyers knew where they had been raised. (Watching, I could only laugh, because I’ve always thought of the solar-sheep synergy as a great selling point for climate-conscious carnivores.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The concern raised most often was the risk of impacts to the nearby North Anna River, though the developer had agreed to shrink the project to accommodate a much greater setback from the river than required. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, however, Supervisor Stoneman’s argument for denying the permit rested on a different argument. He praised the developer for doing a good job, and noted the project was in accordance with all requirements. But, he said, “Beaverdam is just a different place.” People take pride in the rural character and forest and farmland. Our job, he noted, is to protect the trees that are harvested on the site currently, something “that is as important as the power.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Money is not the most important thing,” concluded the man who led the cheering squad for a data center complex in his district six months earlier.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two supervisors who had supported the smaller solar facility that had been rejected in March made their best arguments for this project as well, though they ultimately voted with Stoneman as the home supervisor. One said she supported solar “because I’m pro-farm,” and solar is a way to preserve farmland from development. The other noted that the land would certainly be developed one way or another, and the results would almost certainly be worse. Maintaining rural culture is important, he noted, but “we are approving residential development and seeing by-right development that people don’t want either.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also warned his colleagues, as he had in the spring, that rejecting good solar projects was going to result in legislation that would take away local authority and give it to the unelected State Corporation Commission. He said he would go along with Stoneman’s motion to deny the permit because “I assume he knows something,” but he made it clear he considered it the wrong decision, and a dangerous one for local autonomy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Evidently, he had been paying attention to the conversation at the General Assembly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be clear, my sympathies lie wholeheartedly with people whose instincts are to protect the woods and fields around them. I share the one Hanover supervisor’s belief that solar is a means to preserve land from permanent development and even improve soil health and wildlife habitat, but I also understand it may be years before some people see sheep grazing under solar panels as a welcome feature in their landscape. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So I get how a rural county, having sold a little bit of its soul for $1.8 billion, might then slam the door to other development, even after applicants had worked with the county for months in good faith and done everything asked for. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not a choice I’d make – I’d take solar over data centers every time – but then, no one made it the county’s responsibility to contribute electricity to the grid that serves it, much less to produce the electricity needed to run the data centers it embraced.</span></p>

(Hugh Kenny)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reelection of Donald Trump shows the continued prevalence of climate denialism, which involves a rejection of the scientific consensus that human activity is changing the climate. As in his first term, Trump will no doubt try to hold our country back in the race to slow climate change by phasing out fossil fuels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike Trump’s climate denialism, survey research indicates that we in Virginia largely </span><a href="https://climatecommunication.yale.edu/visualizations-data/ycom-us/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">agree</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that climate change is happening. And most of us understand that it is caused by our reliance on coal, oil, and natural gas. But we have our own special variety of denialism here in the commonwealth: a denial that there are limits to how much electricity we can produce for data centers without also shattering our commitment to shift away from fossil fuels. Ultimately, a transition to renewable energy will require that we slow or stop the current data center boom in order to get there.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Data center development and growing energy demand</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The name “data center” sounds innocuous, but their need for energy is anything but harmless. Data centers are large warehouses stacked full of electronics that convert energy into data storage and computation, increasingly for artificial intelligence. The </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/03/07/ai-data-centers-power/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">amount of electricity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that data centers need is staggering. Just one data center can use as much power as tens of thousands of households combined.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With at least </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/19/energy-policymakers-convene-for-virginia-clean-economy-act-summit/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">500 data centers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that have been built or permitted in Virginia, along with more in the works, the state has a </span><a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/24052024/virginia-data-center-market-electricity-demand/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">higher data center density</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> than anywhere else in the world. Even before the data center boom, a transition away from fossil fuels across the state to 100% renewable energy would be a daunting task. But thanks in large part to data centers, it is now much harder. Virginia is experiencing </span><a href="https://www.vpm.org/news/2024-11-14/meta-google-amazon-dominion-energy-data-centers-virginia-power-demand" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">greater demand</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for power than any time since World War II. Electricity consumption in the state is </span><a href="https://news.dominionenergy.com/2024-10-15-Dominion-Energy-Virginia-releases-comprehensive-long-term-plan-to-meet-growing-power-demand-with-reliable,-affordable-and-increasingly-clean-electricity" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">projected to double</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the next fifteen years. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The limits of green technology</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This growing energy demand cannot be met while also phasing out fossil fuels. Solar panels are an essential part of the energy transition, but they can’t do it all. For example, just one </span><a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/cleanarc-to-develop-600mw-campus-in-caroline-county-virginia/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">600 megawatt data center</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> recently approved in Caroline County will use the equivalent of as much electricity as is produced in Spotsylvania County’s </span><a href="https://colonial-materials.com/portfolio/energy/spotsylvania-solar/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">solar farm</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which covers 3,500 acres of land with solar arrays and is the largest solar development east of the Rocky Mountains.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wind turbines have tremendous promise for electricity production, but also can’t provide a magical solution for meeting energy demand. For example, Dominion Energy is developing a 176 turbine project off of the coast of Virginia Beach. This project will produce enough electricity to meet the needs of about 600,000 homes, or just a bit more than the energy that will be required to power a single data-center mega project that is currently being developed in </span><a href="https://www.bayjournal.com/news/energy/energy-demands-for-northern-virginia-data-centers-almost-too-big-to-compute/article_d64ab388-2cb7-11ef-a753-4ffcc056f619.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hanover County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to the limits of solar and wind energy in meeting expected energy demand, Dominion Energy and Amazon Web Services — a main developer of data centers in our state — have announced </span><a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/amazon-signs-deals-to-invest-in-nuclear-smrs-to-power-data-centers/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">plans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to build small nuclear power plants as low-carbon sources of energy. But it would take dozens of these new reactors to produce enough electricity for Virginia’s data centers alone. Since nuclear power remains controversial and because many Virginians likely do not want to live next to a nuclear power plant, it is uncertain where they would all be built.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Climate denialism, Virginia style</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s style of climate denialism doesn’t dispute that fossil fuels are causing climate change. Instead, denialism in the commonwealth happens when we commit to phasing out fossil fuels but don’t have a plan to get there, and instead approve data center after data center as if there is an unlimited supply of low-carbon electricity to run them all. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion Energy, for instance, says that it is committed to Virginia’s goal of phasing out fossil fuels, even while proposing the development of </span><a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/10112023/dominion-peaker-plant-chesterfield-virginia/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">new natural gas power plants</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Amazon Web Services stresses the importance of achieving carbon neutrality by 2040, even if its CEO </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/17/amazon-announces-deal-with-dominion-energy-to-develop-a-small-nuclear-reactor/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">admits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that he doesn’t know how it will be achieved. And local leaders, like those in my hometown of Fredericksburg, proclaim their commitment to 100% renewable energy goals without a climate plan, while also </span><a href="https://fxbgadvance.substack.com/p/fredericksburg-city-council-passes" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announcing new efforts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to attract data center development.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to overcome Virginia’s special flavor of climate denialism, we must recognize that there are limits to how much energy we can produce without fueling climate change. This means there is also a limit to how many data centers that can operate as we transition away from fossil fuels. In the interest of protecting our climate, it is time for a moratorium on the approval of new data centers in our state.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/meetthepressblog/s-s-driving-americas-increasing-political-polarization-rcna89559" target="_blank">Political chasms</a>, wars, oppression … it’s easy to feel hopeless and helpless watching these dark forces play out. Could any of us ever really make a meaningful difference in the face of so much devastation?</p>
<p>Given the scale of the world’s problems, it might feel like the small acts of human connection and solidarity that you do have control over are like putting Band-Aids on bullet wounds. It can feel naive to imagine that small acts could make any global difference.</p>
<p><a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rljhcqoAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao" target="_blank">As a psychologist, human connection researcher</a> and audience member, I was inspired to hear musician <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hozier" target="_blank">Hozier</a> offer a counterpoint at a performance this year. “The little acts of love and solidarity that we offer each other can have powerful impact … ” he told the crowd. “I believe the core of people on the whole is good – I genuinely do. I’ll die on that hill.”</p>
<p>I’m happy to report that the science agrees with him.</p>
<p>Research shows that individual acts of kindness and connection can have a real impact on global change when these acts are collective. This is true at multiple levels: between individuals, between people and institutions, and between cultures.</p>
<p>This relational micro-activism is a powerful force for change – and serves as an antidote to hopelessness because unlike global-scale issues, these small acts are within individuals’ control.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Abstract becomes real through relationships</h4>

	
Theoretically, the idea that small, interpersonal acts have large-scale impact is explained by what psychologists call <a href="https://www.sup.org/books/sociology/theory-cognitive-dissonance" target="_blank">cognitive dissonance</a>: the discomfort you feel when your actions and beliefs don’t line up.</p>
<p>For example, imagine two people who like each other. One believes that fighting climate change is crucial, and the other believes that climate change is a political ruse. Cognitive dissonance occurs: They like each other, but they disagree. People crave <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/00223980.1946.9917275" target="_blank">cognitive balance</a>, so the more these two like each other, the more motivated they will be to hear each other out.</p>
<p>According to this model, then, the more you strengthen your relationships through acts of connection, the more likely you’ll be to empathize with those other individual perspectives. When these efforts are collective, they can increase understanding, compassion and community in society at large. Issues like war and oppression can feel overwhelming and abstract, but the abstract becomes real when you connect to someone you care about.</p>
<p>So, does this theory hold up when it comes to real-world data?</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Small acts of connection shift attitudes</h4>

	
Numerous studies support the power of individual acts of connection to drive larger-scale change.</p>
<p>For instance, researchers studying the political divide in the U.S. found that participants self-identifying as Democrats or Republicans “didn’t like” people in the other group largely due to <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0202101" target="_blank">negative assumptions about the other person’s morals</a>. People also said they valued morals like fairness, respect, loyalty and a desire to prevent harm to others.</p>
<p>I’m intentionally leaving out which political group preferred which traits – they all sound like positive attributes, don’t they? Even though participants thought they didn’t like each other based on politics, they also all valued traits that benefit relationships.</p>
<p>One interpretation of these findings is that the more people demonstrate to each other, act by act, that they are loyal friends and community members who want to prevent harm to others, the more they might soften large-scale social and political disagreements.</p>
<p>Even more convincingly, another study found that Hungarian and Romanian students — people from ethnic groups with a history of social tensions — who said they had strong friendships with each other also <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/casp.2385" target="_blank">reported improved attitudes toward the other group</a>. Having a rocky friendship with someone from the other group actually damaged attitudes toward the other ethnic group as a whole. Again, nurturing the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/jasp.12736" target="_blank">quality of relationships</a>, even on an objectively small scale, had powerful implications for reducing large-scale tensions.</p>
<p>In another study, researchers examined prejudice toward what psychologists call an out-group: a group that you don’t belong to, whether based on ethnicity, political affiliation or just preference for dogs versus cats.</p>
<p>They asked participants to reflect on the positive qualities of someone they knew, or on their own positive characteristics. When participants wrote about the positive qualities of someone else, rather than themselves, they later reported <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/15298868.2021.1965016" target="_blank">lower levels of prejudice toward an out-group</a> — even if the person they wrote about had no connection to that out-group. Here, moving toward appreciation of the other, rather than away from prejudice, was an effective way to transform preconceived beliefs.</p>
<p>So, small acts of connection can shift personal attitudes. But can they really affect societies?</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">From one-on-one to society-wide</h4>

	
Every human being is embedded in their own network with the people and world around them, what psychologists call their <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/1745691610374588" target="_blank">social ecology</a>. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2013.09.023" target="_blank">Compassionate change at any level</a> of someone’s social ecology — internally, interpersonally or structurally — can affect all the other levels, in a kind of positive feedback loop, or upward spiral.</p>
<p>For instance, both <a href="https://doi.org/10.1037/ort0000513" target="_blank">system-level anti-discrimination programming in schools</a> and interpersonal support between students act reciprocally to shape school environments for students from historically marginalized groups. Again, individual acts play a key role in these positive <a href="https://ncase.me/trust/" target="_blank">domino effects</a>.</p>
<p>Even as a human connection researcher, I’ve been surprised by how much I and others have progressed toward mutual understanding by simply caring about each other. But what are small acts of connection, after all, but acts of strengthening relationships, which strengthen communities, which influence societies?</p>
<p>In much of my clinical work, I use a model called <a href="https://doi.org/10.1037/prj0000588" target="_blank">social practice</a> — or “intentional community-building” — <a href="https://doi.org/10.1037/prj0000604" target="_blank">as a form of therapy</a> for people recovering from serious mental illnesses, like schizophrenia. And if intentional community-building can address some of the most debilitating states of the human psyche, I believe it follows that, writ large, it could help address the most debilitating states of human societies as well.</p>
<p>Simply put, science supports the idea that moving toward each other in small ways can be transformational. I’ll die on that hill too.</p>

(Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was an interesting revelation in a recent</span><a href="https://www.wtvr.com/news/local-news/richmond-osher-forum-nov-22-2024" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">panel discussion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the University of Richmond about the 2024 election where all of us outsiders learned – to varying levels of astonishment – that Donald Trump’s campaign had no interest in persuading undecideds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mike Young, captain of Trump’s campaign in Virginia and North Carolina, came right out and said it: Trump’s campaign deliberately decided not to broaden his base but, rather, to reach every single one of Trump’s voters and make sure each voted for him. It worked in North Carolina, with its 16 electoral votes, but fell short in Virginia, with 13.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That would explain Trump’s actions throughout the campaign which left self-appointed observers like me scratching their heads when he made bizarre and unfounded claims such as Haitian immigrants eating pets in Ohio.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many at the time — including me — believed he had strategically blundered by doubling down on such clownish tropes that would energize his frothing loyalists but alienate persuadable independents. He was ceding the vital middle ground to Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris who already had an army of soccer moms angry over the reproductive rights issue and the support of minorities indignant at Trump’s ceaseless villainizing of immigrants lacking permanent legal status.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That leaves him with only his base, and that wouldn’t be nearly enough to win the 270 electoral votes required to become president. Right?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wrong, at least on a national scale. Trump’s All-About-That-Base approach (apologies to</span><a href="https://youtu.be/7PCkvCPvDXk?si=l_2HPg2q2cP-29PF" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Meghan Trainor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) prevailed beyond what the aggregated conventional preelection polls and the national media that harped on them breathlessly would have us believe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump significantly improved his Virginia showing over the 10-percentage point beatdown he took four years ago at the hands of President Joe Biden but came up about five percentage points short against </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/05/harris-triumphs-over-trump-in-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harris</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia – perhaps more synced to official Washington than any other state – has spurned Trump and his proxies every time they appeared on a statewide ballot </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">during his candidacy in 2016 and his presidency through 2020</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This time, his base turned out but couldn’t match even an</span><a href="https://www.vpap.org/visuals/visual/change-in-votes/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">unenthused</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Democratic coalition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He won 31 states and a combined 312 electoral votes – 42 more than he needed – en route to a popular vote majority that had eluded him in his two previous elections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nationally, he overwhelmingly gained vote share in localities and states he had lost to Biden, most notably seven swing states and the so-called “blue wall” of Midwestern states that were vital to Democrats’ hopes of staying in power.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of that happened in Virginia, too, but not to the extent necessary to flip the commonwealth red for the first time in a presidential race since 2004.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Self-preservation may explain some of that. Northern Virginia’s population base has a lot to say about which candidates win statewide elections, and those voters include federal government employees or employees of federal contractors or businesses reliant on trade with federal employees or contractors. When Washington catches a cold, everything north of the Rappahannock sneezes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump has made no secret of his desire to slash the federal workforce. He tried it during his previous White House tenancy but was a novice at dealing with wily agency leaders and the institutional inertia of bureaucracies. This time, he’s returning to office surrounded by a platoon of proven, dutiful minions and has put Elon Musk,  arguably the planet’s wealthiest plutocrat,</span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-says-elon-musk-vivek-ramaswamy-will-lead-department-government-efficiency-2024-11-13/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">in charge of the demolition</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If he succeeds, it could devastate not just the economy of the Washington suburbs and exurbs but state government revenue by stalling its economic engine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even so, Trump gained vote share in all but nine of Virginia’s 133 localities, including some Democratic-aligned D.C. suburbs like Fairfax County, the state’s largest, where he enjoyed a nearly nine percentage point rightward shift, according to the</span><a href="https://www.vpap.org/visuals/visual/2024-partisan-shift-by-locality/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Public Access Project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Broken down demographically, Trump made gains among Black men, Hispanic/Latino voters, voters younger than 30 and white voters in key states, according to</span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/11/22/nx-s1-5199119/2024-election-exit-polls-demographics-black-latino-voters" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">analyses of election poll data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by NPR. Unlike ever-changing issues such as the economy, inflation, immigration and the job-approval ratings of those in power, these are trends with staying power that should send shivers up the spines of Democrats.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s not to say that Virginia will become Trump country if only, for no other reason, because he’s about to serve out the second and final term that presidents are allowed under the 22nd Amendment. It’s because this state is fully capable of putting other Republicans in charge of things, notwithstanding national media pundits who consider Virginia reliably Democratic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Glenn Youngkin is living proof of that. In 2021, Virginia voters assumed Trump was forever exiled to his luxury oceanfront compound in Palm Beach, Florida, and perhaps a prison cell, and pent-up frustration over the COVID-19 pandemic and wall-to-wall Democratic rule in Virginia manifested itself in a statewide GOP sweep.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin, a wealthy former hedge fund executive running his first bid for electoral office, defeated a favored Democratic former governor, Terry McAuliffe. On his coattails, fellow Republican Winsome Earle-Sears became the first woman of color to win statewide election with her victory as lieutenant governor and Jason Miyares’ triumph as attorney general made him the first Hispanic American to be elected to a statewide office.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fresh off this wrenching, worse-than-ugly presidential campaign, we’re about to kick off another gubernatorial campaign in earnest, one that seems destined to at last give Virginia its </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/25/spanberger-and-earle-sears-tied-in-first-2025-gubernatorial-poll/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">first woman governor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Earle-Sears and outgoing Democratic U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger have both announced their candidacies and are prohibitive favorites to win their respective nominations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Trump back in the White House and vowing to slash the federal workforce, it will be much harder for Earle-Sears to avoid his stain than it was for Youngkin. Democrats won’t have to labor under a deeply unpopular president, and Youngkin has maintained a</span><a href="https://washingtonpost.com/documents/7767776f-8100-4a81-a636-d323e9736f94.pdf?itid=lk_inline_manual_4" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">respectable job-approval rating</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spanberger and the Democrats, however, know – or by now </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">should</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> know – the kind of turnout a motivated GOP can produce in the countryside and eat into the margins in the urban and suburban redoubts. They’ve got to find a way to reconnect with their base on the left while reassuring working people facing a frightening world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That opportunity is about to present itself. Whether the Democrats or Republicans make the best use of it in an election that will serve as the first barometer of the second Trump White House is the question immediately before us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And a dozen months from now, we’ll know the answer.</span></p>

(Hugh Kenny)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ever since data centers started spreading across the Virginia landscape like an invasive pest, one important question has remained unanswered: How much does the industry’s insatiable demand for energy impact other utility customers? Under pressure from the SCC, this month Dominion Energy Virginia finally provided the answer we feared: Ordinary Virginia customers are subsidizing Big Tech with both their money and their health.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion previously hid data centers among the rest of its customer base, making it impossible to figure out if residents were paying more than their fair share of the costs of building new generation and transmission lines. Worse, if data centers are the reason for burning more fossil fuels, then they are also responsible for residents being subjected to pollution that is supposed to be eliminated under the 2020 Virginia Clean Economy Act (VCEA). The </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title56/chapter23/section56-585.5/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">VCEA</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> calls for most coal plants in the state to be closed by the end of this year – which is not happening – and sets rigorous conditions before utilities can build any new fossil fuel plants. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion’s 2023 Integrated Resource Plan (IRP), filed a year and a half ago, projected steep increases in energy demand and the cost of electricity. The utility asserted that for reliability purposes it needed to keep coal plants operating, build new methane gas generating units without meeting the VCEA’s conditions, and add small nuclear reactors beginning in 2034.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="y96cnfBug6"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/28/once-again-dominions-energy-plan-falls-short-this-time-the-scc-isnt-having-it/">Once again, Dominion’s energy plan falls short. This time, the SCC isn’t having it.</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Once again, Dominion’s energy plan falls short.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion’s failure to file a plan that complied with the VCEA led to </span><a href="https://reisingergooch.com/virginia-energy-regulatory-updates-january-2024/#:~:text=SCC%20states%20that%20it%20will,56%2D585.1(A)." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an unusual stalemate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the SCC, with the IRP neither approved nor rejected. Ignoring the foul-weather warning, Dominion filed a similarly-flawed </span><a href="https://www.scc.virginia.gov/docketsearch/DOCS/820101!.PDF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2024 IRP</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in October.  None of the modeled scenarios showed coal plants closing, none met the energy efficiency requirements set by law, and all proposed building new gas and nuclear reactors, with the first small nuclear plant now pushed off to 2035.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neither of the two filings separated out the role of data centers in driving the changes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even before the 2024 IRP was filed, though, the SCC directed the utility to file a supplement. It was obvious the IRP would project higher costs and increased use of fossil fuels. How much of that, the SCC demanded to know, is attributable to data centers? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot, as it turns out. Though Dominion continues to obfuscate key facts, </span><a href="https://www.scc.virginia.gov/docketsearch/DOCS/82l101!.PDF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the document</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it filed on November 15 shows future data center growth will drive up utility spending by about 20%. Dominion did not take the analysis further to show the effect on residential rates. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The filing also shows that but for new data centers, peak demand would actually decrease slightly over the next few years, from 17,353 MW this year to 17,280 MW in 2027, before beginning a gentle rise to 17,818 MW in 2034 and 18,608 MW in 2039. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words, without data centers, electricity use in Dominion territory would scarcely budge over the next decade. Indeed, the slight decrease over the next three years is especially interesting because near-term numbers tend to be the most reliable, with projections getting more speculative the further out you look.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Surprised? You’re not alone. We’ve heard for years that </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/02/virginias-electric-vehicle-transition-depends-on-the-power-grid-how-is-it-faring/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">electric vehicles</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and building electrification will drive large increases in energy demand. When Dominion talks about the challenges of load growth, it cites these factors along with data centers, suggesting that ordinary people are part of the problem. We’re not. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Decreasing demand is a testament to the profound effect of energy efficiency, as advances in things like lighting, heat pumps and other appliances allow consumers to do more with less. Presumably, the electrification of transportation and buildings will eventually outpace gains in efficiency – no doubt reflected in the projections for slightly increasing demand over the 2030s – but the effect is still modest. Electrification is not to blame for demand growth; data centers are.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a future without new data centers, there should be no reason for Virginia’s energy transition to get off track. Solar, offshore wind and battery storage could increasingly displace fossil fuels, clean our air and bring down greenhouse gas emissions at an orderly pace. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At least, that’s the intuitive result, though Dominion fights hard to counter it. The new filing is supposed to show what a VCEA-compliant plan would look like without data centers, but it retains assumptions from its IRPs that skew the results in favor of fossil fuels. These include limiting energy efficiency and artificially capping the amounts of solar and storage that its computer model could select. Obviously, if you won’t invest in low-cost energy efficiency and solar, you need more of something else. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion’s computer model also doesn’t choose offshore wind in spite of the fact that the 2,600-MW Virginia Coastal Offshore Wind project is under construction. No doubt the higher cost of offshore wind is responsible for this counter-factual omission, but again, leaving it out requires that something else be selected. Nuclear similarly doesn’t make the cut due to cost.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By limiting or eliminating all zero-carbon options, Dominion would like you to conclude that, with or without data centers, it “needs” more gas plants.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are other reasons to be skeptical of this manufactured result. As with the 2024 IRP itself, Dominion does not appear to have incorporated the social cost of carbon in its supposedly-VCEA-compliant plan, a mandatory consideration for any new fossil fuel generation. It’s also worth noting that Dominion will once again have to buy carbon emission allowances to run its coal and gas plants now that a court has </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/20/judge-deems-youngkins-actions-to-withdraw-virginia-from-rggi-unlawful/?emci=3782c1a1-7ca7-ef11-88d0-6045bdd62db6&amp;emdi=d50fd664-00a8-ef11-88d0-6045bdd62db6&amp;ceid=343350"><span style="font-weight: 400;">nullified</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s illegal withdrawal of Virginia from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI). (Youngkin has vowed to appeal.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, President-elect Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress seem likely to overturn new EPA regulations tightening pollution standards for fossil fuel plants. That would make fossil fuels appear cheaper by shifting costs onto residents in the form of worse health outcomes and climate-related weather disasters. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to showing what the energy mix might look like without data centers, the SCC directed Dominion to identify which of its approximately 200 planned transmission projects were needed solely because of data centers. The 4-page table in Dominion’s supplemental filing reveals that about half of the projects are solely data center-driven, with two or three dozen more serving a mix of customers that includes data centers. I tried to add up the numbers but lost track at a billion dollars’ worth of projects needed solely for data centers – and I was still on the second page. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is one more caveat to keep in mind. Since the SCC’s order applied only to future growth, Dominion’s new numbers don’t show the cost and energy impact of data centers in operation today. Data centers already make up a quarter of Dominion’s sales, and that growth was the main reason the utility pivoted back to fossil fuels in its 2023 IRP. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, most of the data center growth lies ahead of us, as does Dominion’s plans for new fossil fuel and nuclear generation. With state leaders avidly chasing more data centers in the name of economic development, ordinary Virginians are left to watch the assault on their energy supply, their water, and their environment and wonder: Is anyone going to fix this? </span></p>

<p>In the wake of a presidential election that many feared could <a href="https://www.thetimes.com/world/us-world/article/election-poll-2024-presidential-trump-harris-5zvlczh0k?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email" target="_blank">tear the U.S. apart</a>, this question is on many people’s minds.</p>
<p>A record-high 80% of Americans believe the U.S. is greatly <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/650828/americans-agree-nation-divided-key-values.aspx" target="_blank">divided on “the most important values”</a>. Ahead of the election, a similar percentage of Americans said they feared <a href="https://civilrights.org/2024/10/07/civil-rights-monitor-poll-2024/" target="_blank">violence and threats to democracy</a>. Almost half the country believes people on the other side of the political divide are “<a href="https://hub.jhu.edu/2024/10/27/snf-agora-poll-september-2024/" target="_blank">downright evil</a>.”</p>
<p>Some say that the <a href="https://theconversation.com/when-politicians-use-hate-speech-political-violence-increases-146640" target="_blank">vitriolic rhetoric</a> of political leaders and social media influencers is partly to blame for the country’s state of toxic polarization. Others cite <a href="https://bhr.stern.nyu.edu/publication/fueling-the-fire-how-social-media-intensifies-u-s-political-polarization-and-what-can-be-done-about-it/" target="_blank">social media</a> platforms that amplify misinformation and polarization.</p>
<p>There is, however, reason for hope.</p>
<p>I say this as an <a href="https://sasn.rutgers.edu/alex-hinton" target="_blank">anthropologist of peace and conflict</a>. After working abroad, I began doing research on the threat of violence in the U.S. in 2016. In 2021, I published a related book, “<a href="https://nyupress.org/9781479808014/it-can-happen-here/" target="_blank">It Can Happen Here</a>.”</p>
<p>Now, I am researching polarization in the U.S. – and ways to counter it. I have visited large <a href="https://theconversation.com/i-went-to-cpac-as-an-anthropologist-to-understand-trumps-base-they-believe-more-than-ever-he-is-a-savior-224205" target="_blank">Make America Great Again events</a> for my research. I have also gone to small workshops run by nonprofit organizations like <a href="https://www.uraction.org/" target="_blank">Urban Rural Action</a> that are dedicated to building social cohesion and bridging America’s divides. Some refer to the growing number of these organizations as a “<a href="https://www.listenfirstproject.org/bridging-movement-alignment-council" target="_blank">bridging movement</a>.”</p>
<p>Their work is not easy, but they have shown that connecting with and listening to others who hold different political views is possible.</p>
<p>Here are three strategies these organizations are using – and people can try to use in their own daily lives – to reduce political polarization:</p>
<h2>1. Listen first</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.listenfirstproject.org/pearce-godwin" target="_blank">Pearce Godwin</a>, a former Republican-leaning consultant from North Carolina, was one of the first “bridgers.”</p>
<p>In 2013, Godwin was doing Christian humanitarian work in Africa. Upset by the vitriol of U.S. politics, Godwin, who had worked on Capitol Hill, wrote a commentary, “<a href="https://www.listenfirstproject.org/pg-its-time-to-listen" target="_blank">It’s Time to Listen</a>,” while on an overnight bus trip across Uganda.</p>
<p>Multiple U.S. newspapers published his column, which called for what is the starting point of most bridging work: People should <a href="https://www.listenfirstproject.org/pledge" target="_blank">listen first to understand</a>.</p>
<p>Later that year, Godwin started a nonpartisan and nonprofit organization, the <a href="https://www.listenfirstproject.org/" target="_blank">Listen First Project</a>, to promote this message through <a href="https://www.listenfirstproject.org/story" target="_blank">activities</a> like a 2014 “<a href="https://www.listenfirstproject.org/campaigns" target="_blank">Listen First, Vote Second</a>” public relations and media campaign.</p>
<p>After Donald Trump won the 2016 election, Godwin decided to expand Listen First work. He established the <a href="https://www.listenfirstproject.org/listen-first-coalition" target="_blank">#ListenFirst Coalition</a> with three other similar organizations: <a href="https://tlh.villagesquare.us/about/our-story/" target="_blank">The Village Square</a>, <a href="https://livingroomconversations.org/" target="_blank">Living Room Conversations</a> and <a href="https://nicd.arizona.edu/" target="_blank">National Institute for Civil Discourse</a>.</p>
<p>Today, this coalition includes over <a href="https://www.listenfirstproject.org/listen-first-coalition" target="_blank">500 organizations</a>, whose work ranges from one-off dialogue skills workshops to longer-term projects that seek to build social cohesion in the U.S.</p>
<h2>2. Be curious, not dogmatic</h2>
<p><a href="https://braverangels.org/" target="_blank">Braver Angels</a> <a href="https://braverangels.org/how-braver-angels-began-david-blankenhorn-bill-doherty-david-lapp/" target="_blank">dates back to 2016</a> and is another large nonprofit organization that is part of the #ListenFirst Coalition.</p>
<p>On Election Day on Nov. 5, 2024, Braver Angels organized hundreds of pairs of Trump and Kamala Harris supporters to stand at polling stations and demonstrate that dialogue across the political divide is possible. Some held signs that read “<a href="https://braverangels.org/electionday/" target="_blank">Vote Red, Vote Blue, We’re All Americans Through and Through</a>.”</p>
<p>During the past year, I have observed Braver Angels workshops on media bias, public education, immigration and the 2024 election.</p>
<p>Their <a href="https://braverangels.org/couples-therapy-principles-in-the-design-of-the-braver-angels-red-blue-workshop/" target="_blank">fishbowl exercise</a> stands out.</p>
<p>Designed by <a href="https://braverangels.org/leader-spotlight-bill-doherty/" target="_blank">Bill Doherty</a>, a couples therapist and co-founder of Braver Angels, the fishbowl involves a group of Republicans and Democrats talking.</p>
<p>People in the group take turns speaking on a particular political topic, while the others – along with a larger group of observers – listen to what they say without speaking. After peering into this “fishbowl,” each group member discusses what they discovered by listening to the other group. Many mention their “surprise” at points of agreement on certain issues and the thoughtful reasoning behind positions “on the other side” they had previously dismissed.</p>
<p>The exercise illustrates a key starting point of bridging work: Be curious, instead of trying to prove you are right. Learn how someone on the other side of an issue understands and perceives something.</p>
<h2>3. Burst out of your bubble</h2>
<p>Another key strategy to overcome division is helping people burst out of their bubble. The idea is that people can objectively detach from and examine their assumptions, and then try to explore alternative views outside their social media, news information and community silos.</p>
<p>One #ListenFirst Coalition partner, <a href="https://www.allsides.com/about" target="_blank">AllSides</a>, tries to help people do this through a digital platform that shows how the same news of the day is being reported by left, right and center media organizations. It also has an online tool, “<a href="https://www.allsides.com/media-bias/rate-your-bias" target="_blank">Rate Your Bias</a>,” which helps users become aware of their own assumptions.</p>
<p>People can use these tools to compare different stances on issues like federal taxes and civil liberties – and how their own positions line up. People can also search for individual media outlets to see if the majority of other users have rated these organizations as liberal, conservative or center.</p>
<p>When people identify their own biases – which can become evident as they examine the media outlets they like, for example – it can help them become more curious and open. It also helps them move out of the information silos that divide people.</p>
<p>The bridging movement is not without its challenges. People who lean red are sometimes suspicious of these initiatives, which give people information on voting and democracy and can be perceived as having a <a href="https://www.pacefunders.org/language/" target="_blank">liberal bias</a>.</p>
<p>Group diversity is also a challenge. Based on my observations, Braver Angels participants tend to be <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/04/06/1090910863/red-blue-workshops-try-to-bridge-the-political-divide-do-they-really-work" target="_blank">older, white and educated</a>.</p>
<p>And other groups, like #ListenFirst Coalition partner <a href="https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2024/0716/200-miles-from-where-Trump-was-shot-ordinary-citizens-combat-political-violence" target="_blank">Urban Rural Action</a>, have to spend considerable time and effort getting a diverse range of people in their programs.</p>
<p>But, given America’s stark political divisions, I think there is a clear need and desire for the depolarization work these groups do.</p>
<p>The vast majority of <a href="https://www.listenfirstproject.org/toxic-polarization-data" target="_blank">people in the U.S. are concerned about the current state of polarization</a> in the nation. These bridging groups show a way forward and offer strategies to help Americans build bridges across the country’s deepening political divide.</p>

The casino opened in January 2023 with 57 table games, 24 poker tables and more than 1,400 slot machines. (Roger Chesley/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joyce Jackson was eager to get inside the sprawling Rivers Casino Portsmouth on a recent weekday. Nor was she reticent to express her opinion about the full-scale gaming center that</span><a href="https://www.riverscasino.com/portsmouth/press/rivers-casino-portsmouth-celebrates-grand-opening" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">opened early last year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It’s one of five casinos that’s already operating or being planned across the commonwealth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I love it!” said Jackson, 76, who lives in nearby Norfolk and visits the casino in Portsmouth at least twice a month. A large digital billboard on the building promoted the upcoming appearance of comedian</span><a href="https://www.riverscasino.com/portsmouth/entertainment/Tracy-Morgan" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Tracy Morgan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an alumnus of “Saturday Night Live” and “30 Rock.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I just won a jackpot,” Jackson told me, explaining how she took home $2,600 during an earlier visit. “I like the one-armed bandit.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her son Brian Smith, 51, was her designated chauffeur, and he dutifully stood by as I interviewed them in the parking lot. (Smith told me a few days later he plunked down $140 and won $500 from slot machines during that trip.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Listening to Jackson, you could almost see the flashing lights, hear the canned jingling of coins and smell the restaurant fare. I did just that when I entered the casino – and promptly lost $10 on various slot machines, including video blackjack.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_40897" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:1920px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/img_4130/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-40897" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_4130-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="2560" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_4130-scaled.jpg 1920w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_4130-225x300.jpg 225w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_4130-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_4130-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_4130-1536x2048.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Double 7 jackpot is among the many slot machines customers can play at Rivers Casino Portsmouth. Most allow you to just push a button, but some have the old &#8220;one-armed bandit.&#8221; (Roger Chesley/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, I enjoyed myself and will go back. It’s an entertaining diversion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s what state legislators, casino advocates and many Virginians banked on when the commonwealth </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">finally</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> decided to take a chance on the industry. Well, that and a desire to tap a source of revenue that had bypassed the state for decades.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The move to casino gambling in Virginia was long overdue. Localities, though, shouldn’t depend on gaming as their sole or chief revenue-generating strategy. People who study casinos say there’s only so much cash to go around, and the “new shiny toy” eventually loses its luster – especially given the myriad ways people can gamble nowadays.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The explosion of online sports books is competing with physical casinos,” Bob McNab, a professor and chair of the Department of Economics at Old Dominion University, told me. “Let’s not forget the state lottery or games of skill.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also said there’s a two-hour “catchment” driving area that most gambling halls draw from if they’re not considered a “destination casino,” like in Las Vegas or Monaco.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Most of the traffic is local,” McNab added. The host locality will reap more tax dollars, “but at the state level, you’re</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">really moving money from movies, restaurants and bars to casinos,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So there’s little net gain unless you can attract non-Virginians.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Back in 2015, when I wrote about the topic frequently for The Virginian-Pilot,</span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2015/10/27/putting-pamunkeys-federal-status-on-hold-deals-the-tribe-a-bad-hand/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">40 states had commercial or tribal casinos</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2016/11/30/roger-chesley-maryland-will-reap-millions-from-virginians-with-opening-of-mgm-casino/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Paternalistic attitudes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> among some legislators and congresspeople, plus concerns about protecting state lottery dollars, prevented passage of casino gaming. Virginians had to travel to Delaware, Maryland or elsewhere to get their fill – or fix, depending on your perspective.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia, thus, was one of the last states to welcome casinos when the General Assembly approved them in 2020 for five cities: Bristol, Danville, Norfolk, Portsmouth and Richmond. Residents, though, first had to approve the casinos in a referendum. (Petersburg </span><a href="https://virginiabusiness.com/petersburg-casino-appears-close-to-approval/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">just joined the list</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after Richmond voters said no last year.)</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_40899" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/norfolk-casino-wide-shot/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-40899 size-full" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Norfolk-Casino-Wide-Shot-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1440" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Norfolk-Casino-Wide-Shot-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Norfolk-Casino-Wide-Shot-300x169.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Norfolk-Casino-Wide-Shot-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Norfolk-Casino-Wide-Shot-768x432.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Norfolk-Casino-Wide-Shot-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Norfolk-Casino-Wide-Shot-2048x1152.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  A rendering of the casino to be built in Norfolk, Virginia.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some 42 states now have “land-based” gaming, a spokesperson with the American Gaming Association, an industry trade group, told me. That’s a lot of competition, yet many states – much like Virginia – eagerly welcome them. Eligible localities, including Portsmouth, have embraced the  opportunity:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://cardinalnews.org/2024/11/14/the-long-awaited-500-million-permanent-hard-rock-hotel-casino-holds-its-grand-opening-on-thursday/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The permanent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> $500 million Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino </span><b>Bristol</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, at the former Bristol Mall, opened last week. A temporary casino had opened in July 2022, the first one to operate in the state. The staff will eventually total 1,400, according to news accounts.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Caesars Virginia in </span><b>Danville </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">recently announced it will open doors to its permanent casino next month. Caesars and the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians</span><a href="https://www.wnct.com/news/southeast-region/virginia-casino-resort-about-60-miles-from-durham-schedules-date-for-grand-opening/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">opened a temporary casino in May 2023</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The site is just 60 miles from Durham, so its catchment area actually includes residents in North Carolina. The $750 million casino resort will host the first Virginia restaurant of noted</span><a href="https://newsroom.caesars.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2024/Celebrated-Multi-Michelin-Starred-Chef-Gordon-Ramsay-Brings-First-Restaurant-to-Virginia-with-Arrival-of-Ramsays-Kitchen-at-Caesars-Virginia/default.aspx" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">chef-scold Gordon Ramsay</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">The oft-delayed casino in downtown </span><b>Norfolk</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> held a</span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2024/10/30/norfolk-casino-breaks-ground-on-750-million-project/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">ceremonial groundbreaking</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Oct. 30. The $750 million project includes a 200-room hotel, food and beverage outlets and a casino with 1,500 slots and 50 table games scheduled to open in 2027. A temporary facility should open in late 2025, a casino spokesman told me. The Virginian-Pilot reported the project has shrunk since it was first announced by the Pamunkey tribe, which is a partner with Boyd Gaming. Norfolk voters approved the project in 2020. The development partner has changed</span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2024/09/08/norfolk-casino-plans-have-evolved-heres-how-todays-plans-compare-with-previous-proposals/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">since plans were originally released in 2018</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
<li><b>Petersburg </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">voters this month</span><a href="https://www.wric.com/news/local-news/the-tri-cities/petersburg-moves-forward-with-1-4-billion-casino-after-voter-approval/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">overwhelmingly supported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a proposed $1.4 billion casino project. More than 80% backed it. Petersburg weighed in after voters in</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/04/24/petersburg-doubles-down-on-cordish-as-its-casino-operator/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">nearby Richmond twice rejected casino proposals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All this casino action comes with a huge caveat: It’s likely to cause more gambling addiction. Carolyn Hawley, an addiction expert and professor at Virginia Commonwealth University, told me states and localities should factor in the potential loss to individuals of productivity in their jobs, health problems, stress and family discord.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, because there’s no federal funding for gambling studies, Hawley said, not much research is being done. “We just don’t know what the ramifications are going to be,” said Hawley, who’s also president of the Virginia Council on Problem Gambling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What we do know is that even if Virginia didn’t host casinos, residents here would gamble in nearby states – think of the huge MGM National Harbor casino just across the Potomac River in Prince George’s County, Maryland. Or, Virginians would ante up while on their smartphones.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So the state should collect gaming dollars if it’s going to have to also fight gaming-related problems.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile,</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/09/20/virginia-sees-big-tax-bump-from-sports-betting-and-casinos/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">a September 2023 Virginia Mercury story</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> noted gaming was outperforming previous state projections, even though several casino sites were in temporary buildings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The temporary Bristol casino gained $157 million in net gambling revenue in its first year of operation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The temporary Caesars casino in Danville had $31 million in gambling revenue in May and June 2023. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2024/01/23/rivers-casino-portsmouth-generates-250m-in-revenue-15m-in-city-taxes-in-first-full-year/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A news article</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> said the Portsmouth casino generated nearly $250 million in gaming revenue in its first full year. It provided the city of Portsmouth with more than $15 million in tax revenue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These welcome statistics might not continue for individual cities and counties after all five casinos in Virginia are operating, attendance tapers off and if gambling-related addictions rise dramatically. Localities can’t afford to view gaming as a panacea for their budgets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A healthy dose of skepticism is warranted to rationally discuss how casinos can help (and hinder) economic development,” ODU’s 2021 State of the Commonwealth report noted about the then-fledgling industry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Experience in the gambling industry shows that, after the novelty has worn off, casino revenue tends to plateau, if not outright decline,” the report added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s enjoy ourselves at the roulette wheel, poker table and slot machines. Let’s gamble wisely, within budget.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And let’s tell our local officials and state legislators that gaming is just one of many tools to raise money – and to keep searching for others.</span></p>

(Dominion Energy)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eight years ago this week, I wrote </span><a href="https://powerforthepeopleva.com/2016/11/10/why-trump-wont-stop-the-clean-energy-revolution/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a column</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> titled, “Why Trump won’t stop the clean energy revolution.” Calling global warming a hoax, businessman and reality TV star Donald J. Trump had just been elected with a promise to save coal jobs and pull the U.S. out of the Paris climate accord. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Climate activists were deeply distraught then, as now. I wrote in 2016, “Reading the news Wednesday morning was like waking up from a nightmare to discover that there really </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">is</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a guy coming after you with a meat cleaver.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But as I also wrote, there is only so much damage a president can do when technology, popular opinion and – especially – economics don’t support his agenda. Trump couldn’t save the coal industry (though </span><a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/trumps-order-on-energy-promises-coal-jobs-and-a-clean-environment-what-does-that-look-like" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">he tried</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). Instead, his administration oversaw a </span><a href="https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/us-coal-jobs-down-24-from-the-start-of-trump-administration-to-latest-quarter-61386963" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">24% decline</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in coal employment. And where coal supplied 30% of U.S. electricity in 2016, by the time Trump left office it had fallen to 20%. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the intervening years, Trump seems to have lost interest in coal mining, even as he continues to embrace fossil gas production. His enthusiasm for gas fracking fits with his drill-baby-drill approach to energy, but it was also intended to win over voters </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielmarkind/2024/11/05/will-fracking-determine-the-next-president/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in Pennsylvania</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a major producer of shale gas. Ironically, the gas industry insists on calling methane “clean” precisely because burning it emits less CO2 than coal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While coal was dying, wind and solar were well on their upswing when Trump took office in 2017, and they continued to advance through his first administration. By 2020, wind and solar had become the </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-19/wind-solar-are-cheapest-power-source-in-most-places-bnef-says" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cheapest forms</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of new electric generation. Today, renewable energy supplies more than 21% of the nation’s electricity, while coal’s share has dropped further, to just 16%. Trump or no Trump, technological advances and a thirst for cleaner energy continue to drive new wind and solar generation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed, the offshore wind industry – famously </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/may/13/trump-president-agenda-climate-policy-wind-power" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reviled</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Trump – wasted no time this week in congratulating its erstwhile foe on his victory and </span><a href="https://www.offshore-mag.com/special-reports/news/55240984/offshore-and-energy-industry-trade-groups-comment-on-trump-victory" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">insisting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, hilariously, that his election is a big win for the industry. The first Trump administration, they noted hopefully, “laid out the fundamental framework for our modern offshore wind industry.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, okay. From their lips to Trump’s ears. Trump is hardly known for consistency, and it is not impossible to imagine him softening his position on an industry that is creating well-paying jobs for the blue-collar workers who make up a portion of his base. His Virginia acolyte, Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin, boasts of overseeing the building of the nation’s largest offshore wind farm. Why shouldn’t Trump pivot? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Early in the Republican primaries, one candidate </span><a href="https://rollcall.com/2023/08/24/transcript-gop-presidential-hopefuls-debate-in-milwaukee/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">opined</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that all the solar panels and batteries sold in the U.S. are made in China. That wasn’t actually true. For years one U.S. company, First Solar, has ranked among the world’s top ten solar panel manufacturers. Among the domestic manufacturers of both EVs and batteries, one of the largest is Tesla, whose CEO Elon Musk is now a Trump darling. It is going to be fascinating to find out whether Musk uses his influence to benefit the clean energy transition generally, or only himself. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet the notion that China dominates solar and battery production is also not wrong. China is eating our lunch on clean energy. Chinese companies produce </span><a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/solar-pv-global-supply-chains/executive-summary" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">80% of the world’s solar panels</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and more than half of its </span><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2024/4/20/are-chinese-evs-taking-over-the-car-market#:~:text=China%20accounts%20for%20more%20than,electric%20cars%20sold%20worldwide%20today." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">electric vehicles</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Sadly, perhaps, these are not cheap imitations of superior American products. They are world-leading technology. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chinese dominance of the world market was a major reason that President Joe Biden’s signature climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), put so much emphasis on supporting domestic manufacturing. Tariffs on Chinese goods, Trump’s preferred approach, help U.S. companies compete for American consumers, but they don’t support an export market when other countries produce better goods for less money. Even at home, critics note, tariffs mostly just </span><a href="https://www.bushcenter.org/catalyst/opportunity-road/rooney-tariffs-rising-prices" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">raise prices</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet Trump has vowed to repeal the IRA, and given that Congress passed it without Republican support, there is certainly a danger that a Republican Congress will comply. On the other hand, </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/30/climate/clean-energy-us-2024-election.html?searchResultPosition=1" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">observers note</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that 80% of the manufacturing tax credits have gone to red states, and this August, 18 House Republicans signed a letter to Speaker Mike Johnson asking to keep the credits. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t want to sound too optimistic. Wait, let me rephrase that: I don’t feel optimistic at all. We are facing headwinds today that weren’t around in 2016. At that time, gains in energy efficiency meant electricity demand was not increasing, in spite of a growing population. With wind and solar displacing coal, there was a clear pathway for CO2 emissions from the electric sector to continue falling. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, however, the skyrocketing demand for electricity from data centers threatens the progress we’ve made on clean energy. It remains to be seen whether artificial intelligence will unleash efficiency gains and novel technologies that can put carbon reductions back on track. Right now, though, tech companies are so desperate for power that they will take it from wherever they can get it, and regardless of carbon content.  (I notice, though, that they still </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/11/as-virginias-scc-prepares-to-tackle-the-data-center-surge-it-can-learn-from-ohio/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">want it to be cheap</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and are </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/07/24/amazon-claims-to-power-all-its-operations-with-renewable-energy-if-only-that-were-true/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">happy to greenwash</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it to meet their sustainability goals). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps the biggest change from eight years ago is simply that we are that much closer to reaching catastrophic climate </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/dec/06/earth-on-verge-of-five-catastrophic-tipping-points-scientists-warn" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tipping points</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. 2023 was the </span><a href="https://wmo.int/news/media-centre/climate-change-indicators-reached-record-levels-2023-wmo#:~:text=The%20WMO%20report%20confirmed%20that%202023%20was,was%20the%20warmest%20ten%2Dyear%20period%20on%20record." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">warmest year on record</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and 2024 is </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/06/climate/2024-temperatures-hottest-year.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">on track</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to surpass it. The effects are evident in the number and costliness of severe weather and wildfires made worse by global warming. (Just ask </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/07/18/1198912918/home-insurance-rates-are-rising-due-to-climate-change-what-could-break-that-cycl" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">insurance companies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.) It is frustrating, to say the least, to contemplate losing the next four years to an administration that thinks climate change wouldn’t be an issue if we would just stop talking about it.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet Americans of all political stripes </span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/08/09/what-the-data-says-about-americans-views-of-climate-change/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">continue to support</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> renewable energy by wide margins. And apart from a small minority of vocal climate deniers, most Americans want the U.S. to take stronger action on climate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This election revealed deep fault lines among the American public, but one thing we all have in common is the faith that our ability to solve intractable problems is stronger even than our tendency to wish the problems away. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s why, even in the face of such serious headwinds, the clean energy revolution will continue. </span></p>

(Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Donald Trump, the once-and-future president, holds special animus for people who dare question his statements and actions. At a rally just before Election Day, he placed journalists in the cross-hairs, at least figuratively.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-says-he-wouldnt-mind-if-someone-shot-journalists/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump told rallygoers in Pennsylvania</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it wouldn’t bother him if someone shot the reporters there covering the event. He had mentioned an opening between the panels of bulletproof glass; Trump had faced an assassination attempt during a July rally. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“To get me, somebody would have to shoot through the fake news, and I don’t mind that so much,” Trump told the crowd. Folks there laughed and shouted howls of approval. Nothing like bloodshed, I suppose, to satisfy the masses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an eight-week period before the election, Trump verbally attacked the media more than 100 times,</span><a href="https://rsf.org/en/usa-trump-verbally-attacked-media-more-100-times-run-election" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Reporters Without Borders noted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. That total didn’t even include social media posts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He’s recently called journalists</span><a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2024/11/trump-attack-media-news-lawsuit-fox-news-journalists-first-amendment/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">“monsters” and “horrible, horrible, dishonest people.”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (That’s rich coming from the guy who</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-fact-checker-tracked-trump-claims/2021/01/23/ad04b69a-5c1d-11eb-a976-bad6431e03e2_story.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">lied or otherwise uttered misleading statements more than 30,000 times</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in his first term.) He sued CBS News some $10 billion for its editing of a “60 Minutes” interview with Democratic Party nominee Kamala Harris, though such editing is commonplace.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disabuse yourself of the notion these are merely routine comments by Trump,</span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/06/politics/what-happens-to-trump-criminal-cases/index.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">the nation’s only convicted felon to be voted commander in chief</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Doesn’t he do this all the time? Sure. Have such statements ever </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> led to harm? Well …</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Circumstances are different now, since he’ll have sycophants and</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/2024/11/06/whats-next-trump-presidency-policy-changes/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">supreme loyalists staffing his second administration</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. That’s not like the first term, when he often faced pushback from top advisors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And we all witnessed – in real time and shocking video footage – </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/08/politics/fact-check-trump-january-6/index.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">how he incited</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a failed insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump’s oft-unhinged rantings matter. His fervent followers could take a directive to attack reporters as a call to (fire)arms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which is exactly the point. He wants journalists looking over their shoulders and focusing on would-be attackers, rather than writing forcefully about Trump’s leadership – including its deficiencies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If we’ve learned one thing about Trump and contemporary authoritarians, we have to take them at their word,” Bruce Shapiro, executive director of the Dart Center for Journalism and Trauma at Columbia University, told me in an interview. “Making the press the enemy of the people is central to the MAGA project.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The president-elect’s words “give permission to people in his movement” to assault others, Shapiro added. “It’s not mere bombast when a ‘joke’ is part of a movement that valorizes violence, that declares people ‘the enemies from within.’”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This may sound far-fetched to you. But as a member of the profession constantly under siege by a politician who wouldn’t accept his 2020 defeat, and who sees </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">any</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> criticism as a reason to erupt, I don’t take these attacks lightly. Nor do my colleagues.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It takes a toll on the journalists” who cover the president, Shapiro said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Committee to Protect Journalists, a nonprofit group based in New York City, reported recently that Trump has mulled strengthening libel laws, weakening First Amendment protections and prosecuting reporters for critical coverage. For a man willing to excoriate anyone, and who wields such a huge megaphone, he has notoriously thin skin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Journalists face this onslaught at a time of shrinking newsroom budgets, fewer local reporters and the</span><a href="https://localnewsinitiative.northwestern.edu/projects/state-of-local-news/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">closing of many publications</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> around the country, CPJ noted. Its interviews with journalists, lawyers, and press freedom advocates “found that media workers are confronting challenges that include an increased risk of </span><a href="https://cpj.org/2023/05/man-fires-shot-at-memphis-television-station/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">violence</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://pressfreedomtracker.us/blog/members-of-the-press-charged-with-committing-acts-of-journalism-in-2023/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">arrest</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, on- and offline </span><a href="https://cpj.org/2023/08/this-kind-of-behavior-cannot-be-tolerated-police-raid-on-kansas-newspaper-alarms-media-press-freedom-groups/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">harassment,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> legal battles, and </span><a href="https://cpj.org/2023/10/alabama-publisher-reporter-arrested-charged-with-disclosing-leaked-information/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">criminalization</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joel Simon, director of the Journalism Protection Initiative at the Graduate School of Journalism at City University of New York, noted Trump’s bombast is often used to draw attention to himself, rather than issues that have greater importance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The language can be “incredibly menacing and threatening,” Simon told me, but it also “can be used to manipulate coverage.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s incredibly destructive,” Simon said. “But I don’t think it’s causing journalists to cover him in a different way.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Relatively few journalists in this country over the past 50 years have been slain because of the stories they were covering, but it does happen. Victims include my onetime associate</span><a href="https://chaunceybaileyproject.org/2011/06/10/chauncey-bailey-murder-justice-has-finally-been-done/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Chauncey Bailey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who worked at the competing daily newspaper in Detroit when we both were reporters there. We chatted about the craft, and we often played basketball together.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://chaunceybaileyproject.org/2011/06/09/commentary-chauncey-bailey-verdict-brings-long-awaited-justice/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bailey was gunned down in 2007 in downtown Oakland</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> while walking to work. He had been reporting on a story about financial problems at a business called Your Black Muslim Bakery. A coalition of local media formed the Chauncey Bailey Project to investigate the death and the police handling of the killing. Eventually, three men were sentenced to prison in the case.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/10/16/nx-s1-5155054/las-vegas-reporter-murder-official-sentenced" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeff German</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an investigative reporter at the Las Vegas Review-Journal, was stabbed to death in September 2022. He had reported on a hostile workplace environment in the office of Robert Telles, a then-elected official. Telles was sentenced last month to at least 28 years in prison.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump doesn’t need to know reporters personally, but he can still place their lives at risk. His own statements could “nudge” any one of his followers nationwide to commit violence against journalists. He’d also enjoy some plausible deniability.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump, one of the most reckless presidents in U.S. history, is rushing headlong into fascism. He enjoys a pliant, spineless Republican Party. After the House of Representatives impeached Trump over Jan. 6, GOP senators whom he placed in jeopardy that day refused to convict him. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He benefits from an overtly partisan Supreme Court majority.</span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/supreme-court-trump-capitol-riot-immunity-2dc0d1c2368d404adc0054151490f542" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">It blessed his attempts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this summer to gain broad immunity from prosecution related to his plot to overturn the 2020 election. It was a shocking ruling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My colleagues in the Fourth Estate are one of the few lines of defense left. We’re willing to say when Trump is wrong, lying or violating the Constitution. It’s why the Narcissist-in-Chief has placed a target on our backs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s no accident.</span></p>

That’s the preliminary estimate of damage to farmers in Southwest Virginia after Hurricane Helene brought damaging winds, heavy rain and flooding to the region. We were lucky the storm didn’t impact more of our state, but for those farmers who are today facing crop losses, property and equipment damage, and other recovery expenses as a result of Helene’s wrath, the impacts are significant and will have lasting implications — for their farms, their families’ livelihoods, and the region’s economy.</span></p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Federal government sends Virginia $10 million for Route 58 repair after Hurricane Helene washout&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/22/federal-government-sends-virginia-10-million-for-route-58-repair-after-hurricane-helene-washout/embed/#?secret=MCMet8Ie5p#?secret=Ey8fxwnZM5" data-secret="Ey8fxwnZM5" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And it’s not just this year. Weather records show that since 1980, Virginia has been hit with more than 100 extreme weather events that cost our state </span><a href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/billions/state-summary/VA" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">over $1 billion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In that time period, the records show that the annual average of billion-dollar weather events in Virginia has tripled just in the last five years. Floods, freezes, and — for the last two years, in particular — extreme drought have all wreaked havoc on our agriculture industry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This trend is no surprise to Virginia’s farmers. We live by the weather, and science doesn’t care what you believe. Our weather is, in fact, getting warmer and weirder every year. While we’ve always understood that our success at making a living by farming is dependent on favorable weather, we didn’t start out farming knowing how rapidly the climate would change and how devastating those impacts would be.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve already seen how increases in average annual temperatures are impacting planting and growing seasons. </span><a href="https://crops.extension.iastate.edu/encyclopedia/corn-pollination-effect-high-temperature-and-stress" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Research</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> shows that corn silks and pollen die when temperatures exceed the mid 90’s. Our farm in the Shenandoah Valley is now in USDA plant </span><a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/climate-change-is-shifting-plant-growth-zones-heres-what-to-know-for-your-garden-this-year" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">zone 7</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">; in 1990 we were in zone 6. Our Southwest Virginia farmers suffered catastrophic flooding while farmers in the Shenandoah Valley experienced extreme drought – for two years in a row.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the extreme weather trends have intensified at alarming rates in recent years, we have long known the identity of the primary culprit that is accelerating the pace of climate change: greenhouse gas emissions from our electricity and transportation sectors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We had a sound tool in place to more intentionally and meaningfully address power plant emissions, as designated by law. That tool was the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), which the administration of Gov. Glenn Youngkin single-handedly did away with earlier this year. Before he ended it, it was working. In the first two years of being in RGGI, Virginia’s power plant emissions fell </span><a href="https://campd.epa.gov/data/custom-data-download" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">16.8%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> statewide. Today, less than a year after Youngkin removed us from RGGI, </span><a href="https://campd.epa.gov/data/custom-data-download?bookmarkId=1422" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">EPA data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Virginia’s electricity providers shows that emissions are up significantly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia benefitted from RGGI to the tune of more than </span><a href="https://campd.epa.gov/data/custom-data-download" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$827.7 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> during the years we participated, between 2021 and 2023. The proceeds from RGGI were divided between two statewide programs: a low-income energy efficiency program run by the Virginia Department of Housing and Community Development and a flood resilience capacity building and project implementation program run by the Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation. The emissions reductions from RGGI’s energy efficiency component were consistently progressing. And the flood mitigation measures implemented by the flood preparedness component were making headway at helping protect Virginia’s communities vulnerable to flooding. A total of 98 RGGI-funded resiliency projects had already been approved, but the status of many of those projects is now at risk because of the funding Youngkin pulled out from under Virginians when he pulled out of RGGI. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you talk to a dozen farmers, you’ll probably get a dozen different perspectives on the topic of climate change. But like I stated earlier, science doesn’t care what you believe; the weather is getting warmer and weirder. Taking Virginia out of RGGI is taking Virginia backwards in our fight against climate change — a fight that needs to be accelerated, not hindered or delayed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The effects of greenhouse gas emissions on our climate are cumulative. The longer we wait, the worse it gets. The harder it gets. The more expensive it gets. Virginia’s farming families cannot afford the cost of inaction. When we get Virginia back in RGGI, we’ll get Virginia moving in the right direction again. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The court’s two-thirds majority of Republican-appointed justices (three by former President and current GOP nominee Donald Trump) granted a stay that Virginia’s Republican-led executive branch </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/28/virginia-asks-supreme-court-to-block-order-to-reinstate-1600-people-stripped-from-voter-rolls/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sought</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, after federal district and appellate courts temporarily </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/judge-orders-people-removed-from-voter-rolls-to-be-reinstated-gov-youngkin-to-seek-appeal/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">voided</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s order 90 days before the election to purge Virginia voter rolls.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That means that the 1,600 people who failed to check the correct box on a Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles form and, in many cases, mistakenly identified themselves as noncitizens were excised from rolls of registered voters. Now, they bear the burden, if they’re lucky enough to find out about it in time, of re-registering at this late hour and </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/think-you-might-have-been-mistakenly-purged-from-virginias-voter-rolls-heres-what-to-do/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">casting provisional ballots</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> subject to challenge after the polls close.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin has sought to position himself as a hero standing resolutely against hordes of swarthy outsiders corruptly seeking to influence American elections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be clear, Youngkin is legally and morally right in asserting noncitizens have no business voting in U.S. elections. Yet he’s never shown proof that it happens.</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/10/09/youngkin-noncitizen-voters-virginia/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/10/09/youngkin-noncitizen-voters-virginia/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the Washington Post, no noncitizen has tried to vote in Virginia since he became governor. What’s more, only three people were prosecuted since January 2022 for illegal voting of any kind in Virginia, the Post reported.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former top state election officials say that maintaining clean, up-to-date voter rolls is work that goes on </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">almost</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> year-round as required under a 2006 state law — except in the three months before elections.</span><a href="https://www.justice.gov/crt/national-voter-registration-act-1993-nvra" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Federal law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> specifically bars states from systematically purging its rolls during a “Quiet Period” 90 days ahead of a federal election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of which imparts an unmistakable partisan odor — rooted in Trump-inspired election denialism and nationwide Republican</span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/election-officials-who-back-trumps-big-lie-stir-concern-swing-states-2024-10-08/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">“election integrity” initiatives</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — to Youngkin’s Aug. 7 order to take extraordinary, expedited steps to find and excise noncitizens during that exact 90-day pre-election period.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s order is much more likely to disenfranchise actual citizens for paperwork snafus than to snare a foreigner hell-bent on voting. But then, this was always about political posturing, irrespective of bad operational outcomes or adverse consequences for legitimate citizen voters like lifelong Republican Christine Rabassa of Henrico County or </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rina Shaw of Chesterfield</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">County</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, both U.S.-born citizens and longtime registered voters.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rabassa said in</span><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1l2NI-kh1V4H3No56j1X-BhMC99LUW1aU/view" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">a sworn affidavit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in support of litigation filed in U.S. District Court against Youngkin’s Executive Order 35 that she discovered her registration was “canceled” after she showed up for early in-person voting. She said a Henrico election supervisor “took her into a separate room” and told her she was removed for failing to check a box indicating her citizenship when she renewed her driver’s license in August and that she would have to re-register. She was turned away from the polls that day without being offered a provisional ballot and required to return another day to vote, the affidavit states.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shaw also had no idea that a DMV clerical error compromised her right to vote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I actually wasn’t notified by Virginia. I was notified by NPR,” the unemployed computer programmer told the Mercury on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Had the public broadcaster not sought an interview with her for</span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/10/29/nx-s1-5169204/virginia-noncitizen-voter-purge" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">its Oct. 30 story</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Youngkin’s order, Shaw said, she would have found out as Rabassa had — by being turned away at the polls. She said she called the Chesterfield registrar’s office and was told her removal was “a mistake,” though there was no explanation for it. She said she was assured that she was being reinstated and found when she</span><a href="https://vote.elections.virginia.gov/VoterInformation/Lookup/status" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">checked her registration status online</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Wednesday that she had.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From this columnist, however, Shaw learned to her dismay that the Supreme Court’s Republican majority prevailed  </span><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docket/DocketFiles/html/Public/24A407.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">6-3</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in granting Virginia’s request for a stay, halting enforcement of lower court orders to reinstate voters in situations like hers and Rabassa’s.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s ridiculous,” she said, adding, “… and it was the same six votes that struck down Roe v. Wade, wasn’t it?” That decision in June 2022 ended 49 years of federal protection for abortion rights.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, Rina. It was.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, five days and a wakeup until the nation decides whether Trump or Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris will lead the free world for the next four years, Youngkin and Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares are joining other Republican-led states in imposing restrictions that make voting harder, especially for those with the fewest resources.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://alabamareflector.com/briefs/alabama-secretary-of-states-office-posts-news-release-required-by-court-order/" target="_blank">Alabama’s</a> Republican secretary of state attempted a voter-removal program similar to Youngkin’s that was also struck down by a federal judge. It was unclear Wednesday whether the Supreme Court will rule similarly in Alabama’s case as it did in Virginia’s. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the 2020 and 2024 battleground state of Georgia, a state judge struck down a rule approved Sept. 20 by the pro-Trump conservative majority of that state’s electoral board that would have required the hand count of millions of paper ballots. It’s a state Trump narrowly lost in 2020 despite his desperate, corrupt attempt to sandbag Georgia’s Republican secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, “</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/politics/trump-urges-georgia-secretary-of-state-to-find-votes/2021/01/03/aba64f5f-8c3c-490f-af34-618ccea732d7_video.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to find 11,780 votes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” the margin by which he trailed Democrat Joe Biden.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s a bromide in politics about what motivates the two parties to vote, and there’s a lot of truth to it: “Democrats have to fall in love; Republicans just fall in line.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin recognizes that opposing Trump is lethal in today’s Trump-owned GOP where apostates are targeted for primaries and defeated. Just ask outgoing Rep. Bob Good or former Rep. Denver Riggleman, both Virginia Republicans who fell out of favor with Trump during their time in office.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2021, Youngkin was hailed nationally as the GOP’s post-Trump path forward when he won the governorship on his first bid for elective office with a genial, pragmatic, avuncular style that played well in Virginia and ended a 12-year GOP drought in statewide elections. Now, mindful of his party’s current landscape and his own lofty national ambitions, he has Super Glued his lips to Trump’s ample derriere.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He fell in line.</span></p>

Since 2020, more Virginians have died from fatal drug overdoses than from car accidents and gun violence combined, with fentanyl responsible for a significant portion of these tragedies. This crisis, now the </span><a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/content/uploads/sites/18/2024/01/Quarterly-Drug-Death-Report-FINAL-Q3-2023.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">leading cause of unnatural death in Virginia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, demands urgent action from all sectors of society, especially our educational institutions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schools could take a more proactive and sustained role in combating the opioid crisis by implementing comprehensive drug education programs, training staff and students  to use the lifesaving, overdose-reversing medicine Narcan and fostering student-led campaigns to promote drug-free lifestyles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most effective ways schools can address this issue is by providing thorough and ongoing drug education. A one or two-day awareness symposium, in order to “check off” a box,  is simply insufficient. Instead, a culture of “continuous advocacy” should be integrated into every school. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These programs would not only educate students about the dangers of opioids, but also equip them with the skills to make informed, healthy choices. Starting early and reinforcing these lessons throughout a student’s academic journey is crucial. Schools should partner with healthcare professionals, law enforcement, and community organizations with more frequency to ensure students receive accurate and up-to-date information, particularly about the deadly risks associated with fentanyl.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, schools must be prepared for the possibility of an opioid overdose occurring on campus, which, unfortunately, at least </span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/virginia-high-school-saw-8-opioid-overdoses-three-weeks-unprecedented-rcna123151" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">one Virginia high</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> school has experienced previously, Narcan (naloxone) should be readily available in all schools. Training staff members and older students in its use is essential, ensuring that they are equipped to respond quickly in an emergency.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s Attorney General, Jason Miyares, has underscored the importance of Narcan through his “One Pill Can Kill” </span><a href="https://www.oag.state.va.us/media-center/news-releases/2691-february-21-2024-attorney-general-miyares-launches-new-public-awareness-tools-for-one-pill-can-kill-campaign#:~:text=RICHMOND%2C%20VA%20%E2%80%93%20Attorney%20General%20Jason,%2C%20and%20cable%2C%20broadcast%2C%20and" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">campaign</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, emphasizing the need for widespread training. Schools should integrate Narcan training into health education classes and professional development sessions, making it a standard part of their emergency preparedness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Empowering students to actively promote a drug-free environment is another critical step. School administrators should encourage student-led campaigns, such as the “Make a Pledge” initiative, which can effectively raise awareness and foster a sense of responsibility among peers. These campaigns might include peer mentoring, awareness events and the appointment of campus ambassadors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By involving students in these efforts, schools can create a supportive community where young people feel encouraged to stay drug-free and help their friends do the same. The First Lady of Virginia, Suzanne Youngkin, and AG Miyares have launched a website to help facilitate these kinds of difficult conversations at </span><a href="http://www.itonlytakesone.virginia.gov/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">itonlytakesone.virginia.gov</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which I highly recommend all students visit and study.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To further prepare students for the challenges they may face regarding drug use, schools should incorporate role-playing and real-life scenarios into their education programs. These exercises help students understand the pressures they may encounter and develop strategies to resist them. By practicing how to say “no” to drugs, recognizing signs of drug use in others and knowing how to seek help, students will be better equipped to navigate these situations in real life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, schools should encourage students to become ambassadors for drug prevention, extending their influence to younger students. This peer-to-peer approach can be particularly effective, as younger students are often more receptive to messages delivered by older peers they admire. Schools should partner with organizations like the </span><a href="https://www.vfhy.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Foundation for Healthy Youth</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to design and execute these campaigns.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The opioid crisis, exacerbated by the prevalence of fentanyl, requires urgent and sustained action. Schools must embrace a leadership role by continuously advocating for drug prevention and equipping students and staff with the necessary knowledge and tools to combat this epidemic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Comprehensive drug education, Narcan training, student-led campaigns, role-playing exercises and the promotion of student ambassadors are all crucial steps in creating a safer environment and preparing students to make informed choices. The future of an entire generation depends on it.</span></p>

Daylight hours shorten.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scam artists also descend like locusts upon unsuspecting seniors who are changing coverage options during</span><a href="https://www.kff.org/medicare/issue-brief/what-to-know-about-the-medicare-open-enrollment-period-and-medicare-coverage-options/#:~:text=The%20annual%20Medicare%20open%20enrollment%20period%20runs%20from%20October%2015,st%20of%20the%20following%20year." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Medicare open enrollment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which runs from Oct. 15 to Dec. 7. The only difference from the insects? Pesky scammers strike every year, with nary a respite.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Medicare is the government-sponsored health insurance program for</span><a href="https://www.cms.gov/cms-guide-medical-technology-companies-and-other-interested-parties/getting-started/overview-medicare" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> people ages 65 and older</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as well as for those under 65 with specific disabilities. President Lyndon Johnson signed the legislation establishing Medicare (and Medicaid) into law in 1965.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AARP Virginia recently alerted seniors that Medicare con artists are back at it. Frankly, I doubt they ever lay dormant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Medicare scams spike during open enrollment season with criminals posing as insurance providers calling and emailing about free gifts or limited-time offers,”</span><a href="https://states.aarp.org/virginia/aarp-virginia-fraud-alert-medicare-open-enrollment-scams#:~:text=Be%20suspicious%20and%20don't,an%20existing%20relationship%20with%20them" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the nonprofit organization said in a news release</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “These scams are all designed to steal your money, Medicare information, or your identity.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t share sensitive personal information with anyone who calls, emails or visits promoting a Medicare plan. “Legitimate Medicare plans can only contact you if you’ve requested information or if you have an existing relationship with them,” the release added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Seniors are inundated with ads” this time of year, said Jane Constantineau, marketing director for Senior Services of Southeastern Virginia. Elderly Virginians often are looking for help to navigate their options, but that sometimes leaves them vulnerable to individuals and</span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/12/17/world/asia/myanmar-cyber-scam.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">scam labor camps</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, often overseas, trying to cash in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Martin Bailey volunteers with AARP Virginia, giving anti-fraud presentations to seniors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Scammers can ‘spoof’ a phone number,” Bailey told me.</span><a href="https://www.fcc.gov/spoofing" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Spoofing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> means your caller ID picks up numbers that disguise where the call is actually coming from.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you don’t recognize the call, let it go to voicemail, he advised. Scammers don’t usually waste their time leaving a message. Even when they do, Bailey said, don’t return the message: Find another listing for the so-called company, and dial that number to see whether it’s real.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you receive a text message on your phone from unknown senders, don’t click on the attached links. They could download a virus on your device.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why do con artists go through all this trouble and subterfuge? “Money,” Bailey said simply.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Federal Trade Commission’s</span><a href="https://www.ftc.gov/reports/consumer-sentinel-network-data-book-2023" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Consumer Sentinel Network</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> collects information about problems that Americans encounter for all types of fraud, not just Medicare.</span><a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/CSN-Annual-Data-Book-2023.pdf" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The data book for 2023</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, released earlier this year, tallied 2.6 million fraud reports costing $10.3 billion in total losses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The median loss was $500. People ages 70 and over, though, had a higher median loss compared to younger Americans. Imposter scams and identity theft in government benefit programs were key areas of monetary losses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia ranked ninth-highest among the states in fraud reports per 100,000 people. The commonwealth had nearly 98,000 incidents, and Virginia reported $205 million in losses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A FTC spokesman told me that in 2023, the agency received 743 reports from Virginians of suspected Medicare imposters. Four people reported losses totaling $63,680.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Various news articles suggest</span><a href="https://wvpublic.org/medicare-fraud-costs-taxpayers-creates-problems-for-seniors/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Medicare loses $60 billion annually</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to fraud nationwide.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This topic is personal to me because I turn 65 this year. I’m officially old. My thinning hair and arthritic knees had already been clues.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I had to delve into my Medicare options after decades of employer-sponsored health care. The different parts of</span><a href="https://www.medicare.gov/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Medicare</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (A, B and D, plus Advantage or supplemental) can be confusing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You would’ve thought, however, that I’d advertised my date of birth. I received dozens of unsolicited – and sketchy – phone calls this year. Many came to my cell phone with the note, “Spam Risk.” Here are just two. (I answered them, in part, because I figured they would be fodder for a future column.)</span></p>
<p><b>April 18</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Call originates from an 804 area code, supposedly)</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Caller: I’m Christina at the Health Care Center.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Me: What city and state are you in?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Click.)</span></p>
<p><b>April 23</b></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Caller: I’m Olivia. I’m calling from the Healthcare Information Center. We’re calling with the latest Medicare info.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Me: Olivia, where is the center located?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Click. Why is that question a problem if the caller is legit?)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What can Virginians do to protect themselves?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One resource is the</span><a href="https://virginiasmp.com/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Senior Medicare Patrol</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a grant-funded program from the feds that helps protect against and detect Medicare fraud and abuse. It does outreach and education. Call 800-938-8885. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The patrols are in all 50 states and Washington, D.C.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can also find a wealth of information at</span><a href="https://www.medicare.gov/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">medicare.gov</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Are you more comfortable talking to a program representative one-on-one? Then call 1-800-633-4227. The site is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, except for some federal holidays.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Protect yourself. Don’t get cheated. Prevent scammers from cashing in at your expense – and the government’s.</span></p>

(Parker Michels-Boyce/ For the Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On October 15, Dominion Energy Virginia filed its <a href="https://www.dominionenergy.com/-/media/pdfs/global/company/irp/2024-irp-w_o-appendices.pdf?rev=c03a36c512024003ae9606a6b6a239f3" target="_blank">2024 integrated resource plan</a> (IRP), and just as in 2023, the company shows no inclination to meet the carbon-cutting requirements of the Virginia Clean Economy Act (VCEA). Blaming soaring load growth from data centers, Dominion models only scenarios with increasing amounts of fossil fuel generation to supplement its investments in renewable energy and nuclear. A scenario that would actually comply with the law is discussed only as something stakeholders asked for, then dismissed as “infeasible.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tellingly, the company notes casually that its own scenarios “evaluate the impacts of” the VCEA, as if the law were merely advisory, while the utility retained the final say. It’s kind of like a driver thoughtfully “evaluating the impact” of a speed limit – and then accelerating.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be fair, this used to work for Dominion. The State Corporation Commission (SCC) has a long history of criticizing Dominion’s IRPs and ordering the company to do better next time, but never outright rejecting a plan. If traffic cops only ever gave out warnings, you would expect to see more scofflaws.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year, though, the three-member SCC has two new commissioners, and already they have shown they intend to take their oversight role seriously. The commission didn’t even wait to see what Dominion would come up with before demanding improvements. On October 11, four days before Dominion submitted its IRP, the SCC issued an </span><a href="https://www.scc.virginia.gov/docketsearch/DOCS/81xf01!.PDF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">order</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> instructing the utility to supplement its filing with additional work, to be submitted by November 15.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The task list includes modeling plans that meet the requirements of the VCEA, with at least one that incorporates data center load and one that doesn’t, as well as least-cost plans with and without data centers. In addition, the SCC wants Dominion to break down the costs of new transmission projects to identify the expenses that are primarily due to data center demand. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The order tacitly acknowledges that the staggering growth of the data center industry in Virginia has upended utility planning. At the same time, the SCC is not giving Dominion a free pass, either on costs or on VCEA requirements. If Dominion believes it can only meet demand reliably by adding expensive gas peaker plants, it is going to have to prove it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/11/as-virginias-scc-prepares-to-tackle-the-data-center-surge-it-can-learn-from-ohio/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wrote a few weeks ago</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the SCC plans to convene a technical conference in December to examine issues around serving data center load. Of paramount interest to the commission are the questions of how much it will cost to meet the burgeoning demand, and how to protect other consumers from rate increases for new generation and transmission infrastructure needed only because of one industry. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The SCC is not alone in its concerns about Dominion’s cavalier approach to its IRP obligations. Last year, with a goal of improving utility oversight, the General Assembly </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/09/05/after-six-years-of-inaction-virginia-commission-on-electric-utility-regulation-reconvenes/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">revitalized</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> its Commission on Electric Utility Regulation, which formerly served as a graveyard for utility reform bills. (CEUR used to be pronounced “sewer,” but commission members would dearly love it if you would now call it “the cure.”)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a September 16 </span><a href="https://apps.dlas.virginia.gov/User_db/frmView.aspx?ViewId=6315&amp;s=7" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">memo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, CEUR director Carrie Hearne recommended members consider a list of reforms that would, among other things, require Dominion to include in its IRP “a VCEA conforming scenario that does not assume to exercise an immediate exemption due to reliability concerns.” This scenario would have to incorporate the social cost of carbon, meet energy efficiency metrics (another area where Dominion has fallen short), plan for the retirement of fossil fuel plants targeted for closure in the VCEA, and assume an “unobstructed” buildout of renewable energy and storage (removing the artificial caps Dominion currently employs). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words, CEUR would like Dominion to follow the law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ratepayer and environmental advocates have applauded the more muscular approach being taken by CEUR and the SCC. Dominion, however, has remained steadfastly oblivious to the hints flung at it from all sides.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company remains unapologetic. In an </span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2024/10/19/column-all-of-the-above-approach-needed-for-virginias-growing-power-demand/?share=motroiopfetoicdelaeb" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">op-ed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Dominion Energy Chairman Bob Blue insists the company is pursuing an “all of the above” strategy that will produce electricity that is “reliable, affordable and increasingly clean” – an assertion he repeats three times, as if saying it often enough makes it true. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the IRP puts it, however, “perceptions of affordability are subjective.” Analyzing its favored scenario using the methodology directed by the SCC, Dominion projects residential bills will rise over the next 15 years from an average of $142.77 today to $315.25 in 2039. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s be charitable, though. Maybe when Mr. Blue said the company was committed to affordable energy, he meant for data centers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Increasingly clean” is even more counter-factual. As </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/16/dominion-pushes-for-renewables-more-natural-gas-in-latest-long-term-plan/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the Mercury, “The utility’s previous plan projection said about 95% of electricity generation would be pulled from </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/12/12/dominion-regulator-recommends-rejection-of-utilitys-long-term-plan/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">renewable</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sources. Tuesday’s updated plan calls for about 80% of generation to be spurred by renewables.” And as with the 2023 IRP, Dominion plans to keep expensive and highly polluting coal plants operating beyond their previous retirement dates, putting the company even further away from “clean.”</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="aj0oHhlxJS"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/16/dominion-pushes-for-renewables-more-natural-gas-in-latest-long-term-plan/">Dominion pushes for renewables, more natural gas in latest long-term plan</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Dominion pushes for renewables, more natural gas in latest long-term plan&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/16/dominion-pushes-for-renewables-more-natural-gas-in-latest-long-term-plan/embed/#?secret=GkpAHJrLQI#?secret=aj0oHhlxJS" data-secret="aj0oHhlxJS" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion’s 2023 IRP received considerable</span><a href="https://bluevirginia.us/2023/07/dominion-energys-climate-numbers-dont-add-up" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> criticism</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for projecting a doubling of greenhouse gas emissions by 2048, a year when they should be at zero under the terms of the VCEA. Dominion appears to have learned a lesson from that public shaming, but not the right lesson. The 2024 plan shortens the emissions time frame to 5 years, cutting out reporting for the later years when the proposed new methane gas plants would be in service and spewing out CO2. Instead, the IRP brags about lowering “emissions intensity,” a success it can achieve without cutting carbon, just by selling more electricity. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So much for affordable and increasingly clean. As for reliable, burning more methane will only exacerbate the climate change and extreme weather that have been wreaking havoc on southeastern utilities’ ability to keep the lights on. The recent storms should be a wake-up call for utilities to ramp up renewables, including distributed solar generation and storage to serve communities, rather than building more centralized, carbon-intensive fossil fuel plants to power data centers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But some companies, like some people, never learn. Finding itself deep in a hole, Dominion proposes to keep on digging.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, voters will get dozens of chances to answer that question. All 11 of the commonwealth’s congressional seats are on the ballot, as is one Senate seat, the mayor’s office and all city council posts in Alexandria and Richmond, plus more council seats in Hampton, Harrisonburg, Norfolk, Roanoke, Virginia Beach, and beyond. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These elections involve a wide range of issues.  But in a sense, they boil down to one – housing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unaffordable housing drives the greatest problems across Virginia and the nation.  High housing prices — largely the result of a decades-old housing shortage and restrictive zoning laws — shape where you work, the length of your commute, and the carbon footprint of that journey.  Housing costs affect the size of your home, and with it decisions over how many children to have or whether to have them at all. Record-breaking home prices and skyrocketing rents limit how much families can spend on healthy food and doctor’s visits.  And with real estate making up the brunt of household wealth, rising home prices drive a widening wealth gap between homeowners and renters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My organization </span><a href="https://homeofva.org/learn-and-live-2/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recently helped to highlight</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> how unaffordable housing helps to fuel two other enduring agonies — school segregation and racial inequality.  In the Richmond region, as with so many areas across the United States, the obvious racial segregation of our communities is mirrored in our schools.  And with that separation comes major differences in access to opportunity.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Few neighborhoods with affordable housing in the Richmond area have access to schools with top-tier scores for reading proficiency.  And children living in high-poverty neighborhoods here tend to learn from teachers who lack expertise in their fields.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Think about that: high housing prices are segregating schools and limiting children’s futures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s not all.  Black and Latino individuals rent their homes </span><a href="https://www.nar.realtor/blogs/economists-outlook/racial-disparities-in-homeownership-rates" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more often</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> than their white neighbors, so rent hikes have an outsized impact.  At the same time, the homeownership gap between Black and white Americans — </span><a href="https://ncrc.org/the-racial-wealth-divide-and-black-homeownership-new-data-show-small-gains-deep-fragility/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">larger today than in 1900</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — continues to grow, and that </span><a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/black-wealth-is-increasing-but-so-is-the-racial-wealth-gap/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">drives</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a shameful wealth gap.  The average Black family in the United States owns just 15% of the wealth of the average white family.  Unequal access to housing opportunities sits at the heart of this problem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And it’s a problem holding everyone back.  In the half-century between 1964 and 2009, </span><a href="https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/mac.20170388" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a recent study found</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, U.S. GDP would have been 13.5% higher if Americans had greater access to affordable housing.  </span><a href="https://kirwaninstitute.osu.edu/sites/default/files/documents/Principles-for-Equitable-and-Inclusive-Civic-Engagement-1.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other research</span></a> <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9298745/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">has shown</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that communities where people from diverse backgrounds regularly encounter each other tend to have higher levels of trust among residents and more confidence in civic institutions.  In other words, high-priced housing not only segregates communities and trims our economic sails. It also makes us bad neighbors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What does this have to do with November’s elections?  The problems we face are rooted in failures of policy.  And that means we can change them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The presidential contest presents two starkly different visions of how to address the housing crisis.  And Virginia’s Senators have co-sponsored </span><a href="https://www.kaine.senate.gov/press-releases/warner-kaine-colleagues-introduce-legislation-to-help-first-time-first-generation-homebuyers-narrow-the-wealth-gap" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">housing legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that would offer one way to level the playing field.  Washington will have things to say about housing in America.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But most housing politics is local.  The most effective ways to support affordable and fair access to housing start close to home, in our neighborhoods and city or county councils, where we can make our voices heard.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember the local races I mentioned earlier?  Local candidates elected in November will decide whether their communities offer a “welcome” mat or a “do not enter” sign to the next generation of would-be residents.  They will have thumbs on the scale in decisions over zoning, deciding what will be built and where.  Those zoning decisions will affect construction costs, which get passed along to homeowners and renters, so local officials will shape household budgets as well.  Local races may appear down the ballot, but they’re right at the top of daily concerns.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortunately, these days, housing isn’t red or blue.  We live in a hyper-partisan time, but voters and candidates across the political spectrum have solutions to offer.  Housing has proven to be the rare issue that attracts common sense, well-intentioned problem solvers from the left and right.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At my organization, we’ve found that when we show up for housing, we win: Earlier this year, HOME of VA passed through the General Assembly all ten of our priority bills.  The governor signed into law three of these bills, expanding protections for those facing evictions and boosting state funding for fair housing outreach and education.  While he vetoed the other seven, we’ve proven that fair housing legislation has champions on both sides of the aisle.  After all, this isn’t about politics — it’s about what’s right.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginians keen to put down roots in communities across the commonwealth — or find a way to stay amid rising costs — deserve fairness, choice, and affordability.  Up and down the ballot, those values need our votes.  We can do better than segregated communities sprawling across unaffordable regions where inequality grows.  We can vote for fair access to affordable housing.  We owe it to ourselves, our families and our neighbors to get it right.  </span></p>

Glenn Youngkin speaks to reporters outside the Capitol near the end of the 2024 General Assembly session. (Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By now, you probably know who will get your vote for mayor, for your congressional seat, for the U.S. Senate and for president. But do you know whether you’re still an eligible voter?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Will you arrive at your neighborhood precinct on Nov. 5 and discover that you have been excised from the registered voter rolls weeks before election day without notice and with limited recourse?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voting used to be one of the easiest and most essential privileges we exercise as Americans. As it should be. But nothing in electoral politics is as simple or easy as it used to be.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Americans once could take for granted now requires more vigilance and self-education by the voter and more work than ever by election officials.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Voter ID laws in the commonwealth have swung like a pendulum over the last decade,” said Nikki Sheridan, who was a top official overseeing Virginia elections under Republican former Gov. Bob McDonnell. “Responsible administrations spent significant amounts of time and money for outreach and education about voter identification legislative changes, and citizens are saturated — with messages that swing as wildly and frequently as the law changed.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This fall, in the stretch run of the bitterly contested election, there’s a new wrinkle: Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s 11th-hour order to have elections officials scour Virginia’s voter rolls hunting for noncitizens, an action that the U.S. Department of Justice filed a</span> <a href="https://www.justice.gov/crt/media/1373371/dl" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lawsuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Oct. 14 to halt.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It marked the second time in a week the</span> <a href="https://www.lwv.org/newsroom/press-releases/lawsuit-challenges-recent-voter-roll-purges-virginia-preventing-eligible-us" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">state was sued</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in federal court over Youngkin’s action. The League of Women Voters and the Virginia Coalition for Immigrant Rights allege in</span> <a href="https://www.lwv.org/newsroom/press-releases/lawsuit-challenges-recent-voter-roll-purges-virginia-preventing-eligible-us" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">their Oct. 7 complaint</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the way Virginia purges its rolls violates the federal law’s protections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s order, in large part, restates ongoing and uncontroversial best practices and statutory requirements for safeguarding the security of ballots and those casting them. That includes the universal use of paper ballots to provide a lasting record of a voter’s intent, a strict chain of custody of early ballots and ensuring that computerized counting machines are not linked to the internet to avoid the possibility of remote hacking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then the order directs extraordinary efforts to bar noncitizens from voting, a step an ambitious Republican politico like Youngkin would take as a matter of course to stoke a favored paranoia among his party’s base.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The governor has boasted of removing 6,303 people from Virginia’s voter rolls since he took office. On its face, that’s a good thing. Cleansing the voter rolls of noncitizens is required by a 2006 state law signed by then-Gov. Tim Kaine, a Democrat. Evidently, the law works.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/10/09/youngkin-noncitizen-voters-virginia/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Washington Post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, no noncitizen has attempted to vote in Virginia since Youngkin became governor. The Post also reports that only three people have been prosecuted in the commonwealth for illegal voting of any kind from January of 2022 through July of this year. That’s hardly massive election fraud.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enforcing laws that reserve voting in U.S. elections exclusively to U.S. citizens has been a year-round pursuit, according to Chris Piper, who was Virginia’s commissioner of elections from 2018 to 2022 and is now executive director of the Virginia Public Access Project, a nonprofit and nonpartisan data source about state politics and government.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia was among the states whose election legislation required Justice Department preclearance under the</span> <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/black-history/voting-rights-act" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voting Rights Act of 1965</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> until 2013 when it was ended by a</span> <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/court-cases/shelby-county-v-holder" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Supreme Court decision</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Congress passed the law during the Civil Rights Era to prevent state and local governments, mostly in the South, from erecting barriers to Black Americans’ right to vote. Piper said the Justice Department approved Virginia’s 2006 statute with the unwritten understanding that it would not apply during the Quiet Period.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s order echoes the persistent drumbeat of former President and Republican nominee Donald Trump’s pre-emptive and baseless election fraud assertions. They’re rooted in his</span> <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/big-lie-trump-stolen-election-inside-creation" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Big Lie</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and subsequent legal challenges based on it that got bounced out of courthouse after courthouse —</span><a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/jan/08/joe-biden/joe-biden-right-more-60-trumps-election-lawsuits-l/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">63 in all</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — following his re-election defeat four years ago. But it remains a battle cry among Trump’s deluded disciples.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most vexing consequence of Youngkin’s order, which its critics call a “purge,” is that it’s much more likely to harm legitimate voters, regardless of party, through paperwork errors and bureaucratic snafus than it is to block illicit interlopers from voting. All it takes is for a bona fide citizen to fail to check the right box on a Department of Motor Vehicles form to trigger their removal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once that error is in the system, as Markus Schmidt and Charlotte Renee Woods of The</span> <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/14/voter-purge-lawsuits-add-to-disenfranchisement-allegations-against-youngkin-administration/?emci=5a2745fb-738a-ef11-8474-6045bda8aae9&amp;emdi=a352fb9f-e48a-ef11-8473-0022483029fa&amp;ceid=338091"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mercury reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, there is no obligation by either the State Department of Elections or local elections officers to vet and validate the information before a voter’s registration is terminated. Often, a voter isn’t aware of it until she or he tries to cast a ballot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By then, the remedy is to re-register (which, thankfully, is possible up to Election Day) and cast a</span><a href="https://www.elections.virginia.gov/casting-a-ballot/in-person-voting/#provisional-ballot" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">provisional ballot</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that is subject to scrutiny and perhaps a challenge after the polls close, said Piper and Sheridan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond that, Sheridan noted, is the increasingly rancorous process of counting (and sometimes </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">re</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">counting) the results. What used to be a dispassionate mathematical exercise  has become snarled in partisan gamesmanship and bizarre conspiracy fantasies, a product of Trump’s toxic and unrelenting election denialism.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Prince William County, for instance, a prosecution led by Virginia’s GOP-led attorney general’s office against the county registrar over alleged 2020 election improprieties disintegrated once it reached local courts and was dismissed. Yesterday, the former registrar, a professional election administrator named Michele White,</span> <a href="https://protectdemocracy.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/1.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sued Attorney General Jason Miyares</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and others in his office in U.S. District Court alleging malicious prosecution.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A major shift apparent to me is a lack of civility, often accompanied by an operating assumption that our election officials lack integrity or credibility,” said Sheridan, now a fulltime mom to 5-year-old twins and a volunteer for civic causes in Fluvanna County. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Numerous recent recounts affirm that election results in Virginia are accurate and rarely change the outcome of an election. Infrequent mistakes are human, and allowances must be made. A new registrar, or a seasoned registrar adjusting to a legislative change, is neither a conspiracy participant nor the devil,” Sheridan said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To illustrate her point, she contrasted two recounts in which she was involved, both in Virginia’s 5th Congressional District. One, in 2008, affirmed Democrat Tom Perriello’s thin general election victory over Republican incumbent Virgil Goode. The other was this June’s vicious GOP primary battle in which Trump-supported challenger John McGuire ousted House Freedom Caucus leader Bob Good by 366 votes out of 62,802 cast.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an observer in the 2008 recount, Sheridan eventually struck up a friendship with a Democrat who was part of Perriello’s team, she said. In this summer’s recount, she was the target of withering vituperation from fellow Republicans that included a cyberbullying effort.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is unfortunate, but I observed the process primarily to defend it mightily against those who may deny the outcome because they do not like it,” she said. “That is not how electoral democracy works.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even so, Virginia elections are clean, fair and secure. </span><a href="https://www.elections.virginia.gov/registration/view-your-info/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Check your registration status</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> before you head to your polling place.

Thanks to the Electoral College, that has happened <a href="https://history.house.gov/Institution/Electoral-College/Electoral-College/" target="_blank">five times</a> in the country’s history. The most recent examples are from 2000, when Al Gore won the popular vote but George W.

<p>As a <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=vXXZBEkAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao" target="_blank">scholar of presidential democracies</a> around the world, I have studied how countries have used electoral colleges.

<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The origins of the U.S. Electoral College</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dhm.de/archiv/ausstellungen/heiliges-roemisches-reich/index_3.html" target="_blank">Holy Roman Empire</a> was a loose <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/confederation-politics" target="_blank">confederation</a> of territories that existed in central Europe from 962 to 1806. The emperor was not chosen by heredity, like most other monarchies. Instead, <a href="https://www.holyromanempireassociation.com/list-of-holy-roman-emperors.html" target="_blank">emperors</a> were chosen by electors, who represented both secular and religious interests.</p>
<p>As of <a href="https://www.unesco.org/en/memory-world/golden-bull-all-seven-originals-and-king-wenceslaus-luxury-manuscript-copy-osterreichische" target="_blank">1356</a>, there were <a href="https://brill.com/display/title/18769?language=en" target="_blank">seven electors</a>: Four were hereditary nobles and three were chosen by the Catholic Church. By <a href="https://www.holyromanempireassociation.com/reichstag-of-the-holy-roman-empire.html" target="_blank">1803</a>, the total number of electors had increased to 10. Three years later, <a href="https://search.worldcat.org/title/70699377" target="_blank">the empire fell</a>.</p>
<p>When the <a href="https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/founding-fathers" target="_blank">Founding Fathers</a> were drafting the U.S. Constitution in 1787, the <a href="https://www.senate.gov/civics/common/generic/Virginia_Plan_item.htm" target="_blank">initial draft proposal</a> called for the “National Executive,” which we now call the president, to be elected by the “National Legislature,” which we now call Congress. However, Virginia delegate <a href="https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/founding-fathers-virginia#mason" target="_blank">George Mason</a> viewed “<a href="https://www.consource.org/document/james-madisons-notes-of-the-constitutional-convention-1787-6-2/" target="_blank">making the Executive the mere creature of the Legislature</a> as a violation of the fundamental principle of good Government,” and so the idea was rejected.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania delegate <a href="https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/founding-fathers-pennsylvania#wilson" target="_blank">James Wilson</a> proposed <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/10714/plain-honest-men-by-richard-beeman/" target="_blank">that the president be elected by popular vote</a>. However, many other delegates were adamant that there be an <a href="https://theconversation.com/the-electoral-college-system-isnt-one-person-one-vote-150342" target="_blank">indirect way of electing the president</a> to provide a buffer against what Thomas Jefferson called “<a href="https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Jefferson/01-06-02-0174" target="_blank">well-meaning, but uninformed people</a>.” Mason, for instance, suggested that allowing voters to pick the president would be akin to “<a href="https://www.consource.org/document/james-madisons-notes-of-the-constitutional-convention-1787-7-17/" target="_blank">refer(ring) a trial of colours to a blind man</a>.”</p>
<p>For 21 days, the founders debated how to elect the president, and they held more than 30 separate votes on the topic – <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/706046/tyranny-of-the-minority-by-steven-levitsky-and-daniel-ziblatt/" target="_blank">more than for any other issue</a> they discussed. Eventually, the complicated solution that they agreed to was an early version of the electoral college system that exists today, a method where neither Congress nor the people directly elect the president. Instead, each state gets a number of electoral votes corresponding to the number of members of the U.S. House and Senate it is apportioned. When the states’ electoral votes are tallied, the candidate with the majority wins.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/founding-fathers-virginia#madison" target="_blank">James Madison</a>, who <a href="https://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed19.asp" target="_blank">was not fond of</a> the Holy Roman Empire’s <a href="https://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/debates_725.asp" target="_blank">use of an electoral college</a>, later recalled that the final decision on how to elect a U.S. president “<a href="https://bcuassets.blob.core.windows.net/docs/BJALS-Issue-2.pdf" target="_blank">was produced by fatigue and impatience</a>.”</p>
<p>After <a href="https://prologue.blogs.archives.gov/2020/10/27/amending-the-electoral-college-the-12th-amendment/" target="_blank">just two elections</a>, in 1796 and 1800, problems with this system had become obvious. Chief among them was that electoral votes were cast only for president. The person who got the most electoral votes became president, and the person who came in second place – usually their leading opponent – became vice president. The current process of <a href="https://constitution.findlaw.com/amendment12.html" target="_blank">electing the president and vice president on a single ticket</a> but with separate electoral votes was adopted in 1804 with the passage of the <a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-12/" target="_blank">12th Amendment</a>.</p>
<p>Some other questions about how the electoral college system should work were clarified by federal laws through the years, <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/RL/RL32717/12" target="_blank">including in 1887 and 1948</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://theconversation.com/pro-trump-rioters-storm-u-s-capitol-as-his-election-tantrum-leads-to-violence-149142" target="_blank">After the 2020 presidential election</a> exposed additional <a href="https://theconversation.com/an-unseen-problem-with-the-electoral-college-it-tells-bad-guys-where-to-target-their-efforts-236470" target="_blank">flaws with the system</a>, Congress further tweaked the process by passing <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/4573/text" target="_blank">legislation</a> that <a href="https://theconversation.com/congress-passes-legislation-that-will-close-off-presidential-election-mischief-and-help-avoid-another-jan-6-196204" target="_blank">sought to clarify how electoral votes are counted</a>.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Other electoral colleges</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>After the U.S. Constitution went into effect, the idea of using an electoral college to indirectly elect a president <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/706046/tyranny-of-the-minority-by-steven-levitsky-and-daniel-ziblatt/" target="_blank">spread</a> to other <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/republic" target="_blank">republics</a>.</p>
<p>For example, in the Americas, <a href="https://constitutionnet.org/sites/default/files/1821-grancolombiana.pdf" target="_blank">Colombia</a> adopted an electoral college in 1821. <a href="https://ciaotest.cc.columbia.edu/wps/klg/0028440/f_0028440_23119.pdf" target="_blank">Chile</a> adopted one in 1828. <a href="https://pdba.georgetown.edu/Constitutions/Argentina/arg1853.html" target="_blank">Argentina</a> adopted one in 1853.</p>
<p>In Europe, <a href="https://www.presidentti.fi/en/presidency/election-of-the-president/" target="_blank">Finland</a> adopted an electoral college to elect its president in 1925, and <a href="https://www.elysee.fr/en/french-presidency/electing-presidents-of-the-french-republic" target="_blank">France</a> adopted an electoral college in 1958.</p>
<p>Over time, however, these countries changed their minds. All of them abandoned their electoral colleges and switched to directly electing their presidents by votes of the people. Colombia did so in 1910, Chile in 1925, France in 1965, Finland in 1994, and Argentina in 1995.</p>
<p>The U.S. is the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1057/9780230522749" target="_blank">only democratic presidential system</a> left that still uses an electoral college.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" id="iSxqP" class="tc-infographic-datawrapper" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/iSxqP/1/" width="100%" height="400px" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">A &#8216;popular&#8217; alternative?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>There is an effort underway in the U.S. to <a href="https://theconversation.com/what-could-replace-the-electoral-college-138769" target="_blank">replace the Electoral College</a>. It may not even require amending the Constitution.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nationalpopularvote.com/written-explanation" target="_blank">National Popular Vote Interstate Compact</a>, currently agreed to by 17 U.S. states, including small states such as Delaware and big ones such as California, as well as the District of Columbia, is an agreement to award all of their electoral votes to whichever presidential candidate gets the most votes nationwide. It would take effect once enough states sign on that they would represent the 270-vote majority of electoral votes. The current list reaches 209 electoral votes.</p>
<p>A key problem with the interstate compact is that in races with more than two candidates, it could lead to situations where the winner of the election did not get a majority of the popular vote, but rather more than half of all voters chose someone else.</p>
<p>When Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Finland and France got rid of their electoral colleges, they did not replace them with a direct popular vote in which <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/plurality-system" target="_blank">the person with the most votes wins</a>. Instead, they all adopted <a href="https://theconversation.com/a-brief-history-of-georgias-runoff-voting-and-how-this-years-contest-between-two-black-men-is-a-sign-of-progress-194775" target="_blank">a version</a> of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0217650" target="_blank">runoff voting</a>. In those systems, winners are declared only when they receive support from more than half of those who cast ballots.</p>
<p>Notably, neither the U.S. Electoral College nor the interstate compact that seeks to replace it are systems that ensure that presidents are <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0262026" target="_blank">supported by a majority</a> of voters.</p>

(Chris McGrath/Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s so simple – and soooo seductive – to sign up for offers touting cheap “teaser” rates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You know what I mean: Just $10 for a gym membership for three months. Or a free trial period from retail-order conglomerates. Online news websites are fond of introductory fees of, say,</span><a href="https://subscribe.nola.com/defaultnolanding?ofrgp_id=161&amp;g2i_source=festivals" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">$1 for six months</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The problem comes when the trial period ends.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consumers often don’t track or remember the date when the discounted rate ceases. Their credit cards automatically get billed with the higher fees. The densely laden “terms and conditions” section they clicked on earlier may explain how tough it is to cancel – but who reads all that lengthy gibberish?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortunately, a new Virginia law that took effect July 1 forces companies – if you sign up for a 30-day free trial – to inform you about cancellation options before they actually ding your credit cards,</span><a href="https://www.axios.com/local/richmond/2024/10/04/virginia-cancel-subscription-reminder-free-trials" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Axios</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reported.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del.</span><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+mbr+H340" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Michelle Lopes Maldonado</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, D-Prince William, sponsored</span><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb744" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">the bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that got overwhelming support in both chambers this year. Gov. Glenn Youngkin then signed it into law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s a ‘gotcha moment’” when subscriptions automatically renew, Maldonado told me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s not just individuals who get caught up in this. Small businesses might have licensing agreements” that are similarly onerous, she said, adding that the legislation is part of her ongoing consumer protection efforts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Raheel Sheikh, a Northern Virginia businessman, reached out to Maldonado after receiving costly automatic renewal charges from a website maintenance firm. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The legislation puts some responsibility on the vendors,” he said. “All the responsibility was on the consumers.”</span></p>
<p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/23/some-states-including-virginia-want-to-make-it-easier-to-cancel-subscriptions/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Mercury noted last month</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the commonwealth is one of several states that have enacted similar measures. The laws give more protection to people previously flummoxed by abruptly rising automatic charges.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of us – with jobs, children to feed and busy lifestyles – simply lose track of all that we’ve signed up for online and elsewhere. A survey of 2,343 adults in March</span><a href="https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/subscription-creep-costs-us-consumers-more-than-1000-a-year-cnet-survey-finds/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">by CNET</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a consumer-oriented website, found 48% of respondents said they’d signed up for a free trial of a paid subscription, and then simply forgotten to cancel it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s about time consumers got more help against these expensive costs and shady business practices.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One utility in Ohio has </span><a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/aep-ohio-data-center-crypto-rates-puc/716150/#:~:text=Under%20AEP%20Ohio's%20proposal%2C%20data,GW%20or%20more%2C%20he%20said." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">proposed a requirement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that data centers commit to 10-year service contracts requiring them to pay at least 90% of the cost of the electricity they ask for, regardless of whether the data centers end up using that much power.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AEP Ohio says it has received service inquiries from data centers totaling 30 gigawatts of new power demand, and that serving all those new data centers would require a massive investment in expensive transmission lines. The utility wants to ensure other ratepayers aren’t stuck with the bill if the data centers leave town, if the AI boom goes bust, or if technological breakthroughs reduce the amount of energy they need. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The data center industry is apoplectic, but other utilities and their regulators are watching closely to see if this is a requirement they should adopt, too. This includes Virginia’s State Corporation Commission, which on October 2 </span><a href="https://www.scc.virginia.gov/getattachment/5cb8de50-1f06-4ba3-ae9e-399da0c26c10/PUR-2024-00144-Scheduling-Order-and-Notice.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced plans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for a technical conference on data centers to discuss “issues related to servicing this new electrical load.” Specific topics on the agenda include minimum bills for data centers, contract term lengths and whether certain transmission and/or generation costs should be directly assigned to a new customer class consisting of large-use customers like data centers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The conference is scheduled for December 16, and those who want to participate as panelists can nominate themselves on or before October 22. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AEP Ohio’s solution is not as novel as it might sound. It is normal for new industrial customers to be required to guarantee they will buy at least most of the electricity they say they will need. It’s a reasonable ask: a utility that spends millions of dollars on infrastructure to serve a new factory needs to make sure costs are covered if the factory folds up shop.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Normally, though, the customer has to guarantee it will buy 60-70% of the electricity it has asked for, not 90%. Tech companies complain it is unfair to require more of data centers than of other industries. If the higher number is approved, they warn, they may decide to locate in some other state. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Seriously? If they were to use that talking point in Virginia, the response </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/07/10/virginia-sprawl-data-centers/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">from residents</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> might be, “Is that a threat or a promise?”)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, there are good reasons to treat data centers differently. One is the sheer scale of the energy demand involved, meaning a lot more money is at risk. AEP Ohio projects that electricity use in Central Ohio will </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/09/13/data-centers-power-grid-ohio/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more than double</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> between 2018 and 2028 due to the growth of the data center industry.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another concern is that data centers operate more like warehouses than factories. It’s hard to move a factory, so it is likely to use a predictable level of electricity over a long period of time. By contrast, the contents of a warehouse (in this case, racks of servers) can be moved somewhere else if market conditions change. I </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/10/geothermal-energy-is-having-a-moment-could-it-power-virginias-data-centers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wrote recently</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about the potential of enhanced geothermal energy as a low-cost, renewable technology that is already starting to outcompete fossil fuels in western states. Utilities are right to worry about tech companies pulling out to chase cheaper, greener energy elsewhere. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, there is the question of whether this enormous energy demand is as real as it feels right now. Analysts have been questioning whether </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2024/08/07/is-the-ai-bubble-about-to-burst/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AI might be a bubble</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If companies can’t make it profitable soon, the demand they project might evaporate, leaving a lot of data centers empty and utilities with infrastructure no one needs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another, happier route to lower energy demand could be more energy-efficient operations. The data center industry as a whole has cut energy waste significantly over the years, and research suggests there may be further gains in efficiency coming. </span><a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/opinions/the-dual-pronged-energy-saving-potential-of-quantum-computers/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quantum computing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is frequently cited as one tool to unlock efficiencies. More dramatically, University of Minnesota researchers recently developed hardware that </span><a href="https://cse.umn.edu/college/news/researchers-develop-state-art-device-make-artificial-intelligence-more-energy" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">they say</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can lower the energy consumption of AI applications by “a factor of 1000.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quite possibly, the best  outcome for society would be for the data center boom to go bust, reducing any need for utilities to burn more fossil fuels and relieving communities of impacts on neighborhoods, parks and water resources. But utility regulators can’t wait around to see if that happens. They have to plan according to today’s expectations, which include data center demand growth of </span><a href="https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/articles/AI-poised-to-drive-160-increase-in-power-demand" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">160% by 2030</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, the response from the General Assembly, the governor, and utilities like Dominion Energy has so far amounted to nothing – or more precisely, worse than nothing. At the governor’s behest, the General Assembly actually increased tax subsidies for the wealthy industry in a bid to attract more data centers, while Dominion declared plans for expensive new fossil fuel generation and transmission to feed the demand. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That makes the SCC’s decision to wade in especially timely. The Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission is expected to release a </span><a href="https://jlarc.virginia.gov/pdfs/resolutions/2024_Data%20centers_JLARC.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">data center study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the end of the year, and when it meets again in January, the General Assembly is likely to see a repeat of many of </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/01/15/as-data-centers-continue-spreading-across-virginia-state-lawmakers-propose-new-development-rules/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">last year’s failed bills</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> addressing data center efficiency, siting and ratepayer protection. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the SCC can bring some sanity and cohesion to the discussion, it will be not a minute too soon.</span></p>

It&#8217;s an especially bad moment to be spreading misinformation online. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seems Rooz Dadabhoy has a poor sense of timing. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dadabhoy is the president of Rally Virginia, an organization that describes itself as “the home of the modern Republican woman,” a tech company CEO and a </span><a href="https://bov.vcu.edu/members/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">VCU Board of Visitors member</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> appointed by Gov. Glenn Youngkin.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_40337" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:135px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/08/no-fema-helene-funds-arent-going-to-undocumented-immigrants-despite-youngkin-appointees-tweet/screenshot_20241007-130457/" rel="attachment wp-att-40337"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-40337" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot_20241007-130457-135x300.png" alt="" width="135" height="300" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot_20241007-130457-135x300.png 135w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot_20241007-130457-461x1024.png 461w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot_20241007-130457-768x1707.png 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot_20241007-130457-691x1536.png 691w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot_20241007-130457.png 864w" sizes="(max-width: 135px) 100vw, 135px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Rooz Dadabhoy, president of Rally Virginia, a tech company CEO and a VCU Board of Visitors member appointed by Gov. Glenn Youngkin, posted this tweet containing misinformation about FEMA funds on Oct. 5, 2024. The post was later deleted. (Screenshot)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“FEMA has spent hundreds of millions on its ‘Shelter and Services Program’ for ILLEGAL migrants this year—and it’s right there on FEMA’s own website. WHAT ABOUT HELPING OUR OWN CITIZENS???? Shame on HARRIS-BIDEN!!!” Dadabhoy’s now-deleted Oct. 5 tweet read. The post included a photo that appeared to show a teary-eyed, wet-haired little girl sitting on a boat, wearing a life jacket and clutching an equally-soaked puppy as another boat floats down a river in the background. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most people who saw it, including me, immediately connected the picture to the water-logged Southeast now recovering from Hurricane Helene. Over 100 people died in the storm, and entire communities in </span><a href="https://ncnewsline.com/2024/10/08/fact-check-debunking-misinformation-surrounding-helene/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hardest-hit North Carolina</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> were washed away. There’s been significant flooding in Southwest Virginia, as The Mercury has </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/04/youngkin-shares-update-on-helene-damage-in-virginia-urges-to-not-be-distracted-by-climate-change/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, with at least 519 homes damaged or destroyed; two people have perished. That’s reality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The photo in Dadabhoy’s tweet, however, is not. It’s an AI-generated image, which I was able to confirm in less than 15 minutes by running the photo through </span><a href="https://sightengine.com/detect-ai-generated-images" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">three</span></a> <a href="https://aiimagedetector.org/result#google_vignette" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">different</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> free AI detection tools online. She could have easily done the same — and should have —  before sharing this fake photo.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dadabhoy’s words are also not rooted in reality. The tweet implies that FEMA funds are being routed to undocumented migrants instead of American-born natural disaster victims, a false claim parroted by Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and repeatedly debunked by FEMA in recent days.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No money is being diverted from disaster response needs. FEMA’s disaster response efforts and individual assistance is funded through the Disaster Relief Fund, which is a dedicated fund for disaster efforts. Disaster Relief Fund money has not been diverted to other, non-disaster related efforts,” FEMA posted Oct. 3 on a page of its website especially dedicated to setting the record straight (that they felt compelled to do that is sad, in and of itself).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only is the misinformation Trump, Dadabhoy and countless others are pushing irresponsible, it’s downright dangerous. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is reducing the likelihood that survivors will come to FEMA with a trusted way to register for assistance,” Keith Turi, acting associate administrator for response and recovery at FEMA, told </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/10/07/nx-s1-5144159/fema-funding-migrants-disaster-relief-fund" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NPR</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> yesterday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowing all this, I asked Dadabhoy two questions: Were you aware when you made that tweet that FEMA has repeatedly debunked the false claim that disaster relief funds are being used to support undocumented immigrants? What did you hope to accomplish by tweeting that? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dadabhoy replied that “I never implied that money is being diverted away from Hurricane Helene victims and being siphoned to illegal immigrants. I did not imply that. I did not even intend to imply that.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t believe that, and neither do the dozens of people who replied angrily to her tweet, some calling for her removal from VCU’s BOV. One person, unfortunately, replied by asking after the welfare of the AI child in the fake photo, showing the problem with spreading digital misinformation, even unintentionally: somebody will believe it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginians in positions of public influence, and who have our governor&#8217;s support, should be dispelling Trumped-up, unproven claims — especially in the aftermath of a major natural disaster, when so many people still need help — not adding fuel to the rumor wildfires.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_40341" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:979px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/08/no-fema-helene-funds-arent-going-to-undocumented-immigrants-despite-youngkin-appointees-tweet/picture3_0/" rel="attachment wp-att-40341"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-40341 size-full" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Picture3_0.jpg" alt="" width="979" height="651" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Picture3_0.jpg 979w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Picture3_0-300x199.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Picture3_0-768x511.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 979px) 100vw, 979px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  From FEMA: &#8220;Crews working to restore utilities and infrastructure damaged by Helene (in Washington County, Va.). (Nicholas Monteleone/ FEMA)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At a press gaggle Youngkin convened Tuesday morning to give updates on Hurricane Helene recovery efforts in Virginia, a reporter asked him what his administration was doing to counter misinformation concerning the storm and FEMA’s response, and referenced Dadabhoy’s tweet as an example of the problem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are using, I think, the best process, which is to put people on the ground, answer questions directly, and speak to you all frequently, so that you can help us get out the word how to apply for help where it&#8217;s available, and most importantly, that we care and that we&#8217;re there, and there will be a better day tomorrow,” the governor replied, in part. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin is wise to lean into working with the media to spread the facts; it is an essential part of our role. And you, dear reader, can do your part to identify and stop the spread of misinformation, too. Here are a few tools, tailored to our concurrent election and hurricane seasons:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Perhaps ironically in the context of this column, VCU Libraries is offering an excellent information literacy campaign called </span><a href="https://www.library.vcu.edu/about/news/2024-news/as-a-beacon-in-todays-information-fog-vcu-libraries-launches-campaign-to-encourage-people-to-vetyoursources.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">#VetYourSources</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, including a lecture by author and info literacy expert Mike Caulfield, “Rumors of Theft: Navigating election integrity discourse online” on Oct. 15.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> As mentioned above, FEMA’s </span><a href="https://www.fema.gov/disaster/current/hurricane-helene/rumor-response?utm_campaign=Emergency%20response%202024&amp;utm_content=310511761&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;hss_channel=tw-14074515" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hurricane Helene: Rumor Response&#8221;</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> page offers just-the-fact-ma’am breakdowns of what’s real and what&#8217;s not when it comes to the agency’s response to Helene cleanup efforts, and answers questions about its funding for future emergencies. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The Brennan Center for Justice at NYU Law&#8217;s </span><a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/how-detect-and-guard-against-deceptive-ai-generated-election-information" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">primer on fact-checking</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a great resource to help you learn “how to detect and guard against deceptive AI-generated election information.”</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The Poynter Institute’s </span><a href="https://www.politifact.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PolitiFact</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a verifiable fact-checking machine, a nonpartisan platform with a robust process of analyzing claims by politicians and media “to give citizens the information they need to govern themselves in a democracy,” writes Angie Drobnic Holan, Politifact’s former editor-in-chief. They&#8217;ve got a special section focused on debunking misinformation, too.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s always a good day to stop the spread of dubious digital distortions. Tweet, post, read and share responsibly out there, folks. </span></p>

Recently, a Chesterfield County judge sided with that locality’s police department in refusing a citizen’s request to reveal the names and salaries of hundreds of its officers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ruling occurred despite</span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title2.2/chapter37/section2.2-3705.1/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">a section in the Code of Virginia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> providing access to records “of the name, position, job classification, official salary, or rate of pay” of public employees. Andrew Bodoh, the attorney who sought the release of information for his client, told me this part of state law should’ve resolved potential conflicts with other code portions involving FOIA.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/crime-courts/chesterfield-police-trial-secrecy-undercover/article_e3cce33a-7cff-11ef-b273-efce26f17906.html#tracking-source=home-top-story" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Richmond Times-Dispatch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reported the Chesterfield police department had redacted the names of nearly every officer on the force. The agency had said that all 521 officers below the rank of lieutenant could go “undercover” at any  time in his or her career, which is why the names should remain secret.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More on that novel reasoning later.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bodoh, who specializes in FOIA cases, said the case will be appealed to the Virginia Court of Appeals. A similar case from Hanover County Circuit Court, involving access to information on sheriff’s department deputies there, will be heard at the appellate court.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="1oQkEelGkz"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/01/05/foia-friday-nottoways-new-county-administrator-hanover-officer-info-stays-shielded/">FOIA Friday: Nottoway’s new county administrator, Hanover officer info stays shielded</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;FOIA Friday: Nottoway’s new county administrator, Hanover officer info stays shielded&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/01/05/foia-friday-nottoways-new-county-administrator-hanover-officer-info-stays-shielded/embed/#?secret=TcUhPmTJqv#?secret=1oQkEelGkz" data-secret="1oQkEelGkz" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bodoh said there’s an obvious public interest in obtaining the names of people who are stopping citizens and making arrests. Residents should also know how much officers are being paid and whether those amounts are “fiscally responsible, as well,” he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course we should. Bringing that information to light could curb nepotism and favoritism within local government, too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chesterfield County Attorney Jeffrey Mincks, who defended the police department in court, did not return my calls or emails requesting comment about the case.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bodoh represents Richmond resident Alice Minium, the founder and director of</span><a href="https://openoversightva.org/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">OpenOversightVA.org</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The website bills itself as “a public, searchable database of law-enforcement officers” in the commonwealth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minium started her information-gathering following the racial justice protests that occurred when</span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/31/us/george-floyd-investigation.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Minneapolis police killed George Floyd in 2020</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. During demonstrations in Richmond, Minium told me, police officers often wouldn’t identify themselves to protesters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are trying to get from their mouths who is on their payroll and who is policing us,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some 342 law-enforcement agencies around Virginia have provided information that her organization had sought.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only Hanover and Chesterfield refused her requests.</span><a href="https://www.opengovva.org/minium-v-hines-hanover-circuit-court" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Hanover had utilized the same general defense</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about secrecy for undercover cops that Chesterfield later adopted. “The entire rest of the state acts like this is a given,” Minium noted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It makes you ask: What good is FOIA if you can’t get such basic information? If the appellate court sides with the lower ones, that could be a harbinger of even more state secrecy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Judges in Hanover and Chesterfield seemed hung up over whether “undercover officers” and “plainclothes officers” were the same thing. Generally, undercover officers are possibly impersonating someone else while investigating crimes – drug sales, illegal guns and prostitution, for example.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plainclothes officers can be homicide or major crimes detectives who don’t usually wear uniforms. They aren’t trying to fool citizens about who they are.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s a fundamental distinction between a plainclothes officer, who’s prepared to disclose identification to enforce the law, to an undercover officer” using an alias, attorney Bodoh said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In turning over the roster, though, undercover officers wouldn’t use their aliases. So what are departments trying to protect? After all, an occasional undercover cop who also patrols should give his </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">real</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> name and badge number when pulling someone over.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nor could I find instances where an undercover officer’s ID was revealed by news outlets or public-disclosure advocates that led to injury or death. Bodoh and Megan Rhyne, executive director for the Virginia Coalition for Open Government, said they weren’t aware of any incidents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting the personnel lists and salaries is “a basic measure of accountability,” Rhyne told me. “… We don’t have secret police forces.”</span></p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Virginia needs to stop treating its citizens like bad stepchildren&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2020/09/11/virginia-needs-to-stop-treating-its-citizens-like-bad-stepchildren/embed/#?secret=Yukza5nLID#?secret=46tCigXLQ5" data-secret="46tCigXLQ5" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This issue would be moot if public agencies in Virginia, including police departments, released more info about investigations and their decision-making process in the first place.</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2020/09/11/virginia-needs-to-stop-treating-its-citizens-like-bad-stepchildren/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">As I’ve written previously</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, many disseminate only what’s mandated. They routinely withhold what’s discretionary – often to the point of absurdity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This posture reveals a certain contempt for the press and the public in Virginia, especially at a time when so many newspapers in the state have closed or jettisoned staff members. Northwestern’s Medill School of Journalism, Media, Integrated Marketing Communications</span><a href="https://www.axios.com/local/richmond/2023/12/04/virginias-newspaper-decline" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">reported Virginia had lost 23 local newspapers from 2005 to 2023</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Residents have tried to pick up some of the slack by filing FOIA requests. That’s especially critical when the details involve local government, police and school divisions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I hope the state appeals court will provide clarity that bolsters the state’s FOIA. The shame is justices have to rule on something public agencies should do willingly.</span></p>

State support for higher education </span><a href="https://www.schev.edu/Home/Components/News/News/501/16" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">increased 28%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the past five years, alongside greater investments in Advanced Placement classes and regional collaborations between community colleges and employees. It’s no surprise then that Virginia has earned accolades like </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/11/virginia-americas-top-state-for-business-nations-best-schools-solid-infrastructure.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CNBC&#8217;s top ranking for education</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. These achievements reflect the resilience and drive of our students, teachers, and administrators. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, these rankings obscure the fact that our K-12 education system is seriously lagging. Virginia had perhaps the </span><a href="https://cepr.harvard.edu/news/virginia-experienced-some-nation%E2%80%99s-biggest-drops-reading-and-math-scores-analysis-shows" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">greatest learning loss of any state</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> during the pandemic. Nationally, Virginia’s performance is average, and we fall significantly short in serving Black, Hispanic, and economically disadvantaged students. For example, the </span><a href="https://www.nationsreportcard.gov/profiles/stateprofile/overview/VA?sfj=NP&amp;chort=1&amp;sub=MAT&amp;sj=VA&amp;st=MN&amp;year=2022R3&amp;cti=PgTab_OT" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Assessment of Education Progress</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (NAEP) shows that Virginia’s average 4</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> grade reading score (214) is below the national average (216) while the gap between low-income students and others increased 10 points from 1998 to 2022. Moreover, </span><a href="https://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/subject/publications/stt2022/pdf/2023011VA8.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">35% of 8th graders are </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">below basic</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in math proficiency</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (including 59% of Black students and 50% of Hispanic students), meaning that a significant population of Virginia’s students are not prepared for meaningful choices in life, let alone to reach their full potential.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="OtmgW3wGAt"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/08/29/virginia-board-of-education-approves-changes-to-accreditation-accountability-systems/">Virginia Board of Education approves changes to accreditation, accountability systems</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Virginia Board of Education approves changes to accreditation, accountability systems&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/08/29/virginia-board-of-education-approves-changes-to-accreditation-accountability-systems/embed/#?secret=cYM7vnj1ft#?secret=OtmgW3wGAt" data-secret="OtmgW3wGAt" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new Virginia accountability system the Virginia Board of Education is putting in place is an opportunity to focus on improving Virginia students’ outcomes. Unlike Virginia’s traditional accreditation model, </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/08/29/virginia-board-of-education-approves-changes-to-accreditation-accountability-systems/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this complementary system</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> promises timely and transparent school and student performance data and raises our ambitions about what we should expect from our public schools. It empowers parents, clarifies achievement, and encourages school communities to unite around common improvement goals. While some have raised concerns that over half of Virginia’s schools could be deemed ‘off track’ by the new system, such ratings should fuel our ambition to together achieve higher standards and greater excellence. A state that has, for instance, six in ten of its Black students and half of its Hispanic students below basic is going to have a lot of schools off track under any meaningful accountability system. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new system’s emphasis on transparency, support for underserved student groups, and focus on advanced coursework and chronic absenteeism are vital steps forward to improve student learning and protect the civil rights of Virginia’s students. The Virginia accountability system has the potential to drive systemic change if leveraged effectively. What we’ve learned over the years here at the University of Virginia’s Partnership for Leadership in Education (UVA-PLE) highlights how such systems foster collective ownership across communities for improving outcomes. An accountability system like this can heighten attention to exemplars, guide resource allocation, and ignite collective actions towards improving outcomes, particularly for underserved students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve seen this across the country. For instance, in Colorado’s Boulder Valley School District, Alicia Sanchez Elementary received the state’s lowest accountability rating in 2018. In response, the district provided additional attention and resources to help the school implement data-informed strategies to boost collaboration, instructional delivery, and student well-being. As a result, </span><a href="https://www.bvsd.org/about/news/news-article/~board/district-news/post/alicia-sanchez-elementary-granted-highest-state-ranking-earns-governors-bright-spot-award" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the school in 2020 received the highest rating in the state and the Governor’s Bright Spot Award</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with notable acceleration in Black and Hispanic student achievement. Similarly, the district leveraged lessons from exemplars and challenges highlighted in the accountability system to heighten school support across the district, spurring the district to now </span><a href="https://www.the74million.org/article/which-school-districts-do-the-best-job-of-teaching-kids-to-read/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">outperform what demographics would expect</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, too few districts have rallied community support to improve student outcomes due to a lack of clear focus on this goal obscured by accreditation rankings that do not reflect the reality of school performance. Despite this, Danville Public Schools leaders were able to heighten attention to what it would take to accelerate student achievement due to strong leadership’s focus on the issue, their embrace of the state’s corrective action plan and locally developed ideas to heighten quality teacher instructional support, and a partnership with UVA-PLE. The </span><a href="https://www.danvilleva.gov/DocumentCenter/View/32359/23-24-Danville-Public-Schools-SOL-Test-Results" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">meaningful recent progress for students in Danville</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> demonstrates what could be possible with greater transparency and attention to student achievement across the state.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We must approach this accountability system with a forward-thinking mindset. It should drive leaders to invest in proven interventions, competitive teacher pay, and increased support for schools in line with recommendations from the state’s </span><a href="https://jlarc.virginia.gov/landing-2023-virginias-k-12-funding-formula.asp" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Any accountability system will have flaws and need improvement, but we can adapt over time based on learning from implementation to ensure the system recognizes schools that demonstrate exceptional growth, increases access to rigorous dual enrollment or internship opportunities and shines a light on where we must serve students better.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a civil rights issue. Ensuring the system ultimately increases equitable and excellent outcomes is an opportunity for bipartisan collaboration, collective innovation and a commitment to meeting every student’s needs.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For decades, American factories have been sending their wastewater to municipal sewage treatment plants across the country, which handle it along with the effluent from other industries, homes and businesses. At the other end of the process, the separated and dried-out solids are often delivered to farmers as free fertilizer. The land application of this “sewage sludge” has long been encouraged by environmental regulators as a way to deal with what would otherwise be a vexing waste disposal problem. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet not all of that wastewater, or the sludge that becomes fertilizer, is benign. An increasing number of industries discharge effluent laced with toxic per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), which most treatment plants aren’t equipped to remove. PFAS are notoriously long-lasting, so much so that they are nicknamed “forever chemicals.” And now some states are finding that PFAS-laced sewage sludge is contaminating farmland and </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/21/climate/farm-pfas-meat-poison-sewage-sludge.html?unlocked_article_code=1.MU4.49KT.7DApop-_3wl1&amp;smid=url-share" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">poisoning consumers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PFAS are a relatively new class of synthetic chemical, </span><a href="https://www.manufacturingdive.com/news/the-history-behind-forever-chemicals-pfas-3m-dupont-pfte-pfoa-pfos/698254/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">emerging commercially</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the 1950s to find their way into a wide range of useful products, including non-stick pans (</span><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9071322/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">most notoriously</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Teflon), waterproof clothing, stain-resistant fabrics and firefighting chemicals. Unfortunately, exposure to PFAS has been shown to cause an almost equally-wide range of environmental and human health </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7906952/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">harms</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, including cancer, kidney disease, thyroid disease, reproductive problems and obesity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After years of foot-dragging, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency finally </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/pfas-forever-chemicals-pollution-epa-superfund-2a88bfb2ae4b3bb2f0d23a0686b8e99a" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">took action</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> against two early types of PFAS that had already fallen out of use, </span><a href="https://www.ewg.org/news-insights/news/2024/04/what-theyre-saying-about-epas-regulation-forever-chemicals-drinking" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">setting drinking water standards</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for those and a few others. At the same time, however, chemical companies have been turning out literally </span><a href="https://peer.org/commentary-epas-whack-a-mole-forever-chemicals-posture-is-an-intolerable-failure/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">thousands of new iterations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that have been little studied and remain largely unregulated. PFAS have become so ubiquitous in the environment that scientists estimate </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/28/health/pfas-testing-guidelines-wellness/index.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">98% of Americans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — and even some </span><a href="https://news.emory.edu/stories/2023/09/hs_PFAS_in_newborns_14-09-2023/story.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">newborns </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">— have detectable levels in their blood.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In recent years, public health advocates have started to worry that PFAS may also be entering our food supply via the sewage sludge applied to farmland. </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/31/climate/pfas-fertilizer-sludge-farm.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the New York Times, five states – Texas, Michigan, New York, Maine and Tennessee – have detected PFAS on farmland treated with sewage sludge, sometimes in high levels. Crops grown in contaminated soil absorb the chemicals and pass them up the food chain. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Maine and Michigan, officials shut down farms after finding high concentrations of PFAS in the soil and in the meat of grazing animals. Maine officials </span><a href="https://www.mainepublic.org/environment-and-outdoors/2023-02-01/more-than-50-maine-farms-impacted-by-pfas-but-state-officials-see-glimmer-of-hope" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">found contamination</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on 56 farms and in 23% of more than 1,500 groundwater samples taken from farms and residences. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2022, Maine banned the use of sewage sludge on agricultural land and prohibited most uses of PFAS in consumer products starting in 2030. The state is now working with affected farmers to </span><a href="https://www.pressherald.com/2024/03/19/maine-pfas-fund-fields-first-farm-buyout-request/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">compensate them</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or find alternative uses for contaminated land. Officials note that the testing programs are just beginning and fear that they may be seeing only the tip of the iceberg. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The New York Times did not include Virginia among the states known to have PFAS-contaminated farmland. That’s not because we don’t have a problem. Rather, it’s because the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ), which issues permits to municipal wastewater treatment plants, doesn’t require sludge to be tested. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What little we do know is cause for concern. The conservation group </span><a href="https://wildvirginia.org/our-programs/preventing-pfas-pollution/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wild Virginia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> analyzed data submitted to DEQ in 2022 by a small number of drinking water and wastewater treatment plants that voluntarily tested their effluent. Limited and incomplete as it was, the information </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlfIknLbJJs" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">revealed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that 20 of the 21 wastewater treatment plants that tested for PFAS found significant concentrations in their effluent. Only 8 of the plants also tested their sludge, but all 8 reported significant concentrations of PFAS. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I talked by phone with David Sligh, Wild Virginia’s c</span>onservation director <span style="font-weight: 400;">and a former DEQ employee, who told me the group plans to publish a report on this problem in the coming week. DEQ, he said, has the authority to regulate PFAS in treatment plants’ effluent and sludge and should be doing so to protect the public. His group has joined other members of the </span><a href="https://vcnva.org/agenda-item/stopping-pfas-at-its-source/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Conservation Network</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in calling on DEQ “to place the responsibility and cost of cleaning up PFAS on the industries that use and manufacture PFAS by requiring PFAS disclosure, monitoring, and limits in pollution discharge permits.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DEQ, however, seems to be in no hurry. Neil Zahradka, manager of the land applications program at DEQ, wrote in an email to Tyla Matteson, a Sierra Club volunteer who works on sewage sludge issues, “To date, DEQ has relied upon the EPA biennial reviews to determine if additional regulation of biosolids is necessary beyond that contained in current permits, and no additional limits or criteria for PFAS have been set. … [A]ccording to the EPA PFAS Strategic Roadmap, they plan to complete the risk assessment for PFAS in biosolids this year.  We do plan to update the DEQ biosolids fact sheet once we have additional substantive information to offer landowners.”</span></p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Three interesting bills: declawing cats, sewage regulations and on-duty physicians&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/03/08/three-interesting-bills-declawing-cats-sewage-regulations-and-on-duty-physicians/embed/#?secret=0lkUwvvNmj#?secret=fUF0nnw6HF" data-secret="fUF0nnw6HF" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Waiting for EPA to act first is convenient, but it does a grave disservice to Virginians. EPA itself has stalled for so long that Potomac Riverkeeper, Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility (PEER) and other groups finally sued the agency this year for its failure to regulate PFAS in sewage sludge used as fertilizer. </span><a href="https://peer.org/epa-flees-pfas-biosolids-contamination-crisis/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to PEER</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, EPA identified 10 different types of PFAS among some 250 pollutants contaminating sewage sludge, yet insists it is only obligated to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">identify</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the toxics in sewage sludge, not </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">do anything</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about it. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I suspect EPA and DEQ’s hesitance is due to the fear of what they would find in any extensive testing program. If testing confirmed widespread contamination in sewage sludge, DEQ would – one hopes – feel obligated to stop the practice of spreading it across the farms that produce our food. After all, if you identify a poison in your product, the answer is probably not to spread it among as many people as possible. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Annoying as it would be for DEQ, industry and even farmers to learn the truth, though, the alternative is worse. PFAS </span><a href="https://cen.acs.org/environment/persistent-pollutants/Getting-PFAS-drinking-water/102/i20" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">can be removed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, either in the wastewater treatment process or, ideally, before it leaves its industrial source. Not testing and treating means needlessly exposing farmers, their families and their animals – and ultimately all the rest of us – to chemicals that have no safe level of exposure. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given what we know about the harms PFAS causes, DEQ’s inaction is inexcusable. If Maine can tackle this threat to its land and people, surely Virginia can do it as well. We should expect no less.</span></p>

(Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In elections, the most important thing is who shows up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What makes things interesting in a democratically elected republic is that “who shows up” can vary wildly from election to election based on recent events plus economic and societal conditions and which party and candidates get the blame (or credit) for them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s about to play out in another presidential race in Virginia, a state that in many ways is a political and demographic microcosm of the nation as a whole.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s rural areas vote overwhelmingly Republican and its major cities and suburbs, mostly in the eastern third of the state, usually back Democrats and have the population numbers to determine an election’s outcome.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That leaves us to ponder events and circumstances influencing voters in Virginia’s vastly different regions and cultures. Let’s start with recent events, which couldn’t be more bizarre.</span></p>
<p><b>In June, </b>a<span style="font-weight: 400;"> frail-looking, seemingly confused octogenarian President Joe Biden performed so poorly in a  debate with Donald Trump, the former president he defeated 3 ½ years earlier, that Americans were shocked and Democrats were panicked.</span></p>
<p><b>On July 13</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a would-be assassin’s bullet grazed Trump’s ear during a campaign rally in rural Pennsylvania. Days later, a defiant Trump basked in rapturous ovations when he appeared at the Republican National Convention with a bandaged right ear.</span></p>
<p><b>By the end of July</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, with Democrats in abject despair and Biden’s poll numbers sinking, the president acquiesced to growing calls to quit the race and threw his support behind his vice president, Kamala Harris.</span></p>
<p><b>In August, </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats were instantly buoyed by the switch and the Democratic National Convention imbued them with fresh optimism. Online donations soared and poll numbers rebounded as her candidacy energized previously apathetic Democratic constituencies, particularly women, minority and young voters.</span></p>
<p><b>The Sept. 10 </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">second presidential campaign debate did not go well for Trump. Harris toyed with the former president’s vanity and deftly baited him into dismaying diatribes about crowd sizes at his rallies and false </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/us-news/springfield-ohio-pet-eating-claims-haitian-migrants-04598d48" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">claims</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, devouring family pets. Minutes afterward, global pop megastar Taylor Swift endorsed Harris.</span></p>
<p><b>The next day, </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Springfield’s Republican</span><a href="https://www.springfieldnewssun.com/news/springfield-leaders-reject-recent-wild-haitian-rumors-focus-on-few-key-problems/B7523FC6BVGYRNQDX7LXK3NVKM/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">mayor,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">the city’s police chief</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and Ohio’s Republican Governor, Mike DeWine, felt compelled to publicly and forcefully reject the pet-eating claims and call upon Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, to renounce them. DeWine</span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-vance-haitian-immigrants-springfield-ohio-threats-d74b7ff56f9a45d9389d8ebee4af1652" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">ordered Ohio State Police</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> into Springfield to help with unrest and threats that have arisen from the unsubstantiated rumors.</span></p>
<p><b>A little over week ago</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a second</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/09/18/ryan-routh-trump-suspect/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">assassination attempt</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> against Trump was foiled after Secret Service agents spotted a rifle barrel protruding from undergrowth surrounding the Trump-owned Florida course where he was playing golf.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s the stuff of a Franz Kafka fever dream — strange news bulletins that stand out even in these strange times — but it all happened, leaving us to ponder what unimaginable twists await in the 42 days and a wake-up until the election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those events exist atop longer-term issues, and the issue most on voters’ minds is the economy and inflation, according to poll after poll. They show that Trump holds a significant advantage on that issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harris, however, has found traction by moving the visceral issue of abortion rights to the forefront in ways Biden never could. No poll ranks it as high as the economy, but it’s an exceptionally persuasive issue among women, particularly moderates in urban and suburban areas where Democrats win when turnouts are strong.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A recent</span><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1K91JQDiVF7qVkjPUP3EPOt1a1cxlEDzo4euc2_0iiac/edit?gid=1733607470#gid=1733607470" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">statewide poll</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the Washington Post and the</span><a href="https://schar.gmu.edu/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Schar School of Policy and Government</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at George Mason University showed Harris leading Trump among likely Virginia voters by 8 percentage points, a margin outside the survey’s margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. Among women, Harris’s lead grows to 19 points.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="DkYpg3JMQ0"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/new-polling-finds-harris-ahead-of-trump-by-a-comfortable-margin-in-virginia/">New polling finds Harris ahead of Trump by a comfortable margin in Virginia</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;New polling finds Harris ahead of Trump by a comfortable margin in Virginia&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/new-polling-finds-harris-ahead-of-trump-by-a-comfortable-margin-in-virginia/embed/#?secret=X4fpgmMSiF#?secret=DkYpg3JMQ0" data-secret="DkYpg3JMQ0" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Harris’ chief advantage in Virginia is Trump himself. Every time he appeared on the ballot and throughout his presidency, he was poisonous to GOP candidates in Virginia, said Mark Rozell, a political science professor and dean of the Schar School.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Virginia voters rejected him soundly twice, and when he was in the White House they rejected Republican candidates all over the commonwealth. Only when Trump was out of the White House and looked to be politically finished in 2021 did it become acceptable for many swing voters in Virginia to vote Republican again,” Rozell said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump lost Virginia’s 13 electoral college votes by 5 percentage points to Hillary Clinton in 2016, when home-state U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine was her running mate, and by 10 points four years later to Biden and Harris. In between those elections, Democrat Ralph Northam routed Republican Ed Gillespie in the 2017 governor’s race and Democrats won majorities in the Virginia Senate and House of Delegates plus seven of its 11 U.S. House seats while retaining both U.S. Senate seats.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Things changed once Trump seemed banished to Mar-a-Lago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State Department of Election data from the</span><a href="https://historical.elections.virginia.gov/elections/view/144567/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">2020 presidential race</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the</span><a href="https://historical.elections.virginia.gov/elections/view/147466/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">2021 gubernatorial race</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> shows how dramatically the partisan polarity of Virginia shifted in the year after Trump left Washington.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the 2020 election, Biden took 54% of the Virginia vote to Trump’s 44%. Few imagined that in 2021, behind a former investment fund executive with zero experience in elective politics, Republicans would boost their share of the vote by 6.6% while the Democrats’ share fell by 5.5% — a remarkable net partisan migration of just over 12 points.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Glenn Youngkin accurately read and leveraged voter frustration with Democrats who then held all the levers of power in Virginia and the White House as the nation struggled to emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic. He also avoided being </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trumped</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The GOP nominating process in 2021 rejected a Trump extremist,” Rozell said, referring to former state Sen. Amanda Chase, “and Youngkin ran a middle-right campaign that kept a smart strategic distance from the former president.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Again, the data comparison of 2021 to the previous year is telling. Republicans won 99 of the commonwealth’s 133 localities in Youngkin’s 2021 victory, including a dozen where Democrats won in 2020. In the 34 the GOP didn’t win, Youngkin narrowed Democrats’ margins enough that a powerful rural turnout by conservatives was decisive. In 93 localities, the GOP share of the 2021 vote improved by 5% or more year over year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, Rozell notes, that was then.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The GOP triumphs in 2021 do not portend a competitive race in Virginia this year. The problem for the GOP in Virginia is Trump,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which brings us back to recent events and how Virginians perceive them. Traveling with alt-right conspiracy theorist</span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/13/us/politics/who-is-laura-loomer.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Laura Loomer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in his campaign entourage and comments about</span><a href="https://youtu.be/V5CR7HkByC4?feature=shared" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">pet-eating immigrants</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and “</span><a href="https://youtu.be/SYRd0s6xBDY?feature=shared" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">childless cat ladies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” from those who seek control of the nation’s nuclear arsenal may rouse Trump’s base, but they dissuade unaligned moderates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Trump&#8217;s disastrous debate performance and close associations with far-right extremists such as Loomer just remind swing voters in Virginia why they rejected him every time in the past,” Rozell said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or, as William Faulkner wrote, “The past is never dead. It’s not even past.”</span></p>

It’s a critical investment in Virginia’s health care workforce, and one that all of us should be celebrating — but there’s an opportunity for further action. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ve likely heard of CHWs over the last few years. They are making </span><a href="https://richmondmagazine.com/life-style/health/community-health-workers/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">headlines</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for all the right reasons. For one, these frontline health professionals played an outsized role in reducing vaccine hesitancy and connecting people to resources during the pandemic. </span></p>

(Health Brigade)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CHWs are public health professionals who come from or have an unusually close understanding of the communities they serve. They help patients access important safety net services like food, housing and transportation assistance – all factors that contribute to a person’s wellbeing. In short, they support people so they can comfortably and confidently navigate health care settings by leveraging their personal experiences.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Raeann Ramshaw, a CHW at Ballad Health System in Southwest Virginia, is just one example. Every day is different, but she frequently helps people navigate SNAP paperwork, find rental assistance or access specialty medical programs in her hometown.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Community health centers, nonprofits and local health districts are seeing the value of CHWs and are increasingly integrating them into care teams. Today, there are nearly 1,300 CHWs across Virginia, including approximately 290 certified CHWs who have completed substantial training supervision and education requirements.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CHWs are invaluable assets to the communities they serve. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the federal government recognized their importance and provided funding to support them. Now, it is crucial we ensure sustained long-term funding.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a logical solution: to bill CHW services through Virginia’s Medicaid program. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the years, the federal government has created </span><a href="https://www.astho.org/topic/brief/leveraging-medicaid-to-support-community-health-workers/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">several pathways</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for billing CHW supports through Medicaid. Currently, </span><a href="https://nashp.org/state-tracker/state-community-health-worker-policies/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">15 state Medicaid plans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> authorize coverage for CHW services, which are designed to improve health outcomes and save program costs. Five states cover CHW services through Medicaid waivers, which allow states to test innovative ideas to improve health. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Collaborating with Gov. Glenn Youngkin and his administration as well as members of the legislature on a comprehensive strategy is essential to secure this funding, which is vital for the viability of the CHW workforce and the health of our communities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a focus on improving the health and well-being of Virginians through access to high-quality health care coverage and services, the state’s Medicaid program already covers care from doctors and nurses. Including reimbursements for CHWs, who are often on these care teams, is the missing link.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a wise investment because we know CHW interventions work, and we have local data to prove it.  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ballad Health was one of five health care organizations across the country to participate in a </span><a href="https://www.pcori.org/research-results/2019/expanding-use-impact-community-health-worker-program" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that examined the impact of CHWs. Researchers found patients who were connected to CHWs experienced 29% fewer hospital stays than patients who were not connected to them.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The study mirrors </span><a href="https://www.pennmedicine.org/news/news-releases/2020/february/penns-community-health-worker-program-yields-247-for-every-1-invested-annually-by-medicaid" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">previous research</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that shows for every dollar invested in CHW programs, Medicaid payers see a $2.47 return on investment within a year, generated through reduced hospitalizations.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While calculating the costs of avoidable hospital visits can be hard to measure, helping patients access care outside of emergency rooms for non-emergency care can save people and our state millions of dollars. One analysis by </span><a href="https://www.vhi.org/Media/flyers/Potentially%20Avoidable%20ED%20Visits.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Health Information</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2020 showed the total cost of avoidable emergency room visits for symptoms like urinary tract infections, back problems and upper respiratory infections was more than $75 million, compared to $8 million for similar care at a primary care provider.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to reducing health care costs and improving patient care, CHWs are an important part of the solution. CHWs are making so much progress  in the commonwealth because they go above and beyond every day to support people and disrupt health disparities.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the Mount Rogers health district, Grace Lowe works throughout the community sharing information about free NARCAN trainings, while also helping families connect with Medicaid, WIC and other important programs. You can regularly find her at local events and fairs because she is focused on building a foundation of trust when it comes to accessing health care and safety net resources.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than four hours away, CHW Emely Baez Salazar visits with Latino community members and encourages them to access health services at Health Brigade. Her outreach is helping connect dozens of new people with comprehensive care at the free clinic.  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s CHWs know the challenges of their communities and are equipped to work with their local health care system to create solutions. I’m immensely grateful that they’re such a prominent part of our healthcare safety net. CHWs are essential, and it’s just as essential we find sustainable funding solutions to help them continue making progress. The health of Virginians depends on it.</span></p>

(Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drill down far enough into the earth, and you will hit hot rocks. Energy companies have used this heat to generate carbon-free electricity for </span><a href="https://web.mit.edu/nature/archive/student_projects/2009/bjorn627/TheGeothermalCity/History.html#:~:text=In%201904%2C%20Prince%20Piero%20Ginori,This%20plant%20is%20still%20operating." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more than a century</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It’s an elegant concept, but it worked only where pockets of heat lay close to the surface, accompanied by steam ready-made to turn turbines. Those limitations confined geothermal power plants to geologically active areas like Iceland, parts of Indonesia, and a few locations in the American West. As of 2023, geothermal energy made up </span><a href="https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/geothermal/use-of-geothermal-energy.php" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">less than half of 1%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of U.S. electricity generation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suddenly, that is changing. </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/apr/02/geothermal-energy-electricity" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">New technology</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> derived from oil and gas fracking methods is allowing energy companies to drill deep into the earth in places far from geologic activity. Wells can reach miles beneath the surface before branching out horizontally and creating fissures in hard, hot rock. Water injected into the wells comes back to the surface as steam to generate electricity. The steam is recaptured and re-injected to take up heat again, in a virtuous cycle powered by the earth itself. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The benefits</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These “enhanced geothermal” systems can produce 24/7 baseload electricity or fill in around variable sources like wind and solar. They can even be used like batteries to store energy, including for long durations.  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike drilling for fossil fuels, geothermal companies avoid the shale formations that hold hydrocarbons, instead targeting non-porous rock. And since the product is not fossil fuel but steam, the technology produces zero-carbon energy without toxic or radioactive waste. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Freed from geographic limitations and using the same technology and workforce as the oil and gas industry, geothermal energy is ready to take off fast. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) sees it spreading across the country to provide </span><a href="https://liftoff.energy.gov/next-generation-geothermal-power/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">as much as 125 gigawatts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (GW) of electricity by 2050. A global estimate suggests the industry could eventually produce </span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0306261920312551#:~:text=Potential%20of%20enhanced%20geothermal%20systems,256%20GWe%20in%202050." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">4,600 GW</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of electricity at a cost of 50 euros (around $55) per megawatt-hour or less.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2022 DOE launched an “</span><a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/geothermal/enhanced-geothermal-systems" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earthshot Initiative</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” to reduce the cost of enhanced geothermal energy in the U.S. to $45 per megawatt-hour (MWh) by 2035. If successful, that would put it </span><a href="https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Lazard-LCOE-Levelized-Cost-of-Energy-renewable-energy-version-17.png" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">at or below</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the cost of any other new, dispatchable energy source. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is this technology the answer to the surging demand for electricity from data centers and artificial intelligence? And could it allow Virginia to keep adding data centers without blowing up its climate goals?</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The challenges</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We do have to keep in mind that not all silver bullets prove to be sterling. Small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs) are </span><a href="https://ieefa.org/resources/small-modular-reactors-still-too-expensive-too-slow-and-too-risky#:~:text=SMRs%20still%20are%20too%20expensive,coming%2010%20to%2015%20years." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">evidence</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that some highly-anticipated technologies don’t follow the rosy timelines and price projections their boosters promise. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike SMRs, though, enhanced geothermal systems have already achieved commercial deployment. After </span><a href="https://eartharxiv.org/repository/view/5704/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">successfully demonstrating</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the technology with a 3.5 MW pilot facility,  </span><a href="https://fervoenergy.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fervo Energy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> signed a contract last year with </span><a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/sustainability/google-fervo-geothermal-energy-partnership/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to provide electricity for its data centers from a 115-MW enhanced geothermal power plant in </span><a href="https://fervoenergy.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevada</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Fervo will deliver the power to the local utility, NV Energy, which will then charge a slightly higher price to Google via a </span><a href="https://ob.nv.gov/PUC/api/Document/AUVtXfg9PCPGv6AN5IUcwlkqU2FOoopJ88kv9f6OWMnjzuFpY1bQJgc%C3%89Pfmr%C3%89og%C3%81qn0Ejg4YBd7GEPUO%C3%89aDWxjE=/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">proposed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> new </span><a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/google-fervo-nv-energy-nevada-puc-clean-energy-tariff/719472/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“clean transition tariff.”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Fervo has also signed a deal for an even bigger project that will deliver 400 MW to California utilities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using a different fracking-based technology it calls a “Geopressured Geothermal System,” Houston-based </span><a href="https://www.sagegeosystems.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sage Geosystems</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> recently </span><a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/geothermal/sage-geosystems-and-meta-sign-150mw-geothermal-power-agreement" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">agreed to supply 150 MW</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of power for Meta’s data centers beginning in 2027. Sage says it can make electricity not just by extracting heat but also by using pressure, an add-on technology that allows it to offer energy storage independent of steam production. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both Fervo and Sage say their methods can be used almost anywhere, and both cite advantages over established energy sources. Like wind and solar, geothermal is renewable and carbon-free, but it isn’t dependent on weather. It also doesn’t require fuel sources like coal and gas that are highly polluting and sometimes </span><a href="https://rmi.org/reality-check-keeping-the-lights-on-in-extreme-winter-weather/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">unreliable in extreme weather</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, with a small physical footprint relative to the energy produced, geothermal facilities could be located in urban areas or next to data centers and other large customers without the need for major new transmission lines. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But of course, the fact that geothermal technology can be used </span><a href="https://www.nrel.gov/geothermal/anywhere.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">anywhere</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> does not mean it can be deployed profitably everywhere, or at least not yet. A </span><a href="https://www.nrel.gov/geothermal/resource-assessment-mapping.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">map</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> compiled by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory shows the most ideal areas are still in the West, where hot rocks lie within a few kilometers of the Earth’s surface. In most of the eastern U.S., deeper wells would be needed to reach the same temperatures. For this reason, DOE sees the technology proving out in the West first before spreading east.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Use in Virginia?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But favorability is not purely a function of geology, according to Ben Serrurier, manager of government affairs and policy at Fervo. I wanted to know how soon geothermal systems could start providing electricity to the world’s largest concentration of data centers, in Northern Virginia. He said the biggest impediment for the industry is not location, but the high cost of capital and the paucity of government support compared to SMRs, hydrogen, and other new technologies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In spite of these challenges, Serrurier predicted geothermal would be deployed in Virginia by the latter part of the 2030s, noting that his company is already ahead of DOE’s projected timeline for the technology’s maturation. Eastern data centers present an especially attractive market, he said, because demand is increasing so quickly, and utilities have limited options for carbon-free energy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alas, observers of the data center industry know that while renewable energy is nice to have, cheap energy is even nicer. So I wanted to talk about cost.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Serrurier told me Fervo’s first project will deliver power to NV Energy at a price of $107 per MWh, and Google will pay slightly more than that to the utility. That is twice DOE’s target cost for 2035, yet it still puts the price below the U.S average of 13.1 cents per kilowatt-hour ($131 per MWh) for commercial customers, and competitive with the average Nevada commercial rate of 10.92 cents, </span><a href="https://www.eia.gov/electricity/monthly/epm_table_grapher.php?t=epmt_5_6_a" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Energy Information Agency data.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That price is, however, more than the 9.54 cents/kWh that the average commercial customer in Virginia pays for electricity derived primarily from fossil fuels. And Fervo’s price is for drilling in the West, not in the less favorable geology of the East.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But heck, anywhere in the country, 10.7 cents for zero-carbon baseload power — with no waste to be cleaned up and no added healthcare costs from pollution — still sounds compelling. Google may have chosen to be a first mover in order to show leadership and promote a new technology, but it is also locking in a solid deal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sage does not make its costs public, but Lance Cook, the company’s chief technical officer, told me their process is competitive with combined cycle gas plants when the cost of fossil gas is above $6 per thousand cubic feet. (According to the Energy Information Agency, the price of gas is </span><a href="https://www.eia.gov/dnav/ng/ng_pri_sum_a_EPG0_PEU_DMcf_a.htm" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">currently</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> below that level in most states, though gas prices are famously volatile.) </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An additional benefit, said Cook, is that a geothermal plant could be co-located with a data center, foregoing a grid connection and obviating the need for transmission lines. “We can turn electricity into data,” he told me. “It is much easier to connect data than to wait for a grid connection.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both Cook and Serrurier are confident that geothermal will beat new nuclear  price-wise, which today sounds like a safe bet. </span><a href="https://www.woodmac.com/press-releases/nuclear-needs-to-be-cost-competitive-with--alternative-power-generation-to-enable-net-zero/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Analysts warn</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that cost continues to be a significant issue for the nuclear industry. </span><a href="https://www.lazard.com/research-insights/levelized-cost-of-energyplus/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Current projections</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the cost of electricity from SMRs start at $142/MWh. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cook noted that Sage’s technology can also provide long-duration energy storage that isn’t dependent on the heat of the earth. This approach can be used anywhere to turn solar and wind power into baseload energy. Sage’s website claims it can achieve this for less than the cost of batteries or pumped hydro. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With all this promise, enhanced geothermal has been slow to catch the attention of Virginia utilities and policy-makers. The Virginia Code includes geothermal energy in its definition of renewable energy, but enhanced geothermal is not on the list of energy sources that qualify for the state’s renewable portfolio standard (RPS). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The General Assembly did pass </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=Sb508" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this year from Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, to include a similarly-named, but quite different, kind of geothermal energy – geothermal heating and cooling systems, also known as ground-source heat pumps – in the RPS. </span><a href="https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/geothermal-heat-pumps" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Geothermal heat pumps</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> use the near-constant temperature of the ground just a few feet under our feet to help heat and cool buildings, much as air-source heat pumps do but with greater efficiency. A working group under the auspices of the State Corporation Commission is currently trying to figure out how to award renewable energy certificates (RECs) for a technology that does not produce electricity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But drilling down two miles or more and generating electricity at the utility level is quite another thing. Making enhanced geothermal systems eligible for the RPS would be essential to putting the technology on an even footing with other renewables for use in Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an email, Surovell told me, “I have read about the Google geothermal project and believe there is significant potential in Virginia.I understand it is different, but we need to do all we can to try to meet the demand for energy created by data centers without upsetting the carbon-free goals we set with the Virginia Clean Energy Act.” He added, “Geothermal also has the potential to create thousands of well-paying trade jobs in drilling and pipefitting in the Commonwealth.”  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I also contacted Dominion Energy Virginia to gauge the utility’s level of interest. Dominion is facing an enormous challenge to meet the </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/28/virginia-explained-data-center-expansion-with-all-its-challenges-and-benefits/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">explosion of demand</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from data centers. Its </span><a href="https://cdn-dominionenergy-prd-001.azureedge.net/-/media/pdfs/global/company/2023-va-integrated-resource-plan.pdf?la=en&amp;rev=8e5047ba283b4b9bb5e17c41b3544564" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2023 integrated resource plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (IRP) proposed building new gas plants as early as 2028 and an SMR in 2034, but no geothermal energy. The plan </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/05/10/law-what-law-pandering-to-the-governor-dominions-new-plan-ignores-virginias-climate-law/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">failed to meet</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the carbon-cutting requirements of Virginia law, so the company ought to see the need to up its game for its 2024 IRP, due in October. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion’s answer was not encouraging. Aaron Ruby, Dominion’s director of Virginia and offshore wind media, responded with an email that made reference to the working group for geothermal heat pump RECs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re certainly looking at the potential for geothermal in Virginia. The SCC is leading a geothermal working group, and there are lots of knowledgeable experts taking a close look. Most of the potential in Virginia appears to be geothermal heat pumps, with maybe less potential for power generation. The process is ongoing, so still more to learn.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Echoing Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/07/19/youngkin-speaks-about-energy-plan-ahead-of-update-in-coming-weeks/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rhetoric </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">on energy, he added, “As you know, we’re experiencing an unprecedented growth in power demand. Reliably serving that growth requires an ‘all of the above’ approach, including offshore wind, solar, battery storage, next generation nuclear and natural gas. Emerging technologies like clean hydrogen, longer-duration storage and geothermal could also play a role.”</span><b> </b><b> </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not a great sign that Dominion ranks geothermal dead last. The company seems quite content to keep adding data centers to its customer base with no plan to meet its climate commitments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data center developers, on the other hand, could vote with their metaphorical feet. If Dominion will not bring geothermal technology to Virginia data centers, maybe the data centers will go to the geothermal technology. Why, after all, should they face public opposition and rising electricity rates in Virginia when they can go to Utah, Nevada or Texas to access low-cost, zero-carbon energy delivered 24/7 from a source that might even be located onsite? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Especially since, in so doing, they would provide the capital and demand required for enhanced geothermal to achieve DOE’s goals ahead of time, and hasten the day when Dominion presents an IRP with a real zero-carbon plan.  </span></p>

<p>Over time, the shape and size of these helmets have gradually changed, from the <a href="https://historicsportscollectibles.com/" target="_blank">leather head coverings</a> of the early 20th century to the <a href="https://content.riddell.com/Axiom/" target="_blank">space-age plastic domes</a> we’re accustomed to seeing today.</p>
<p>But the visual profiles of some NFL football helmets may change drastically in 2024. The league has approved the in-game use of padded helmet accessories known as Guardian Caps, which, according to the NFL, “can reduce the force from head contact” <a href="https://www.nfl.com/news/nfl-to-give-players-option-to-wear-guardian-caps-during-regular-season-games" target="_blank">by up to 20%</a>.</p>
<p>A backlash has already begun. Some players have <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/34313193/feel-bobblehead" target="_blank">complained that the devices are unwieldy</a>. And both fans and players have blanched at how the blocky accessory <a href="https://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/Articles/2024/08/19/nfl-guardian-caps?publicationSource=sbd&amp;issue=208d5f5ece8341dc81fccda364fc0570" target="_blank">makes players’ heads seem disproportionately large</a>.</p>
<p>Because I’m working on <a href="https://noahcohan.com/" target="_blank">a cultural history of the football helmet</a>, I’m eager to see what transpires.</p>
<p>In a multibillion-dollar sport in which <a href="https://slate.com/culture/2023/11/football-helmet-safety-innovation-design.html" target="_blank">the helmet is the preeminent branding space and symbol of the game</a>, what happens when the imperative of player safety conflicts with its visual appeal?</p>
<p>We’re about to find out.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">From the practice field to the playing field</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Affixed to the outside of players’ existing helmets via snaps and Velcro straps, <a href="https://guardiansports.com/guardian-caps/" target="_blank">Guardian Caps</a> consist of a series of soft, rectilinear pads connected by fabric.</p>
<p>After the caps were introduced in 2010, some college and pro teams gradually adopted them during practices. In 2022, the <a href="https://guardiansports.com/2022/04/06/nfl-mandates-guardian-caps/" target="_blank">NFL began requiring their use in preseason practices</a>. At first, only linemen and linebackers were required to wear them. By 2024, the league mandated <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/33620788/seeking-reduce-head-contact-nfl-nflpa-mandate-use-guardian-cap-helmet-early-portion-training-camp" target="_blank">all players except quarterbacks and kickers wear them</a> while practicing. In April 2024, the league announced that players <a href="https://www.nfl.com/news/nfl-to-give-players-option-to-wear-guardian-caps-during-regular-season-games" target="_blank">could wear them in regular season games</a> at their discretion.</p>
<p>There seems to be good reason to encourage their use. Using data collected from all 32 teams, the league found that the devices <a href="https://www.nfl.com/news/nfl-to-give-players-option-to-wear-guardian-caps-during-regular-season-games" target="_blank">reduce the impact force of head-on-head collisions</a> by 20% when both players involved wear the device, and 10% when one of the players is wearing one.</p>
<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/11/is-the-nfl-making-progress-tackling-its-concussion-crisis/" target="_blank">Some scholars have expressed skepticism</a> toward the NFL’s closely held research data. Nonetheless, the league claims that there’s been an <a href="https://www.nbcsports.com/nfl/profootballtalk/rumor-mill/news/nfl-says-positions-wearing-guardian-caps-saw-52-decrease-in-concussions" target="_blank">eye-popping decline of 52% in concussion incidence reporting</a> during preseason practices since the devices were mandated.</p>
<p>Touting the safety benefits of the Guardian Caps is an obvious public relations win for the NFL. <a href="https://www.bu.edu/cte/" target="_blank">Ongoing research into chronic traumatic encephalopathy</a>, or CTE, and other traumatic brain injuries continues to show just how much damage repeated blows to the head can do to the brain, with football players particularly vulnerable.</p>
<p>Many players <a href="https://www.indystar.com/story/sports/nfl/colts/2024/08/11/5-colts-wear-guardian-caps-including-jonathan-taylor-vs-broncos/74762096007/" target="_blank">have supported the league’s efforts</a> to put safety first, including Indianapolis Colts running back <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/T/TaylJo02.htm" target="_blank">Jonathan Taylor</a>, who became the first high-profile, skill-position player <a href="https://www.nfl.com/news/jonathan-taylor-among-colts-players-to-wear-guardian-caps-in-sunday-s-preseason-game" target="_blank">to wear a Guardian Cap</a> during a preseason game on Aug. 11, 2024.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Players object</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>But the story of Guardian Caps’ introduction is not an unfettered success – at least, not yet.</p>
<p>Though the standard-issue Guardian Caps <a href="https://guardiansports.com/guardian-caps/" target="_blank">weigh less than</a> 7 ounces (0.2 kilograms), many players find them <a href="https://www.profootballnetwork.com/miami-dolphins-guardian-caps-nfl-2024/" target="_blank">heavy and hot</a>.</p>
<p>“I hate them,” Seattle Seahawks defensive tackle <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/sports/seahawks/why-seahawks-are-wearing-padded-helmets-in-practice-and-possibly-games/?utm_source=pocket_shared" target="_blank">Jarran Reed told The Seattle Times</a>. “I understand the safety for them, but I’ve been playing a long time. It just looks crazy to me. I don’t like them. I’m ready to take them off.”</p>
<p>“I can’t stand them. It impacts my swag,” Philadelphia Eagles cornerback <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2024/aug/12/aesthetics-over-safety-nfl-players-weigh-benefits-/?utm_source=pocket_saves" target="_blank">Darius Slay told CBS Sports</a>. “My game is part of my swag. If I ain’t looking the part, I can’t feel the part.”</p>
<figure class="align-center "><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
<p>Obviously, in such a fast-paced and violent game, the tiniest margins – both physical and psychological – can make a difference in performance. And players like Reed, Slay and <a href="https://www.profootballnetwork.com/miami-dolphins-guardian-caps-nfl-2024/" target="_blank">at least</a> <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/sports/seahawks/why-seahawks-are-wearing-padded-helmets-in-practice-and-possibly-games/?utm_source=pocket_shared" target="_blank">a dozen</a> <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2024/aug/12/aesthetics-over-safety-nfl-players-weigh-benefits-/?utm_source=pocket_saves" target="_blank">others</a> don’t seem to be willing to sacrifice their ability to maximize on-field performance for incremental safety gains.</p>
<p>As important as such players’ objections to the feel and look of Guardian Caps may be, it may not be the most significant problem the NFL faces in their adoption.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Blemishing the brand</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Simply put, many fans think the <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/nfl/news-nfl-fans-react-new-guardian-cap-rules?utm_source=pocket_saves" target="_blank">Guardian Caps</a> <a href="https://athlonsports.com/nfl/nfl-fans-furious-over-recent-league-uniform-change?utm_source=pocket_saves" target="_blank">are</a> <a href="https://talksport.com/sport/1845153/nfl-rule-change-guardian-caps-helmet-concussion-controversy/" target="_blank">ugly</a>, even when they’ve been <a href="https://uni-watch.com/2024/07/28/chargers-commanders-have-custom-cap-covers/?utm_source=pocket_shared" target="_blank">covered with fabric</a> that mimics the look of the logos on the underlying plastic shell.</p>
<p>But why should the reaction of the fans matter? After all, they’re not the ones putting their health on the line.</p>
<p>What’s more, for the first 75 years of football history, most helmets were nondescript. Per football historian Timothy P. Brown, early helmets were constructed from plain leather in “various shades of brown or black, <a href="https://www.footballarchaeology.com/p/how-the-forward-pass-changed-the-color-of-football-helmets" target="_blank">so they all looked more or less alike</a>, as did many team uniforms.” It wasn’t until the 1940s and ’50s, <a href="https://content.riddell.com/history/" target="_blank">when sports equipment manufacturer Riddell’s early plastic models</a> began to gain popularity, that the helmet’s potential <a href="https://doi.org/10.1123/kr.2024-0037" target="_blank">as a canvas for decoration began to be realized</a>.</p>
<p>Yet so much of the NFL’s incredible success is premised on its visual appeal.</p>
<p>In the early 1960s, then-NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle observed that television, not ticket sales, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/08/sports/rozelle-s-nfl-legacy-television-marketing-and-money.html" target="_blank">would power football’s future financial success</a>. Helmet branding was a vital way <a href="https://www.toddradom.com/blog/fl-helmet-logos-licensing-giants-rams-eagles-cowboys" target="_blank">to promote and celebrate an NFL team’s identity</a>. For TV viewers, helmet logos would become only more crisp and colorful as broadcasting technology improved.</p>
<p>Today, the logos that first appeared on helmets in the mid-20th century have become the icons of <a href="https://www.forbes.com/lists/nfl-valuations/" target="_blank">multibillion-dollar brands</a> with <a href="https://www.si.com/nfl/2022/07/18/nfl-executive-outlines-mission-for-the-league" target="_blank">hundreds of millions of fans</a> around the world.</p>
<p>The negative impact the Guardian Caps have on the look of the game, and the importance of that look to the continued popularity of the game, have not gone unnoticed.</p>
<p>“Football is an extremely visual sport,” <a href="https://www.nbcsports.com/nfl/profootballtalk/rumor-mill/news/nfl-confirms-players-can-choose-to-wear-guardian-caps-during-games" target="_blank">Mike Florio of “Pro Football Talk” wrote</a>. “It thrives in large part because of how it looks on TV.”</p>
<p>“With sleek helmets coated in clumpy coverings that look like soundproofing panels, the vibe will be compromised,” he added.</p>
<p>Fortunately for Florio and others who dislike the look of the Guardian Cap, the NFL has already <a href="https://www.nfl.com/news/twelve-new-helmets-to-be-offered-to-players-for-2024-season" target="_blank">approved and encouraged the use of six new helmet models</a> that purportedly provide equivalent protection to those with the Guardian Cap affixed to them.</p>
<p><a href="https://vicis.com/products/zero2-trench-helmet?srsltid=AfmBOor3aFZArlxN2DAr-7QjFg6kHBis8XSJXFvs6fydi9iDsM624hqJ" target="_blank">These models</a> don’t exactly look like normal helmets, either. But they don’t look like Guardian Caps, and that could make all the difference.</p>

(Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to hyping phantom voter fraud – most recently by noncitizens reputedly casting ballots in presidential contests, which is already illegal – Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin keeps playing lapdog to Donald Trump. The former president’s lies about the subject have earned tacit support from Youngkin and other Republican officials in the run-up to the November election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They all know better. Shame on them for placating</span><a href="https://www.commoncause.org/press/in-major-setback-for-democracy-insurrectionist-is-allowed-to-stay-on-ballot/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">an insurrectionist</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a</span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-trial-deliberations-jury-testimony-verdict-85558c6d08efb434d05b694364470aa0" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">convicted felon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and someone whose</span><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2021/01/17/covid-19-us-400-000-deaths-experts-blame-trump-administration/6642685002/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">incompetent response to the COVID-19 pandemic</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> killed hundreds of thousands of Americans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember this: Trump was so incensed that he lost the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">popular</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> vote to Hillary Clinton in 2016 that he embarked on a</span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2017/05/17/voter-fraud-trumps-electoral-commission-is-the-real-fraud/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">discredited quest</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to uncover millions of undocumented immigrants who “all voted for Hillary,” he claimed. Trump’s biased commission ended with a whimper,</span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2018/01/05/voter-fraud-panel-was-a-sham-time-to-focus-on-real-challenges-of-security-access/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">after states refused to comply with the panel’s intrusive requests for voter data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and opponents complained the panel wasn’t open with the public about its work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I hesitated to write this column because it gives more oxygen to a lie about voting by noncitizens. Some noxious statements, though, must be repudiated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This lie is just the latest from the Republican Party, as it provides a ready excuse for Trump if he loses a second straight election. GOP leaders are priming the pump for chaos if Democratic Party nominee Kamala Harris wins.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/governor-of-virginia/pdf/eo/EO-35-Comprehensive-Election-Security-Ensuring-Legal-Voters-and-Accurate-Counting---vF---8.7.24.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin recently signed an executive order</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> codifying “election security” measures that were already in place in the commonwealth. He noted the state Department of Elections had removed 6,303 noncitizens from the voter rolls between January 2022 and July 2024.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump then praised Youngkin</span><a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/112922950918796711" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">on social media</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for “securing” November’s election in the state. By the way, Republican nominees haven’t carried Virginia since George W. Bush in 2004 – and Trump has already lost Virginia twice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No mention was made in the guv’s executive order of how many immigrants had purposely voted illegally, or whether some were confused and didn’t know it was against the law. I sought answers from the governor’s office, but a Youngkin spokesman didn’t return my calls and emails.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wanted to know, among other things, why Youngkin signed the executive order just months before the November election, and why he didn’t say how many of those thousands of people actually tried to vote. Were any charged with a crime?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican lawmakers, including Trump, have lied repeatedly that illegal immigrants are overrunning the polls. That’s simply not the case.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans know this, yet keep fanning the flames. We all saw how deceitfulness like that incited an insurrection on Jan. 6, 2021.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider this:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">         </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A study by the Heritage Foundation – the folks behind the ultraconservative, government-gutting</span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-is-project-2025-trump-conservative-blueprint-heritage-foundation/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Project 2025</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> –</span><a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/blog/four-things-to-know-about-noncitizen-voting/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">found just 24 cases of noncitizens</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> voting between 2003 and 2023. That’s an infinitesimal amount compared to the total number of votes cast.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">       </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/voting-immigrants-noncitizen-trump-republicans-2024-1c65429c152c2a10514b5156eacf9ca7" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Associated Press</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reported that Georgia officials in 2022 audited the state’s voter rolls looking for noncitizens. Some 1,634 had tried to register to vote over a period of 25 years,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">but election officials caught all the applications; none actually registered.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">         </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In North Carolina in 2016,</span><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dl.ncsbe.gov/sboe/Post-Election%20Audit%20Report_2016%20General%20Election/Post-Election_Audit_Report.pdf" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">an audit found 41 legal immigrants</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – not yet citizens – cast ballots, out of 4.8 million total votes. Not surprisingly, the votes made no difference in the results in any of the state’s elections.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">         </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The progressive</span><a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/noncitizen-voting-missing-millions" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Brennan Center for Justice</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> studied the prevalence of noncitizen voting, too. “Across 42 jurisdictions, election officials who oversaw the tabulation of 23.5 million votes in the 2016 general election referred only an estimated 30 incidents of suspected noncitizen voting for further investigation or prosecution,” it said. “[I]improper noncitizen votes accounted for 0.0001 percent of the 2016 votes in those jurisdictions.”</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your family wasted money at those minuscule rates, you’d be euphoric.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alice Clapman, Washington-based senior counsel for voting rights at the Brennan Center, told me Youngkin’s executive order feeds disinformation about voter fraud.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think it’s a disturbing pattern,” she said. Similar announcements have occurred recently in other states with Republican governors, including</span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/louisiana-noncitizens-voting-87e6199c8792eba4746ffabcf0d9f8a8" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Louisiana</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://www.sos.texas.gov/about/newsreleases/2024/081224-2.shtml" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Texas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The number of actual instances of noncitizen voting is vanishingly rare,” Clapman said, adding there’s a distinction between such people who register to vote, but then realize they can’t do so legally and stay away from the polls.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clapman also noted that it would be extremely risky for noncitizens to cast ballots. They could be imprisoned and deported.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, Youngkin has zero credibility on the issue of voting security and administration. He’s chosen partisanship over good governance repeatedly since taking office in early 2022.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2021/11/10/maybe-now-we-can-lay-the-election-integrity-talk-to-rest/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">He played coy during the gubernatorial party nomination</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> process about whether he agreed Joe Biden won the 2020 election – a litmus test for Trump supporters. He participated in a discredited</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/08/12/28460/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “election integrity” rally in Lynchburg</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s elections commissioner pulled Virginia out of what had been an</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/virginia-joins-republican-states-pulling-out-of-multi-state-voter-list-program/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">uncontroversial, multistate program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to share accurate voter rolls known as the Electronic Registration Information Center, or ERIC, after it was targeted</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/after-eric-withdrawal-virginia-strikes-deals-with-6-states-to-share-voter-data/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">by conservative activists</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and conspiracy theorists. The decision emboldened partisan hacks and quacks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A spokesman with the state Department of Elections told me his agency has “gained access to substantially more data to use in updating voter lists” since leaving ERIC. It now receives data from 42 states about voters who may have moved, compared to 25 states before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The change, however, is a classic case of reinventing the wheel, because there was nothing wrong with ERIC in the first place. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin also has reversed the ease</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/08/05/mississippi-ruling-reflects-virginias-history-of-felon-voter-disenfranchisement/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">with which former felons could regain the right to vote in Virginia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We remain among the toughest states to do so nationwide, hewing to a state Constitution clause that’s racist.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">States run by Republican governors, including Virginia, have made a lot of noise about one of Trump’s favorite talking points – noncitizen voting. It’s not a problem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin and others shouldn’t bestow their imprimatur to someone who constantly lies – and stokes fear – to try to regain power. It’s dangerous.</span></p>

Every voting bloc will count – including members of labor unions and other people in their households.</p>
<p>The majority of union leaders have over generations <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7591/j.ctv3s8mr0" target="_blank">endorsed Democratic candidates</a>, and <a href="https://theconversation.com/democratic-partys-embrace-of-organized-labor-in-2024-elections-has-long-roots-that-had-started-to-wither-237002" target="_blank">this race is no exception</a>. Although rank-and-file union members have also historically sided with the Democratic Party by large margins, that support has wavered for at least the past 45 years. In 2016, <a href="https://onlabor.org/the-union-household-vote-revisited/" target="_blank">exit polls indicated</a> that voters in union households supported Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton over Trump by only 8 percentage points, down from 18 percentage points in 2012 when Barack Obama was on the ballot.</p>
<p>No Democratic presidential nominee had fared worse with union voters since Ronald <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2016/11/labor-unions-hillary-clinton-mobilization-231223" target="_blank">Reagan’s wins over Jimmy Carter and Walter Mondale in 1980 and 1984</a>.</p>
<p>Union voters are particularly <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/union2.pdf" target="_blank">prominent in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Nevada</a>, three swing states where the share of voters who belong to unions is above the national average of 10%.</p>
<p>A late 2023 <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/31/politics/union-voters-election-trump-biden/index.html" target="_blank">New York Times/Siena College poll of six swing states</a> that Joe Biden won in 2020 – those three plus Arizona, Georgia and Wisconsin – shows that Biden and Trump were tied at 47% among union voters when they were asked who they’d vote for in 2024. Biden had an <a href="https://cces.gov.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">8 percentage point advantage with these same voters in 2020</a>, according to a different survey.</p>
<h2>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">3 key issues</h4>

	</h2>
<p>Union voters, like all U.S. citizens, are concerned about many issues. But they are more likely than most people to seriously consider a candidate’s record in terms of support for workers and organized labor. Labor historians generally concur that the <a href="https://theconversation.com/bidens-labor-report-card-historian-gives-union-joe-a-higher-grade-than-any-president-since-fdr-228771" target="_blank">Biden administration</a> has the second-strongest labor-friendly record, after Franklin D. Roosevelt.</p>
<p>And I find that <a href="https://prospect.org/labor/2024-07-18-grand-old-party-for-workers/" target="_blank">historian Nelson Lichtenstein, who contends that Trump’s years</a> in office were bad for organized labor, is representative of how labor experts see his track record.</p>
<p>In my view as a labor studies scholar, three aspects of the candidates’ records are the most likely to sway union members one way or the other.</p>
<p><strong>Federal workers</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2019/10/21/2019-23021/executive-orders-13836-13837-and-13839" target="_blank">Trump signed</a> <a href="https://www.federaltimes.com/management/2018/05/25/trump-targets-feds-in-latest-series-of-executive-orders/" target="_blank">three executive orders in 2018</a> that restricted the labor rights of approximately 950,000 federal government employees who belong to unions. In 2020, he signed another measure, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/02/28/trump-plan-omb-schedule-f-nteu/" target="_blank">known as Schedule F</a>, that The Washington Post described as “designed to gut civil service job protections.”</p>
<p>Biden <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/22/executive-order-protecting-the-federal-workforce." target="_blank">rescinded those executive orders</a>. He also established a White House task force charged with making recommendations for how to streamline the procedures for federal worker union organizing, which Harris chaired. The number of <a href="https://www.afge.org/article/union-membership-in-federal-sector-went-up-in-2023/" target="_blank">federal employees in unions</a> has <a href="https://www.govexec.com/federal-news/2024/07/unpacking-kamala-harris-record-federal-workforce-issues/398226/" target="_blank">risen by tens of thousands</a> during the Biden administration.</p>
<p><strong>Union elections</strong></p>
<p>Rules governing how elections are conducted once workers express an interest in forming a union date back to the 1930s, when Roosevelt signed the <a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/guidance/key-reference-materials/national-labor-relations-act" target="_blank">National Labor Relations Act</a> into law. The <a href="https://sunypress.edu/Books/T/The-Making-of-the-National-Labor-Relations-Board2" target="_blank">National Labor Relations Board</a>, created by that legislation, oversees union elections.</p>
<p>In 2019, when Trump appointees held a majority of the NLRB’s five seats, the board overturned an Obama-era NLRB ruling mandating speedy elections. In 2023, when Biden’s appointees were in the majority, the board issued a ruling favorable to unions that rolled back that Trump-era ruling.</p>
<p>Today, when a majority of workers in a workplace say they want union representation, an employer must either recognize and bargain with the union or seek an election. If that employer violates labor law in the period before the election, the election is called off and the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/nlrb-restores-obama-era-rule-speeding-up-union-election-process-2023-08-24/" target="_blank">NLRB may order the employer</a> to recognize and bargain with the union.</p>
<p><strong>OSHA</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.osha.gov/aboutosha" target="_blank">Occupational Safety and Health Administration</a>, a Labor Department agency, is responsible for U.S. workers’ health and safety.</p>
<p>Fewer workplace inspections occurred during the Trump administration than during <a href="https://www.osha.gov/enforcement/2015-enforcement-summary" target="_blank">Obama’s second term</a>. This decline is largely attributable to the slow hiring of new OSHA inspectors to <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/8/18/21366388/osha-worker-safety-trump" target="_blank">replace those who had retired</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/safety/inspector-numbers-up-20-during-biden-administration-osha-says" target="_blank">number of inspections is rising again</a>. However, by OSHA’s calculations, workplace accidents and fatalities have <a href="https://publicintegrity.org/politics/system-failure/deaths-cutbacks-workplace-safety-inspections-osha/" target="_blank">increased during the Biden administration</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/03/02/osha-inspections-covid-oig-report/" target="_blank">Trump administration issued no workplace rules</a> about coronavirus safety, leaving hundreds of thousands of people employed in health care, groceries, meatpacking and education at risk.</p>
<p>By comparison, two days after taking office in 2021, Biden issued an executive order that established masking guidelines, and his administration <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/agencies/asa/hhs-covid-19-workplace-safety-plan/index.html" target="_blank">made health and safety protocols on the job</a> during the rest of the COVID-19 pandemic a high priority.</p>
<p>Compared with the inaction by the Trump administration during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Biden administration has been more active in proposing health and safety measures. For example, in July 2024 it proposed rules designed to protect some 36 million workers from <a href="https://www.osha.gov/news/newsreleases/national/07022024" target="_blank">health risks associated with extreme heat</a>. After a period for written comments, public hearings will be held on the bill.</p>
<p>When Trump tried cutting OSHA funding for 2018 by approximately US$10 million, Congress blocked his efforts. The Biden administration is <a href="https://www.safetyandhealthmagazine.com/articles/25147-biden-administration-seeking-a-37-budget-increase-for-osha" target="_blank">seeking a 3.7% increase in OSHA’s budget</a> for the 2025 fiscal year.</p>
<h2>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Legislative and gubernatorial records</h4>

	</h2>
<p>Harris was a U.S. senator before she became vice president; her vice presidential running mate, Tim Walz, is the governor of Minnesota and was a member of Congress before that; and Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance is currently a U.S. senator as well. The candidates’ records in those positions are also indicators of what they might attempt to do in the White House.</p>
<p>The AFL-CIO, the largest umbrella organization for U.S. unions, gave Harris a <a href="https://aflcio.org/scorecard/legislators/kamala-harris" target="_blank">lifetime score of 98%</a> on her Senate voting record. <a href="https://aflcio.org/scorecard/legislators/tim-walz" target="_blank">Walz</a> got a 93% rating for his votes from the AFL-CIO when he served in the House of Representatives. He belonged to the <a href="https://www.nea.org/about-nea/media-center/press-releases/nea-endorses-vp-walz" target="_blank">National Education Association</a>, the nation’s largest labor union, while working as a high school teacher.</p>
<p>As Minnesota’s governor, Walz signed into law <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/08/06/nx-s1-5065626/labor-unions-tim-walz-minnesota-running-mate-vp" target="_blank">paid sick days for the state’s workers</a> and a measure that made Minnesota the first state to establish a minimum wage for Uber and Lyft drivers. In 2023, Walz also signed a law that established the Nursing Home Workforce Standards Board to oversee the health and welfare of nursing home workers.</p>
<p>The AFL-CIO has given <a href="https://aflcio.org/scorecard/legislators/jd-vance" target="_blank">Vance a 0%</a> rating for his Senate votes as of mid-2024. Among other things, Vance opposed the nominations of several judges and government officials with pro-labor track records.</p>
<h2>Addressing auto workers</h2>
<p>Perhaps the most visible sign of <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/biden-makes-history-striking-auto-workers-picket-line-rcna117348" target="_blank">Biden’s support for labor unions</a> came when he walked a Michigan picket line with striking members of the United Auto Workers in September 2023. He was the first president to do so.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/sep/27/donald-trump-michigan-uaw-autoworkers" target="_blank">Trump turned up nearby</a> the next day. He gave a speech at a nonunion auto parts plant.</p>
<p>More recently, Trump did himself no favors with labor voters and their allies when, in a highly publicized conversation with Tesla, SpaceX and X CEO Elon Musk, <a href="https://x.com/UAW/status/1823343962012123254" target="_blank">he praised Musk for firing employees</a> who <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trump-and-musk-discussed-firing-striking-workers-the-uaw-is-now-seeking-an-nlrb-investigation" target="_blank">spoke out on workplace problems</a> and attempted to unionize.</p>
<p>How union households will vote in 2024 is not clear. But there’s <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/08/29/swing-states-candidate-visits-summer/" target="_blank">no doubt that the Harris and Trump campaigns</a> are certain that it will matter, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/silver-bulletpoints-the-union-vote-could-swing-the-election/" target="_blank">just as it did in 2020</a>, when Biden narrowly won <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/11/10/joe-biden-flipped-blue-wall-states-michigan-wisconsin-pennsylvania/6221295002/" target="_blank">Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania</a> – and in 2016, when Clinton lost those states.</p>

<p>The girl’s teacher told her to keep moving without her shoe, then grabbed it herself and gave it back to the girl when the class settled into their designated safe location.</p>
<p>The girl recently recounted the story of losing her shoe during a morning car ride to school. It was just one of several times the girl or her siblings described what they were supposed to do – run “over to that fence,” “across that field” or “into those woods” – if an intruder enters their school building.</p>
<p>The reason I know this story is because the girl is my daughter.</p>
<p>In the quarter-century since the <a href="https://vault.fbi.gov/Columbine%20High%20School%20" target="_blank">Columbine High School massacre</a> of April 20, 1999, a whole generation of children, including my own, have lived under the threat of school-related gun violence. More recent tragedies, like those occurring at <a href="https://vault.fbi.gov/sandy-hook-elementary-school-shooting" target="_blank">Sandy Hook Elementary School</a> in Connecticut in December 2012 and <a href="https://portal.cops.usdoj.gov/resourcecenter/Home.aspx?item=cops-r1141" target="_blank">Robb Elementary School</a> in Texas in May 2022, reveal the persistent nature of this threat.</p>
<p>Regrettably, gun violence stands at the backdrop of all contemporary American education. As such, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2015/02/when-schools-simulate-mass-shootings/385642/" target="_blank">active shooter and intruder drills have become standard fare</a>, not only for my children but for nearly all American schoolchildren.</p>
<p>I am concerned about the fact that preparedness exercises – such as the one in which my daughter temporarily lost her shoe – sometimes <a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/146/3/e2020015503/36710/Participation-of-Children-and-Adolescents-in-Live" target="_blank">cause students harm</a>. For example, a recent study showed that active intruder drills can result in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamapediatrics.2018.0120" target="_blank">distress and anxiety</a> for students. In another case, one of these drills led to <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/03/active-shooter-drills-erika-christakis/580426/" target="_blank">hysteria and a stampede</a> in a school in Florida as students attempted to flee their faux intruder. Students and teachers alike experienced terror at the pronouncement of a real threat, that it was “<a href="https://www.today.com/parents/active-shooter-drill-leaves-students-teachers-shaken-t144748" target="_blank">not a drill</a>.”</p>
<p>As a <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=aREmyhsAAAAJ&amp;hl=en" target="_blank">researcher in developmental and educational psychology</a> – and as a <a href="https://www.clemson.edu/education/about/directory/profile.html?userid=lrapa" target="_blank">faculty member who trains future teachers</a> – I understand the need for schools to ensure the safety and security of <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=372" target="_blank">the nation’s 55 million school-age youth</a>. But might there be a better way to protect children in the post-Columbine era?</p>
<p>I’m not the only one raising this question. A new initiative by the <a href="https://www.nationalacademies.org/our-work/the-impact-of-active-shooter-drills-on-student-health-and-wellbeing" target="_blank">National Academies</a> has been initiated to assess the effects of active shooter drills on student health and well-being and to determine best practices in preparing schools to respond to threats of violence.</p>
<h2>A look at the trends</h2>
<p>To gain insight on the prevalence of school-related gun violence, my colleagues and I conducted a study of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2023-064311" target="_blank">school shootings and school mass shootings</a> that took place in America’s K-12 schools from 1997 through 2022. We used two public databases to count <a href="https://www.chds.us/sssc/data-map/" target="_blank">school shootings</a> and <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/12/mass-shootings-mother-jones-full-data/" target="_blank">school mass shootings</a> that occurred each school year.</p>
<p>School shootings in our study were defined as “each and every instance a gun is brandished, is fired, or a bullet hits school property for any reason, regardless of the number of victims, time of day, or day of week.” School mass shootings were defined as those that happened at a K-12 school site and met the federal definition of a mass shooting in place at the time of the shooting: four or more victims killed, up to December 2012, or three or more victims killed, from January 2013 onward.</p>
<p>During the 25 school years we examined, 1997-2022, there were 1,453 school shootings. More than half of those, 794, occurred in the last five years, 2017-2022. Our analyses revealed a <a href="https://publications.aap.org/view-large/figure/13881403/peds.2023-064311f1.tif" target="_blank">sharp increase in school shootings after 2017</a>, with the number of shootings jumping from a then-record high of 89 in the 2017-2018 school year to 328 in the 2021-2022 school year.</p>

<p>While the number of school shootings has increased dramatically in recent years, the number of school mass shootings has not increased at the same rate – though they have become more deadly. In total, 11 school mass shootings occurred across the 1997-1998 to 2021-2022 school years, with 126 fatalities and 122 injuries sustained overall. Five of those school mass shootings occurred in the 1997-2012 school years, while six occurred in the 2012-2022 school years. Nevertheless, the fatality rate nearly doubled in the last decade, rising from 7.6 deaths per mass shooting event from 1997-2012 to 14 deaths per school mass shooting event from 2012-2022.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" id="jSGzS" class="tc-infographic-datawrapper" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/jSGzS/1/" width="100%" height="400px" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></p>
<p>Efforts to maximize student safety are paramount. To be sure, I want my children’s schools to do their utmost to protect their students. However, many current measures designed to keep students safe – like the appointment of <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/docs/wh_now_is_the_time_full.pdf" target="_blank">school resource officers</a> – have <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/2372966X.2020.1846458" target="_blank">not been proven to prevent school shootings</a> or <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2018.12.006" target="_blank">lessen the severity of school shootings</a>, in terms of injury or fatality, when they do occur.</p>
<p>Gun injury is now the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMc2201761" target="_blank">leading cause of death for children and adolescents</a> in the United States. While school shootings and school mass shootings represent only a portion of gun injuries sustained by school-age youth, gun violence – including school-related gun violence – is a <a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/sites/default/files/2024-01/2023-june-cgvs-u-s-gun-violence-in-2021-v3.pdf" target="_blank">public health crisis</a>. As such, a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMsb1302631" target="_blank">public health approach</a> is merited.</p>
<h2>Relying on research</h2>
<p>I see at least three ways that schools and communities can work to lessen gun violence occurring in and around schools:</p>
<p><strong>1: Educate parents and families about safe gun storage.</strong></p>
<p>Educators and community health care providers – including <a href="https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2023-065281" target="_blank">pediatricians, primary care physicians and mental health clinicians</a> – can engage in efforts to counsel families on <a href="https://www.healthychildren.org/English/safety-prevention/at-home/Pages/Handguns-in-the-Home.aspx" target="_blank">safe firearm storage</a>. Health care providers can also work to understand <a href="https://www.aap.org/en/advocacy/state-advocacy/extreme-risk-protection-orders-erpo-or-red-flag-laws" target="_blank">Extreme Risk Protection Order laws</a> in their states; such laws allow them to coordinate with law enforcement to remove firearms from a home environment when an individual is identified who may be at risk of doing harm to self or others.</p>
<p><strong>2: Utilize evidence-based, schoolwide approaches to promote school safety.</strong></p>
<p>School safety can be supported through evidence-based frameworks, such as <a href="https://www.pbis.org/" target="_blank">Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports</a>, which aims to improve school-based practices affecting student outcomes. This positive approach can be used to proactively address students’ <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/pits.22614" target="_blank">social, emotional and behavioral needs</a> and promote school safety. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2012-0243" target="_blank">This approach</a> also allows school personnel to monitor and manage students’ mental health needs, attend to schoolwide behavior and discipline issues, and foster a safe school climate. Accordingly, it may help reduce potential threats of gun violence perpetrated by students.</p>
<p><strong>3: Support legislation and regulations for gun safety and violence prevention.</strong></p>
<p>Community members, including parents and teachers, and policymakers can support <a href="https://efsgv.org/wp-content/uploads/PublicHealthApproachToGVP-EFSGV.pdf" target="_blank">legislation for gun safety, evidence-based violence prevention practices and regulations</a>. For example, child access protection laws – laws that impose penalties on gun owners if children access firearms – decrease <a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/wjps-2020-000223" target="_blank">firearm injuries</a> and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1086/699657" target="_blank">gun carrying</a>, and thus help promote safety in and around schools.</p>

<h2>Hope for the future</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://nij.ojp.gov/funding/opportunities/o-nij-2024-171966" target="_blank">National Institute for Justice</a> has made it a priority to support new research to study firearm violence and mass shootings, including research on the effectiveness of school campaigns to educate families on safe gun storage.</p>
<p>These efforts will provide important new insights about how to <a href="https://everytownresearch.org/report/how-to-stop-shootings-and-gun-violence-in-schools/#solutions-to-prevent-school-gun-violence" target="_blank">prevent school-related gun violence</a>.</p>
<p>While my own children and their millions of peers attending school in the United States today continue to endure the threat of school-related gun violence, I hope future generations will experience school without having to worry about someone showing up at their school with a gun.</p>

(Photo by Diane Macdonald /Stockbyte/Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The human population of the Earth passed 8 billion in 2022, up from 7 billion in 2011 and less than 2 billion just a century ago. The United Nations </span><a href="https://www.un.org/en/observances/world-population-day" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">projects</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that by 2050, the world will hit 9.7 billion people and continue rising to 10.9 billion in 2100. The average number of children women have in their lifetimes remains above the replacement rate of 2.1. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So why is there so much hand-wringing about a population </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">bust</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is true that population trends are uneven across the world, and some European and East Asian countries are struggling to address a decline in numbers. This is not the case in the U.S., however. Although our birth rate has been below the replacement rate for years, the Census </span><a href="https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2023/population-projections.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">projects</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> our population increasing by another 33 million before it peaks in 2080. By 2100, the Census expects there will still be almost 10% more people in the U.S. than there are today. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frankly, it’s more than a little odd to worry about something that won’t happen for at least three-quarters of a century, while ignoring that in the meantime, an ever-growing population using too many resources is pushing the planet to the brink of ecological collapse. You would think we could worry about that now, and save the hysterics over population decline for the next century. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet conservatives see </span><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/04/28/natalism-conference-austin-00150338" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the sky falling</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The fear is most palpable among white supremacists spouting </span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/replacement-theory" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">replacement theory</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the notion that pale-skinned people, who are having fewer children, will be swamped by brown people, who are having more. They are pretty sure this is, in fact, a nefarious plan concocted by Jewish people, who apparently don’t count as white, with a goal of destroying Western civilization and all the great things that America stands for — by which they definitely do not mean democracy and </span><a href="https://www.adl.org/resources/blog/misogyny-powerful-undercurrent-great-replacement-conspiracy-theory-0" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">civil rights</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even some liberal Americans say they’re worried about the birth rate, and </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/05/opinion/birthrate-jd-vance-progressives.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">argue</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> we need child tax credits, mandatory parental leave and publicly-subsidized daycare to reverse the decline. Of course, progressives support these policies anyway, so it’s hard to know how sincere their concern over birth rates really is. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m not sure about the sincerity on the right, either. Most of the people who express alarm about a declining birth rate are red-state Republicans who celebrate rural living and the small-town lifestyle. They hate traffic and the plethora of rules necessary to make life tolerable in crowded communities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, I guarantee you no one in New York or LA looks around and says, “You know what would make this place better? More people!”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, the pro-population-growth crowd absolutely rejects the one sure way to increase the US population: allowing more immigrants in. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They say it’s not racism. Theirs is just a preference for people who look like them, sound like them and do things the way they do them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet immigration does all the things that the population alarmists say we need. It fills schools with children, bolsters the workforce, and keeps contributions flowing to Social Security and Medicare, </span><a href="https://publicintegrity.org/inequality-poverty-opportunity/immigration/new-data-shows-why-the-u-s-needs-more-immigrants/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">extending the solvency</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of these programs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vastly more would-be immigrants are knocking at our doors than we are willing to allow in, and the numbers will only increase as climate change and the collapse of ecosystems spark further conflict and make it harder to eke out a living in more parts of the world. Countries that are able and willing to absorb the outflow of migrants from devastated areas will not be challenged by depopulation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. is home to more migrants than any other country. Clearly many Americans, themselves descended from immigrants, are ready to shut the door behind them, but </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-22/immigration-is-fueling-us-economic-growth-while-politicians-rage?utm_medium=cpc_search&amp;utm_campaign=NB_ENG_DSAXX_DSAXXXXXXXXXX_EVG_XXXX_XXX_COUSA_EN_EN_X_BLOM_GO_SE_XXX_XXXXXXXXXX&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gbraid=0AAAAAD9e5yp9qr7ToKv_fTO5JBlxGHqtJ&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwq_G1BhCSARIsACc7NxoW4tgy9EakvQQBctB_d2qKGME9D8UwuXrsQl3PMNrFxBbU0T-kxDwaAgTjEALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">economists agree</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> immigration is the secret sauce of our economic strength. That doesn’t mean the doors need to be wide open, with no one managing the flow, or that we shouldn’t try to help solve the crises that drive people to leave their home countries in the first place. And we still urgently need to work on transforming our consumption-based economy into a sustainable one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it does mean we needn’t fear a population bust in our lifetimes. While other advanced countries are figuring out how to retool their economies for a shrinking population, we will always have the numbers we desire, so long as we remain a society committed to equal opportunity, democracy and the striving for justice.    </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Obviously, this is not what the nativist right wants. But what they want — more American-born babies and limitless population growth, achieved by controlling women’s bodies rather than by strengthening the welfare state — is a fantasy served up with a helping of bad policy. </span></p>

(Parker Michels-Boyce/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Supply and demand: We often hear that this is the fundamental issue when it comes to affordable housing. If only we built more homes, meeting demand, then prices would fall. But like many simple stories, it’s more fiction than truth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recently I was reminded of this when hearing about one of our clients at Housing Opportunities Made Equal of Virginia (HOME of VA). She was struggling to find a home she could afford. We work with first-time buyers to make homeownership possible, and this client hoped we could help unravel a problem that seemed to have no solution.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our client had worked as a nurse for 31 years at a Richmond-area hospital. Her wages made it challenging to get by while raising four children, and she never could save for a down payment. When disability suddenly forced her into retirement, her diminished income seemed to put homeownership out of reach — especially in the current market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The high cost of housing today is news to no one. In Richmond, </span><a href="https://www.axios.com/local/richmond/2024/02/05/richmond-renters-cost-burden-unaffordable" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">52% of renters</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> spend more than 30% of their incomes on rent — a level economists call “cost-burdened” — making rent here more expensive relative to income than in New York or San Francisco. The average sale price of a home in Richmond is </span><a href="https://www.redfin.com/city/17149/VA/Richmond/housing-market" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">60% higher today</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> than it was just five years ago. And over the last generation, home prices locally have risen at </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/06/20/nx-s1-5005972/home-prices-wages-paychecks-rent-housing-harvard-report" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">nearly twice the rate of incomes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even without these statistics at hand, we all see and feel these realities — in conversations with friends and family, in difficult decisions about how to make ends meet while ensuring access to good jobs and schools. But some of us feel the pinch more than others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, Black women workers like our client make 32% less than white men — a gap that means they will make nearly </span><a href="https://nwlc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Equal-Pay-for-Black-Women.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$1 million less</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over their lifetimes. At the same time, the average Black family in the United States holds </span><a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/black-wealth-is-increasing-but-so-is-the-racial-wealth-gap/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">15% of the wealth</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the average white family. This has major ramifications for homeownership, because </span><a href="https://investors.redfin.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1071/nepo-homebuyers-more-than-one-third-of-gen-z-and" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">family wealth is the source of down payments</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for more than a third of first mortgages. And even when credit scores and debt-to-income ratios are equal, Black Americans are </span><a href="https://www.minneapolisfed.org/article/2024/lender-reported-reasons-for-mortgage-denials-dont-explain-racial-disparities#:~:text=In%20our%20previous%20analysis%2C%20after,be%20denied%20a%20conventional%20mortgage." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">twice as likely to be denied a mortgage</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as white applicants. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The unavailability of affordable housing was one major factor troubling our client’s finances — and those of many others. The Partnership for Housing Affordability, a local nonprofit, has found that the Richmond region </span><a href="https://pharva.com/housing-solutions/#:~:text=In%20addition%20to%20a%20current,based%20on%20household%20growth%20projections." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">needs to build 20,000 affordable homes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> just to meet current demand. When we work with first-time home buyers or renters seeking to move to higher-opportunity neighborhoods, the scarcity of options is an all-too-familiar barrier. Boosting the supply of housing would serve many families in need.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But supply alone will not solve a key problem with demand: Too few Black and Latino Virginians can buy a home or maintain stable renting because of generations of unfairness in the housing market. Redlining, government policy until 1968, walled off communities of color from investment. Today, individuals living in these areas </span><a href="https://ncrc.org/decades-of-disinvestment/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">still</span></a> <a href="https://publichealth.berkeley.edu/news-media/research-highlights/50-years-after-being-outlawed-redlining-still-drives-neighborhood-health-inequities" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> lower incomes, reduced life expectancy, and less access to services. These disparities worsen the impacts of income inequality and lack of access to credit. Boosting supply without addressing the inequity issues of demand will only reinforce race-based exclusion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have tools to break with the unfairness of years past and create a housing market with more opportunity for everyone. For example, U.S. Sens. Tim Kaine and Mark Warner have co-sponsored a bill that would provide </span><a href="https://www.kaine.senate.gov/press-releases/warner-kaine-colleagues-introduce-legislation-to-help-first-time-first-generation-homebuyers-narrow-the-wealth-gap" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">down payment assistance to first-time homebuyers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And already, a little-used federal law empowers banks to create </span><a href="https://financialequity.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/SPCPs-A-Tool-for-Greater-Equity-final.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">special-purpose credit programs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for historically marginalized communities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both strategies — down payment assistance and a deeply discounted interest rate accessed through a special program — proved the solution for our client, who closed on her new house last month. She told us she’s grateful for the chance to “build generational wealth,” and appreciating a simpler pleasure, no less special — “just to enjoy a piece of earth that is my own.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But this happy ending isn’t yet possible at scale. Federal support for down payment assistance, one possible outcome of November’s elections, would help. And banks could dramatically expand special-purpose credit programs. In the meantime, even if scores of new homes are built, long-standing barriers to homeownership and affordable renting will remain the reality for far too many Black and Latino Virginians. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s because you can’t trickle down housing. Expanding supply is a one-size-fits-all solution to a problem with many dimensions. As we tackle the crisis of housing affordability, we must be targeted in our approach, nuanced in our thinking, intentional in our actions. And we should put fairness first.</span></p>

(Parker Michels-Boyce for the Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Charlottesville city officials say they have no plans to roust homeless individuals from the well-known Downtown Mall pedestrian area, despite complaints from some business owners that the latter’s presence affects the “safety” and “cleanliness” of the area and they should be rounded up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s a super complex issue,” city spokeswoman Afton Schneider told me. “It’s not one that can be easily fixed.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thank goodness compassion has prevailed, at least for now, over punishment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The callousness calls to mind </span><a href="https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/christmascarol/quotes/character/bob-cratchit/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ebenezer Scrooge</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> refusing Bob Cratchit a lump of coal in winter. Or demanding folks pull themselves up by their bootstraps — when they don’t even have shoes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I understand that the presence of homeless people and the </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/10/20/helping-panhandlers-involves-more-than-just-easing-bans-on-begging/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">related panhandling</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> could impede retail sales. Folks strolling along the Mall might feel threatened, or at least annoyed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s important to remember, though, why some 200 homeless people in Charlottesville and five nearby counties have to survive this way: Many have faced medical emergencies, job terminations or other cash-sucking calamities. Affordable housing is </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/04/15/continued-lack-of-affordable-housing-hinders-pride-security-among-virginians/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CApproximately%2029%20percent%20of%20Virginia,said%20in%20a%202021%20report."><span style="font-weight: 400;">at a premium in Virginia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">; Demand has outstripped supply.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And sadly,</span><a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2024-04-17/most-homeless-americans-are-battling-mental-illness#:~:text=%22The%20most%20common%20mental%20disorders,on%20homelessness%20and%20mental%20illness." target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">an estimated two-thirds</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of those who survive on the streets worldwide suffer from some form of mental illness, according to a review of 85 studies published this year.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Nothing is going to change if barriers still exist to get into housing,” Shayla Washington, executive director of the Blue Ridge Area Coalition for the Homeless, told me Thursday.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.cvilletomorrow.org/local-agencies-shock-city-council-members-with-latest-data-on-the-number-of-folks-experiencing-homelessness/#:~:text=The%202023%20PIT%20count%20was,it%20at%20any%20given%20time." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Charlottesville Tomorrow</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://dailyprogress.com/news/local/business/people-are-afraid-charlottesville-businesses-call-on-city-to-round-up-homeless/article_401e266e-55bc-11ef-83a6-a7ff6d61d011.html#tracking-source=mp-homepage" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The (Charlottesville) Daily Progress</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have covered homelessness closely in the city of 45,000 residents. Challenges there are often duplicated </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/10/20/helping-panhandlers-involves-more-than-just-easing-bans-on-begging/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in communities across the state</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, including Norfolk, Virginia Beach and Fairfax County. Some localities have adopted a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/03/26/newest-anti-homeless-project-builds-on-strong-efforts-statewide/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Housing First” model</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which provides shelter as quickly as possible and then offers needed social services and counseling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Daily Progress recently reported the mayor and police chief met with business leaders in late June about the issue at the Downtown Mall. Some businesspeople suggested the police more aggressively monitor and expel the homeless. They cited a recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling in </span><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-175_19m2.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grants Pass v. Johnson</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">that said local ordinances with penalties for camping on public land do not constitute cruel and unusual punishment, even if homeless people have nowhere else to go.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The police chief in Charlottesville, though, said the city doesn’t have such an ordinance to enforce. Then, at an Aug. 5 City Council meeting, several residents and homeless advocates publicly opposed the “inhumane” rhetoric and lock-’em-up mentality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That vocal repudiation was justified.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A petition organized by Friends of Cville Downtown suggested more resources be identified to help people who don’t have a roof over their heads, the newspaper said. Among them: a free public health clinic; an overnight shelter with fewer hurdles to admission; and a designated campsite with bathroom, showers and storage units. It was a turnaround from an original draft that was punitive toward people living on the streets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nor is it clear how much of an effect the presence of the unhoused has on Mall sales. Dueling statistics appeared in the recent article. Washington, the homeless advocate, pointed out that many shops there are niche or boutique retailers, which might limit customers. Inflation could impact sales, too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t think homelessness is the only target for their businesses being affected,” she added.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_39644" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="max-width:100%;width:1024px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/?attachment_id=39644" rel="attachment wp-att-39644"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-39644 size-large" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DC-homeless-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DC-homeless-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DC-homeless-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DC-homeless-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DC-homeless-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DC-homeless-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Members of a clean-up crew remove belongings that have been left behind by occupants as the National Park Service clears the homeless encampment at McPherson Square on Feb. 15, 2023 in Washington, D.C.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What’s clear is the Charlottesville area isn’t the </span><a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/park-service-dc-police-clear-foggy-bottom-homeless-encampments/3617977/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">District of Columbia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, where federal and local agencies have repeatedly cleared out large homeless encampments. In May, workers shut down several sites affecting scores of people in the nation’s capital.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That city tallied more than </span><a href="https://community-partnership.org/homelessness-in-dc/facts-and-figures/?_sft_resource_topic=recent" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">5,600 homeless individuals during its annual Point-in-Time Count in January</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a total that dwarfs the numbers in localities around Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The District’s Encampment Response Team was activated to protect residents on District property after dangerous circumstances arose, including fires, danger of traffic collisions, multiple assaults, and growing rodent issues,” a city statement said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is an extreme stance, one that should be avoided if possible. Also, just because officials destroy tents and makeshift living spaces, that doesn’t mean the folks who had slept there suddenly have other places to live.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s why long-term, well-planned solutions are needed. Some ideas come from groups like Virginia Supportive Housing (VSH), a nonprofit developer that operates 11 residential communities around the state. They include one in Charlottesville known as The Crossings, which has 60 apartments and opened in 2012.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VSH and the Piedmont Housing Alliance want to build 140 affordable residential units in nearby Albemarle County called Premier Circle, but a </span><a href="https://www.cvilletomorrow.org/as-chronic-homelessness-rises-in-the-charlottesville-area-one-type-of-housing-that-can-help-has-been-delayed-because-of-rising-construction-costs/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">previous news report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> said work stalled because of higher estimated costs. Construction could begin late this year, a VSH spokeswoman told me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re very, very excited for this project to get underway,” said Kate McCarthy, a spokesperson for VHS.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These efforts, though, can take years. That’s also true when city governments take the lead in opening overnight, multipurpose shelters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During my time at The Virginian-Pilot, </span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2011/11/15/beach-should-move-quickly-with-homeless-campus-plans/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I engaged in a very public debate with municipal officials in Virginia Beach</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who, I believe, purposely dragged their feet on building an overnight homeless shelter in the commonwealth’s largest city. A sizable homeless population was often drawn to the Oceanfront or nearby neighborhoods.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2016/01/07/roger-chesley-time-to-build-virginia-beach-homeless-center/" target="_blank">It took plenty of ink</a> and combative rebuttals from local officials before the city finally dedicated the $29 million Housing Resource Center in 2018. The center has beds for individuals and families, and it also provides medical exams, health education and other services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before the opening, unhoused people had to travel to a large, nonprofit facility in nearby Norfolk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or just sleep where they were.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That doesn’t mean homeless people have no value. It certainly isn’t an excuse to round them up like common criminals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or to remove them from the Downtown Mall in Charlottesville without any alternatives to shelter.</span></p>

<div class="theconversation-article-body">
<p>However, it’s not just <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(14)62114-0" target="_blank">high and low temperatures</a> that matter. How many degrees the temperature swings within a day – the <a href="https://www.weather.gov/images/ama/climate/50Ranges/MarchRanges.JPG" target="_blank">daily temperature variation</a> – itself poses health risks.</p>
<p>Studies have found that days with larger than normal temperature swings can increase <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anai.2014.01.007" target="_blank">asthma flare-ups</a> and hospitalizations for <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2024.116613" target="_blank">respiratory</a> and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/oemed-2019-106245" target="_blank">cardiovascular diseases</a>, leading to an <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2017.10.018" target="_blank">overall higher death rate</a> than normal. One study, based on data from 308 cities from 1972 to 2013, estimates that <a href="http://doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2017.10.018" target="_blank">2.5% of deaths</a> in that time could be attributed to large daily temperature swings.</p>
<p>Although humans can live in a wide range of ambient temperatures, a dramatic shift in temperature can tax multiple systems in the body, including the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/discim/kyae001" target="_blank">immune</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mpaic.2008.04.009" target="_blank">musculoskeletal</a> and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00484-016-1221-0" target="_blank">cardiovascular systems</a>. It can be especially <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cupe.2003.11.012" target="_blank">taxing on very young</a> and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1159/000333148" target="_blank">older individuals</a>, who are generally more vulnerable to harsh climates.</p>
<p>We <a href="https://skrisliu.com/dtvus/map.html" target="_blank">mapped daily temperature variations</a> at the neighborhood scale across the U.S. to get a better picture of where these temperature swings are highest and who is most affected. The results highlight how poverty and a legacy of discriminatory practices have left racial minorities and low-income residents in neighborhoods with more dramatic temperature differences through the day.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What affects temperature swings?</h4>

	
<p>Large night-to-day temperature swings are more common in some regions, such as the U.S. Southwest, but they can also vary over short distances depending on the landscape and what’s known as the <a href="https://theconversation.com/landsat-zooms-in-on-cities-hottest-neighborhoods-to-help-combat-the-urban-heat-island-effect-182925" target="_blank">urban heat island effect</a>.</p>
<p>For example, the ocean can mitigate rapid temperature changes since water can absorb a lot of heat before it gets hot. The Greater <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.uclim.2023.101526" target="_blank">Los Angeles</a> area is a case in point. Santa Monica, a coastal community in Los Angeles County, has much smaller temperature swings then more inland neighborhoods in the county, like downtown Los Angeles.</p>

<p>Green space, like forested parks, can also reduce temperature swings. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-89972-0" target="_blank">Urban trees</a> and vegetation can keep neighborhoods cooler, reducing the temperature volatility.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Who faces the greatest temperature swings?</h4>

	
<p>Using NASA’s satellite data between 2000 and 2017, we cross-checked the daily temperature variation with the U.S. Census Bureau’s <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs" target="_blank">American Community Survey</a> demographic data at different census tracts to see <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/pnasnexus/pgae176" target="_blank">how race and ethnicity, income, and age affected exposure</a> to daily temperature variations across all 50 states.</p>
<p>We found that, of the three demographic factors, exposure to daily temperature variation is the most unequal by race and ethnicity, followed by income. Age mattered the least.</p>

<p>In the state with the greatest disparity, Rhode Island, Hispanic and Black populations experienced, on average, daily temperature swings of 31.2 degrees Fahrenheit (17.3 degrees Celsius) in May, while the average daily temperature variation for white populations was 25.8 F (14.3 C). That’s a 5.4 F (3 C) difference between the groups.</p>
<p>The contrast between low-income and high-income groups in Rhode Island was 28.6 F (15.9 C) compared with 24.5 F (13.6 C), a 4.1 F (2.3 C) difference. The difference was negligible among age groups, at 1.8 F (1 C).</p>

<p>Among the 50 states, we saw significant differences by race and ethnicity in 46 states, by income in 39 states, and by age in 15 states. In general, <a href="https://skrisliu.com/dtvus/map.html" target="_blank">daily temperature swings were highest</a> in western states, particularly in late spring and summer.</p>
<p>The fact that minority populations are disproportionately living in neighborhoods with wider temperature swings confirms yet another dimension of inequality in vulnerability to climate change.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Temperature swings widen with climate change</h4>

	
<p>There is also evidence that temperature swings will get more dramatic over time. From the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2004GL019998" target="_blank">1950s to the 1980s</a>, records show shrinking temperature swings globally. Since the 1990s, however, research shows temperature swings have widened, potentially <a href="https://phys.org/news/2024-02-temperature-difference-day-night-affect.html" target="_blank">affecting all life on Earth</a>.</p>

<p>Studies suggest these temperature swings will <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S2542-5196(20)30222-9" target="_blank">continue to widen</a> as greenhouse gas emissions, largely from burning fossil fuels, continue to raise global temperatures. And with those increases will come more premature deaths. Under the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s highest emissions scenario (RCP 8.5), which projects conditions in a world that burns increasingly large amounts of fossil fuels, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S2542-5196(20)30222-9" target="_blank">future temperature swings</a> are projected to increase by as much as 2.9 F (1.6 C) by the end of the century.</p>
<p>There are ways to reduce the risk, starting with cutting greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles, power plants, livestock and other sources.</p>
<p>Communities can also take steps to reduce low-income and minority neighborhoods’ exposure to temperature swings by increasing tree cover and using <a href="https://theconversation.com/lighter-pavement-really-does-cool-cities-when-its-done-right-162918" target="_blank">light coatings on roofs</a> to reflect heat away from buildings. They can also provide support programs to help people who can’t otherwise afford to install or power cooling or heating equipment.</p>

Jim Gilmore and First Lady Roxane Gilmore with their sons Jay and Ashton. (Courtesy Dan Kreske)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was watching because a Democratic operative had pitched a rumor to me a few days earlier that Roxane had decamped the governor’s residence. The tip smelled of barnyard droppings from the start and I wanted to state with firsthand certainty that it was exactly what its odor indicated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just to be sure, I had also queried a few sources on the inside and was told repeatedly and unequivocally that Mrs. Gilmore was very much living at the mansion and that, by all appearances, she and the governor were happy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wanted to run this insinuation to ground because I knew another side to them from moments outside their official role.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What moments,” you ask?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">High school football and our sons: the Gilmores’ and mine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That busy year, the governor was in the inner circle of Republican Texas Gov. George W. Bush’s presidential campaign against Vice President Al Gore. That fall was also the greatest football season that Mills E. Godwin High School in Henrico County has ever had.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The governor’s eldest son, Jay, was a senior on the Eagles’ 2000 team. My son, Rob, was a junior. It was a team better stocked on determination and coaching than next-level talent, but week after week, this team vanquished larger, faster football powers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I had run into the governor and the first lady at a Saturday morning practice early in the preseason that coach Ron Axselle had organized especially for players’ parents in hopes they would get to know one another. Coach Ax added post-practice watermelon as an inducement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It felt awkward at first because the Gilmores were the state’s most powerful couple and I was a reporter tasked with keeping tabs on them. But this was outside official lines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So we made a deal: this would be about our kids. I’d be “just Bob,” a proud Godwin dad and fan, and they’d be “just Jim and Roxane,” proud Godwin parents and fans. With that out of the way, we were able to relax and relish those fleeting Friday nights.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I figured I’d see them at maybe four or five games, thinking that they would be otherwise occupied with weighty matters of state or politics, especially for road games. I figured wrong. They attended every game right up to the nail-biter finale against Jim’s alma mater, J.R. Tucker High School.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They arrived late: he had been campaigning for Bush that day and got there before halftime. Early the next morning, he would be back at it and stay that way through the final weekend of the campaign and the election on Tuesday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But when our sons and their teammates salvaged a last-minute victory over Tucker, the Gilmores joined in the euphoria because it marked the first time in Godwin’s history that it had ended a regular season unbeaten.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is constant tension between journalists and those they cover about how close or distant such relationships should be. It’s not like a football field: no white hash marks and boundary lines. We can argue whether by giving the first family its space, I was too lenient.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jim will tell you it never stopped me from reporting unflattering news about him if I had the facts to back it up. Those interactions outside our traditional roles never dulled my curiosity or skepticism — same as it would be with successive governors with whom I shared off-record moments. Such moments, I would argue, allow journalists to understand their subjects as real, three-dimensional people and are a guardrail against cynicism, a destructive default tendency to believe the worst.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moments like those during their time in office and since allowed me to admire Roxane Gilmore as a first lady of great intellect, character and wit. I came to appreciate her as a mom who made time for her sons, Jay and Ashton, despite impossible demands her schedule sometimes imposed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And I realized she loved her husband, was his staunchest supporter and his wisest advisor.</span></p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican officials in Virginia and nationwide – recognizing the</span><a href="https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2015/demo/p25-1143.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">ongoing shift in racial demographics across America</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – surely would overhaul their messaging, I reasoned, to become more welcoming toward African Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans and others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The GOP would favor increasing voter registration totals, I thought. It would work diligently to persuade more folks to its side with an inclusive, less-accusatory agenda. Gone would be the days of demonizing people of color on conservative mouthpieces like Fox “News.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all, gaining just a tiny segment of non-white voters should ensure repeated electoral victories, especially in presidential contests. Such a strategy would allow the party</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/04/27/gop-operatives-screed-against-voting-practices-isnt-based-on-facts/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">to actually win the popular vote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> more often this century. There would be no need to manufacture barriers to the ballot box for groups that usually support Democrats. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What a fool I was.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans want to keep power and pretend they’ve earned a mandate, even though in 2022 they garnered a</span><a href="https://www.cookpolitical.com/vote-tracker/2022/house" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">small majority of votes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> nationwide in the U.S. House of Representatives. Even though at least</span><a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/states-have-added-nearly-100-restrictive-laws-scotus-gutted-voting-rights" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">29 states have passed 94 restrictive voting laws</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> since the U.S. Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act in 2013.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ege00cDU1A"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/05/26/restoring-rights-a-good-gubernatorial-move-but-automatic-restoration-would-be-better/">Restoring rights a good gubernatorial move, but automatic restoration would be better</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Restoring rights a good gubernatorial move, but automatic restoration would be better&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/05/26/restoring-rights-a-good-gubernatorial-move-but-automatic-restoration-would-be-better/embed/#?secret=sExgjXcgGQ#?secret=ege00cDU1A" data-secret="ege00cDU1A" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest evidence of Republicans erecting hurdles for would-be voters comes from the federal judiciary. In July the “most conservative appellate court” in the country –</span><a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2024/07/the-countrys-most-conservative-court-just-reinstated-a-jim-crow-era-voter-suppression-law/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">as Mother Jones put it</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – reinstated a Jim Crow-era felon disenfranchisement law in Mississippi.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/05/26/restoring-rights-a-good-gubernatorial-move-but-automatic-restoration-would-be-better/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s own 1901-02 Constitution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> mimics the racist precepts in Mississippi’s; they’re a perpetual stain on the commonwealth. </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/12/15/foia-friday-a-times-dispatch-lawsuit-and-a-rights-restoration-case-dismissed/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re the only state that permanently strips voting rights</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from convicted felons unless the governor restores them. Virginia utilized now-defunct poll taxes and literacy tests, too, that targeted Black voters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals just upheld a Mississippi law dating to 1890 that permanently prevents residents there from voting if they’ve been convicted of any of about 100 crimes. They include such nonviolent offenses as timber larceny, writing a bad check and bigamy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 13-member majority overturned a three-judge panel of its own court that said the law violated the 8</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Amendment’s prohibition on</span><a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-8/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">cruel and unusual punishment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Revealing the ongoing politicization of the federal judiciary, all but one of the majority judges were appointed by Republican presidents. Six judges appointed by Democrats dissented.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The law was upheld despite the fact it was adopted as part of a state Constitution designed to maintain white supremacy. “We came here to exclude the Negro,” said</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2021/05/01/mississippi-constitution-voting-rights-jim-crow/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Solomon S. Calhoon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the constitutional convention president, more than a century ago. “Nothing short of this will answer.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Felons in Mississippi are disproportionately Black. However – as I’ve noted previously –</span><a href="https://www.sentencingproject.org/reports/report-to-the-united-nations-on-racial-disparities-in-the-u-s-criminal-justice-system/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Black people and other minorities are treated more harshly than white people are for the same crimes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The Mother Jones article reported that from 1994 to 2017, the law disenfranchised nearly 50,000 people. African Americans comprise 38% of the state’s population – the highest percentage among U.S. states.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, it’s curious Mississippi is so vengeful, given Republicans rarely face serious challenges in the state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The last time the Magnolia State picked a Democrat for president was fellow Southerner Jimmy Carter in 1976. For the U.S. Senate, it last picked a Democrat in 1982.</span><a href="https://benniethompson.house.gov/about#:~:text=Serving%20his%2015th%20term%20in,in%20the%20Mississippi%20Congressional%20Delegation." target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Rep. Bennie Thompson</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, serving a district including Jackson, the state capital, is the lone Democrat among four members in the U.S. House of Representatives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s probably the … most racialized state in the nation,” David Lublin, professor and chair of the department of government at American University, told me during an interview. Lublin wrote “The Republican South: Democratization and Partisan Change.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The post-Reconstruction constitutions in the South aren’t badges of honor, he noted: “These were not adopted for nice reasons.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s putting it mildly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lublin said because we live in such a highly polarized nation, both Democrats and Republicans fight “tooth and nail” over any advantage – though Democrats might be on the moral side of the voting rights argument.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No one likes to give up advantages,” he added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here in Virginia, Gov. Glenn Youngkin has restored voting and other civil rights to 7,575 people, his spokesman Christian Martinez said. The state Constitution requires him to make “restoration decisions on an individualized, case-by-case basis,” Martinez told me by email.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://apnews.com/article/voting-rights-felony-convictions-lawsuit-af720e316859e25b2e99ab8e69ee4af9" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawsuits have been filed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> against the administration because of the opaqueness of the process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Martinez wouldn’t answer whether Youngkin supports a constitutional amendment that would allow automatic restoration. House Republicans killed such a legislative attempt after</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/11/03/governors-mismanagement-of-voting-process-continues-as-election-day-looms/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">he took office in 2022</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The total number of restorations by Youngkin is dwarfed by those</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/04/11/democratic-senator-says-hes-meeting-with-youngkin-to-discuss-rights-restoration/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">approved by his predecessors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who made the system more streamlined. Republican Bob McDonnell signed off on more than 10,000. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrat Terry McAuliffe approved more than 173,000, and  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrat Ralph Northam restored </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">rights to more than 126,000 people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is it political, since so many Black and Latino voters support Democrats? Yes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s also the right thing to do to re-engage Virginia residents regarding their citizenship duties. Voting gives people a stake in their communities. Given the racist history of felon disenfranchisement in Virginia, legislators should support the amendment process and allow people released from prison to regain their rights automatically.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I know this is a tough sell for Republican lawmakers, in Virginia and elsewhere, who value power over equity. I’m probably delusional.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Doesn’t mean I’m wrong.</span></p>

<p>As global temperatures have risen, major sporting events like the Olympics and FIFA World Cup <a href="https://basis.org.uk/resource/rings-of-fire-2/" target="_blank">have had to adapt</a> to high heat and extreme storms to keep athletes and fans safe and allow the games to go on.</p>
<p>Olympic organizers have moved events such as marathons <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/paris-2024-summer-olympics-heat-records-athletes-risk/" target="_blank">to early mornings</a> and <a href="https://olympics.com/en/news/tokyo-2020-olympic-marathon-course-sapporo-finalised" target="_blank">even to cooler cities</a>. FIFA, the governing body for world soccer, pushed the 2022 Men’s World Cup back from its usual time in June to late November so it could be <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/11/sports/soccer/fifa-world-cup-qatar.html" target="_blank">held in Qatar</a>.</p>
<figure class="align-center "><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
<p>The heat risks and the environmental impact of major sporting events have led some people to <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/16184742.2022.2096661" target="_blank">question whether these events</a> should be held at all. But as someone who studies sport management and sustainability in an area I coined “<a href="https://doi.org/10.1123/jsm.2019-0294" target="_blank">sport ecology</a>,” I believe that radical approach misses the benefits, including the Olympics’ ability to promote sustainable actions to the public worldwide.</p>
<h2>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">How rising global heat affects the Olympics</h4>

	</h2>
<p>Sports have good reason for caring about sustainability: Climate change can put athletes’ and fans’ health at risk and even put the future of some sports in doubt.</p>
<p>Winter sports <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/13683500.2014.887664" target="_blank">face the greatest threats</a> from climate change as temperatures rise and precipitation changes, dramatically shortening winter sports seasons in many areas. In 2022, the Beijing Winter Games had to <a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2022.944764" target="_blank">artificially create snow</a> so it could have ski runs at all. The <a href="https://olympics.com/ioc/news/future-host-commission-studying-landscape-of-winter-sport-with-a-view-to-the-olympic-winter-games-2030-and-beyond" target="_blank">International Olympic Committee has delayed its decision</a> to select Winter Games host cities for 2030 and beyond because of the uncertainty of winter sports.</p>

<p>Major <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/14693062.2022.2147895" target="_blank">sport federations and leagues</a>, as well as the Olympics, have responded to the risks by delaying competitions to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/11/sports/soccer/fifa-world-cup-qatar.html" target="_blank">cooler times of day or year</a>, <a href="https://ausopen.com/visit/tournament-info/policies" target="_blank">implementing water breaks</a> and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/23750472.2023.2166574" target="_blank">offering more player substitutions</a>.</p>
<p>Organizers of the Tokyo Summer Games, held amid a fierce heat wave in 2021, had <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/olympic-marathon-moved-out-of-tokyo-over-heat-concerns/" target="_blank">preemptively moved the marathon to Sapporo</a>, more than 500 miles north of Tokyo, so athletes could run in cooler weather. They also delayed competitions during the Games to avoid <a href="https://doi.org/10.1265/ehpm.21-00024" target="_blank">extreme heat</a> and <a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport/olympics/57980885" target="_blank">excessive rain</a>.</p>
<h2>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Olympic progress toward sustainability</h4>

	</h2>
<p>Any large event like the Olympics can produce vast carbon emissions through its construction, transportation needs and energy use.</p>
<p>That impact, and the risks it creates for sports and their athletes, are why sustainability has been <a href="https://stillmed.olympic.org/media/Document%20Library/OlympicOrg/Olympic-Studies-Centre/List-of-Resources/Official-Publications/Olympic-Charters/EN-1996-Olympic-Charter.pdf" target="_blank">a pillar of the Olympic charter</a> since 1996 and is a focus of its <a href="https://stillmed.olympics.com/media/Document%20Library/OlympicOrg/IOC/What-We-Do/Olympic-agenda/Olympic-Agenda-2020-5-15-recommendations.pdf" target="_blank">planning for the future</a>. In 2012, the London Olympics pioneered a new <a href="https://www.iso.org/news/2012/06/Ref1598.html" target="_blank">international certification standard</a>, ISO2012, which provides guidelines for any large event to make more sustainable choices, from construction to catering.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" id="NXfD9" class="tc-infographic-datawrapper" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/NXfD9/1/" width="100%" height="400px" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></p>
<p>The 2024 <a href="https://olympics.com/ioc/news/ioc-receives-iso-20121-certification-for-sustainability-performance-at-corporate-events" target="_blank">Paris Games</a>, from July 26 to Aug. 11, and Paralympic Games, Aug. 28 to Sept. 8, are certified to the latest standard, and organizers are taking many steps to reduce their climate impact.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://medias.paris2024.org/uploads/2024/07/Paris2024-Sustainability-and-legacy-report.pdf" target="_blank">organizers plan</a> to power the events’ operations with <a href="https://olympics.com/en/paris-2024/our-commitments/the-environment/renewable-energy" target="_blank">100% renewable energy from wind and solar</a>. They are using existing venues when possible, had new ones built with low-carbon concrete and recycled materials, and brought in thousands of <a href="https://interestingengineering.com/culture/lean-green-paris-olympics" target="_blank">seats made of recycled plastic</a>.</p>
<p>All furniture and temporary buildings approved for the Games also must have a <a href="https://medias.paris2024.org/uploads/2024/07/Paris2024-Sustainability-and-legacy-report.pdf" target="_blank">contractually guaranteed second life</a>, rather than going into a landfill. All of the competition venues are on public transportation, allowing for fewer vehicles in the streets. Even the food is targeted for a 50% emissions cut compared with the average meal by increasing the use of plant-based foods. The Paralympics will use the same venues and housing in the weeks that follow.</p>
<figure class="align-center zoomable"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
<p>That doesn’t mean the 2024 Olympics won’t have a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-021-00696-5" target="_blank">large carbon footprint</a>, however, particularly <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSBRE8BB0C3/" target="_blank">as many spectators and athletes arrive by plane</a>. But the organizers are aiming for the <a href="https://medias.paris2024.org/uploads/2024/07/Paris2024-Sustainability-and-legacy-report.pdf" target="_blank">construction and operations emissions to be half</a> those of the London and Rio Games in 2012 and 2016.</p>
<h2>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">World’s fair of sustainability</h4>

	</h2>
<p>The Paris Olympic Games is an example of what large sporting events can do to reduce their impact on the <a href="https://olympics.com/en/paris-2024/information/our-legacy-and-sustainability-plan" target="_blank">environment</a> and promote sustainability solutions to a global audience. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.128475" target="_blank">Spectators will experience sustainability firsthand</a>, and organizers will promote <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s11625-021-00954-7" target="_blank">the Games’ sustainability efforts</a>.</p>
<p>Such campaigns can influence people’s <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.smr.2019.03.005" target="_blank">everyday behaviors</a> and even increase their <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s11625-021-00954-7" target="_blank">advocacy for sustainability</a> in their home communities.</p>
<p>Suggestions to <a href="https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/warming-up-9781399404525/" target="_blank">reduce the scale and size of sports events</a> or even <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/16184742.2022.2096661" target="_blank">eliminate commercialized sports</a>, ending spectator sports as we know them, overlook the ability of sports to influence and change human behavior.</p>

<p>The 2024 Olympics’ strategies, <a href="https://inside.fifa.com/social-impact/sustainability/fifa-wwc-2023-sustainability-strategy" target="_blank">building on those used in previous events</a>, and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/olympics-paris-2024-air-conditioning-climate-change-78b47a6f1bf0e1fcae9889cce9debcd9" target="_blank">what Paris learns</a> in carrying them out, will also help in planning for future events, including the 2028 Summer Games in <a href="https://www.insidethegames.biz/articles/1142249/los-angeles-clean-energy-2028-roadmap" target="_blank">Los Angeles</a>.</p>
<p>In essence, the Olympic Games, the largest sporting event in the world, is a sport sustainability world’s fair. It highlights what is possible for a sporting event through collaborations with international corporations to reduce its environmental impact. And it influences others to follow suit, whether that is other sporting events, leagues and federations or spectators from around the world.</p>

(Wally McNamee/CORBIS/ Getty Images)</p><p>Staring straight at the camera, with a grave expression on his face, the president uttered these famous words: “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3oWo26POYM" target="_blank">I shall not seek, and I will not accept</a>, the nomination of my party for another term as your president.”</p>
<p>Lyndon Johnson made that announcement at the end of his nationally televised address on the Vietnam War on March 31, 1968. Those words now echo loudly, as pundits recall them in the wake of Joe Biden’s withdrawal from the 2024 presidential election.</p>
<p>Like Biden, Johnson was a sitting Democratic president who was eligible for another term. Both men understood the odds against reelection, and both opted out. Their decisions shape their legacies as presidents who compiled impressive records yet failed to sustain their power across a longer span.</p>
<p>As the author of “<a href="https://uncpress.org/book/9781469651095/the-men-and-the-moment/" target="_blank">The Men and the Moment</a>,” a short narrative history of the presidential election of 1968, I have reflected on these parallels, too. But I think we can learn more from the differences in the circumstances of Biden’s and Johnson’s withdrawals. They illustrate the high hurdles that the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/harris-biden-presidential-candidate-election-withdraw-9fbd153493cb3f088994854fe61a73e9" target="_blank">likely Democratic presidential nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris</a>, now must clear, while also sounding a note of hope for the Democratic Party.</p>

<figure><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
<h2>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">When they did it</h4>

	</h2>
<p>One important distinction between Johnson and Biden was the nature and timing of their decisions.</p>
<p>Johnson arrived at his decision not to run for a second full term on his own, five months before the Democratic National Convention. It surprised everyone. No one expected this larger-than-life president – the force behind a massive slate of liberal government programs known as the <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/1960s/great-society" target="_blank">Great Society,</a> as well as the escalation of the Vietnam War – to voluntarily give up power.</p>
<p>But Johnson suffered as communist forces launched the <a href="https://history.state.gov/milestones/1961-1968/tet" target="_blank">Tet Offensive</a> against U.S. troops in Vietnam. At home, critics on both the right and left blasted him. He realized that he could no longer forge a consensus in Congress. He rationalized that he could serve his final year in office by crafting peace in Vietnam.</p>
<p>That choice allowed other candidates to compete for delegates, from his loyal vice president, <a href="https://www.senate.gov/senators/FeaturedBios/Featured_Bio_HumphreyHubert.htm" target="_blank">Hubert Humphrey</a>, to anti-war senators <a href="https://libguides.mnhs.org/mccarthy" target="_blank">Eugene McCarthy</a> and <a href="https://www.jfklibrary.org/learn/about-jfk/the-kennedy-family/robert-f-kennedy" target="_blank">Robert F. Kennedy</a>.</p>
<p>Biden, by contrast, renounced his nomination well after the primaries and just one month before the convention. Moreover, he succumbed to external pressure from donors and party leaders to leave the race, stemming from <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/27/politics/takeaways-biden-trump-debate/index.html" target="_blank">his disastrous performance in the June 27, 2024, debate</a>.</p>
<p>Biden’s prolonged candidacy appears to have dictated that the party anoint Harris as his successor. Can she craft a message that resonates with voters? Can she win their trust and respect?</p>
<p>Running in the primaries would have provided answers. Instead, for now, those questions linger.</p>
<h2>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Delegate selection differences</h4>

	</h2>
<p>Another divergence between 1968 and 2024 was the process of delegate selection.</p>
<p>In 1968, only a handful of states had binding primaries, where all delegates pledged their vote to the election’s winner. It was <a href="https://theconversation.com/until-1968-presidential-candidates-were-picked-by-party-conventions-a-process-revived-by-bidens-withdrawal-from-race-235082" target="_blank">more common for party insiders to choose delegates</a> through <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/reformingthepresidentialnominationprocess_chapter.pdf" target="_blank">state conventions and other bureaucratic means</a>.</p>
<p>Humphrey campaigned through the spring and summer of 1968, but he avoided primary elections. McCarthy and Kennedy battled in those primaries, each trying to claim the mantle of the popular anti-war challenger. Then <a href="https://www.historytoday.com/archive/months-past/assassination-robert-kennedy" target="_blank">Kennedy was assassinated</a> in June, and McCarthy failed to rally a viable coalition. Humphrey captured the nomination by winning the support of most Democratic officials.</p>
<p>By the next election cycle, the party had enacted reforms for choosing delegates, <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/reformingthepresidentialnominationprocess_chapter.pdf" target="_blank">including open primaries and caucuses</a>. That system remains in place now.</p>
<p>Yet this year’s extraordinary turn of events means that Harris has bypassed that system. Unlike Humphrey, she has to overcome voters’ doubts about whether she is the genuine preferred candidate of the Democratic Party.</p>
<h2>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Party unity not the same</h4>

	</h2>
<p>If these distinctions from 1968 illustrate the obstacles before Harris, a final difference suggests one of her greatest assets: She has the support of <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c51ywewzpz2o" target="_blank">almost the entire Democratic Party</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/07/21/us/biden-drops-out-election" target="_blank">including the sitting president</a>.</p>
<p>Humphrey could not say the same. His own president kept hanging him out to dry.</p>
<p>To attract voters seeking change, Humphrey needed to articulate his own position on the Vietnam War, but Johnson was unwilling to make concessions as a prelude to peace. <a href="https://theconversation.com/democrats-struggle-over-masculinity-in-an-election-50-years-ago-is-still-playing-out-today-104688" target="_blank">He bullied Humphrey</a> into supporting his tough stance, which included a reluctance to halt bombings in North Vietnam.</p>
<p>Johnson didn’t respect Humphrey. Early in the race, <a href="https://tulsaworld.com/archive/lbj-wanted-rockefeller-on-gop-ticket-ex-aide-says/article_d50acfee-b8ce-57ef-aa9b-157c87b444c1.html" target="_blank">LBJ privately beseeched Republican Nelson Rockefeller to run</a>. By the general election, Johnson seemed more politically aligned with <a href="https://www.minnpost.com/eric-black-ink/2018/12/did-lbj-want-nixon-to-beat-humphrey/" target="_blank">Republican nominee Richard Nixon</a> than with his own vice president.</p>
<figure class="align-center zoomable"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
<p>Vietnam was cleaving the party, and Humphrey could not heal the wounds. Finally, at the very end of September, Humphrey cast his independent stance on the war, pledging to halt the bombing of North Vietnam <a href="https://lbjtapes.org/conversation/hell-stop-bombing-if-elected" target="_blank">“as an acceptable risk for peace.”</a> But it was too little, too late.</p>
<p>McCarthy, his fellow Minnesotan, offered <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2010/10/26/130848492/flashback-friday-on-this-day-in-1968-mccarthy-finally-endorses-humphrey" target="_blank">the limpest of endorsements</a>, and not until one week before Election Day. In the end, Humphrey could not unite Democratic voters, and Nixon triumphed.</p>
<p>Now, for all the ideological differences among prominent Democrats, the party looks unified in its ambition to negate the threat they see in Donald Trump. Biden will almost certainly exhibit more political generosity than Johnson.</p>
<p>In addressing the monumental task of a late presidential run against the polarizing figure of Trump, Harris faces challenges that are unique in American political history. If she can overcome them, she might avoid the fate of Humphrey.</p>

Amazon owns more data centers here than anyone else, and data center energy demand is driving Dominion Energy Virginia’s plan to renege on its climate commitments, keep dirty coal plants online and build expensive new gas plants and transmission lines.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, Amazon’s announcement is so full of asterisks it looks like a starry night. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s start with the good news. Amazon’s claim that it has purchased enough renewable energy to “match” its energy use is likely true, though its </span><a href="https://sustainability.aboutamazon.com/2023-sustainability-report.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sustainability report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> doesn’t reveal essential details like how much energy the company uses. Amazon also says it is the largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy in the world, an impressive achievement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of that renewable energy is in Virginia, so it is reasonable to say it serves the company’s data centers here. A map on Amazon’s </span><a href="https://sustainability.aboutamazon.com/climate-solutions/carbon-free-energy?energyType=true" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> shows the company has invested in 19 solar farms in Virginia, with a capacity that totals around 1,386 MW  – about a quarter of all </span><a href="https://www.seia.org/state-solar-policy/virginia-solar" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">solar installed in Virginia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to date. That’s terrific. If every company operating in Virginia did as much, we’d be rolling in solar, figuratively speaking. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So what am I complaining about? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One problem is that the energy appetite of Amazon’s data centers in Virginia far outstrips the output of all of its solar farms here. The other problem is that producing renewable energy in the middle of the day can only very loosely be said to “match” energy used at other times of the day and night. Meeting energy demand on a 24/7 basis is harder, and Amazon isn’t even trying. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s start with the numbers. Because the sun doesn’t shine all the time, a large solar array produces, on average, 22-25% of what it produces on a cloudless day at noon. (That percentage is known as the facility’s capacity factor.) At a 25% capacity factor, Amazon’s 1,386 MW worth of solar panels produce enough electricity to “match” about 347 MW of demand. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon keeps its energy demand in Virginia a secret, but we can be pretty sure its </span><a href="https://baxtel.com/data-center/virginia" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">110 data centers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> here use way more than that. A 2019 </span><a href="https://www.greenpeace.org/usa/news/greenpeace-finds-amazon-breaking-commitment-to-power-cloud-with-100-renewable-energy/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Greenpeace report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> estimated Amazon’s Virginia data center demand at 1,700 MW in operation or under construction, an amount that would call for 6,800 MW of solar. Amazon rejected Greenpeace’s estimate at the time, but it didn’t supply a better one. </span><a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/environment/data-centers-virginia-amazon-environment/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">More recent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> estimates suggest Amazon’s energy appetite in Virginia is on its way to 2,700 MW, enough to require the output of around 11,000 MW of solar.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Luckily for us, Virginia is part of </span><a href="https://www.pjm.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PJM</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a regional transmission grid that covers all or parts of 13 states plus Washington, D.C. Generation sources located anywhere in the region can serve a Virginia customer, and Amazon’s map shows it has utility solar and wind projects in several PJM states. By my count, these add up to as much as 4,000 MW of additional renewable energy that could be allocated to Virginia data centers, if Amazon had no other operations in those states that it wanted to power. (Which, however, it does.)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adding together its solar in Virginia and elsewhere in PJM still leaves Amazon short of what it likely needs. So, if the company is correct that it has secured enough renewable energy to match all of its demand, a lot of those facilities must be in other regions or other countries. Yet the climate benefit of Amazon’s solar farms in (for example) Spain, which gets </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/spains-share-electricity-generated-renewables-rose-508-2023-2023-12-19/#:~:text=MADRID%2C%20Dec%2019%20(Reuters),Teresa%20Ribera%20said%20on%20Tuesday." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more than 50%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of its electricity from renewable energy, is significantly less than the climate benefit of solar in PJM, where the percentage of wind and solar combined still hangs in the </span><a href="https://www.monitoringanalytics.com/reports/Market_Messages/Messages/2022-som-pjm-press-release.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">single digits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I will – almost – give Amazon a pass on this point. PJM has been so </span><a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/pjm-interconnection-queue-solar-battery-gas-columbia-report/715620/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">appallingly slow</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to approve new generation that Amazon could well have as many projects in the “queue” as online. PJM claims it will catch up in the next year and a half, and when that happens, perhaps Amazon won’t feel the need to obfuscate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if Amazon were “matching” all its energy needs with wind and solar in PJM, though, it’s the second problem that troubles me more. Building solar and wind is cheap; Amazon very likely makes a profit on it. Actually ensuring renewable energy provides all the juice for the company’s operations every hour of every day, on the other hand, would require a heck of a lot of expensive energy storage. And Amazon is not doing that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without energy storage, solar delivers electricity only while the sun is shining. The rest of the time, Amazon’s data centers run on whatever resource mix the local utility uses. In both Virginia and PJM’s territory, fossil fuels make up the great majority of the mix. Building more Amazon data centers in Virginia increases the burning of fossil fuels, causing more pollution and raising costs that are borne by the rest of us. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The self-styled climate hero turns out to be a climate parasite, harming people to make itself look good.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Combining renewable energy with storage to achieve true carbon neutrality isn’t prohibitively expensive. Other leading tech companies seem to be making that extra effort, with Google notable for its </span><a href="https://www.google.com/about/datacenters/cleanenergy/#:~:text=Now%2C%20as%20we%20enter%20our,every%20grid%20where%20we%20operate." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">commitment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to meeting its energy demand with renewable energy and storage on a 24/7 basis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon’s failure to rise to this challenge explains why, in spite of its massive investments in wind and solar, the company’s carbon footprint actually</span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/10/24195707/amazons-carbon-emissions-fell-last-year" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> rose by 34%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> since the launch of its Climate Pledge in 2019, when it set a target of net zero carbon emissions by 2040. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That explains why, a year ago, the </span><a href="https://sciencebasedtargets.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Science Based Targets initiative</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a U.N.-backed organization that monitors corporate net-zero plans, removed Amazon from a list of companies taking action on climate goals. According to </span><a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2023-08-14/amazon-carbon-emissions-climate-change#:~:text=Amazon%20is%20removed%20from%20key,up%20about%2040%25%20since%202019." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">press reports</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Amazon failed “to implement its commitment to set a credible target for reducing carbon emissions.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among those least impressed with the company’s efforts are its own workers. Last year, Amazon Employees for Climate Justice </span><a href="https://amazonemployees4climatejustice.medium.com/amazon-is-failing-its-own-climate-pledge-c6ff60fceccd" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">accused the company</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of failing in its climate commitments, and the group released its own report this month alleging </span><a href="https://techxplore.com/news/2024-07-years-amazon-climate-pledge-workers.html#:~:text=Amazon%20Employees%20for%20Climate%20Justice%20said%20in%20its%20report%20that,other%20%22dirty%22%20energy%20sources." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">multiple climate failures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, including using “creative accounting” to inflate its achievements.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If Virginia is serious about meeting the climate challenge, we can’t blindly accept rosy claims from corporations whose central goal is not sustainability, but growth. Data centers whose energy demand isn’t met on a 24/7 basis from zero-carbon sources located on the same grid are not part of the climate solution, they are part of the problem. And currently, Amazon’s data centers are making the problem worse.</span></p>

They had two options: worse and worst.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">President Joe Biden’s Sunday concession to the ravages of advanced age (already the oldest sitting president in U.S. history, he would turn 82 just 15 days after the election) doesn’t assure the Democrats’ victory on Nov. 5. It does, however, lift the “worst” option, at least for the immediate term, and offers Virginia Democrats a glimmer of hope.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden labored under alarmingly poor job approval numbers before his abysmal performance in a June 27 debate with former President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, which raised profound questions about Biden’s mental fitness and sent his campaign into an unrecoverable death spiral.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Biden’s polling plunged, Democrats in</span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/democrats-call-biden-step-aside-tracking-updates-reactions-rcna160699" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Congress</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/11/us/politics/biden-george-clooney-hollywood.html?smid=url-share" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Hollywood</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> wrung their hands and differed publicly over whether he should abandon the race. Making things worse, Trump seemed not only invincible but inevitable after a rifle bullet grazed his right ear during a July 13 Pennsylvania campaign rally. Days later, wearing gauze over his wound, Trump was hailed as a mythic hero at the Republican National Convention.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In public polling, the separation grew wider between an ascendant Republican campaign and a Democratic one seemingly disintegrating by the day with donors threatening to close their checkbooks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the seeming red wave grew into a tsunami, not only would Democrats likely lose Virginia in a presidential race for the first time in 20 years, it could threaten them in competitive contests for open U.S. House seats their party now holds,</span><a href="https://richmond.com/opinion/column/trump-assassination-attempt-virginia-republicans-wins-democrats/article_5a927c3c-42bd-11ef-a875-57a86e762128.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">wrote Mark J. Rozell</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, dean of the George Mason University Schar School of Policy and Government.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://research.wilder.vcu.edu/commonwealth-polls/poll-archives/trump-leads-biden-by-3-points-in-virginia.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A poll of 809 Virginia adults</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> conducted by Virginia Commonwealth University’s Wilder School of Government and Public Affairs from June 24 through July 3 found that 39% favored Trump and 36% supported Biden. The results are within the poll’s margin of error of plus-or-minus 4.8 percentage points, in a survey whose outcome is further clouded because the debate occurred on day four of the 10-day survey. Even so, it’s an outcome that didn’t comfort Democrats in a state Biden won by 10 percentage points over Trump just four years ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A landslide Biden defeat that includes Virginia could even imperil the re-election of Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., against a prohibitive and little-known GOP underdog, Hung Cao, Rozell predicted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe Sunday changed that trajectory. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A more recent</span><a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2024/president/va/virginia_trump_vs_harris_vs_kennedy_vs_west_vs_stein-8518.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">New York Times/Siena College poll</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of 661 likely Virginia voters conducted July 9-12 found Vice President Kamala Harris (whom Biden endorsed to succeed him as the putative nominee) was the choice of 43% compared with 39% for Trump. That slight advantage is within the poll’s ±4.4 percentage point margin of sampling error. The survey was completed before the July 13 attempt on Trump’s life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As long as the narrative focused on Democratic disarray, Biden’s age and doubts about his ability continued, Trump and the Republicans looked unbeatable. Now the narrative changes as the Democrats have a chance to unite and put the focus back on Trump,” Rozell said in an interview Sunday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden’s retreat is “a critical reset opportunity” for Democrats, not a guarantee for success, he noted. That’s a vital distinction, given the Democrats’ demonstrated penchant for squandering opportunities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Let’s see what the Democrats make of it. There is always the chance for a different kind of disarray,” Rozell said. “Imagine if there is a strongly contested convention with multiple ballots, for example, and Harris gets nudged out.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An intramural power play that leapfrogs Harris would rip apart vital elements of the Democratic coalition — women and Black voters — and inflict long-lasting damage on the party as Trump never could. Harris, of Jamaican and South Asian descent and the daughter of immigrant parents, is the first woman ever elected on a national ticket.</span></p>

(Parker Michels-Boyce/For The Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Summertime in Virginia: Temps are sweltering and show no sign of abating. Children are out of school and bored. Various fruits and vegetables are ripe for the picking, even in this hellish heat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And cases of COVID-19,</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/national/coronavirus-us-cases-deaths/?state=US" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">the scourge of our nation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the planet, tick up around the commonwealth. It’s become a rite of the season, as common as antsy kids, forever-running air conditioning and respites at the beach.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We should get used to the seasonal increase in infections and protect ourselves as best as possible. That means: boosting our vaccines – or getting an initial one</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2021/06/16/overcoming-vaccine-hesistancy-with-fomo/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">if we’ve stubbornly refused</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">; practicing good hygiene, including washing our hands frequently; staying home if sick; and testing to detect infections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The situation now, thankfully, is far from the overwhelming terror at the height of the pandemic that began in early 2020. COVID-19</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/national/coronavirus-us-cases-deaths/?state=US" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">killed more than 1.13 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> people in the United States and infected more than 104 million, or less than one-third of the U.S. population.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, “There are people severely sick from COVID-19,” Heather Harmon-Sloan, the COVID-19 unit lead for the Virginia Department of Health, told me this week.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">“We still see people pass away.”</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/coronavirus/see-the-numbers/covid-19-in-virginia/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state listed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> no coronavirus deaths in the weeks ending June 29 and July 6. That contrasted, though, with 40 deaths reported across Virginia in the week ending Feb. 10, according to the health department.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/covid-19-virginia-pandemic-flirt-variant-vaccination/article_fcb33672-3eef-11ef-902a-b7bb2497ced7.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Richmond Times-Dispatch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> recently reported COVID-19 numbers rose in June and that the new FLiRT variant is circulating. The COVID-19 “parent” variant is SARS-CoV-2.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On June 8, the state’s confirmed cases numbered 638, and they had nearly doubled by July 6. Those numbers, though, were dwarfed by the total in December, when 5,600 cases were reported in Virginia. The newest variant has the same symptoms of upper respiratory problems, Harmon-Sloan said. Antiviral treatments should be effective.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A troubling sign is the total number of people who got the 2023-24 vaccine in Virginia, she said. A new vaccine for 2024-25 will target the FLiRT variant and probably will come out in September. The current one, though, is still available for those who didn’t get vaccinated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some 91% of Virginians has gotten</span><a href="https://usafacts.org/visualizations/covid-vaccine-tracker-states/state/virginia/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">at least one dose of the vaccine</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Seventy-seven percent were considered fully vaccinated as of May 2023. About</span><a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/epidemiology/respiratory-diseases-in-virginia/data/vaccines/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">1.34 million Virginians</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> got the latest COVID-19 vaccine, according to state records. (The state population is 8.7 million.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In order to update and restore people’s protection and immunity,” Harmon-Sloan told me, “it’s important to get the latest vaccine.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The news on infections and vaccinations was released about the same time the agency announced that a</span><a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/news/2024-regional-news-releases/southwest-virginia-health-districts-conducting-long-covid-study/" target="_blank"> l<span style="font-weight: 400;">ong COVID surveillance project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which began in October in the Central Virginia Health District, would now be open to all residents in Southwest Virginia. Long COVID means someone is still sick at least two months after getting COVID-19.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Participants must live in the following state health districts: Roanoke city and Alleghany, Central Virginia, Cumberland Plateau, LENOWISCO, Mount Rogers, New River, Pittsylvania-Danville, Southside or West Piedmont. More details are</span><a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/news/2024-regional-news-releases/southwest-virginia-health-districts-conducting-long-covid-study/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re just hoping to better understand how long COVID has affected people in their daily lives,” said Cali Anderson, senior epidemiologist for the Central Health District. “And identify opportunities to improve long COVID resources.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Symptoms can include trouble breathing, coughing and feeling weak and tired. The project has so far detected 141 cases of long COVID and fewer than five deaths in the Central Health District, which comprises the Lynchburg city and the counties of Amherst, Appomattox, Bedford and Campbell.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Tim Kaine has</span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbYVCXAUC1c" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">publicly announced he has the condition</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The Democrat has co-sponsored legislation to support long COVID sufferers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In February, the National Institutes of Health announced</span><a href="https://nih.gov/about-nih/who-we-are/nih-director/statements/nih-bolster-recover-long-covid-research-efforts-through-infusion-515-million" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">it was redirecting $515 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in federal money for the RECOVER initiative. The nationwide research program targets long COVID. The CDC says one in nine adults in the country who have had COVID-19 continue to suffer from long COVID.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nowadays, it’s comforting to go out to stores, restaurants and places of worship and feel we’re not taking our lives in our hands. Mask-wearing is mostly optional – and doesn’t cause controversy, thankfully. COVID is now considered “endemic,” what the CDC calls “the amount of a particular disease that is usually present in a community.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But COVID </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">hasn’t</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> disappeared.</span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-with-medical-conditions.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">People ages 65 and over and with certain medical conditions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> must continue to monitor the latest news and updates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be smart. Get the vaccine. Realize others might refuse – and could be infected. Be cognizant when in poorly ventilated buildings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re in a much better place today than in 2020 and 2021. Let’s work to keep it that way.</span></p>

(Photo courtesy of Carolyn Weems)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andrew Finch, who’s worked at and evaluated “recovery” high schools for more than a quarter century, has some advice for administrators who want to open such a sanctuary for teenagers battling substance abuse in South Hampton Roads:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create a school that’s distinct from the general population of students – and possibly in a separate building altogether. Keep the enrollment to no more than about 30 students at a time. Invite hospitals, colleges and other institutions to share their expertise and resources.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another thing: “People often forget they are schools,” said Finch, a professor at Vanderbilt University and a co-founder of the</span><a href="https://recoveryschools.org/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Association of Recovery Schools</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a nonprofit group based in Pennsylvania. Students are “working on high school diplomas, credits, preparing for college, the workforce. … A best practice is they have to provide a solid academic curriculum.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Opening such specialized schools is a serious, possibly expensive project. However, it’s one that educational officials should undertake if they plan smartly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">School divisions and their larger communities are helping to rehabilitate young people at a critical time in their lives – and these academies might make the difference in keeping students clean. Costs shouldn’t be ignored; neither should the fact these schools fight alcohol and drug abuse among teenagers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Beach School Board members are weighing such an initiative, and they’ve already identified some public funding. They are leading an effort that could comprise public school students in Virginia Beach, Chesapeake, Norfolk, Portsmouth and Suffolk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carolyn Weems, a longtime Virginia Beach School Board member, is a key proponent. It’s also very personal to her, since Weems lost her</span><a href="https://www.wtkr.com/investigations/lawmakers-discussing-recovery-high-school-in-hampton-roads" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">21-year-old daughter Caitlyn to a drug overdose in 2013</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While in high school, Caitlyn Weems had a soccer injury; she broke her nose and lost three teeth. She became addicted to pain medicine and had taken Oxycontin and Percocet at various times, the elder Weems told me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s unbelievable how much medicine she was on,” Weems said, noting much of it was prescribed by doctors. “It was so hard to get her help.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The General Assembly approved $750,000 over two years for a recovery academy in the region. Virginia Beach also has committed $500,000</span><a href="https://www.wavy.com/news/virginia/virginia-to-receive-over-16m-in-juul-agreement/?fbclid=IwY2xjawD7e19leHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHaSycTRJO3nwIkUi2uMO0dfR5AzRoJJ1s6FeRN31-zaKN9_MS1zTXcWdvg_aem_qt2gQQDtO9qafWGe2jSQDQ" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">from the state settlement with JUUL, the e-cigarette brand</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, involving the firm’s marketing and sales practices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other details about the proposed academy, though, haven’t been decided. They include how much money each city would contribute; where the academy would be located; and how transportation would be worked out.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/amendment/2024/1/HB30/Introduced/CR/124/13c/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Loudoun County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is also considering a recovery high school.</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/07/05/virginia-prepares-to-launch-its-first-recovery-high-school/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Such schools have been around for decades</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, though they’ve generally been clustered in about half of the states. The academies often do random drug testing to ensure the students adhere to the rules.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://drugabusestatistics.org/teen-drug-use/#virginia" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The National Center for Drug Abuse Statistics</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reports that 9% of all 12- to 17-year-olds in Virginia used alcohol in the past month, and 7% of the age group reported using drugs. One bright spot: Teenagers in the commonwealth were 16.5% less likely to have used drugs in the past month than the average American teen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hampton Roads’ developing plan will study the</span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C56ivS1e9uE&amp;t=11s" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Chesterfield Recovery Academy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as a possible model. The academy opened in August 2022,  and is a regional effort headed by Chesterfield Public Schools. It’s the first recovery school in the state, and Chesterfield’s is one of about 45 such schools nationwide. The General Assembly contributed</span><a href="https://rga.lis.virginia.gov/Published/2023/RD671/PDF" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">nearly $1.4 million to help start the Chesterfield academy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A recovery school is a good asset for any school division,” Justin Savoy, Chesterfield academy program coordinator, told me. “Unfortunately, the ease of access to drugs and alcohol has increased a lot for students.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The school takes up to 50 students but often has just 20, said Savoy, whose professional background is in mental health and substance abuse. The staff includes two academic facilitators, three clinicians and a peer recovery specialist, who is someone often maintaining sobriety. A white retriever named Lettie, a therapy dog, is part of the staff and encourages calm. Enrollment requires students to have abstained from drugs and alcohol for at least 20 days.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This past spring, 10 students graduated, he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Savoy and two of his students participated in a White House panel on recovery strategies in 2023. “There’s a lot of times when my recovery was impossible,”</span><a href="http://www.youtube.com/live/KZfZiB-WDQ8?si=yojbLf3uIIgXVSJe" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Michael Spain told the audience</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “I spent the time. I put in the work.” He said he was scheduled to join the military this year, to the cheers of attendees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michael Durchslag is director of the</span><a href="https://mtcs.org/pease/about/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">P.E.A.S.E. Academy in Minneapolis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and he’s been at the recovery school since 1995. “Many of the schools operate on a shoestring budget,” he told me, but added, “they are needed resources.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nor are they panaceas. Some students, Durchslag said, would be better treated in other settings that offer different services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What they represent is hope, for students and parents alike. That a teen might kick the habit and stay that way. That he’ll have support when he thinks about backsliding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That kind of school “would have been perfect for Caitlyn,” said Weems, the school board member.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s worth the effort to begin the academy, she added. “The things we’re doing now aren’t working.” </span></p>

Lewis High School on June 2, 2023 in Springfield, Virginia. (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The question burning at the center of American public opinion since the first presidential debate: If </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/07/11/biden-at-nato-press-conference-rebuts-doubters-im-the-best-qualified-to-govern/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">President Joe Biden</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> steps down, who will replace him as the Democratic nominee for president of the United States? The most obvious answer appears to be the nation’s second-in-command, Vice President Kamala Harris. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But her candidacy would face nearly insurmountable odds of success, if American history and recent voter polls are any indication.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not because she isn’t qualified; as the </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/11/us/politics/kamala-harris-biden-news-conference.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">president asserted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Thursday in a press conference, she is, undoubtedly. And, being decades younger than Biden and accustomed to the demands of public office, she’d likely have the energy and stamina to campaign and serve out four years of the presidency. She’s also a history maker, as the first woman, African American and South Asian American person elected vice president. There’s the rub.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://according/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Poll </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">after </span><a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/2024/national/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">poll </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">show only mere percentage points separating Biden and former President Donald Trump. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reflect on that: A huge chunk of American voters want Trump, a convicted felon whose </span><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/06/trump-racism-comments/588067/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">racist</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trump-offensive-comments-women" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sexist</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/trump-under-fire-again-for-violent-language-and-dehumanizing-anti-immigrant-rhetoric" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">violent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> rhetoric went beyond bombast before, during and after his time in the White House and was frequently reflected in his policies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If that many voters are seriously considering voting for him, then does Harris — representing so much of what Trump stands against — even stand a chance?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think that she does not,” </span><a href="https://politicalscience.vcu.edu/directory/faculty/wrighten.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jatia Wrighten, PhD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an assistant professor of political science at Virginia Commonwealth University, told me this week. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In this political climate, and historically in the country’s political climate, Americans have been hesitant to put support behind Black women at the national level,” Wrighten said. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enter </span><a href="https://nmaahc.si.edu/shirley-chisholm-president" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shirley Chisholm</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the first Black woman elected to Congress and, in 1972, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the first Black candidate to seek a major party&#8217;s nomination for President of the United States. Despite her track record of success representing New York’s 12th congressional district — including sponsoring legislation that expanded food assistance programs for low-income single mothers and drawing from her experience as an early childhood educator and authority to further Head Start and school lunch programs — her candidacy was largely viewed as a joke. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Media members, mostly white men, picked apart her appearance and dismissed her presidential run as “</span><a href="https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=J7AiAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ErMFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2935%2C941954" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">female meddling</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.” Those who seemed most likely to support Chisholm — like feminist leader Gloria Steinem and civil rights leader Rev. Jesse Jackson — instead </span><a href="https://www.biography.com/political-figures/shirley-chisholm-presidential-run" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">supported her opponent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, George McGovern. In the end, she clinched just 152 delegate votes at the Democratic National Convention that year and the party deemed McGovern their nominee. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More recently there was Stacey Abrams of Georgia, who, though seeking her state’s highest office and not the country’s, experienced many of the same obstacles Chisholm did by daring to seek public office while existing as a Black person and woman, at the same time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps as much as supporters and the media covered her work to root out voter suppression in the Peach State, Abrams’ opponents and the media zoomed in on all the wrong things, betraying a double standard, which subjects Black woman political candidates to scrutiny that white candidates, male or female, just aren’t.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They talked about [Abrams] being single, her </span><a href="https://medium.com/@mnhoskin25/the-real-reasons-stacey-abrams-may-have-lost-georgias-gubernatorial-race-b21dbc6e8a2b" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">weight</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, how dark she was, on top of examining the things we look at with any candidate, like how qualified she was, her education, how well spoken she was,” Wrighten said. Heightening all of this is the fact that dark-skinned, kinky-haired Chisholm and Abrams don’t mirror classic American beauty standards, derived from European ideals of fair skin, straight hair, a narrow nose and a thin physique. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Concerning Black women in American politics, Wrighten posited, “Being overweight matters, having darker skin matters, having natural hair matters…and it shouldn’t. Black women candidates are faced with this standard of beauty that others don&#8217;t have to contend with.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The same sentiments that poisoned Chisholm’s candidacy and Abrams’ governor’s race still exist in America and would pose a serious hurdle to Harris’ victory, said Wrighten.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“At the national level, there&#8217;s a lot of media attention that works against Black women. There&#8217;s a lot of bias, there are stereotypes at play that hurt Black women especially. There&#8217;s still a sense that women are unfit for the office.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another obstacle Harris could encounter if she tried to make the leap from VP to commander-in-chief: &#8220;I think established Democrats would have an issue with [Harris] running; there&#8217;s this sense of, you have to put your time in, pay your dues,&#8221; Wrighten said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That dynamic is familiar is Virginia state politics, too, evidenced by the establishment Dems putting their weight behind Terry McAuliffe&#8217;s 2021 run for governor — a role he&#8217;d already held, in addition to chairing the Democratic National Committee 2001-2005 and Hilary Clinton&#8217;s presidential campaign in 2008 and co-chairing former President Bill Clinton&#8217;s 1996 reelection campaign — instead of the Jennifers, McClellan and Carol Foy. Both Black women  — with their bold ideas, statehouse experience and lots of public support — had the potential to be Virginia&#8217;s first Black woman governor. Instead, McClellan and Carol Foy&#8217;s prospects were blunted because their party&#8217;s heavy hitters backed McAuliffe (who then lost to Gov. Glenn Youngkin).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s also the lingering effects from the Obama era that would likely damage Harris’ chance to be commander-in-chief. The election of the country’s first Black president ushered in a double-edged sword: a “post-racial era” (yeah right) marked by more opportunities and tangible progress for historically oppressed, disenfranchised groups, most notably Black Americans. The flipside was a seething resentment of that progress mostly expressed by the historically powerful group that orchestrated the oppression and disenfranchisement, white Americans. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“From the tea party’s racially tinged attacks on the president’s policy agenda to the ‘birther’ movement’s more overtly racist fantasies asserting that Obama was not even an American citizen, the national racial climate grew more, and not less, fraught” after Obama’s presidency, wrote historian Peniel Joseph, director of the Center for the Study of Race and Democracy and the LBJ School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas, in a 2016 Washington Post </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/national/obama-legacy/racism-during-presidency.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">series</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Obama’s legacy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Obama’s presidency, flesh-and-blood proof of the nation’s shifting demographics and values, fueled a public sentiment held by many white Americans “that Black people were getting perks they didn&#8217;t deserve,” Wrighten said. “So we see this pushback against that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of this consideration may be for nought, as Biden again reiterated Thursday that he intends to stay in the race, despite any voter polling indicating Harris would fare better against Trump than he would. But should Harris come to the forefront as the nominee, she’ll have a tough time ahead of her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think she’ll continue to be sexualized,” Wrighten said, referring to the </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/10/07/kamala-harris-sexist-racist-attacks-spread-online/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">unfounded rumors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that emerged almost as soon as Biden announced Harris as his VP in 2020. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">There will continue to be this idea that she didn&#8217;t earn what she has.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are 59 countries of the United Nations’ 193 member states who have elected women heads of government, a number that has </span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/03/28/women-leaders-around-the-world/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“risen steadily”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> since 1990. It doesn’t seem likely that November’s presidential election will put America on that list; since George Washington’s election in 1789, America’s presidents have always been men. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think that the U.S. should take a long hard look at itself when we&#8217;re thinking about who can be a leader and what they look like,” Wrighten said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I also think there’s ample evidence to suggest that some serious self-examination is in order, on a national scale. The reality is, only Americans can transform the nation into one that would actually support and enable Harris, or any other woman or woman of color, becoming president. But it doesn’t appear we’re in a particularly reflective mood. </span></p>

(J.D. Pooley/Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we age, we face a myriad of new challenges. For a growing sector of older Americans, housing instability and homelessness is a daunting challenge they must now navigate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reality across Virginia – and the nation – is that the number of seniors experiencing homelessness is on the rise. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, </span><a href="https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/ahar/2023-ahar-part-1-pit-estimates-of-homelessness-in-the-us.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Point in Time homelessness counts from the summer of 2023, the most recent statewide data, found that more than 1,500 adults who are over 55 experience homelessness in the commonwealth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New data from some of the state’s most populous regions underscore the rise in seniors facing homelessness. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The largest share of single adults experiencing homelessness in the metropolitan D.C. area, including Northern Virginia, was above the age of 65, according to information from that region’s 2024 Point in Time count. In Fairfax County specifically, there was a 6.5% increase in people over 55 experiencing homelessness.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2024 Point in Time count in Hampton Roads found that 27% of people experiencing homelessness in that region were 55 or older. </span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="P3GdC6l3z9"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/03/26/newest-anti-homeless-project-builds-on-strong-efforts-statewide/">Newest anti-homelessness project builds on strong efforts statewide</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Newest anti-homelessness project builds on strong efforts statewide&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/03/26/newest-anti-homeless-project-builds-on-strong-efforts-statewide/embed/#?secret=d621DS7a0o#?secret=P3GdC6l3z9" data-secret="P3GdC6l3z9" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the Richmond region, data from local Point in Time counts show that the number of adults 55 and older who are served by regional homeless service providers increased from 29% in 2018 to 40% in 2024. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These trend lines are all moving in the same direction and accelerating, which should create a shared  sense of urgency to address the growing number of older adults experiencing homelessness. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortunately, agencies focused on older adults and homeless services organizations that serve seniors have a deep understanding of the needs of older adults and the solutions to meet those needs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Older adults face unique challenges, including a greater need for medical care, mobility issues, transportation needs, and higher rates of disability than other groups. Additionally, older adults are less likely to work or generate income. They’re often on a fixed income, so as prices for housing and food rise, they may be less able to adapt as quickly as the market changes and are therefore more likely to face financial hardships or to be pushed into poverty and homelessness. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Partnerships between homeless service providers and agencies focused on older adults have proven highly effective to ensure that existing resources are aligned to best support the needs of older adults. As part of these partnerships, groups work closely to share best practices and connect seniors to resources. For example, emergency shelters are adapting to provide more accessible space and deepen partnerships with healthcare providers to offer additional services for seniors in shelters. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Homeless service providers are also working with area agencies on aging in Virginia, like Senior Connections, to partner with Medicaid to meet the supportive and healthcare needs of seniors experiencing homelessness. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although we maximize the resources we have, the reality remains that those resources are not enough. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are three tangible ways that all Virginians can help and support older adults experiencing homelessness: </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, you can create care kits for older adults. Distributed at emergency shelters and elsewhere, these care kits provide some basic necessities, including soap, toothpaste and toothbrush and deodorant. For older adults, add lotions and wipes. You can contact local shelters in your region about creating and donating care kits.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Second, you could support emergency shelters with donations or by volunteering so that shelter staff can focus on working with seniors by helping them connect to resources and find stable, safe homes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Third, Virginians can advocate at the General Assembly and within their locality for more  affordable housing that includes universal design, which ensures accessibility and makes it easier for someone to age in place. Ultimately, we need more homes that all seniors can live in and afford. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All our neighbors should be able to age with dignity and respect. It’s critical that we support older adults facing homelessness and work to prevent homelessness in the first place. </span></p>

																						<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="1024" height="668" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/internetphoto-1024x668.jpeg" class="attachment-large size-large wp-post-image" alt="" style="margin-bottom: 10px;" decoding="async" loading="lazy" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/internetphoto-1024x668.jpeg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/internetphoto-300x196.jpeg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/internetphoto-768x501.jpeg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/internetphoto-1536x1002.jpeg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/internetphoto-2048x1336.jpeg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p style="font-size:12px;">(Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Somehow, we were not prepared for this. Artificial intelligence was in development for decades, during which time we fantasized about all the wonderful things it was going to do for us. And then the bots launched almost fully formed like Athena springing from the forehead of Zeus with her sword in hand, and only then did we have our epiphany: Oh man, this is not going to go well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What happened to the AI utopia? We were expecting self-driving cars that would let us drink too much on nights out while eliminating highway fatalities. We anticipated the seamless integration of all our devices and appliances, maybe even without cords! We imagined an unlocking of efficiencies at home and at work; medical breakthroughs; scientific innovation on steroids. We’d have three-day workweeks and go hiking on the weekends while the robots cooked and cleaned. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe these things are still there in our future, along with world peace, but so far what we’ve got is a new way for kids to cheat on homework, a lot of derivative art, pernicious deepfakes and raging arguments over intellectual property theft. Oh, and an unprecedented increase in the demand for electricity that threatens to overwhelm the grid and make it impossible for us to stop burning fossil fuels before global warming destabilizes societies worldwide. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The wonder is why we thought this would go well. Shouldn’t we have known ourselves better?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In my view, the biggest problem with AI is that either humans are in charge, or the robots are. If it’s the robots, there is a good chance they will decide to kill us all, and </span><a href="https://news.berkeley.edu/2024/04/09/how-to-keep-ai-from-killing-us-all/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">we won’t see it coming</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. So we need to root for the humans, who could use the powerful new tools of AI to address hunger and climate change but so far mostly use it for </span><a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/financial-services/financial-services-industry-predictions/2024/deepfake-banking-fraud-risk-on-the-rise.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">financial fraud</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/charlotte-child-sexual-abuse-material-case-shows-unsettling-reach-of-ai-generated-imagery" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">child pornography</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and adding to the absurd percentage of the internet </span><a href="https://blog.purestorage.com/perspectives/how-much-of-the-worlds-data-is-cat-content/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">devoted to cat memes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And instead of helping to lower CO2 emissions, right now the effect of AI is to increase the burning of fossil fuels. U.S. electricity consumption had </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/03/13/climate/electric-power-climate-change.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">flatlined</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after the mid-2000s, but AI is pushing it up again, and sharply. Data centers, where AI “lives,” could consume </span><a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/artificial-intelligence-doubles-data-center-demand-2030-EPRI/717467/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">as much as 9%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of U.S. electricity generation by 2030, double that of today. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have a close-up view of this in Virginia, the data center capital of the world. In 2022, when I first tried to quantify Virginia’s </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/12/09/virginia-has-a-data-center-problem/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">data center problem</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, industry sources put the state’s data center demand at 1,688 megawatts (MW) — equivalent to about 1.6 million homes. With the advent of AI and its enormous appetite for power, the industry added 4,000 MW of new data centers in 2023. By the end of last year, data centers </span><a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/dominion-connected-15-data-centers-totaling-933mw-in-virginia-in-2023-15-more-expected-in-2024/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">commanded fully 24%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the total electricity generated by Dominion Energy Virginia, the state’s largest utility. Over the next 15 years, Virginia’s data center demand is expected to </span><a href="https://www.pjm.com/-/media/library/reports-notices/load-forecast/2024-load-report.ashx" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">quadruple</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Citing the need to supply data centers with power, Dominion did an about-face on its </span><a href="https://esg.dominionenergy.com/assets/pdf/2022-Climate-Report.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050. It now </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/05/03/dominion-projects-new-gas-plants-advanced-nuclear-will-be-needed-to-meet-soaring-demand/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">proposes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to keep coal plants running past their previous retirement dates, and to build new gas-powered generation. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The problem is not confined to Virginia. Across the country, utilities are struggling to meet AI’s increased energy demand, and </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/03/13/climate/electric-power-climate-change.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">looking to fossil fuels</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to fill the gap. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And while tech companies talk a good game about meeting their power demand sustainably, the evidence says otherwise. Tech companies conspicuously </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/08/16/why-are-ratepayers-footing-the-bill-for-virginias-data-center-buildout/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">did not push back</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Dominion Energy’s plan, and their own efforts fall woefully short. Even Google, which has taken its carbon-cutting obligations more seriously than most companies, just reported a </span><a href="https://sustainabilitymag.com/articles/emissions-up-13-how-can-google-make-ai-data-sustainable" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">13% rise</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in its greenhouse gas emissions in 2023, thanks to its investments in AI and data centers.  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apparently, Google and its competitors in the race to dominate AI think meeting climate goals is like getting a loan from a bank; you emit more today, grow your business and use the profits to clear the debt by emitting a lot less tomorrow. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Mother Earth is not a bank. She is a loan shark, and she has started breaking fingers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we can’t rely on the inventors of AI to restrain their energy appetites, we have to turn to our politicians (sigh). Our leaders have to make and enforce limits on the growth of AI commensurate with the world’s ability to provide the resources without baking the planet. Admittedly, mustering that kind of willpower is hard to do in a country that has elevated corporations to personhood and defines the First Amendment to include both spreading lies and spending money to influence elections. </span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Y9aoRiEtAW"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/02/05/virginia-legislators-should-be-learning-all-they-can-about-ai/">Virginia legislators should be learning all they can about AI</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And that gets us to the second-biggest concern I have about AI, but the one that might upend society soonest: the unleashing of deepfakes in this fall’s elections, and the threat that the reins of government will go not to those most dedicated to tackling hard problems, but to those who prove themselves the biggest scoundrels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The American Bar Association (ABA) </span><a href="https://www.americanbar.org/groups/leadership/office_of_the_president/american-democracy/resources/deepfakes-american-elections/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">defines deepfakes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as “hoax images, sounds and videos</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">that convincingly depict people saying or doing things that they did not actually say or do.” Noting that they have already been used in election campaigns in the U.S. and abroad, the ABA is promoting model state legislation to criminalize the creation of malicious deepfakes. Meanwhile, tech companies including </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/google-require-disclosures-digitally-altered-content-election-ads-2024-07-01/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google and Meta</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have adopted advertising policies to require disclosures of altered content. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both approaches are good as far as they go; websites should police content, and states should act swiftly to outlaw the deepfakes (though the ABA lists very few that have done so yet). But in a high-stakes situation like an election, punishing violators after the fact – if you can catch them at all – is very much a case of closing the barn door after the horses are out. Once voters have been exposed to “evidence” of a candidate’s unfitness for office, especially when media coverage has primed them to believe the lies, the damage is done. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many voters, especially younger ones, are savvy enough to be wary of campaign-related materials generally, and of unattributed images that float around the internet in particular. But older people who came of age in the pre-internet-memes era are vulnerable to believing what they see and hear, and a lot of us won’t put ourselves to the trouble of questioning what feels true. A deepfake only has to fool some of the people some of the time to alter the results of an election.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But maybe I’m being needlessly alarmist about the dangers of AI, even if I have </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/14/business/artificial-intelligence-ceos-warning/index.html#:~:text=Forty%2Dtwo%20percent%20of%20CEOs,interviehttps://www.cnn.com/2023/06/14/business/artificial-intelligence-ceos-warning/index.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a lot of company</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. So I did the obvious thing: I asked a bot if AI would save humanity or kill us all. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ChatGPT responded with a list of pros and cons of AI, including the familiar benefits and concerns that have spawned a thousand op-eds. You can try this at home, so I won’t reiterate them here. But I will note the curious fact that the bot didn’t mention either carbon emissions or election-altering deepfakes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe that’s an oversight, or maybe it means my fears are unwarranted. But maybe it shows something even scarier than AI itself: It’s AI pretending it isn’t trying to take over.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We urgently need action from U.S. and corporate leaders. Stiff new taxes on data center energy use would lead to greater efficiencies and nudge companies to price data storage and AI use appropriately. New laws should put the onus on internet platforms to stop deepfakes before they can spread. Tech companies should prioritize what is good for human beings over what is good for corporate profit. If they can’t ensure AI is used only for good, they should pull the plug until they can.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If all this doesn’t happen, and soon – well, let’s just hope the robots are kind. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not long ago, in vitro fertilization — the medical process by which human sperm and ovum are united in clinical conditions outside a woman’s body and later implanted, giving the otherwise childless a chance at having a child — would have met scant resistance in the chambers of political power.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Welcome to 2024 and the looming American dystopia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, Virginia’s Democratic U.S. senators, Tim Kaine and Mark Warner, were copatrons (along with most of the Senate’s Democratic conference) of a bill sponsored by Sens. Tammy Duckworth and Patty Murray that would establish legal protections for IVF.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill was in response to an</span><a href="https://publicportal-api.alappeals.gov/courts/68f021c4-6a44-4735-9a76-5360b2e8af13/cms/case/343d203a-b13d-463a-8176-c46e3ae4f695/docketentrydocuments/e3d95592-3cbe-4384-afa6-063d4595aa1d" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">extraordinary ruling</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in February by Alabama’s Supreme Court that outlawed IVF. It held that embryos frozen in liquid nitrogen at a temperature of 320 degrees below zero Fahrenheit are legally no different from a newborn in its mother’s arms or a kindergartner on a school bus. Since there are more embryos on ice than a woman could reasonably carry to term, the choice becomes whether to leave them frozen permanently or, eventually, to destroy them. To IVF foes, that’s homicide.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ruling instantly suspended IVF procedures across Alabama and produced panic and heartbreak among aspiring parents for whom it was their best, or last, shot at having offspring and had spent many thousands of dollars out of pocket toward that end.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to our sister publication, The</span><a href="https://alabamareflector.com/2024/02/19/alabama-supreme-court-ruling-could-end-ivf-treatments-in-state/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Alabama Reflector</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Justice Jay Mitchell tied his majority opinion to a state law enacted seven years after the Civil War authorizing lawsuits over the wrongful deaths of children and a</span><a href="https://www.al.com/news/2018/11/alabama-passes-anti-abortion-amendment.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">2018 Alabama constitutional amendment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that requires the state to “ensure the protection of the rights of the unborn child.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mitchell wrote that neither specified an exception for frozen embryos. That goes without saying for the statute, passed 106 years before the first birth from an extracorporeal conception, when electricity was in its infancy and refrigeration was decades in the future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Greater illumination into motivations behind the decision, however, derive from a concurring opinion by Alabama’s chief justice, Tom Parker, that reads more like a sermon than a legal treatise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…[E]ven before birth, all human beings bear the image of God, and their lives cannot be destroyed without effacing his glory,” Parker wrote. “We believe that each human being, from the moment of conception, is made in the image of God, created by Him to reflect His likeness.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state constitutional amendment, which conveys personhood at a somewhat uncertain instant of conception, was approved by Alabama’s conservative, largely evangelical and fundamentalist religious electorate six years ago to deter abortion. When the court applied it to IVF, however, the volume and intensity of the resulting outrage sent the Republican-ruled legislature scurrying back to Montgomery to promptly enact legislation that put IVF clinics back in operation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s a place for proselytizing — by </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">all</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> faiths — and it should be afforded all the robust protections of our First Amendment. But the First Amendment also prohibits the government from establishing a religion, a safeguard against an American theocracy enacted by founders who bore the Church of England’s yoke before winning independence from Britain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When religion — in this case, segments of Christianity — muscles its doctrines into public policy to be imposed upon those who don’t share them, the resulting conflict is uncivil and ubiquitous. It produces the sort of uncompromising, paralyzed politics that grips our nation’s tribalized culture today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Polling consistently shows majorities of Americans support abortion rights in some form. A</span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/03/25/what-the-data-says-about-abortion-in-the-us/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">recent poll</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the Pew Research Center says 62% of Americans surveyed believe abortion should be legal in all or most cases. A</span><a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/506759/broader-support-abortion-rights-continues-post-dobbs.aspx" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Gallup survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found that 69% said abortions should generally be legal in the first trimester. Support for abortions declines the longer a fetus progresses toward birth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As this near-existential election year moves toward its decisive conclusion on Nov. 5, one of the few issues that augurs in favor of Democrats is that of women&#8217;s reproductive freedom. Until recently, that was abortion, particularly after the U.S. Supreme Court’s</span><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/19-1392_6j37.pdf" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> decision struck down 49 years of federal protections for abortion access and made abortion a state-by-state issue. Virginia is the lone southern state that has not banned or severely curbed abortion access.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It galvanized abortion rights voters, especially women, and staunched what was expected to be a crimson wave midterm congressional election for Republicans in 2022. Rather than win back a Senate majority as predicted, Democrats narrowly retained power after a late November runoff election in Georgia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which brings us back to June’s effort in the Senate to codify IVF protections. It failed on a near party-line vote with 47 Republicans in opposition. Forty-four Democrats, two Republicans and two independents voted for it, but that’s shy of the 60 votes needed to advance bills in the Senate. But even in its demise, it served a purpose.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s no small amount of partisan theater in votes like these, particularly in high-stakes election years. The goal is to force one party to take damaging, adversarial votes that the other party can use to rally sympathetic voters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is the normal course of events in Congress in election years,” said Stephen Farnsworth, professor of political science and director of the Center for Leadership and Media Studies at</span><a href="https://cas.umw.edu/polisci/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Mary Washington University</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Fredericksburg. “Legislating may be the driving factor in year one, but demonizing your opponent is the prominent factor in year two of the election cycle.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Both parties do this. The Republicans, when they were in the majority, forced the Democrats to take tough votes on immigration and, when Obamacare was unpopular, Republicans pushed for Obamacare votes,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine stands to be a direct beneficiary of the IVF bill’s death. He’s on this fall’s ballot seeking his third Senate term and hitting his Republican challenger, retired Navy officer Hung Cao, relentlessly on the reproductive rights issue. Cao</span><a href="https://www.fauquier.com/news/wexton-cao-clash-on-abortion-va-policies-for-transgender-students-in-first-debate/article_c835174e-4379-11ed-a0a6-bf53776c5ea8.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">said in a debate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for a U.S. House seat two years ago that life “begins at conception” and he felt compelled to protect it.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="1TycpL7oXZ"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/17/they-dont-like-abortion-but-kaines-gop-challengers-say-they-wont-seek-a-federal-ban/">They don’t like abortion, but Kaine’s GOP challengers say they won’t seek a federal ban</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;They don’t like abortion, but Kaine’s GOP challengers say they won’t seek a federal ban&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/17/they-dont-like-abortion-but-kaines-gop-challengers-say-they-wont-seek-a-federal-ban/embed/#?secret=D0tWTjZNl3#?secret=1TycpL7oXZ" data-secret="1TycpL7oXZ" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other Democrats can reap a residual benefit by using the outcome in a broader message about a GOP threat to women’s rights, particularly in two of the nation’s most fiercely contested U.S. House races. Incumbent Democratic Reps. Abigail Spanberger and Jennifer Wexton — both forceful advocates for reproductive rights — are leaving seats they won in 2018 in Virginia’s 7th and 10th congressional districts, respectively. Spanberger is a 2025 candidate for governor and Wexton is departing for health reasons.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The painful reality about politics these days is that we’re talking about trench warfare,” Farnsworth said. “An unpopular vote here, an unpopular vote there may weaken a party in a swing district.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spanberger’s seat is a prime example, he said. “In that Washington-area district, the greater the focus is on the Dobbs decision and IVF, the better for a Democratic candidate.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Women are a potent voting bloc. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pissed off</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> women are a force of nature.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a year when Kaine and down-ballot Democrats swim upstream against unfavorable issues such as the economy, immigration and an octogenarian president whose recent debate debacle leaves overwhelming majorities —</span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/poll-debate-should-biden-be-running-mental-abilities/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">72%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — believing he’s too old to perform, a force of nature is a comforting thing to have.</span></p>

The monument is inscribed with the names of 122,000 families listed in the 1870 census, the first in which many former enslaved people were recorded. (Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)</p><p>You can’t understand the scope of 122,000 names until you see them on a wall.</p>
<p>Stand at the foot of the National Monument to Freedom, <a href="https://alabamareflector.com/2024/06/19/equal-justice-initiative-dedicates-monument-to-slavery-survivors-at-montgomery-memorial-park/" target="_blank">recently dedicated by the Equal Justice Initiative</a> in Montgomery, and you’ll see all of them, soaring <a href="https://eji.org/news/national-monument-to-freedom-dedication-honors-millions-of-enslaved-black-americans-and-their-descendants/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">three or four stories above your head</a>.</p>
<p>Each name, taken from the 1870 census, belonged to a former enslaved person. These are surnames. Family names. Combined, they represent about 4 million people who emerged from bondage.</p>
<div>
<div>Each one stands for an American once treated as an animal. Someone who could be abused and assaulted under the law. Who could be stripped naked in front of a crowd of rich men; poked and prodded, and sold away from parents, spouses and children.</div>
<div></div>
</div>
<p>You get a taste of this horror in a park surrounding the monument and along a path leading to it. There are slave cabins. And a rail car that transported human beings like cattle. Surrounding all of it are statistics that measure toll of human bondage; stories that illustrate it, and carvings of the laws that upheld it.</p>
<p>There’s this chilling statistic from EJI: about 6 million Americans died as the property of someone else.</p>
<p>By the time you reach that wall, you know that each name represents not just those who survived, but dozens if not hundreds of people who lived and died as prisoners. Each one stands atop a mountain of pain and trauma, deposited like sediment over generations.</p>
<p>It’s led me to think about a phrase that seems inescapable when we approach federal holidays like Independence Day.</p>
<p>Freedom isn’t free.</p>

<p>I’ve heard it invoked many times over the last 23 years. The slogan is usually employed to bludgeon critics of the nation’s disastrous military actions following 9/11.</p>
<p>But the National Monument to Freedom gives the phrase a new meaning.</p>
<p>When the United States came into being on July 4, 1776, each of its 13 constituent parts allowed enslavement. Congress struck out a paragraph <a href="https://www.blackpast.org/african-american-history/declaration-independence-and-debate-over-slavery/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">condemning the slave trade</a> from an early draft of the Declaration of Independence. There was never anything condemning slavery itself.</p>
<p>Human bondage declined during the Revolution, particularly in South Carolina and Georgia. In Generations of Captivity, a history of slavery, historian Ira Berlin writes that the enslaved population in Georgia fell two-thirds between 1775 and 1783. It fell by a quarter in South Carolina during that period.</p>
<p>That was due to chaos, not ideals. In a revolution, state authority collapses. Without state authority, it’s hard to keep people subjugated. And enslaved people took advantage of the opportunity.</p>
<p>But war is a poor liberator. Slavery reasserted itself in both states within a decade. And there was nothing on paper that would have kept it from going on forever.</p>
<p>Except Americans.</p>
<p>Enslaved people resisted in ways large and small, defending their humanity in a system determined to rob them of it.</p>
<p>It was two enslaved people — <a href="https://www.mass.gov/guides/massachusetts-constitution-and-the-abolition-of-slavery" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mum Bett and Quock Walker</a> — who pushed Massachusetts courts to declare in 1781 and 1783 that the state’s new constitution had abolished slavery.</p>
<p>It was Black men and women, aided by white allies, who ran the Underground Railroad and put themselves on the line to get people out of slavery.</p>
<p>None of this was easy. Success was not guaranteed. It took centuries to end the institution. Every member of every family listed on the National Monument to Freedom knew someone – a parent, a child, a loved one – who lived and died as someone else’s property.</p>
<p>But by the eve of the Civil War, the work of brave men and women had broken through in the north. And created a bloc of politicians whose primary goal was putting slavery on the path to extinction, if not abolishing it outright.</p>
<p>That came from people on the margins of society, demanding what had been denied them: respect; the rule of law and a voice in their governance.</p>
<p>Freedom isn’t free. But it’s not armed conflict that pushes freedom forward. More often than not, it’s the person <a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part4/4p1539.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wounded by power at its most nihilistic</a> who broadens the boundaries of liberty. It’s the lawyer who helps register voters <a href="https://alabamareflector.com/2023/05/22/arthur-madison-and-the-long-afterlife-of-courage/" target="_blank">in defiance of a regime</a> working to stop it. And it’s the people who march for their rights <a href="https://nmaahc.si.edu/explore/stories/onthisday-bloody-sunday" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with law enforcement against them</a>.</p>
<p>These men and women push past the inertia of the ordinary to grab an ideal that seems impossible.</p>
<p>If we can celebrate a free society on Thursday, it’s not because of centuries-old philosophers or decades-old battles. It’s because Americans who were not free took risks and made sacrifices that lifted this nation higher than it was before.</p>
<p>The 122,000 names on the National Monument to Freedom testify to the enormity of that task. And remind us that the seed of justice is often planted in those who have the least of it.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a joke in development economics: it helps to pick your parents. It’s a tongue-in-cheek reference to outcome disparities based on both where a person is born and what their parents do for a living. My mom&#8217;s family is from Western Pennsylvania between Pittsburgh and the Ohio border – an area that reminds me a lot of Southwest and Southside Virginia.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I saw how macroeconomic decline during the 1980s and 1990s limited my family’s options. After my uncle lost his job in a steel mill, he had to drive six hours each day for work because the only decent job he could find was in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Ultimately, he ended up sleeping at a friend’s place in Harrisburg four days a week for over 20 years, only seeing the family on weekends until he retired. My cousin, who is almost the same age as me (I&#8217;m 43), works irregularly in food service and the gig economy to make ends meet. College wasn’t for him but the new economy that took root in Pittsburgh required advanced degrees even for entry-level roles. Now his future is even more uncertain as the</span><a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/covid-19/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">economy of rural America struggles to regain its footing after COVID-19.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following my parent’s divorce, I grew up in two neighborhoods: Arlington,/East Falls Church (EFC) in Northern Virginia and Hill East in Washington, D.C. Both were very much working-class neighborhoods back then; neither are now. Hill East was around 90% blue-collar African American. Today, the neighborhood is upwards of 80% non-Hispanic White with at least 50% of the population having graduate degrees. This change is reflected in rents, housing prices and property tax burdens that most of the people I grew up with can no longer afford. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similarly, EFC was once full of teachers, police officers, administrators — even my elementary school&#8217;s custodian lived there. Now, only people like lawyers, finance professionals, and c-suite executives make enough to buy there. A vast majority of the residents of Hill East and EFC were able to wait out the most serious impacts of COVID-19 in relative comfort; the rest of Virginia wasn’t as lucky. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a public policy researcher, I constantly think about structure — the things that affect a person’s outcomes but are largely pre-existing and/or beyond their ability to control. Structure-based outcomes are something I’ve seen consistently throughout both my personal and professional lives. Studying the COVID-19 pandemic was no different. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://data.census.gov/table/ACSDP1Y2021.DP03?q=DP03&amp;g=050XX00US51013,51015" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the height of the COVID-19 pandemic</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, at least 49% of Arlington residents worked from home. Meanwhile in Augusta County near the West Virginia border, only 8% of workers were able to do the same. The most common industries in Arlington are classified as professional, scientific, and management while the most common industries in Augusta are educational services, health care and manufacturing. Through 2021, Augusta’s age-adjusted COVID-19 death rate was 2.25 times higher than Arlington’s, despite Arlington’s population density being 115 times greater. As a community-based researcher at VCU, I’ve seen a similar dynamic play out inside the City of Richmond between different groups that share the same spaces. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The common themes here are:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 1.) Marginalized groups have often been left behind because they are forced to accept more vulnerable, less-decent employment and housing options.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2.) They generally don’t have the resources to break this cyclical poverty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">3.) Government programs designed to address these issues suffer from major gaps.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">4.) These inequities inevitably lead to other serious outcome disparities, like what we saw during the COVID-19 pandemic.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212420924003583?via%3Dihub" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">My recent research</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, co-authored with Dr. Brittany “Brie” Haupt, illuminates how these differences in structure guided COVID-19’s disproportionate impacts in rural and minority communities in Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the county and independent city level, we started with a simple correlational analysis that showed Virginia municipalities with greater percentages of African Americans and those outside of metropolitan statistical areas suffered greater levels of COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations and death rates (both crude and age-adjusted). We then took socio-economic data collected before the COVID-19 pandemic to analyze how structure interacted with race and rurality to produce these disparate COVID-19 outcomes. Using a procedure called structural equation modeling , we partialed out direct and indirect effects, as well as analyzed likely causality direction by modifying the covariance functions and comparing their likelihoods.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In our model, we were able to isolate a set of workforce roles as the primary cause of disproportionate infections in more rural and minority communities. Once we included a variable for this, the direct covariance between race, rurality and COVID-19 infection rates lost statistical significance in the case of rurality, and, in the case of race, became a statistically significant negative. Additional analyses showed there was still a statistically significant positive indirect path. Similarly, once we added data to our model on underlying community health (diabetes, premature death rates, etc.), the direct paths between race, rurality and COVID-19 hospitalizations and age-adjusted death rates lost statistical significance. Also similarly, statistically significant positive indirect paths remained. Thus, we believe we likely isolated the biggest drivers of COVID-19’s disproportionate impacts in marginalized communities.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our conclusions are fairly straightforward — before vaccine uptake was widely utilized, patients with COVID-19 either made it through or perished based on their underlying health status and other characteristics. These traits are not randomly distributed throughout Virginia’s population, rather they are concentrated based on the structures many people are either born into, migrate to, or are displaced to. We believe future pandemics will play out in similar fashion given the nature of epidemiology.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, chronic conditions like diabetes and hypertension — which were the biggest driver of COVID-19 deaths in our model — are managed and reduced instead of cured. This requires sustained resources for years if not decades. Unfortunately for many people and localities that need them, these resources are either not currently available, affordable or feasible, given the dynamics of structure. The at-risk jobs we identified in our model are less likely to offer health insurance or pay high wages but they are unstable and often lack promotion potential. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Local governments in these areas are often not able to offset this because of the same economic structures that affect employment opportunities. Local governments rely overwhelmingly on business and property taxes. But if an area is economically distressed and/or has a greater marginalized population, this means that the government  has less money but also a greater need. Thus, even with the CARES Act, we saw how metropolitan areas like the city of Richmond were able to provide more resources to local businesses during COVID-19 than rural areas like Lee County. Similarly, we cannot expect marginalized or declining areas to stockpile resources on their own before the next pandemic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an era when Virginia</span><a href="https://www.wric.com/news/virginia-news/latest-estimate-shows-virginia-with-5-1-billion-surplus-youngkin-calls-for-more-tax-cuts/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">consistently sees record revenue surpluses in the billions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, there is no good reason why health disparities, especially like what we observed during the COVID-19 pandemic, should be so stark or consistent. In 2022, the U.S. Census Bureau listed Virginia as the 13</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><a href="https://data.census.gov/table/ACSDT1Y2022.B19013?g=010XX00US,$0400000&amp;moe=false" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">wealthiest state by median income</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and the same year, Virginia’s health system was ranked 20</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> out of 50 states</span><a href="https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/scorecard/2022/jun/2022-scorecard-state-health-system-performance" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">by the Commonwealth Fund</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. There are 86 Virginia jurisdictions  currently</span><a href="https://www.vhcf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/MUAs_Localities_in_Virginia_3_3_23.pdf" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">designated as medically under-served</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> areas (MUAs). Even in wealthy counties like Arlington, there are multiple census tracts that are also classified as</span><a href="https://data.hrsa.gov/tools/shortage-area/mua-find" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> MUAs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Virginia increased healthcare funding since the COVID-19 pandemic,</span><a href="https://cdn.wildapricot.com/33442/resources/Documents/Key%20Public%20Health%20Takeaways%20from%20Virginia%E2%80%99s%20New%20Budget.pdf?version=1658928791000&amp;Policy=eyJTdGF0ZW1lbnQiOiBbeyJSZXNvdXJjZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vY2RuLndpbGRhcHJpY290LmNvbS8zMzQ0Mi9yZXNvdXJjZXMvRG9jdW1lbnRzL0tleSUyMFB1YmxpYyUyMEhlYWx0aCUyMFRha2Vhd2F5cyUyMGZyb20lMjBWaXJnaW5pYSVFMiU4MCU5OXMlMjBOZXclMjBCdWRnZXQucGRmP3ZlcnNpb249MTY1ODkyODc5MTAwMCIsIkNvbmRpdGlvbiI6eyJEYXRlTGVzc1RoYW4iOnsiQVdTOkVwb2NoVGltZSI6MTcxOTUxMTM1NX0sIklwQWRkcmVzcyI6eyJBV1M6U291cmNlSXAiOiIwLjAuMC4wLzAifX19XX0_&amp;Signature=mMRS9nSM~41u7~LOZePnCfBxBxr5b~Xpi2T~VDjvyI60qkhVogRSO8zM4y59LXS1UJZLw598~gf~v9tUTDmPPGV-ozEVzmuu6AMl5IuO3H9vxzNZwrWM5dQbvo22lhK1-HFOAxefERIFxsoHVh7o21w6fAyB6G9veFrwkvZRqNRJK47tmcpCyrt4V-gHUiJSllxiQbpYAgXmvWIoAbbaMiya69CA~qSzSEhG8cbCHiQh0usut65yEjtOYfcoGqa6UUZAtyDeybm9mbieX8uvM3aOIJSUFFvUJ8rSKQ9H7Tyu1O--BJpA-BqkZPLRr4Q56Vx6S6UmvE3rfCy0Ab7QRw__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=K27MGQSHTHAGGF" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">per the Virginia Public Health Association (VPHA)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, most of it (approximately 85%) was a result of Federal CARES Act funding rather than sustained appropriations from the general fund. Understandably, the major focus of the increased spending is on communicable disease spread, but there is little mention of managing chronic conditions that our research suggests are the biggest factors in patient survival. Also, while</span><a href="https://www.employmentlawwatch.com/2021/09/articles/employment/it-continues-virginia-updates-its-permanent-covid-19-workplace-safety-standard/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia requires COVID-19 workplace-based protections that follow CDC standards</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the current disparities in infection rates suggests much more can be done. And, employers shouldn’t be asked to bear these costs and responsibilities alone. So, where do we go next?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia must invest in more federally-qualified community health centers, social workers who specialize in assisting marginalized populations, and accessible wellness programs targeted towards chronic disease management. These improvements will keep more people healthy, reduce structural inequality and save lives during the next pandemic. Surely if Virginia has money for</span><a href="https://www.casino.org/news/caesars-virginia-casino-development-cost-balloons-to-750m/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">casino developments</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RE1lAhQ8hmp7pVI04WdI6eI1VQUmjaqL/edit#heading=h.gjdgxs" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">sports stadiums</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span><a href="https://apnews.com/a-look-at-whats-in-amazons-new-deal-with-virginia-3aca4cb3b2b140c08a91edfc0b50c660#:~:text=Virginia%E2%80%99s%20contract%20with%20Amazon%20agrees%20to%20pay%20the,of%20%24550%20million%20in%20grants%20to%20the%20company." target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortune 500 company relocations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it has money for these structural healthcare investments well.

Anderson, who’s based in Virginia Beach, has filed lawsuits in state and federal courts against the shutterbugs in Chesapeake and Suffolk. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is completely, totally profit policing,” the Republican told me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anderson said localities are skirting the regulations the </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=201&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=HB1442" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">General Assembly established when it passed legislation in 2020</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> allowing the cameras in highway work and school zones. Speed camera tickets are civil fines of up to $100 in Virginia. He offered mainly technical arguments against them.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_34245" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG_9998-scaled.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-34245" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG_9998-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1707" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG_9998-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG_9998-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG_9998-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG_9998-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG_9998-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG_9998-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Former delegate Tim Anderson speaking at a subcommittee meeting on Jan. 17, 2022. (Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the state level, Anderson posited, camera vendors are impersonating local governments to collect the fines, so localities are breaking the law to maximize revenues. Also, alleged offenders should receive court dates immediately. If they did, the court system would be overwhelmed, forcing administrators to rethink the overall process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the federal suit, Anderson said, violators should have the right to question third-party vendors that regulate the cameras and oversee videos. Currently, defendants can’t confront their “accusers,” which violates the Sixth Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spokespersons in Chesapeake and Suffolk said their cities don’t comment on pending litigation. That’s a standard response when municipalities have been sued.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I support the cameras’ purpose: reducing speeding scofflaws and improving safety. That’s a good thing. I’ve been caught by speed cameras in the metropolitan Washington area, and I knew I was driving above the posted limits. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, motorists have to drive at least 10 miles above the speed limit to be photographed, so there’s wiggle room already. Violations occur because people don’t respect traffic laws. (You can add busting through red lights and not obeying stop signs, too. But I digress.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plenty of cities outside Virginia, by the way, operate speed cameras in places other than school or work zones. That includes busy thoroughfares and wide boulevards. The commonwealth hasn’t gone that far,</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb20" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">though a bill to expand speed camera usage failed this year in the Assembly</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anderson concedes he’s not aware of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">any</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> other attorney in Virginia who’s jumped into the fray to challenge the cameras. That’s telling, because it suggests this could be a quixotic campaign. Nor is he suggesting his own clients obeyed speed limits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than a dozen localities in Virginia use the devices now,</span><a href="https://rga.lis.virginia.gov/Published/2024/RD163/PDF" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">according to a Virginia State Police report released in February</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It feels like to me that government is picking on people,” Anderson noted, adding he’s handling the cases pro bono. Anderson emailed me the complaints in the state lawsuit against the city of Suffolk and the federal lawsuit against the city of Chesapeake. One plaintiff is named in each case.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, localities are raking in plenty of cash, and that infuriates the Virginia Beach attorney. Critics call the violations a backdoor tax – though I don’t understand why it’s OK for a police officer to pull over a speeding motorist, but advanced technology that catches speeders should be verboten.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The District of Columbia, by the way, can impose</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/transportation/2023/11/24/dc-traffic-cameras-expansion/#TRFBUSSLCZGQ3D4XPDZ3TOYV7I-3" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">fines of up to $500 for speed camera violations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. That’s much more expensive than here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chesapeake started speed camera monitoring in April 2022 and has since issued 160,000 citations, city spokesman Heath Covey told me by email. The city has raised roughly $9.8 million in revenues. Fewer violations are being issued now than since the program began, he said – suggesting more people are obeying the law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For 2023, Suffolk collected nearly $8.7 million in school and work zone violations. Fairfax County, the state’s largest locality in population, reaped $800,000 in violations last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jay Jones is a Norfolk Democrat and former delegate who sponsored the 2020 legislation. He’s somewhat surprised by Anderson’s campaign.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is the first time I’ve heard any complaints” about speed-camera operations, Jones said, noting he still gets emails to his political account about various issues. The 2020 bill limited the cameras to school and work zones, he said, “where you want people to slow down anyway.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plus, many police departments have struggled to reach full strength since the pandemic and the police killing of George Floyd. The cameras help bolster law enforcement, Jones said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is Anderson interpreting the law correctly, and does he have a legitimate case? Darryl Brown, a University of Virginia School of Law professor, said it’s possible, especially on the state claims.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The plaintiff could well be correct about the violations they allege,” Brown said. “Although even if the city loses in this lawsuit, it ought to be able to revise the way it handles speeding violations and, with some new practices, continue to enforce the speeding law on the basis of speed camera videos.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brown said the federal lawsuit is a stretch because the Sixth Amendment applies to criminal offenses, not civil ones. Speed camera violations are the latter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why haven’t other attorneys complained about the issue? The law stipulating rules for speed cameras didn’t start yesterday. Anderson’s crusade is a lonely one, and rightly so. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/06/16/traffic-cameras-dc-speeding/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Washington Post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> recently reported streets in D.C. with speed cameras saw speeding drop sharply, citing city data. Easing up on the accelerator should be applauded.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t feel sorry for people who speed &#8212; especially since the safety of schoolchildren and construction workers are at risk. Anderson’s arguments are novel ones, and they support people who don’t respect posted speed limits.</span></p>

Glenn Youngkin can’t run for reelection, so it’s frustrating to see him spending so much time trying to score political points. The latest episode came earlier this month, when according to </span><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/youngkin-calls-out-pentagons-plan-gift-china-millions-rooftop-solar-panels" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fox News</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Youngkin sent a letter to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin questioning the Pentagon’s plan, </span><a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/biden-harris-administration-announces-more-104-million-advance-net-zero-projects-federal" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> back in January, to install solar panels on the building’s massive roof. Youngkin complained that the plan included no requirements for American-made technology, raising the question “whether American taxpayer dollars will be used to purchase solar equipment from the Chinese Communist Party.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few days later, Fox News </span><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/pentagon-shoots-down-concerns-chinese-solar-panels" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the Pentagon offered reassurance that it had a “rigorous and extensive oversight process to ensure compliance” with the Buy American Act and other laws requiring domestic content. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to this second article, a Youngkin spokesperson quoted the governor as “pleased that Secretary Austin will follow his recommendations to adopt the ‘Made in America’ requirements for procuring Chinese solar panels.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Younkin’s attempt to snatch victory while still clenched in the jaws of defeat is amusing, but more than a little puzzling. Apparently Younkin is under the impression that solar panels are inherently Chinese. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s be clear: Solar energy is one of the great American </span><a href="https://www.seia.org/blog/solar-century-landmark-moments-history-solar-energy" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">success stories</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Americans invented solar photovoltaic technology, nurtured it and led the world in its development for half a century. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">American ingenuity put solar on the path to becoming today’s </span><a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/solar-is-now-cheapest-electricity-in-history-confirms-iea/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">low-cost leader</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for power generation, to the point that it is </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-19/solar-energy-has-crossed-a-global-tipping-point-study-finds" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">projected</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to become the world’s dominant source of electricity by 2050. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, as with a lot of American manufacturing, most solar panel production migrated overseas as the technology matured.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Starting in 2010, </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/07/business/china-solar-energy-exports.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">China bet big</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on renewable energy, investing in solar technology itself and driving down panel prices to the point where most manufacturers in Europe and the U.S. were driven out of business. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only </span><a href="https://www.firstsolar.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">one U.S company</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> remains in the top ten worldwide</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chinese companies also likely benefited from the use of </span><a href="https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/ILAB/images/storyboards/solar/Solar.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">forced labor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the production of polysilicon, the raw material for most solar panels. The U.S. </span><a href="https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/03/28/solar-panel-production-is-struggling-to-stay-clear-of-forced-labor/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">banned the importation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of solar panels made with forced labor in 2021. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By then, however, China had developed a mature supply chain and technological know-how to support low-cost production. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today China dominates every aspect of solar manufacturing, with about 80% of the world’s market share</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Chinese solar companies have expanded production capacity beyond the ability of world markets to absorb, driving down already-low prices by </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/china-solar-industry-faces-shakeout-rock-bottom-prices-persist-2024-04-03/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">42% in 2023</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Domination of the world market is only half the story, though. China also leads the world in deploying solar at home. China installed as much solar PV capacity in 2022 </span><a href="https://e360.yale.edu/features/china-renewable-energy" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">as the rest of the world combined</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and then </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">doubled </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">that in 2023. China also leads the world in </span><a href="https://www.offshorewind.biz/2023/06/30/china-now-has-31-gw-of-offshore-wind-installed-country-on-track-to-hit-wind-and-solar-targets-five-years-early-report-says/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">offshore wind</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> deployment and </span><a href="https://www.drive.com.au/caradvice/which-country-has-the-most-electric-cars-in-the-world/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">electric vehicle</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sales and dominates production of lithium-ion batteries. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So the concern that the Chinese are winning the clean energy race is well justified, and Youngkin is not the only American who hates the taste of second place. But our leaders only have two choices: stand around talking trash about the competition, or get in the game. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s what Congress did in passing laws like the Bipartisan Infrastructure Act and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) that support American investment in solar panels, wind turbines, electric vehicles and other components of a green revolution. More controversially, President Joe Biden also extended Trump-era tariffs on Chinese-made polysilicon solar panels to give American manufacturers a chance to scale up. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not everyone supports tariffs on Chinese-made solar panels, given the inflationary impact of trade barriers and the urgent need to deploy as much renewable energy as possible to lower CO2 emissions. Still, the </span><a href="https://emp.lbl.gov/news/new-study-refocuses-learning-curve" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">learning rate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of solar is expected to continue </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">driving prices lower</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over the long term. Even with a less-mature, more expensive supply chain, American-made panels are projected to become cheaper than imported panels </span><a href="https://www.solarpowerworldonline.com/2024/01/trade-policies-will-keep-solar-panel-prices-higher-than-average-in-united-states/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">by 2026</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One year after the IRA’s passage, a Goldman-Sachs analysis found the law was </span><a href="https://www.gsam.com/content/gsam/isl/en/advisors/market-insights/gsam-insights/perspectives/2023/us-inflation-reduction-act-is-driving-clean-energy-investment-one-year-in.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">meeting its objectives</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of driving private sector investment and job creation in the clean-tech sector, including manufacturing. This month, Wood Mackenzie </span><a href="https://www.woodmac.com/press-releases/2024-press-releases/us-solar-manufacturing-capacity-increase-to-71-percent/#:~:text=News%20Release-,American%20solar%20panel%20manufacturing%20capacity%20increases%2071%25%20in%20Q1%202024,industry%20reaches%20200%2Dgigawatt%20milestone&amp;text=A%20record%2Dsetting%2011%20gigawatts,manufacturing%20growth%20in%20American%20history." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that U.S. solar manufacturing capacity increased 71% in the first quarter of 2024, making it the largest quarter of solar manufacturing growth in history. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Pentagon is not known for caring about saving money, so maybe it isn’t surprising that it is only now following the example of millions of Americans by putting solar panels on the roof. Defense Department officials say the move is intended to support the resurgence in American manufacturing and to deliver the benefits of increased </span><a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/the-pentagon-will-install-rooftop-solar-panels-as-biden-pushes-clean-energy-in-federal-buildings" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">energy resilience and reliability</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, including having an uninterrupted power source in case of a cyberattack or a grid outage. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Low-cost, clean power, resilience and energy security are all part of the great American success story that is solar energy. A note of congratulation, not complaint, would be the better response from a governor whose state hosts the Pentagon. </span></p>

(Wyatt Gordon for the Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We all deserve the freedom to choose where we live. But even Virginians who have won a lottery struggle to find a way home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, a Richmond mother — I’ll call her Michelle — called my colleagues at Housing Opportunities Made Equal of Virginia (HOME of VA).  She had recently given birth to twins.  Tragically, both passed away – one soon after birth, the other after weeks in an ICU.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michelle had received a Housing Choice Voucher, a coupon provided by the federal government to help pay rent in a higher-opportunity neighborhood than the one where she and her other children live. These vouchers are administered locally and support low-income families seeking safe and stable housing. Waiting lists are years long.  New vouchers are sometimes issued by lottery.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a long wait, Michelle’s number had come up. But a severe shortage of housing in our region meant that she struggled to find a suitable home. Meanwhile, the clock was ticking: her voucher was set to expire at the end of this month, unless the local housing authority agreed to extend the deadline due to her heartbreaking situation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This wasn’t the only obstacle Michelle faced. Vouchers offset the cost of rent, but they don’t cover security deposits.  Virginia law allows property managers to require security deposits that can equal two months’ rent — a near impossibility for individuals and families whose low incomes have qualified them for a voucher.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="2sElwLNoq8"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/10/these-new-housing-laws-will-take-effect-next-month/">These new housing laws will take effect next month</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;These new housing laws will take effect next month&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/10/these-new-housing-laws-will-take-effect-next-month/embed/#?secret=s5SPvypkWR#?secret=2sElwLNoq8" data-secret="2sElwLNoq8" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michelle also had a relatively small pool of options.  If I were looking for a new home in the Richmond area, I could search throughout the region.  But voucher holders living in Virginia’s cities must first search for housing within their own city, and are only able to transfer their voucher to another — possibly more affordable — town after waiting a full year.  As a result, housing opportunities for Michelle and other voucher holders are limited.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regular violations of housing law make our rental market even more challenging.  The Virginia Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination against rental applicants based on race, people with Housing Choice Vouchers, and other “</span><a href="https://homeofva.org/get-help/fair-housing/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">protected classes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”  But discrimination complaints about the source of funds used to pay rent are among the most common we see.  Falsehoods about voucher holders — stereotypes that they are unreliable, untidy, or dangerous — put many on a fruitless search.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Any one of us could wake up to a nightmare like Michelle did with her newborns.  But the desperate housing situation she confronted reflects a failure of policy and enforcement amid a tight housing market ripe for discrimination.  It also reflects a lack of investment in ridding our housing landscape of injustice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Throughout the 20th century, public investment made housing inequity possible. Massive outlays funded whites-only mortgages and highways that fueled the growth of segregated suburbs.  Today, many Black and Latino Virginians live in areas lacking essentials that most of us would choose for our families: access to well-paying jobs, public transit, grocery stores, childcare, and tree cover to clean the air and offer shade during our blistering summers. These features of well-resourced neighborhoods remain out of reach to many.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is nothing natural about the lack of fairness across communities in our region. Michelle’s housing struggles were created — by policy, by investment, by human actions.  In the same ways, we can dismantle them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is why, for more than a half-century as a fair housing organization, HOME of VA has worked to ensure equal access to housing for all people.  We envision empowered communities where everyone has the freedom of housing choice.  Where we live shouldn’t determine the shape of our lives; people everywhere should have an equal chance to seek their potential.  But as Michelle knows, as you know, where we live </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">does</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> matter.  It determines which schools our children can attend, how safe we find our streets, how close we find our jobs.  Fair access to housing is possible only without discrimination.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elections, naturally, have a role to play in shaping policy that would make Michelle’s situation rare. But we don’t have to wait for November to make meaningful change. Our local elected officials meet regularly.  Vulnerable would-be renters apply for housing daily  and violations of fair housing law happen just as often.  We can push our leaders to enforce fair housing law and provide funds to help voucher holders pay security deposits.  Our elected officials can act at any time, especially when we speak up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We might also be surprised by the power each of us has to raise an alarm. Through vigilance and a spirit of helping our friends and neighbors, we can talk about fair housing protections — and guide people we know who have experienced violations toward help. At HOME of VA, </span><a href="https://homeofva.org/intake" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">we receive complaints</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of housing law violations every week.  Our team works hard to help enforce the law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michelle recently left the hospital, and her spirits are strong. With the support of one of our tireless housing counselors, she has found a home for her family and hopes to move soon. But so many of our neighbors, including others who have won a housing lottery, remain in need.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Policy solutions that make housing fair do not magically appear. We must make the case — not only at the polls, not only in November, but consistently.  Fair housing is up to all of us.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though it might be cumbersome logistically, I hope the county approves the program. More communities should try doing something different, instead of being perennially exasperated at the sight of people begging motorists and pedestrians for money.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A special city task force recently presented</span><a href="https://legistarweb-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/attachment/pdf/2658888/Item_4-B.pdf" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">a possible project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to Prince William’s Board of County Supervisors.</span><a href="https://www.princewilliamtimes.com/news/county-supervisors-mull-hiring-pandhandlers-to-pick-up-roadside-litter/article_f0ef1d7e-2879-11ef-9e57-73629aa3e75f.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The program would pay</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> panhandlers $13 an hour to pick up roadside litter while working two, three-hour shifts a week.</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/10/20/helping-panhandlers-involves-more-than-just-easing-bans-on-begging/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve written previously</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about similar projects nationwide.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="u2ddK1Gb7n"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/10/20/helping-panhandlers-involves-more-than-just-easing-bans-on-begging/">Helping panhandlers involves more than just easing bans on begging</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Helping panhandlers involves more than just easing bans on begging&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/10/20/helping-panhandlers-involves-more-than-just-easing-bans-on-begging/embed/#?secret=7OycUR2EQz#?secret=u2ddK1Gb7n" data-secret="u2ddK1Gb7n" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A supervisor had asked county staff to report on panhandling at intersections and businesses. Nikki Brown, a county spokeswoman, told me by email Tuesday she didn’t have statistics on how often panhandling occurs there, “but we have received several complaints and anecdotal information from our residents” and county supervisors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lack of specifics makes me wonder how bad the problem actually is in the county of nearly a half-million people. But I digress.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Estimates for such a project aren’t complete, nor is it clear who would pay for it. The nonprofit Keep Prince William Beautiful would administer it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fairfax County has run a similar program since 2019 called</span><a href="https://www.fairfaxcounty.gov/publicworks/oss" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">“Operation Stream Shield”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that employs homeless individuals to remove litter and non-native invasive plant species in waterways. However, during a brief search, I didn’t find other localities running such projects in Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A couple of laudable goals in Prince William County’s proposal stand out:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One, the county would direct panhandlers, who are often homeless, to services they need and provide work opportunities. Second, people inclined to give a few dollars to those begging would be urged instead to donate to homeless community partners, who are better equipped to help long term.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Board supervisors will debate the plan in July. They should approve it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only will panhandlers pick up trash for cash; the program could also help them prop up their lives.</span></p>

<p>With the investigation still underway, details about God’s Misfits remain scarce. The group’s members may be part of the so-called “<a href="https://leb.fbi.gov/articles/featured-articles/sovereign-citizens-a-growing-domestic-threat-to-law-enforcement" target="_blank">sovereign citizen” movement</a> – people who believe they <a href="https://www.adl.org/resources/backgrounder/sovereign-citizen-movement-united-states" target="_blank">owe no allegiance to any government</a> and are not required to obey laws.</p>
<p><a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CyAnrLMAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao" target="_blank">My research</a> into sovereign citizens has found they have long been <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-45851-5" target="_blank">active in the U.S.</a> and other countries. At the core of their beliefs is the denial of the government’s legitimacy. They commonly do not register their vehicles, acquire driver’s licenses or car insurance, or pay taxes. And they pose a significant threat to the public.</p>
<h2>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Harassment and abuse</h4>

	</h2>
<p>One threat they pose is “paper terrorism,” which involves harassing public officials with legal threats to intimidate them. Sometimes officials are targeted because they arrested or prosecuted someone from the movement.</p>
<p>This method involves filing fake deeds and liens against public officials the sovereign citizens think wronged them. <a href="https://fox4kc.com/news/problem-solvers/fake-lien-battle-finally-ends-in-victory-for-platte-city-woman/" target="_blank">County recorders</a> are <a href="https://tucson.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/paper-terrorism-used-by-sovereign-citizens-to-harass-public-officials/article_8d519bfe-525d-11ee-a8a7-e76c476f87dc.html" target="_blank">sounding the alarm</a>.</p>
<p>This type of act – a form of fraud that can be illegal – is <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/prolific-ads-featuring-wing-icons-push-questionable-claims/story?id=85365286" target="_blank">rare nationwide but common in some places</a>, local and federal officials have said.</p>
<p>For instance, in 2023, a New Mexico man allegedly <a href="https://www.abqjournal.com/news/local/paper-terrorism-what-is-it-and-why-is-a-man-named-trapper-killsmany-behind-bars/article_c52b78e6-4d3a-5dc0-8f22-1f436cf1d069.html" target="_blank">filed a US$20 million lien against property</a> owned by federal employees he believed were connected with the termination of his Social Security benefits. All told, he has <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/66897081/14/united-states-v-killsmany/" target="_blank">allegedly filed $1 billion in false liens</a> against federal employees.</p>
<p>Federal prosecutors have charged him with <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/66897081/united-states-v-killsmany/" target="_blank">retaliating against a federal employee by making a false claim</a>. Court documents identify the man as a sovereign citizen who describes himself as a “<a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/66897081/14/united-states-v-killsmany/" target="_blank">private attorney general</a>.” He is awaiting trial.</p>
<h2>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">More violent threats</h4>

	</h2>
<p>The FBI considers sovereign citizens a <a href="https://leb.fbi.gov/articles/featured-articles/sovereign-citizens-a-growing-domestic-threat-to-law-enforcement" target="_blank">domestic terrorism threat</a>.</p>
<p>In April 2024, a Utah man was <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/68455519/1/united-states-v-bracken/" target="_blank">charged in federal court with stalking</a> after allegedly telling staff at the Salt Lake County Recorder’s Office that they had committed treason and the penalty was death.</p>
<p>Court documents show that the man has identified himself as a “sovereign citizen” and made quasi-legal claims that <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/68455519/united-states-v-bracken/" target="_blank">prosecutors characterize as arguments commonly used by sovereign citizens</a> – claims that were dismissed by a judge as “<a href="https://sovereigncitizenwatch.com/2024/06/07/sovereign-citizen-stalking-case-unsealed/" target="_blank">frivolous and without merit</a>.” Trial is set to begin July 1, 2024.</p>

<h2>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Killings</h4>

	</h2>
<p>Sovereign citizens have <a href="https://www.justsecurity.org/77328/sovereign-citizens-more-than-paper-terrorists/" target="_blank">killed</a> police officers and <a href="https://lawandcrime.com/live-trials/live-trials-current/waukesha-parade-tragedy/after-trial-marred-by-constant-outbursts-jury-finds-darrell-brooks-guilty-of-murdering-six-people-in-waukesha-parade-attack/" target="_blank">civilians</a>. <a href="https://www.wpr.org/justice/darrell-brooks-found-guilty-all-charges-waukesha-parade-tragedy" target="_blank">Darrell Brooks</a>, who represented himself in court as a sovereign citizen, was found guilty in October 2022 of killing six people when he drove an SUV through a Christmas parade.</p>
<p>Dejaune Anderson, a <a href="https://www.whas11.com/article/news/crime/dejaune-anderson-cairo-jordan-boy-suitcase-body-indiana/417-d191ddac-b414-42d3-a2c0-11caaadd61d7" target="_blank">self-declared sovereign citizen</a>, is accused of neglecting her 5-year-old son so badly that he died of dehydration. Her <a href="https://www.whas11.com/article/news/local/indiana/dejaune-anderson-cairo-jordan-indiana-suitcase-boy-dead-court-new-motions/417-418f600e-130f-4bed-b480-22a1b1a458d0" target="_blank">trial is pending</a>.</p>
<p>Traffic stops <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.avb.2020.101509" target="_blank">can be especially dangerous for police</a> because sovereign citizens often will not comply with officers’ basic commands. At times, this tendency can lead to violence.</p>
<p>In April 2024, two police officers in Florida investigated a report of a man in a vehicle in a public park after the park’s closing time. The person identified himself as a “Moorish sovereign citizen,” a type of sovereign citizen who claims that <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/moorish-sovereign-citizens" target="_blank">people of African American descent are not subject to U.S. law</a> because of a <a href="https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Jefferson/01-10-02-0292" target="_blank">1787 treaty between the U.S. and Morocco</a>, which says nothing of the sort.</p>
<p>During the confrontation that ensued, the man allegedly <a href="https://www.police1.com/sovereign-citizens/sovereign-citizen-shoots-wounds-2-fla-deputies-before-fatal-ois" target="_blank">shot and wounded the officers</a> before being killed by police.</p>
<h2>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">A new subgroup</h4>

	</h2>
<p>Over the past several years, a new variation of sovereign citizens has emerged, known as <a href="https://www.police1.com/sovereign-citizens/american-state-nationals-the-newest-group-of-sovereign-citizens" target="_blank">American State Nationals</a>. <a href="https://doi.org/10.54208/1000/0006/006" target="_blank">In my research</a>, I learned that they have been congregating on social media and gathering at seminars. Their leaders teach traditional sovereign citizen ideology along with new methods that supposedly let them live outside the law.</p>
<p>For instance, leaders teach their followers that driver’s licenses, marriage licenses, Social Security cards, car registrations and voter registrations are “contracts with the government,” which to them form the basis for requirements that they obey laws.</p>
<p>American State Nationals are urged to cancel or rescind these documents by filling out a set of forms, which are sold by the seminar leaders for about $250, in addition to the $150 seminar fee. Then they are told to submit the documents to <a href="https://azcir.org/news/2023/09/11/sovereign-citizen-paperwork-pima-county/" target="_blank">county recorders</a> and even the U.S. State Department. They are told that doing so will remove them from the reach of the U.S. government.</p>

<p>Paul Grice, the fifth member of God’s Misfits to be arrested in that Oklahoma kidnapping and murder case, reportedly sent his <a href="https://kansasreflector.com/2024/05/05/a-fifth-misfit-is-accused-of-murdering-two-kansas-women-last-year-he-declared-extremist-beliefs/" target="_blank">packet of paperwork</a> by certified mail to Antony Blinken, the U.S. secretary of state.</p>
<p>Perhaps paradoxically, American State Nationals are also told to acquire a federal document that group members call a “noncitizen national passport.” They believe this document gives them <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wMlUaoyoa_Ifn1H3ISHynp_WeNm4L2AV/view" target="_blank">many special privileges</a>, including no longer being a U.S. citizen and having immunity from U.S. laws. They believe this even though U.S. law applies to <a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artI-S8-C18-8-7-2/ALDE_00001262/" target="_blank">everyone within the borders of the U.S</a>.</p>
<p>In reality, this document does none of what they think it does. The document, officially called a “<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/travel-legal-considerations/us-citizenship/Certificates-Non-Citizen-Nationality.html" target="_blank">Certificate of Non Citizen Nationality</a>,” is really for use by people born in one of several U.S. possessions, such as American Samoa. Directly contrary to what sovereign citizens think, the document certifies that its bearer does “<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/travel-legal-considerations/us-citizenship/Certificates-Non-Citizen-Nationality.html" target="_blank">owe permanent allegiance to the United States</a>.”</p>
<p>Sovereign citizens’ beliefs have yet to hold up in any <a href="https://assets2.pacermonitor.com/gpo/USCOURTS-txsd-6_23-cv-00056/USCOURTS-txsd-6_23-cv-00056-0.pdf" target="_blank">court of law in the U.S.</a> or overseas. As an Australian law school lecturer said of a case involving a sovereign citizen in Australia, “<a href="https://www.sbs.com.au/news/the-feed/article/the-rise-of-sovereign-people-and-why-they-argue-laws-dont-apply-to-them/i2g9jij7g" target="_blank">No court in Australia, no court in the U.S., Canada, anywhere that I’ve seen</a>, has ever accepted the legal arguments raised by sovereign citizens.”</p>

(Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a problem that divides communities and stymies lawmakers: Virginia’s transition to clean energy depends on building thousands of acres’ worth of large solar facilities, but a backlash from some rural neighbors makes siting projects increasingly difficult. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of the objections are aesthetic – few people prefer to look at rows of solar panels if they once enjoyed a bucolic country scene – but some opponents say they worry about the loss of farmland and trees. Solar, they fear, is bad for the land as well as the eyes. It doesn’t help that some early solar development suffered from corner-cutting that resulted in soil compaction and erosion. If that is solar, many people want no part of it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2022, land conservation groups banded together with agriculture and logging interests to lobby for </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+ful+CHAP0688" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> requiring mitigation whenever a solar project would disturb more than 50 acres of forest or 10 acres of “prime agricultural soils.” House Bill 206 applies to any solar project developed under Virginia’s sort-of-streamlined “permit by rule” process, which is available to all but the largest facilities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The solar industry initially fought the legislation, joined by some climate advocacy groups. They pointed out that no other industry is subject to mitigation requirements, and that solar provides greater climate benefits than forests and agriculture. Moreover, solar panels can be removed and the land returned to farming or forestry. By contrast, once land is converted to a housing subdivision or strip mall or data center, the damage is permanent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eventually the solar industry accepted compromise language that put off the effective date until the start of 2025 and gave industry members a voice in an advisory panel under the auspices of Virginia’s Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ). The law tasked this group with helping to develop “criteria to determine if a significant adverse impact to prime agricultural soils or forest lands is likely to occur as a result of a proposed solar project,” and if so, the actions that should be considered in any mitigation plan. DEQ was to use the working group’s conclusions to draw up regulations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As it turned out, the working group </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/12/20/state-work-group-on-solar-development-unable-to-reach-consensus/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">agreed on very little</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Its 717-page report found consensus on only a few points, leaving DEQ itself with the task of resolving key issues. On May 13, the agency published its </span><a href="https://townhall.virginia.gov/L/ViewXML.cfm?textid=18376" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">proposed regulations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, a few things have happened since the passage of HB 206.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In March of 2022, DEQ </span><a href="https://www.williamsmullen.com/insights/news/legal-news/virginia-deq-issues-more-stringent-stormwater-management-policy-solar" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">toughened</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> its stormwater regulations to address the runoff and erosion problems that had given solar a bad name in some communities. Building on that, the agency just released a new </span><a href="https://www.deq.virginia.gov/our-programs/water/stormwater/stormwater-construction/handbooks" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">stormwater handbook</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that will become effective July 1, 2024, with sections specific to solar development. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some solar industry members complain that DEQ’s stormwater regulations are unreasonably onerous, but no one questions the importance of preventing runoff and erosion. In any case, many companies are already using land-friendly practices that make it easier to meet tougher rules. One is the use of </span><a href="https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/04/20/tracking-the-sun-on-uneven-terrain/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">terrain following trackers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a technology that allows solar to be installed on uneven terrain instead of bringing in bulldozers to level the site. The trackers maximize solar production in hilly areas while preserving topsoil and vegetation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new tracker technology is among the suite of </span><a href="https://openei.org/wiki/InSPIRE/Primer" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">low-impact approaches</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> gaining ground as the solar industry matures. DEQ encourages another eco-friendly practice: planting native species among and around solar arrays. Native plants provide food and habitat for insects whose numbers have plummeted in recent years, </span><a href="https://www.audubon.org/content/why-native-plants-matter" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">threatening our ecosystems</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Though only a few solar projects have achieved DEQ’s </span><a href="https://www.dcr.virginia.gov/natural-heritage/pollinator-smart" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pollinator-smart certification</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to date, most of the developers I’ve spoken with say they are open to it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gaining traction even faster is the practice of using grazing animals for vegetation management. Sheep hit the sweet spot: project owners save money they would have to spend on humans operating machinery, while the sheep thrive in the shade of solar panels and return nutrients to the soil. Already, 2% of sheep in the U.S. are being grazed under solar panels, according to an American Solar Grazing Association </span><a href="https://solargrazing.org/asga-call-76-replay-how-big-is-solar-grazing-in-the-u-s-asga-census-results/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">webinar</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, including at several large Virginia facilities providing power to Dominion Energy. Elsewhere, </span><a href="https://cowboystatedaily.com/2024/06/01/wyoming-solar-farms-also-want-cows-pigs-and-sheep-roaming-under-panels/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cattle</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> graze under solar panels or </span><a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/07/agrivoltaic-farming-solar-energy/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">crops</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> grow between the rows, further erasing the distinction between solar facilities and agricultural use. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All-terrain trackers, topsoil preservation, native plants and incorporating active farming or grazing: all these practices ensure farmland isn’t “lost” to solar. Yet DEQ’s tougher stormwater rules, the solar industry’s increasingly land-friendly practices, and even the passage of HB 206 haven’t allayed concerns among solar opponents. Instead, rural counties have stepped up the pace of bans, caps and moratoriums. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One suspects the continued hostility isn’t because opponents lack familiarity with the ways solar can be eco-friendly, but because the opposition’s primary motivation isn’t preserving farmland. If what they really care about is keeping solar from cluttering up the viewshed (“preserving our rural heritage” is the euphemistic framing), then adding a new layer of mitigation requirements won’t change anything. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Admittedly, I never supported HB 206 in the first place. From an environmental perspective, solar is no worse for the land than monoculture pine plantations or commodity crops grown with pesticides and petroleum-based fertilizers. Done in a habitat-friendly way, solar can </span><a href="https://www.anl.gov/evs/article/if-you-build-it-they-will-come-how-habitatfriendly-solar-energy-can-synergize-with-biodiversity#:~:text=Solar%20facilities%20that%20provide%20habitat,which%20can%20improve%20crop%20production." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">increase biodiversity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and help </span><a href="https://cleanpower.org/wp-content/uploads/gateway/2023/03/ACP_Solar_and_Farmland.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">heal the land</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And solar addresses our CO2 problem, far more </span><a href="https://blogs.law.columbia.edu/climatechange/2022/10/25/response-to-the-new-york-times-essay-are-there-better-places-to-put-large-solar-farms-than-these-forests/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">even than trees</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, DEQ’s job was to try to find a middle ground between the solar industry and its detractors, and in fairness, their effort gets some things right. The proposed rules recognize that there are degrees of impact a solar facility can have, and that practices like leaving topsoil undisturbed or incorporating </span><a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/solar/agrivoltaics-solar-and-agriculture-co-location#:~:text=Co%2Dlocation%2C%20also%20known%20as,or%20adjacent%20to%20solar%20panels." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">agrivoltaics</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> should be rewarded with lower mitigation requirements. A neat table delineates the various levels of impact and proposes differing levels of mitigation to match. Mitigation mostly takes the form of land set-asides, but can also be satisfied with per-acre payments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And yet the proposal misses the mark on at least three fronts. First, it fails to give full credit to solar projects that minimize soil disturbance and incorporate agrivoltaics. DEQ should recognize that adopting best practices is itself mitigation, which should obviate the need for land set-asides or monetary payments. </span></p>

        </a>
        
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Second, the proposed regulations make no exceptions for projects owned and operated by local farmers who incorporate solar into their farm activities in order to increase and diversify their income without having to sell their land. If the point of HB 206 was to protect farming, DEQ has shot wide of the mark.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, the dollar amounts that DEQ proposes in lieu of land set-asides are punishingly high, with perverse effects. A solar company that has to pay a stiff penalty must pass that cost along in the form of a higher price for the electricity produced. If a utility has to pay more for electricity, ratepayers ultimately foot the bill. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The alternative is equally counterproductive. I noted at the start that DEQ’s permit-by-rule process is available to all but the largest projects, but it is not the only pathway open to developers. Projects over 150 MW are required to go to the SCC for approval, but smaller projects aren’t foreclosed from doing so. If DEQ makes its own process too onerous, solar developers will go to the SCC instead. The SCC requires that a developer secure a local permit, but not that it employ soil-saving practices, agrivoltaics or mitigation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It would be great if DEQ could turn the lemon that is HB 206 into a lemonade of a solar industry adopting eco-friendly development practices and incorporating pollinator plantings, sheep grazing, and other agrivoltaic businesses. What we have instead is a proposal that may kill the permit-by-rule program without producing any benefit to anyone – in effect, turning lemonade into lemons.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is still time to get it right. DEQ may not be able to resolve the solar wars, but a good set of regulations would position Virginia to make the most of a solar industry that is essential to our future. </span></p>

Glenn Youngkin has taken the extraordinary — and illegal — step of announcing his administration will ignore Virginia law and withdraw from the vehicle emissions standards known commonly as the Clean Cars program, which would reverse the state’s most significant action to date to curb climate pollution. This attempt to circumvent the law comes after repeated failed attempts to convince the General Assembly to repeal the Clean Cars statute. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, we’ve seen such shocking executive overreach from Youngkin before. He similarly sought to unlawfully remove Virginia from participating in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, contrary to another state statute aimed at cutting climate </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">pollution that also funds energy efficiency and flood resilience. Now the target is Clean Cars, never mind the facts and the law.</span></p>

<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Clean Cars is the law</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of the misinformation provided to justify scrapping Clean Cars, the Governor and his allies have repeatedly stated or implied that Virginia should set its own vehicle emission standards. The truth is, we can’t. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the federal Clean Air Act, Virginia has two options to adopt to control vehicle emissions:: federal standards developed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency or the more environmentally protective state standards California is federally authorized to set. Virginia did not abdicate state authority over tailpipe emissions standards to “unelected leaders” in California, as Youngkin claims. Virginia lawmakers — our publicly-elected representatives — asserted state authority in 2021 by choosing to adopt and maintain consistency with standards that do more to protect our health and our environment. The regulations carrying out this directive went into effect in January 2024.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The benefits of Clean Cars</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia is one of 17 states that have adopted the more protective vehicle emissions standards. And for good reason: The Clean Cars standards will substantially cut transportation pollution, the source of almost half of carbon emissions in Virginia that are fueling the climate crisis. Gas-powered vehicles are also a significant source of other harmful pollution like nitrogen oxides and particulate matter that cause serious health impacts across Virginia, including premature death, and disproportionately impact communities of color and low-income communities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The standards require automakers to deliver an increasing number of both cleaner gas-powered vehicles and zero-emission vehicles for sale in the commonwealth. Contrary to misinformation being spread by opponents, the Clean Cars standards do not ban gas-powered vehicles. They only apply to new vehicles. And under the law, zero-emission vehicles include both fully electric vehicles (EVs) and plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) that still have gas-powered engines. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since automakers prioritize sending clean vehicles to states with the Clean Cars standards, adopting the standards increases the number of new vehicle models available and helps our economy, since at least one-third of registered EVs were purchased out of state before the standards took effect. Cleaner vehicles will also save Virginians money. In 2021, Virginians spent almost </span><a href="https://perma.cc/22QX-KDKN" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$11 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on imported gas. But EV drivers typically spend the equivalent of approximately </span><a href="https://perma.cc/N5Z6-SGUU" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$1 per gallon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for a full charge, and the typical EV can be driven 150 to 400 miles before it needs to be recharged. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We can’t afford to lose the benefits of Clean Cars. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">A convenient flip-flop</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attorney General Miyares’ office previously — and correctly — concluded that Virginia law requires adoption of the Clean Cars standards and updates, and Miyares called upon the General Assembly to repeal the legislation. Throughout the implementation process, the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality — again, correctly — also noted that the standards were required by law. And they concluded that the regulations would automatically update to maintain consistency with any future changes to the Clean Cars Program.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, Miyares has flip-flopped and instead asserts that the governor can unilaterally override a law passed by the General Assembly. It is striking that this new interpretation arrives over halfway through his term, and Youngkin’s, and only after the legislature has, for three years, rejected every proposed bill to repeal the Clean Cars law. How convenient.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Moving forward</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Governor is not above the law. Virginia must continue to implement the Clean Cars standards until the General Assembly chooses otherwise, ensuring that all Virginians enjoy the health, economic, and environmental benefits of the most substantial step the state has ever taken to cut tailpipe pollution.</span></p>

(Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s political class loves to beat its chest over its “part-time legislature,” doing the people’s bidding in the dead of winter each year and then sending its citizen lawmakers back to their homes long before the first daffodils bloom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet here we are in the shank of June, one special session in the books and likely facing yet another legislative cattle call back to the Capitol in Richmond, this time to repair a snafu from a bungled budget amendment that restricts the eligibility for veterans’ dependents using college benefits they’ve been promised.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This isn’t about mistakes. People make them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No, this is about a policymaking system rooted in Virginia’s distant, bucolic past when tobacco farming, textile milling and coal mining were the pillars of an economy in the commonwealth that was puny compared to today’s. It’s about a system that invites error and inefficiency.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve said it before and I’ll say it ‘‘’til the cows come home,” if I may borrow an aphorism almost as antiquated as those notions about the virtues of an abbreviated, amateur, pastoral General Assembly: Virginia, with the nation’s 12th largest population and its 13th largest gross domestic product, is a busy, fast-paced, technologically advanced state inextricably hardwired into the neighboring seat of national government. Its problems and the policy solutions they demand are commensurately intricate. Yet we adhere to a legislative schedule befitting the agrarian Virginia of the 19th century.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ten states have full time legislatures, </span><a href="https://www.ncsl.org/about-state-legislatures/full-and-part-time-legislatures" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the National Conference of State Legislatures. Virginia’s legislature is among 26 that the NCSL classifies as “hybrid,” somewhere between those that essentially remain at work year-round and those with limited meeting schedules ranging from a few weeks to every other year. We pay our senators $18,000 and our delegates $17,640 per year plus $210 per diem, ranking Virginia in the bottom third nationally for legislative compensation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s a very macho conceit that 140 people and their support staffs can, in just a couple of months, remedy the many pressing, evolving issues that require thorough research and analysis and thoughtful deliberation, instead of shoot-from-the-hip responses that seem easy but sometimes flop spectacularly when pressed into practice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, any fair assessment has to conclude that the final work product is better than one might expect from such a system. In the 20 or so years I spent reporting on and analyzing the General Assembly from within, I was impressed at how well overworked committee staffs performed under the numbing stress of impossible deadlines, especially those who handled the budget.</span></p>

	</div>
	</div>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More times than I can count, I was among a handful of journalists who stayed into the wee hours with the House and Senate money committee staffs as they guided a handful of bleary-eyed lawmakers in brokering a compromise on a new state budget. After a handshake sealed the deal, those wizards of money, math, policy and technology toiled through the dark to well after sunrise to put everything into final form, printing and collating 140 fat binders known as “half sheets” and putting them neatly on the desk of each legislator on the House and Senate floors. It’s one of the most amazing feats I have ever seen a team achieve.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The present dilemma arises from the whirlwind pace of time-stressed legislating paired with bipartisan misjudgment on the sensitive question of higher education benefits for families of those killed, injured, missing in action or held captive during military service.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/03/youngkin-calls-for-repeal-of-new-limits-on-college-tuition-program-for-military-families/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mercury reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that costs of the Virginia Military Survivors &amp; Dependents Education Program have, if plotted on a grid, spiked abruptly upward like a hockey stick over the past half-dozen years because of growing enrollment. The number of participants more than quadrupled — from 1,400 in 2019 to 6,400 last year — and commensurately bloated the state’s cost to nearly $65 million in the 2022-23 academic year, up 444% from the 2018-19 school year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers voiced alarm at the rapid cost increases. A stand-alone bill that would have moderated VMSDEP was introduced in this year’s regular General Assembly session but was converted into a study resolution. After they blew past the deadline for enacting the state budget by the scheduled regular session adjournment date this year for the seventh year in a row, they went into a special session to reach a compromise on the commonwealth’s two-year, $188 billion financial blueprint through June of 2026.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A closed-door conclave of senators and delegates slipped an amendment into their final version of the budget that imposes new VMSDEP eligibility rules. They limit benefits to undergraduate study and exclude graduate study such as medical or law school. They further restrict them to Virginia residents and compel participants to file an application for federal programs that assist with higher education costs based on income to mitigate VMSDEP expenses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The compromise had the imprimatur of House and Senate budget negotiators — led by Democrats but including Republicans — and Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin. What it didn’t have was any heads-up </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">to</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (and certainly no input </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">from</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">) affected stakeholders — spouses and dependents of disabled or killed armed forces members. When the details became public days before the May 13 special floor sessions to enact the overdue budget, all hell broke loose, as it should have.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The optics are dismaying. Here is the government of Virginia, home to the largest number of active-duty military per capita of any state, sneaking in cuts to a program that aids the loved ones of those who paid a profound price — including the supreme price — for defending their country. True, the costs are climbing, but these ham-handed reductions to VMSDEP in the context of a $188 billion biennial budget fail the sniff test.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Did they really believe it would go unnoticed or, at worst, encounter only grudging acquiescence?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Was a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/03/07/farewell-and-adieu-possible-pitfalls-and-historical-context-of-pending-legislative-retirements/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lack of foresight</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the loss of more than three centuries of collective legislative experience and hard-earned wisdom after a tsunami of 2023 retirements (14 delegates, six senators, including half a dozen with 20 or more years’ tenure) partly to blame?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s tough to fathom even a freshman legislator not recognizing a threat to VMSDEP as a hornet’s nest, and now that they’ve treated it like a piñata, stung policymakers want the limits rescinded. Legislative leaders agreed  Thursday to return to the Capitol on the 28 — two days before the new state fiscal year starts and the 2025-26 biennial budget takes effect — to do that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Initially, Democratic legislative leaders voiced misgivings about rushing back to Richmond to amend the newly passed budget, noting that current VMSDEP participants and new enrollees would not be affected by the change and thus remedial action could be deferred until January and the 2025 regular session. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because the special session that convened May 13 to belatedly pass the budget was recessed rather than adjourned, there is no need to convene a second special session — something the General Assembly has required three times since 2018 to finish its business. There have been only eight years this century that Virginia’s General Assembly has not had at least one special session.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s time to drop the threadbare conceit that Virginia isn’t already being forced to make and revise policy throughout the year. Why not do it at a more deliberate, thoughtful pace instead of in fits and starts occasioned by a calendar for a time that predates indoor plumbing?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An African-American woman’s quest to buy a pricey condo near the Virginia Beach Oceanfront – impeded by the white homeowner’s refusal because of her race – is just the latest example.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bias Raven Baxter faced, detailed in a recent article in</span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/31/realestate/race-home-buying-raven-baxter.html?searchResultPosition=1" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The New York Times</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, was only unusual in this way:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jane Walker, 84, candidly told her agent why she didn’t want Baxter, a molecular biologist and</span><a href="https://x.com/ravenscimaven/status/1791680744055595443" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">social media maven</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with a quarter-million online followers, to buy the condo. Housing rights officials say discriminatory homeowners and landlords frequently use subtle methods or mask the real reasons why they don’t want people to move in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the Virginia Beach transaction, however, the unspoken part was said out loud: Walker didn’t want to sell to a Black person.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The incident got tons of publicity because Baxter </span><a href="https://x.com/ravenscimaven/status/1796521068024447244" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wrote about it</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on X (formerly Twitter), where she has more than 165,000 followers. She also has her own website,</span><a href="https://thesciencemaven.com/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. Raven the Science Maven</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think that because we’ve come so far in history, we think that things can’t happen anymore,” Baxter, 30, told me this week. “And we forget racism isn’t something that we just leave in the past. It’s something that can pop up at any time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed. Progress isn’t always linear. We often move forward in fits and starts. Or even fall backward.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, unless you’re the person directly affected by such bias, it’s very easy to dismiss.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Baxter seems somewhat taken aback by all that’s happened since she went public with her housing story. “I’ve kind of been overwhelmed [by] how deep of an issue this is,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She declined to answer some of my questions, including whether she’ll still buy the condo. However, an official with 757 Realty, the company assisting her, told me the closing is scheduled in August.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Baxter also has filed discrimination claims with the Virginia Fair Housing Office and U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, The Times reported.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Baxter was born and raised in Buffalo. She works remotely for a New York City hospital and lives in Northern Virginia with her partner, Ronald Gamble Jr., 35, a theoretical astrophysicist. Baxter wanted to own property outright, and Gamble encouraged her to find a house near the beach, a longtime dream of hers, The Times said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She viewed the Virginia Beach condo online and liked what she saw. It has three bedrooms, three bathrooms, and a marble fireplace. It’s a stone’s throw from a country club golf course, and it’s a quick walk to the beach and Atlantic Ocean.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Baxter contacted a listing agent, did a virtual tour and agreed to the $749,000 asking price. She made a down payment. She and Gamble saw the condo in person May 17. That’s the same day when the owner’s agent, Susan Pender of Berkshire Hathaway RW Towne Realty, introduced them to Walker, the seller.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">757 Realty provided me a chronology of events. That narrative said shortly after Baxter and Gamble left the condo May 17, Walker told her agent – Pender – that she didn’t want to sell to Baxter because of her race. Pender relayed that information to the folks at 757 Realty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One disagreement between buyer and seller was a decades-old air-conditioning system that needed to be upgraded. It’s unclear if that affected the seller’s attitude and demeanor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neither Pender nor her boss returned my messages. No one answered when I rang the doorbell at that condo this week, which is on the</span><a href="https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/virginia-beach-departments-docs/planning/Boards-Commissions/Historic-Preservation-Commission/Historical-Register-List_2021.pdf" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Beach Historical Register</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s telling, however, that none of the principals denied the biased statement occurred.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Discrimination in housing in the United States is illegal for home sellers and their real estate agents under the Fair Housing Act of 1968 and the Civil Rights Act of 1866. Yet racial bias remains an issue, along with discrimination based on skin color, national origin, religion, disability and other protected classes covered by federal law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve had other complaints of direct use of racial slurs,” Brenda Castañeda, deputy director for advocacy for </span><a href="https://homeofva.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HOME of Virginia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, told me. “I haven’t seen one this blatant or open.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her nonprofit organization assists residents who believe they have faced housing discrimination. It also sends in testers of different races to check if people are being given the same information, or whether some folks are steered elsewhere.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Baxter’s story is similar to the claims </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/04/realestate/wendell-pierce-harlem-apartment-racism.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">of actor Wendell Pierce</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who says his rental application for a Harlem apartment was rejected by a white landlord. “Racism and bigots are real,” </span><a href="https://x.com/WendellPierce/status/1797805253787611141" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">he said on X this week.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “There are those who will do anything to destroy life’s journey for Black folks.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The National Fair Housing Alliance said in its most recent report covering specific trends that</span><a href="https://nationalfairhousing.org/resource/2023-fair-housing-trends-report/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">more than 33,000 fair housing complaints were recorded in 2022</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the most in a single year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The tally might only be a fraction of the actual total, the Washington-based coalition said, because “most incidents of housing discrimination go undetected or unreported.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The organization continued: “Housing providers may lie about the availability of housing units or the monthly rent for apartments, steering Blacks, Latinos, Asian Americans, Pacific Islanders, and Native Americans to rent or buy homes only in neighborhoods of color.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another problem is the disparate treatment appraisers dole out as property owners place their homes on the market. I’ve written before about how African-American home sellers are often given lower appraisals, only to</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/08/23/blacks-others-shouldnt-have-to-obliterate-their-presence-to-receive-fair-home-value/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">receive more expensive ones</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when they obliterate any hint a Black family lives there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">John Robertson IV, spokesman for the Virginia Department of Professional and Occupational Regulation, told me the state’s Fair Housing Office has received 318 complaints this fiscal year, which ends June 30. Nearly 25% were race-based.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That should change. Without the threat of going behind bars, there’s little to compel racist property owners to do the right thing.</span></p>

<p>In many states, voters will soon be casting ballots to nominate candidates for office, and some have already done so. As voters, election officials and policymakers fulfill their civic duty in the coming months, this principle should drive how we discuss elections: The secure and fair elections that are a foundation of American self-government require high levels of trust and confidence from the public.</p>
<p>With the 2024 presidential race being a reprise of the 2020 election, this election year seems bound to raise many important questions about voting and election policy. In addition, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/south-dakota-open-primary-ballot-initiative-cdc43a6cee1447fd53d06de79bfb325d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some states will debate</a> how they nominate candidates for office to run in the general election. All will consider in some fashion how to maintain the best balance of convenience, security and trustworthiness in voting.</p>
<p>What should be top of mind for all of us the proper way to respond to attacks on the integrity of election outcomes from losing candidates or their campaigns, and how best to support election officials who face undue criticism and even personal threats against their lives.</p>
<p>Sutherland Institute, where I work, recently began a yearlong exploration of these questions at the <a href="https://sutherlandinstitute.org/the-election-trust-forum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Election Trust Forum</a>: an event co-sponsored by the Gary Herbert Institute of Public Policy at Utah Valley University and the SNF Agora Institute at Johns Hopkins University. This event and an ongoing stream of research, analysis and commentary throughout this election cycle represent a commitment to relentlessly pursue the answers to important voting and election policy questions.</p>
<p>One thing is certain: The power of average voters to choose their leaders through secure elections that evoke public confidence is what gives legitimacy to our self-governing republic. For elected officials who have taken an oath to support and defend the United States, this means that promoting public trust in secure elections is a solemn public duty. For citizens and voters, this means that promoting public trust in secure elections is both a civic duty and a matter of enlightened self-interest in maintaining the power of the people manifested through voting.</p>
<p>Of course, if our preferred candidate loses an election and blames it on fraud or vote suppression, it is natural to wonder if they are right. But in every state across the country voting is protected by dozens of layers of security that make widespread voter fraud practically impossible. Voting today is also more convenient and accessible than it has ever been.</p>
<p>This means that our patriotic loyalty to our republic requires us to reject misinformation from even our preferred candidates for office that would suggest that either voter fraud or voter suppression is driving election outcomes.</p>
<p>Of course, election policies and processes can always be improved. For instance, when I recently put the question of how we build or restore public trust in elections to MIT election researcher and professor Charles Stewart, he noted that the research clearly indicates that trust grows when voters have a positive experience with voting. This suggests that any negative experiences in voting in a primary election may be doing the opposite.</p>
<p>While political insiders obsess about the latest legal drama in the presidential race, we ought to be focused on issues of greater import, like seeking to improve elections and election security measures. As we do so, we must remember that the need to maintain and renew the health of our constitutional republic and American democracy demands a recognition that our elections are already fundamentally secure and trustworthy.</p>

Glenn Youngkin last week.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Kempsville High School varsity baseball team&#8217;s season was brought to a screeching halt after administrators found evidence that players had been making racist, harassing comments for years — one local mom said her son&#8217;s teammates called him the n-word — Virginia Beach Public Schools&#8217; superintendent </span><a href="https://www.13newsnow.com/article/news/local/mycity/virginia-beach/not-something-we-tolerate-vb-schools-superintendent-addresses-racism-hate-speech-found-in-kempsville-hs-baseball-program/291-78dd27ff-54fa-4f5a-8128-f51263ca4006" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said Monday</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Commonwealth University and George Mason University aren&#8217;t moving forward with previous plans to make mandatory courses that expand students&#8217; racial literacy and understanding of racism’s real-world consequences for Black Virginians and others of color. This, after the Youngkin administration </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/03/28/youngkin-administration-reviews-race-dei-syllabi-for-vcu-george-mason-courses/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">asked to review the courses&#8217; curricula</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and framed such classes as “a thinly veiled attempt to incorporate the progressive left’s groupthink on Virginia’s students.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even President Joe Biden snubbed one of the state&#8217;s oldest historically Black colleges, Virginia State University, by </span><a href="https://www.wric.com/news/politics/capitol-connection/virginia-lawmakers-college-leaders-react-after-president-biden-announces-he-wont-participate-in-debate-at-vsu/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pulling out of a highly-anticipated debate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the school with former President Donald Trump; it would have been the first time a presidential debate was hosted at an HBCU in the nation, at a time when most are </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/10/03/enrollment-is-growing-at-virginia-hbcus-but-they-face-historic-underfunding/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">still underfunded</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> compared to legacy white institutions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I could go on but I don&#8217;t need to; the pattern of these events reflects a steady dissolution of years of progress Virginia had been making to recognize and address the historic lack of diversity and equitable, inclusive practices in public schools, higher education, health care, and local and state government. It&#8217;s in line with the </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/21/us/dei-education-state-laws.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislative pushback against DEI</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> across the country, which will undoubtedly further rupture our ideological and political divides. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a moment for reflection. We should be asking ourselves hard questions, starting with, how did we get here?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why are we OK with our decisions and public policies hearkening back to a time when certain Virginians&#8217; human and civil rights were trampled as standard practice?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are we creating a legacy of social progress that will make the state the best it can be for all Virginians, or are we replicating the prejudices and problems that defined much of our past and passing a baton of moral failings to the next generations?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It will be to all of our benefit if our thinking spurs some serious course correction.</span></p>

In addition to creating a framework for a transition to a zero carbon electricity sector by 2050, the VCEA and sister legislation known as Solar Freedom swept away multiple barriers to installing solar in Virginia. Among the new provisions were some that strengthened net metering, the program that allows residents, businesses and local governments who install solar onsite to be credited for excess electricity they feed back to the grid. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, the </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title56/chapter23/section56-594/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> requires that customers of Dominion Energy and Appalachian Power be credited for the electricity they supply to the grid at the full retail rate for electricity. The credit is applied against the cost of the electricity they draw from the grid at night. The policy makes solar affordable and supports small businesses across Virginia.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the VCEA came with a ticking time bomb. It provided that in 2024 for Appalachian Power, and 2025 for Dominion, the State Corporation Commission would hold proceedings to determine the fate of net metering, and in particular the terms for compensating new net metering customers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, it’s 2024, and the bomb just went off. On May 6, the SCC issued an </span><a href="https://www.scc.virginia.gov/docketsearch/DOCS/7z0%4001!.PDF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">order</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> directing the two utilities to file their suggested changes. Appalachian’s proposal is due by September 2; Dominion’s is due by May 1, 2025. The SCC will establish a schedule for each case that will include provisions for the public and interested parties to participate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are two important protections to note. First, low-income customers will have their choice of installing solar under either the existing rules or the new ones. Second, customers who install solar panels and interconnect to the grid before the SCC issues its final order will continue to be covered by the existing provisions for retail net metering. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For anyone who’s been on the fence about installing solar, I can’t overstate the urgency of acting now. Nonprofits </span><a href="https://www.solarunitedneighbors.org/virginia/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solar United Neighbors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.solarizeva.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solarize Virginia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can help you get the best deal. Also check out the excellent advice and sample quotes from </span><a href="https://www.hrclimatehub.org/solar/solar-installer-comparison/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HR Climate Hub</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make no mistake, </span><a href="https://energyandpolicy.org/edison-electric-institute-campaign-against-distributed-solar/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">utilities hate net metering</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and will destroy it if they can. The more customers who install solar, the less control the utility can exercise over them — and, even more critically, the </span><a href="https://ilsr.org/articles/why-utility-execs-hate-distributed-solar/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">less money</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the company makes for its shareholders from building new generation and transmission. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s not what our utilities tell legislators and the SCC, though. Instead, they promote a narrative that net metering customers impose extra costs on other ratepayers, creating a “cost shift.” The idea is that residents who go solar are making everyone else pay more of the costs of the grid while they themselves rake in money with their free electricity from the sun. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This argument has raged across the country for years. Utilities often argue that solar customers should be paid for their surplus electricity only the amount of money the utility would otherwise have had to spend to generate or buy that same amount of electricity from somewhere else. This “avoided cost” can be less than one-third of the retail rate for residential electricity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a payback period of nine to </span><a href="https://www.ecowatch.com/solar/worth-it/va" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">15 years</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Virginia, residential solar is a reasonable investment with retail rate net metering, but it’s hardly a get-rich-quick scheme. Brandon Praileau, the Virginia program director for Solar United Neighbors, said in an email that lowering the net metering rate would eliminate the energy savings that homeowners see from solar today. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is the full retail 1:1 value of solar that allows solar to not be a boutique purchase that only fits a certain demographic but something that every homeowner can benefit from,&#8221; he noted. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Praileau added that the loss of net metering would also hit Virginia’s solar installers hard and lead to job losses, something I confirmed with industry members. Russ Edwards, president of Charlottesville-based Tiger Solar, says any devaluation of solar would have a “significantly adverse” impact on local companies like his that serve the residential market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the “cost shift” argument doesn’t actually depend on whether rooftop solar is affordable for customers or profitable for installers. The way utilities think about net metering, a homeowner could even lose money on solar and still be guilty of shifting the costs of maintaining the grid onto other customers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Net metering supporters counter that rooftop solar provides valuable benefits to the grid and to other customers that the utilities overlook, like relieving grid congestion and lessening the need for utility investments in new generation and transmission. Solar also has larger societal benefits like increased energy security, local resilience, clean air and carbon reduction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the years this dispute has spawned literally dozens of </span><a href="https://www.seia.org/initiatives/solar-cost-benefit-studies" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">studies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> estimating the value of solar. A Michigan study </span><a href="https://www.mtu.edu/news/2021/02/shining-a-light-on-the-true-value-of-solar-power.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">found</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that rather than being subsidized by other ratepayers, residents who install solar actually subsidize their non-solar-owning neighbors. Closer to home, a </span><a href="https://www.solarpowerworldonline.com/2018/11/maryland-public-service-commission-completes-value-of-solar-report/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maryland</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> study also concluded that distributed solar provided a value greater than the retail cost of energy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But every state is different. California’s public utility commission recently </span><a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/solar/california-derailed-its-booming-rooftop-solar-buildout-can-it-be-fixed" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">slashed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the net metering rate all the way down to a so-called avoided cost, in part because the huge growth of solar in the state has led to a power glut in the middle of the day. The residential solar market cratered as a result of the PUC’s action, with an estimated 17,000 </span><a href="https://calssa.org/press-releases/2023/12/22/significant-loss-of-solar-jobs-in-every-part-of-california-following-cpuc-cuts-to-solar-incentives#:~:text=A%20survey%20of%20California%20solar,all%20solar%20jobs%20in%20California." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">jobs lost</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the solar industry. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia does not have California’s problem. With only about </span><a href="https://www.seia.org/state-solar-policy/virginia-solar" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">6.5%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of our electricity generated by solar and the world’s largest energy storage facility in the form of Bath County’s </span><a href="https://www.dominionenergy.com/projects-and-facilities/hydroelectric-power-facilities-and-projects/bath-county-pumped-storage-station" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pumped hydro</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> plant, rooftop solar still helps Virginia utilities meet peak demand. We also face a skyrocketing demand for electricity from </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/04/03/now-what-the-heck-do-we-do-about-data-centers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">data centers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which militates in favor of all the clean energy we can generate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ten years ago, Virginia set out to do a study on the value of solar, led by the Department of Environmental Quality. Unfortunately, our utilities </span><a href="https://powerforthepeopleva.com/2014/10/06/utilities-pullout-wont-affect-value-of-solar-study/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pulled out</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when they didn’t like what they were seeing, so the study never progressed beyond a framing of the issues. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since then, Dominion and APCo have often repeated the “cost shift” narrative but have never backed it up with evidence. Their efforts have had some effect with legislators, most recently with passage of a </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb1062&amp;submit=GO" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> instructing the SCC to “make all reasonable efforts to ensure that the net energy metering program does not result in unreasonable cost-shifting to nonparticipating electric utility customers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But of course, that simply begs the question of whether a cost shift is actually occurring. Under the VCEA, the SCC will now have to “evaluate and establish” the amount a net metering customer should pay for “the cost of using the utility’s infrastructure,” and the amount the utility should compensate the customer for the “total benefits” the customer’s solar panels provide. The SCC is also instructed to evaluate and establish the “direct and indirect economic impact of net metering” and consider “any other information the Commission deems relevant.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Presumably, this other information should include the state’s </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title45.2/chapter17/section45.2-1706.1/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">energy policy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The policy specifically supports distributed solar, including “enhancing the ability of private property owners to generate their own renewable energy for their own personal use from renewable energy sources on their property.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The SCC will now have to navigate these opposing positions in what are certain to be contentious proceedings. Meanwhile, residents and businesses would be well advised to get their solar panels up this year. </span></p>

University bigwigs pat themselves on the back for the PR boost.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Noticeable numbers of graduates then protest at the ceremony, outraged at the luminary – and the university’s tone-deaf selection.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s what we witnessed last week as</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2024/05/11/vcu-youngkin-commencement-walkout/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Glenn Youngkin gave the commencement speech</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s also what happened at Howard University more than four decades ago.</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/1981/05/10/bush-speaks-at-howard/5723c487-587c-408a-a553-2e920ac590e6/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Then-Vice President George H.W. Bush</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – representing an administration that repeatedly attacked the quest for racial equality – spoke at the historically Black institution in Washington. I was among the 1,000 graduates receiving degrees that sunny day in 1981.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My alma mater’s decision to provide Ronald Reagan’s second-in-command a platform was more egregious than VCU’s – by far. For example, months earlier then-candidate Reagan had campaigned</span><a href="https://www.zinnedproject.org/news/tdih/reagan-speech-at-neshoba/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">near where three civil rights workers had been murdered by Ku Klux Klan members in 1964</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Mississippi. In his 1980 speech, Reagan invoked “states’ rights” – code words for keeping the feds from investigating blatant discrimination, especially throughout the South. Nor did he even acknowledge the previous murders, which had to be investigated by the FBI to achieve justice. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, you have to wonder why VCU officials tapped a guv who’s</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/11/10/orwellian-snitch-line-shuts-down-will-guv-end-assault-on-teachers/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">attacked teachers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/governor-of-virginia/pdf/74---eo/74---eo/EO-1---ENDING-THE-USE-OF-INHERENTLY-DIVISIVE-CONCEPTS,-INCLUDING-CRITICAL-RACE-THEORY,-AND-RESTORING-EXCELLEN.pdf" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">lambasted critical race theory</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and interfered</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/12/06/thought-policing-va-s-schools-youngkin-consolidates-his-grip-on-educations-ruling-boards/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">with the independence</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of public colleges in the state. His administration’s decision to review</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/03/28/youngkin-administration-reviews-race-dei-syllabi-for-vcu-george-mason-courses/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">syllabi for courses about diversity, equity, inclusion and race</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at VCU and George Mason University – what one faculty member called “hostile state scrutiny” – ultimately led to both universities</span><a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/diversity/2024/05/13/vcu-gmu-wont-require-dei-classes-after-youngkins-review" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">announcing course mandates wouldn’t go into effect this fall</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the person you let riff on</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2024/05/11/vcu-youngkin-commencement-walkout/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">musical metaphors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at commencement? I’m wondering if the folks who invited Youngkin would’ve allowed the fox to guard the henhouse, too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A VCU spokesman told me that it’s par for the course to invite the state’s chief executive to address the graduating class. Brian McNeill said previous gubernatorial speakers from both parties include George Allen, Jim Gilmore, Mark Warner, Tim Kaine, Bob McDonnell and Terry McAuliffe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We invite varied leaders from different backgrounds and with different perspectives to share their stories with our graduating class,” he said by email.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That may be. Though I don’t recall any recent governors as so overtly suspicious – and contemptuous of – the education community as Youngkin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McNeill said a</span><a href="https://president.vcu.edu/media/president-2021/media/docs/ootp2021-documents/HonoraryDegreesandOtherSpecialAwardsPolicy03-22-2019.pdf" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">special committee</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> annually recommends possible commencement speakers. That panel may include: cabinet members; board, faculty and student representatives; and other people chosen by the president. He didn’t have a list of the group’s members this year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wanted to know because it seems students, as on most campuses when such controversies arise, would’ve been the ones most likely to object. Were they outvoted?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some 1,200 graduating students signed up for the main commencement Saturday at the Greater Richmond Convention Center. Dozens walked out during Youngkin’s speech for a variety of reasons, including his crusade against efforts to promote racial equity in education and the teaching of Black history. Another reason students said they walked out was to support Palestinians during the ongoing</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/04/29/youngkin-says-no-encampments-on-virginia-campuses-supports-peaceful-protests/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Israeli military offensive in Gaza</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I asked a Youngkin spokesman about the guv’s reaction, Christian Martinez replied the day was about “celebrating the students.” That’s what you say when you deflect from the crux of the issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I noted earlier, the incident was a déjà vu moment. My mother had pleaded with me the morning of my graduation in 1981 not to protest. I was lukewarm about making any obvious display of disgust toward Bush.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet I supported others who turned their backs on the vice president, as dozens did that day. Bush, as a chief representative of the Reagan administration, had to answer for its regressive attitudes on race. If there were no public protest, it would’ve been a tacit approval of the administration’s social actions – some coded, some overt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though only in office a few months, some of the administration’s positions and viewpoints were clear:</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.npr.org/2004/06/10/1953700/reagan-the-south-and-civil-rights" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The administration opposed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> affirmative action and busing for school integration. It threatened to veto an extension of the</span><a href="https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/civil-rights-act/immediate-impact.html#:~:text=The%20Voting%20Rights%20Act%20of%201965%20provided%20direct%20federal%20enforcement,register%20voters%20and%20observe%20elections." target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Voting Rights Act of 1965</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which had allowed many Blacks – especially in the South – to finally gain access to the ballot box. (</span><a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/du-bois-review-social-science-research-on-race/article/reagan-legacy-and-the-racial-divide-in-the-george-w-bush-era/8B1FDB60B5252AE4B81733E78C701731" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reagan had opposed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act during his time in California, where he’d been governor. The landmark laws spurred equality for Black people in America.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plus, Reagan had been fond of relaying a story on the campaign trail about a notorious</span><a href="https://www.salon.com/2014/01/11/the_racism_at_the_heart_of_the_reagan_presidency/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">“Chicago welfare queen.”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The undertones suggested Black people were getting unfair advantages at the expense of white people, even though the woman in question wasn’t typical of the average welfare recipient.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why, then, was Bush invited to my campus? Howard is a</span><a href="https://thedig.howard.edu/all-stories/howard-works-meet-operating-expenses-face-unprecedented-inflation#:~:text=As%20a%20federally%20chartered%20HBCU,of%20Howard%20University's%20operating%20budget." target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">federally chartered historically Black university</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and it gets a sizable federal appropriation each year. HU officials were likely currying favor with the new presidential administration – despite the blowback.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At least, that’s what I remember from the time when I was more excited to earn my bachelor’s degree in print journalism than show disgust at Bush.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those memories came flooding back after I read about the VCU protest. I doubt most graduates will see the incident Saturday as anything more than a blip on an otherwise joyous day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The person who </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">should </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">be mortified, though, is Youngkin. His actions caused the protest in the first place. If he hadn’t politicized education, no one would even remember his speech – or the walkout.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The central bank recently proposed </span><a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/paymentsystems/regii-about.htm" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regulation II</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which would lower the maximum allowable “interchange fee,”  the cost merchants pay to banks to process debit cards. The thought is that the central bank mandating banks charge smaller processing fees to corporations would help both consumers and the big chain retailers like Walmart that pushed the regulation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, however, anything but this would happen. We know this because history proves it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2011, the Fed implemented a similar policy. Big merchants benefited while consumers — especially minority Americans — got dealt the short end of the stick.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/economic_brief/2015/eb_15-12#:~:text=In%202010%2C%20the%20so-called,and%20unequal%20effects%20on%20merchants." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the Richmond Federal Reserve Bank found that, in response to the Fed limiting the amount banks could charge retailers, financial institutions increased the maintenance costs associated with consumers’ checking accounts. They also raised the minimum balance for fee waivers, thereby preventing lower income individuals from accessing banking services, a requirement for transacting and succeeding in the modern economy. All told, 90% of merchants did </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">not </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">decrease their prices in response to this 2011 Fed price control on interchange, which allowed said merchants to increase their profits an additional $90 billion off our backs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Research from my school, George Mason University, found that the 2011 price control went so far as to increase the nation’s unbanked population by 1 million. As Richmond-based education and equity advocate Taikein M. Cooper </span><a href="https://richmondfreepress.com/news/2022/apr/28/banking-black-community-and-durbin-amendment-taike/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">put it</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Virginia felt this “unbanking” more than most in the country did because roughly 15% of Black and Latino households already lacked access to a financial institution. This policy added further complications to an already complex problem in this commonwealth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lesson here is clear: Price controls distort the market and result in less efficient transactions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, however, now the Fed has laid out a new proposal, Regulation II, to make this price cap even lower. That would again be a blessing for the Walmarts of the world, but it would hurt the rest of us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regulation II wouldn’t just lower the current interchange fee cap by over 30%. Under the new policy, the Fed would also gain the power to evaluate if technological innovations have allowed banks to lower their processing costs and if so, it would lower the maximum charge allowable. In other words, this proposed rule captures any gain that banks obtain and forces them to put it into reducing processing costs – even if that is not a feasible reality. Consequently, this proposed regulation provides the debit card issuers with little or no incentive to innovate or create cost-saving technology to lower transaction costs, increase their product offerings, or bolster the security of consumers’ accounts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By preventing banks from competing in the transaction fee market, the policy will also negatively affect other services customers receive. It should not surprise us if this policy accelerates the trend of businesses and consumers using digital payments to avoid an over-regulated banking market. That would reduce Virginia and the larger government’s tax revenue even further. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead of moving policies that would disproportionately benefit chain retailers, the Fed should stick with enforcing its dual mandate of creating maximum employment and price stability. Those are two things that many Virginians don’t feel they have enough of, and it is incumbent on the Fed to help make them more attainable.</span></p>

As the demand for data storage and processing grows, so does the need for reliable, sustainable, and affordable energy to power these facilities, the largest of which can consume more than </span><a href="https://dgtlinfra.com/data-center-power/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">100 megawatts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (MW) of power. That’s equal to the production of a single large utility-scale facility — enough to power tens of thousands of homes. The rise of AI will greatly increase the power needs of data centers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Policymakers and energy providers are exploring the potential of small modular reactors (SMRs) to meet the growing energy needs of the data center industry. While SMRs offer the potential for clean, reliable energy, their development and deployment face significant challenges and limitations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SMRs are a type of nuclear reactor that are smaller in size and power output compared to traditional nuclear power plants. They are designed to be modular, meaning they can be factory-built and transported to the site of installation, potentially reducing construction time and costs. SMRs typically have a power output of approximately 300 MW (MW) and can be used for a variety of applications, an obvious-looking one being electricity production to power megawatt-hungry data centers. In 2022, Gov. Glenn Youngkin suggested that the state’s first SMR would be built in Southwest Virginia, but in March the governor </span><a href="https://www.wjhl.com/news/local/youngkin-reverses-course-on-plans-to-build-first-smr-in-southwest-virginia/#:~:text=Youngkin%20reverses%20course%20on%20plans%20to%20build%20first%20SMR%20in%20Southwest%20Virginia,-by%3A%20Katherine%20Simpson&amp;text=ABINGDON%2C%20Va.,modular%20nuclear%20reactors%20(SMR)." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reversed course</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and the focus has shifted to areas that have a more established nuclear infrastructure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The industry is gearing up to potentially employ SMRs as part of the power stack for data centers. Stakeholders definitely noticed when Microsoft commenced a nationwide search for a “</span><a href="http://www.popsci.com/technology/microsoft-nuclear-power/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">principal program manager</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for nuclear energy and then when it </span><a href="http://www.theregister.com/2024/01/23/microsoft_nuclear_hires/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in January 2024 that it had hired Directors of Nuclear Technologies and Nuclear Acceleration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Virginia navigates this complex energy landscape, a wisely balanced approach is crucial. SMRs are not a panacea. We should continue to recognize the vital role of solar energy and other renewable sources in our state&#8217;s energy mix. Only by embracing a diverse and inclusive energy strategy can Virginia meet the demands of its burgeoning data center industry while ensuring a sustainable and prosperous future for all Virginians. Additionally, this embrace of diversity will be mission-critical for Dominion Energy to meet the statutory requirement under the Virginia Clean Economy Act that 100%of its energy be produced by renewable sources by 2045. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The risks of overreliance on SMRs</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While SMRs represent a promising avenue for clean energy production, it is essential to recognize that they are not a silver bullet solution to Virginia&#8217;s energy challenges. One of the most significant risks associated with an overemphasis on SMRs is that this technology — years away from coming to fruition — may be used as a pretense to block the development of solar energy projects in rural Virginia counties.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In recent years, there has been growing opposition to solar development in many rural communities across the state. As I noted in a previous</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/11/10/why-its-better-to-let-counties-review-solar-projects-case-by-case/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">commentary</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> piece for the Virginia Mercury, &#8220;A clear trend has emerged of Virginia counties purposefully limiting their own options. An increasing number of them are imposing explicit moratoria or near-bans on solar development.&#8221; This opposition is often rooted in concerns about the impact of solar projects on local land use, property values, and aesthetics. An oft-cited opposition argument is that the energy produced in these rural farms is “just sent up to Northern Virginia.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The promise of SMRs risks exacerbating this trend by providing opponents of solar development with a new argument to justify their position. They may argue that with SMRs on the horizon, there is no need to invest in solar projects that  could, allegedly, have negative impacts on local communities. This line of reasoning, however, ignores the fact that SMRs are still years away — perhaps as much as 20 years away — from widespread deployment and face significant permitting challenges.  Further, when sites are identified, they will almost certainly face local “NIMBY” opposition themselves. It’s also worth noting that one SMR’s electrical production is approximately that of two orange solar farms — hardly the sort of production that moots solar. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia legislators recently authorized Dominion Energy and Appalachian Power to move forward with initial development efforts for two nuclear reactors but, as Virginia Mercury columnist Ivy Main </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/04/03/now-what-the-heck-do-we-do-about-data-centers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">colorfully noted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, “This is not a fix. It is like scheduling knee surgery for next year when you are having a heart attack today.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, curbing today’s development of reliable, cost-effective renewable energy, and overemphasizing the present significance of SMRs in meeting Virginia’s energy needs, could leave Virginia in a very precarious position.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The case for a balanced, holistic energy approach</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To meet the growing energy demands of Virginia&#8217;s data center industry while ensuring a sustainable and resilient energy future, it is essential that we adopt a balanced, holistic approach that embraces a diverse mix of energy sources. This approach should include a combination of SMRs, solar energy, and other renewable sources such as wind and hydropower — as well as energy derived from fossil fuels. Fossil fuels still play a significant role in Virginia&#8217;s energy mix and will likely continue to do so, although gradually declining in importance, for the foreseeable future. It’s unrealistic to suggest otherwise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SMRs, although promising, face significant challenges that could delay their widespread deployment beyond even the 20-year timeframe. For one thing, such projects face significant licensing challenges at the state and federal level, including by the Nuclear Energy Regulatory Commission, whose processes include an extensive review of safety, environmental, waste management and other issues associated with nuclear projects.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nuclear energy is also expensive, especially when compared to solar. According to a</span><a href="https://www.lazard.com/media/2ozoovyg/lazards-lcoeplus-april-2023.pdf" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">2023 analysis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Lazard, a financial advisory and asset management firm, the cost of generating electricity from new nuclear plants in the United States is significantly higher than the cost of solar energy, even when accounting for energy storage. Lazard estimates that the unsubsidized levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) from new nuclear plants will range between $141 and $221 per megawatt-hour (MWh).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In contrast, Lazard projects that the unsubsidized LCOE for newly constructed utility-scale solar facilities will range between $24 and $96 per MWh. This means that, on average, solar energy with storage is likely to be </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">less than half the cost</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of electricity generated from new nuclear plants. (It is fair to acknowledge  that these costs are current estimates and that nuclear power could get more cost-effective over time, by improved technology, for example.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These cost differences have significant implications for Virginia&#8217;s energy future. By prioritizing solar energy development now, the state can not only reduce its carbon footprint but also ensure that electricity remains affordable for consumers and businesses. Moreover, the lower costs of solar energy can help to attract new industries and businesses to the state, driving economic growth and job creation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, the key to Virginia&#8217;s energy future lies not in a false choice between SMRs and solar, but in a comprehensive approach that recognizes the strengths and limitations of each energy source, plus traditional sources of energy, while working to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and reducing our carbon footprint over time. Instead of either/or when it comes to energy, let’s focus on all of the above.</span></p>

Marjorie Taylor Greene gives a thumbs down during President Joe Biden's State of the Union address. The Georgia Republican shouted at Biden at various times during the speech. (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)</p><p>We are a divided country these days, so much so that certain people have taken to mad mutterings about a “national divorce,” secession or even civil war. But fear not, fellow Americans, for a time of healing and reunion may be upon us.</p>
<p>If you have doubts, I get it, because what could inspire renewed unity in this overheated political environment? What could possibly bring together Republicans and Democrats, conservatives and liberals, at a time when we appear to agree on so little?</p>
<p>Well, history tells us that nothing brings people together faster than having a common enemy, and Americans of both parties now seem to have found one in Georgia’s own Marge in Charge, U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene.</p>
<p>Of course, Democrats have openly despised Greene since she entered public life a few years ago, in large part because she’s as mean as a water moccasin and nutty as a south Georgia pecan orchard. But times being what they are, that disdain has become the foundation of her political career. Conservatives love what liberals hate, so the more anger that Greene could trigger from the left, the more adoration and power she got on the right. It has worked very, very well for her until now, but her limitations are about to come into play.</p>
<p>Thanks to her time in the spotlight, Greene now sees herself as a foreign policy expert, as the arbiter and enforcer of what Republicans are allowed to believe, and even as vice presidential material. She has also recently decided, pretty much all on her own, that House Speaker Mike Johnson, her fellow Republican, must be removed from that high office because he dared to allow votes on foreign-aid packages to Ukraine, Taiwan and Israel that Greene personally opposed. (All three passed by large margins.)</p>
<p>“Mike Johnson’s speakership is over,” she proclaimed last week, as if she held his fate in her hands, saying that “he has betrayed America, he has betrayed Republican voters.”</p>
<p>Instead, and for the first time in her short career, there has been significant blowback from her own party. Her insistence that all aid to Ukraine be ended has earned her the title of “Moscow Marjorie” from the Murdoch-owned New York Post. The far-right editorial board of the Wall Street Journal, also Murdoch-owned, called her “Rep. Mayhem Taylor Greene” for her ongoing string of tantrums.</p>
<p>“She — not the Democrats — are the biggest risk to us getting back to a majority,” said Sen. Thom Tillis, Republican of North Carolina, accusing her of being “a terrible leader” and “dragging our brand down.” Even Democrats are now saying that if necessary, they will join with Republicans in voting to spite Greene and keep Johnson as speaker, a step of bipartisan cooperation that would be extraordinary even in less heated times.</p>
<p>Greene is clearly a clown, but clowns can be popular. However, the traits that make a good clown aren’t transferable to other lines of work. A funny face and big feet don’t qualify you to dictate American foreign policy on Ukraine. A lapel flower that shoots water doesn’t make you vice presidential material, and a big red nose doesn’t give you the power to unilaterally remove a House speaker.</p>
<p>The most famous clown in America, Ronald McDonald, has been the popular mascot for McDonald’s for more than 60 years, but nobody, including Ronald, thinks Ronald should be CEO of McDonald’s Corp. (The actual CEO of McDonald’s went to Harvard Business School, not to clown college.)</p>
<p>But you see, that’s where Ronald McDonald and Marjorie Greene part company. Ronald is self-aware enough to know he’s a clown. Marjorie doesn’t. She thinks she gets all this TV time and attention because of her wisdom and leadership qualities, when in fact she has just happened to come along at a time when her party’s base cares more about performance art and political theater — which she’s good at — than they do about actual governing.</p>
<p>But like Greene herself, that approach has severe limitations. The GOP has forfeited so much power to the clowns among them – including at the very top – that on its own it is incapable of performing the basic functions of self-government. Thanks to the leeway they’ve given to Greene and others, the party that famously rejects compromise as betrayal now needs Democratic help just to keep its own speaker in place.</p>
<p>It’s a kumbaya moment.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But as many families with a college-bound high school senior know, this isn’t a normal year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Delays in processing the FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid) form have students across the country stressed out, and understandably so. Typically, May 1 is the national college deposit deadline – but this year, many students haven’t yet received need-based financial aid offers from schools because of the federal delays in processing applications. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Typically, students file their FAFSA forms starting in the fall, meaning that by January or so, schools are receiving those forms and are able to create financial aid packages based on the forms. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year, the issues with the new forms meant that students couldn’t even start their applications until the end of December. That means schools like VCU are just now receiving financial information we need to process financial aid packages. This week VCU is starting to offer need-based aid packages to new students – nearly four months later than we usually do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without knowing how much financial aid they’ll receive to cover the cost, it could be challenging  for some families to decide which college their student will attend. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At VCU, our message to students is that the most important thing is to remain committed to their college education. This year’s FAFSA issues are stressful, yes – but they’re a glitch in the system, which is not the norm. We want students to understand that VCU and college administrators around the country are working to help them. We’ll get through this! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We applaud the federal government’s intent, which was to make the FAFSA form simpler and easier to use, especially for lower-income and middle-income students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Department of Education, simplifying the form should allow 610,000 more students to qualify for Pell grants, which go to low-income students, and almost 1.5 million more students will qualify for the maximum Pell grant. These are laudable goals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is an issue which especially impacts VCU’s students, because so many of them rely on need-based financial aid. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the current academic year, about 65% of VCU’s student body, and 71% of our undergraduates, are enrolled with a FAFSA. More than 30% of our student body is Pell-eligible, meaning their families have low incomes, and another third is made up of first-generation students. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The FAFSA delay has a greater impact on those groups, but it also impacts middle-income families, who also often rely on need-based financial aid. In addition, the FAFSA is the first step toward other ways of paying for college, such as direct loans.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Comparing the applications we received last year at this time to the ones we’ve received so far for next year, we’ve seen about 14% fewer FAFSA applications — which is still a better rate than the state and national averages. <a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/bill.debaun.national.college.access.network/viz/NCANsFAFSATracker-2024-25FAFSACycle/HomePage?publish=yes" target="_blank">According</a> to the National College Attainment Network, FAFSA submissions are down 23.8% in Virginia and down 29% nationally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our expectation is that we’ll see that number tick up as the federal government processes more applications. While VCU, like many schools, has a May 1 deadline for commitments and financial deposits for the coming academic year, we’ve extended our deposit deadline to May 15. We understand the position our students are in. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the meantime, there are </span><b>proactive</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> steps both VCU, other Virginia institutions of higher learning and students can take. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On VCU’s end, we are processing aid packages as quickly as possible for the applications we’ve received. And this year, we’re also awarding merit-based financial aid earlier than we usually do, so students who qualify can use that to start making decisions. We’ve also made additional institutional aid available. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We encourage students – and potential students – to reach out to their financial aid counselors at the college they are considering, via phone or email. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And we encourage students to visit campus if they haven&#8217;t yet, to also speak in person with their financial aid counselor. Incoming students can connect with VCU’s financial counselors face-to-face and get a feel for the school, as well. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We also want students to remember: every student who applies for FAFSA, and every college, are facing the same delays. A lot of students are just like them, waiting anxiously for their forms to process. And that will happen – later than we’d all like, but it will happen. Colleges are working with students to help make this process a little easier. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And the most important thing is that students not give up on college because of these delays. Their future is too important to let it be sidelined by what is ultimately a temporary timing issue. The FAFSA is just one step toward the bigger goal – getting an education that will allow them to pursue their dreams.</span></p>

Or</span><a href="https://www.dailypress.com/1998/01/18/an-innocent-bystander/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Gary Roberson</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, whom I once interviewed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of these individuals were “third parties” – innocent pedestrians, drivers or their passengers who got in the way of speeding criminal suspects or pursuing law enforcement officials around the state. They died or were horribly injured during high-speed police pursuits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m mentioning them following a</span><a href="https://stateline.org/2024/04/12/in-reversal-more-areas-allow-high-speed-police-chases/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">recent report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that several states and municipalities around the country have reversed policies about high-speed chases. They’re allowing police more latitude to speed to catch suspects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a dangerous trend that should end.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In previous years, many departments had limited high-speed pursuits. But</span><a href="https://stateline.org/2024/04/12/in-reversal-more-areas-allow-high-speed-police-chases/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Stateline</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> notes legislators and some police agencies, citing concerns about crime, have since eased restrictions. (Stateline is a sister publication of the Virginia Mercury.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is happening despite data that reveal major </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">decreases </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">in violent and property crime rates since the early 1990s, according to the</span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/04/24/what-the-data-says-about-crime-in-the-us/#:~:text=Property%20crime%20in%20the%20U.S.,violent%20crimes%20per%20100%2C000%20people." target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Pew Research Center</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s as if tough-on-crime politicians aren’t paying attention to the data. They’re letting perceptions of crime outweigh the actual facts, while glossing over the inherent dangers of such police chases.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Florida, Washington state, the District of Columbia and San Francisco are among the places that have rolled back restrictions over the past year. That decision is alarming, especially given the possibility for deaths and injuries to unsuspecting civilians and the officers themselves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several law enforcement agencies I canvassed around Virginia still have strict guidelines and parameters regarding police chases. They weigh the seriousness of the crimes a suspect is accused of versus the possible threat to others on the roadways.</span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/crime-courts/virginia-police-high-speed-chases/article_f689973e-3c69-11ee-9bdf-334d53ee7361.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The Richmond Times-Dispatch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found similar results last year when reporting on a handful of agencies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Fairfax County Police Department, the largest among localities in the state with nearly 1,500 sworn officers,</span><a href="https://d.docs.live.net/d016fe375902de20/Documents/GO-504.pdf%20(fairfaxcounty.gov)" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">has a pursuit policy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> mandating officers have a reasonable suspicion that fleeing motorists or their passengers have committed or tried to commit a violent felony, or possibly violated any felony or misdemeanor involving the display, threat or firing of a gun or explosive device.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The county’s latest policy began in 2021 and was updated in March. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The revised pursuit policy aligned FCPD with best practices regionally and across the country,” a police department spokesman told me by email. “This policy balances the need to pursue criminals while maintaining safety for all within our community.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Chesapeake, among the circumstances that police officers must consider are the “severity of crime for which the offending driver is a suspect” and that person’s “vehicle speeds and driving behavior,” according to the department’s 11-page pursuit policy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The decision to continue the pursuit should be based on the officer’s reasonable belief that the necessity for immediate apprehension outweighs the level of danger created by the pursuit,” it emphasizes. Pursuits are to be ended immediately in a number of situations, including when a suspect “begins to drive in the opposite lane against oncoming traffic.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of those steps seem smart. Yet, according to one</span><a href="https://courtroomproven.com/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">study by a Las Vegas law firm</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Virginia ranks second among the states where a deadly crash following a police pursuit is most likely. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The January news release by H&amp;P Law said it analyzed the percentage of fatal crashes involving a police pursuit in each state. The firm, known for personal injury litigation, studied crashes from 2017 to 2021 reported by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s percentage of fatal crashes involving a police pursuit was 2.03%, only behind Georgia at 2.09%. Some 82 deadly motor accidents occurred during police chases over the five years that were studied, the law firm said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Virginia State Police spokeswoman, at my request, provided statistics on police pursuits from 2020 through 2023. The department patrols interstates, highways and rural roads in the commonwealth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Relatively few people were injured or killed in those 2,222 police chases. Most of those harmed were criminal suspects or law enforcement officials. Last year, though, 28 third-party individuals were injured during 716 State Police chases. In 2021, one uninvolved person and nine suspects died during 492 pursuits.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to pursuits, police officers and their supervisors should prioritize “safety above all else,” Tim Goler, assistant professor of sociology and urban affairs at Norfolk State University, told me.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">“A balanced approach is crucial.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such pursuits should occur only when violent felons are the targets, for example, instead of someone suspected of something as minor as an expired license plate, he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goler also advocated for serious evaluations of such incidents afterward, something he questioned is happening now in most police chases. “Departments should have rigorous review policies in place for every pursuit,” he continued.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Police agencies don’t want to let suspects in murders, rapes or robberies run free, obviously. But they have to ask themselves questions, too: Can they arrest a suspect later? Do they know where the person is headed, such as home or a workplace? Is that person an immediate threat to others in the community?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Relatives of those killed during police pursuits, especially people who weren’t the target, are left asking: “Why my loved one? Was the chase even necessary?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last July 29,</span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/crime/hopewell-police-chase-ends-in-fatal-collision/article_930cca2c-2fa4-11ee-a81e-ab264077972e.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">a high-speed chase in Hopewell</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ended when the driver of a pickup truck sought by Prince George County Police ran a red light. The truck struck a car, and the car’s driver, 45-year-old Andre Bassett Jr. of Jacksonville, Fla., was fatally injured. Police said they had tried to stop the pickup truck because its driver was traveling 67 mph in a 45 mph zone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Aug. 7,</span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/crime/1-dead-in-carjacking-and-police-chase-in-henrico/article_14088abc-361c-11ee-a6e0-47803b6f3a23.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">a high-speed chase occurred in Henrico County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as county police pursued a carjacking suspect. The suspect’s car crashed into a boy riding his bike, killing Geormond “Geo” Morton, 17, of Henrico.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nor are such incidents new.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than a quarter century ago, while reporting at the (Newport News) Daily Press, I met Gary Roberson. While walking to a convenience store in 1997 in Newport News, he was struck by a car fleeing police when it ran up onto the sidewalk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roberson suffered a broken lower back, damaged nerves in his spine, a broken leg, fractured collarbone and paralysis below the waist for a few months – among other injuries. He eventually endured more than half-dozen operations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The suspect who struck Roberson, police said at the time, had earlier arrests or convictions for speeding, cocaine possession, brandishing a firearm and assault. A lawsuit filed by Roberson claimed police officers should have prevented the suspect from even entering his car the day of the chase.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Police officers can’t have a blanket “no chase ever” policy. Violent suspects would speed away every time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, we know fleeing suspects on our roads won’t be responsible. That’s why police officers must be.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Officers have an extra duty not just to make an arrest, but also to prevent harm against innocents. It’s an unfortunate – though necessary – burden.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Erring on the side of restraint may allow nonviolent offenders and low-level criminals freedom – at least immediately. Yet it will also keep third parties alive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s a goal police officers should accept. Municipalities and departments bucking that philosophy are placing their desire for arrests over public safety.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion Energy Virginia’s answer, as described in its 2023 Integrated Resource Plan (IRP), is “build more fossil fuels.” The utility is pushing forward plans to build new methane gas generating units in Chesterfield. Dominion argues that although its IRP calls for dramatically increased carbon emissions, it sort of complies with the Virginia Clean Economy Act anyway because the VCEA has an escape clause when reliability is at risk. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion does not acknowledge that its own actions contribute to the problem. To be fair, though, it’s a huge problem, and even if our utilities were on board with the VCEA’s carbon-cutting agenda, we would need stronger legislative policy than we have now. Rejoining the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative is an </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/03/29/yes-rggi-works/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">important priority</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that Democrats are rightly pursuing, but the need for action goes much further. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Dave Marsden, D-Fairfax, convened meetings the week before last to hear from utilities, industry members, environmental groups and others to get suggestions on ways to reform the VCEA. The interest groups met separately, and members of one group were not allowed to attend other group sessions to hear what those stakeholders had to say. The meetings were closed-door and confidential, with the express purpose of preventing a nosy public from learning anything  through Freedom of Information Act requests. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That secrecy makes me queasy, so I declined the invitation to attend the environmentalists’ session. I’d have cheerfully jettisoned my scruples, though, if I could have been in the utility session to hear what Dominion’s lobbyists were whispering in the senator’s ear. Alas, that was not on offer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Marsden is asking the right questions, and of course, I always have answers, even when no one is asking. In my view, Virginia can stay on track to carbon neutrality by adopting four basic principles: data centers must pay their own way, both literally and carbon-wise; solar must be easy to build and interconnect; utilities must not build new fossil generation for “reliability” before exhausting non-carbon solutions; and efficient buildings must be added to the strategy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s start with the elephant outgrowing the room.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Data centers are sucking up all the energy</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without action, data centers will soon overtake residential customers to become Dominion’s largest category of customer. Already, they are driving the utility’s decision-making, as we saw from Dominion’s IRP. This year, the General Assembly deferred action to address the energy crisis until it sees the results of a </span><a href="https://jlarc.virginia.gov/pdfs/resolutions/2024_Data%20centers_JLARC.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> being undertaken by the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission (JLARC). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the 2025 session, though, the General Assembly will have to choose from three options if it still cares about the energy transition: stop the growth of the data center industry in Virginia, put the onus on data centers to source their own clean energy from the grid, or dramatically increase renewable energy generation and power line construction.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers show no desire to stop all data center growth, but as </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/11/21/a-5-point-plan-for-data-centers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve urged before</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, they should establish a joint state-local task force to choose appropriate sites for growth based on energy and transmission availability, water resource adequacy and good-neighbor factors, like distance from residential communities and parkland. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legislators should also require data centers to meet industry-best standards for energy efficiency, use alternatives to diesel generators for backup power and source carbon-free energy from facilities located on the grid that serves Virginia. They could buy this power either on their own or through a specially-designed utility tariff, as long as it meets all of their needs on a </span><a href="https://www.raponline.org/knowledge-center/24-7-carbon-free-electricity-transition-tariffs-regulatory-tool-accelerating-decarbonization-technical/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">24/7, hourly basis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In no case should other customers see higher electricity bills for infrastructure that’s only needed because of data centers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, these measures will take time to put in place, yet data center development is proceeding apace while the General Assembly takes its nap this year. There is no avoiding Virginia’s need for a lot more carbon-free generation, pretty much right away. A </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/03/07/virginia-lawmakers-pass-competing-proposals-to-encourage-small-modular-reactor-development/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">couple</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of small modular nuclear reactors ten years from now aren’t a solution.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Don’t expect climate leadership from Dominion</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion’s fossil-heavy IRP marked a sharp break away from the </span><a href="https://esg.dominionenergy.com/assets/pdf/2022-Climate-Report.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">climate report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the company released just months before, which projected solar dominating the grid by 2040. Whether the IRP should be dismissed as political pandering to a conservative governor, or taken in earnest to mean the utility has thrown in the towel on renewable energy, is something of a Rorschach test for Virginia leaders. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Dominion releases its 2024 IRP this fall, we may get more clarity about what the company really thinks. More likely, we will still be left guessing. Dominion has a long history of playing to both sides to get what it wants, and what it wants is profit.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s nothing wrong with a company making a profit, of course, as long as the company isn’t also allowed to make the rules it plays by. Asking Dominion’s lobbyists to help make energy policy is like recruiting burglars for a task force on crime prevention. </span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Make it easier to build solar</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Virginia counties vie with each other to attract data centers, some are notably less keen on solar farms. Sprawling developments of windowless warehouses that suck power? Yes, they say. Grassy fields lined with rows of solar panels that produce power? No. Such is the horror with which some people view solar that localities have adopted moratoriums, acreage caps and other limits designed to keep projects at bay. The result is that an already-slow process for siting solar projects is getting even slower, more unpredictable and more expensive. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers rejected legislation this year that would have allowed the State Corporation Commission to overrule local permit denials. Yet it seems </span><a href="https://greenehurlocker.com/more-virginia-counties-are-seeking-solar-moratoriums-but-are-they-legal/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">doubtful</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> whether, in a Dillon Rule state like ours, local governments actually have the authority to enact blanket prohibitions and caps on specific kinds of land use. Legislators may want to ask the attorney general to clarify this point rather than waiting for landowners to challenge in court a locality’s refusal to let them put solar panels on their property. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the AG (or a court) rules these barriers illegal, localities would have to go back to evaluating the merits of project applications on a case-by-case basis — hardly a bad result. But it would be wiser and more orderly to pass legislation spelling out under what circumstances a local government may reject a solar project, and what the landowner’s recourse should be. </span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">New gas plants are the wrong solution for reliability</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though Dominion’s 2023 IRP didn’t win approval from the SCC, Dominion is going ahead with plans to build new methane gas combustion turbines in Chesterfield. Given that these “peaker” plants generate dirty power at a high price, Dominion should not be permitted to build gas combustion turbines if other alternatives are available. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which they are. Demand-response programs, advanced grid technologies and batteries charged by renewable energy </span><a href="https://www.cleanegroup.org/peaker-plant-reliability-must-run-designation/#:~:text=These%20alternatives%20include%20compensated%20and,lives%2C%20and%20they%20strengthen%20communities." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">are superior to gas peakers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for reasons of cost, air quality and climate impact. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion is building some large batteries and testing long-duration battery storage technologies (and of course, Virginia already has the largest pumped storage facility in the world), but our utilities have not even begun to tap the potential of batteries in homes and businesses. Subsidizing the purchase of batteries by homeowners and businesses in exchange for the ability to draw on the batteries for peaking power, </span><a href="https://www.masssave.com/residential/rebates-and-incentives/battery-storage-and-evs/batteries#:~:text=Residents%20can%20participate%20in%20the,inverter%20will%20control%20your%20battery." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">as some utilities do</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, would also build resilience into the grid and </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/09/business/energy-environment/green-mountain-home-batteries.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">address power outages</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> more cheaply than burying lines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Imagine: If data centers had installed batteries instead of the </span><a href="https://bristowbeat.com/stories/deq-does-not-grant-approval-for-data-centers-to-run-diesel-generators-outside-of-emergencies,37122" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">11 gigawatts of diesel generators</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at Loudoun and Fairfax County data centers, Virginia would already have more battery storage capacity than </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1412755/electrochemical-energy-storage-capacity-worldwide-by-country/#:~:text=The%20United%20States%20was%20the,capacity%20as%20of%20that%20year." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">any country in the world</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Let everyone build solar </h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The VCEA calls for 35% of its solar target to be satisfied by third-party developers. The purpose of this set-aside is two-fold: to attract more private capital, and to use competition to keep a lid on prices. Unfortunately, the SCC accepted Dominion’s argument that 35% should be read as a ceiling as well as a floor, to the detriment of ratepayers and solar developers. With Dominion now reneging on its solar commitments, it’s more important than ever that private developers be allowed to step in. One </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB638" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the 2024 session would have corrected this problem by explicitly making 35% the minimum. The General Assembly should adopt that measure. </span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Fix interconnection</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Possibly the most inexplicable failure of the General Assembly this year was failing to pass legislation to resolve </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/12/05/solar-for-schools-and-nonprofits-is-under-siege-fortunately-theres-a-simple-fix/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the dispute</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> between Dominion and commercial customers over interconnection requirements. The onerous requirements that Dominion adopted in December of 2022  — imposed even in the face of a contrary SCC ruling — have wreaked havoc on plans by local governments to put solar on public buildings and schools. That is fine with Dominion; though the goal of the new requirements was to acquire upgraded distribution infrastructure at no cost to itself, its monopolistic lizard brain is equally satisfied with the result of shutting down competition from small solar companies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legislators should not accept this result, though. The General Assembly adopted net metering years ago because encouraging residents and businesses to go solar is good for the economy and makes communities more resilient. Support for distributed renewable energy is even written into the Virginia Code as </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title45.2/chapter17/section45.2-1706.1/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">official policy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And distributed solar is hugely popular. Indeed, the very people who oppose utility-scale solar projects almost inevitably argue that society should maximize rooftop solar instead. In this they are at least half right: If we are really going to meet the energy challenge ahead of us, the very least we can do is milk every kilowatt-hour from sunshine falling on rooftops.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customers have always paid to interconnect their solar to the utility’s grid. The dispute between Dominion and its customers is about whether Dominion can insist they pay the entire cost of expensive new fiber-optic wire and other cool technology that could make the distribution grid better for everyone, but which any one customer can’t afford. These upgrades could enable not just more solar but also electric vehicle charging in our communities, vehicle-to-grid technology and programs allowing utilities to make use of customers’ battery storage. But if the technology really is that valuable (a determination that should be made by the SCC, not Dominion), then getting it shouldn’t depend on how deep a customer’s pocket is — especially when that customer is a local government and, therefore, effectively, the Virginia taxpayer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year’s </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB117" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">interconnection bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would have allowed a utility to recover the costs of these grid upgrades from ratepayers, with SCC oversight. Even Dominion would have been better off with the bill, something it would have recognized if its lizard brain weren’t in charge at the time. The General Assembly should pass the bill.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">An untapped three gigawatts of energy are waiting off our coast</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion’s 2,600 megawatt Virginia offshore wind project is due to begin construction this year, but it is not the only game in town. The </span><a href="https://www.kittyhawkoffshore.com/documents/30600168/0/Kitty+Hawk+Wind+Fact+Sheet+March_2024.pdf/045cdac9-27a6-0b82-f46e-99d1e9840afb?t=1709785208653" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kitty Hawk</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> offshore wind area situated off North Carolina can deliver up to 3,500 megawatts of energy through a cable that will come ashore at Virginia Beach. All that is holding up the project is the lack of a customer.  Offshore wind is more expensive than solar, but we have a lot of power-hungry data centers who could pay a clean energy tariff that would include Kitty Hawk wind. </span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Maximize efficiency in buildings </h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Possibly the best piece of energy legislation to pass this year was the </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB151" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that directs local governments and schools to build to higher efficiency standards and incorporate renewable energy, as appropriate. The language could have been even stronger, but as it is, it will deliver significant cost savings for taxpayers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, local governments will now build to better standards than most homeowners get for themselves when they buy a house.  That’s because Virginia’s residential building code is pathetically </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/10/19/houses-can-be-built-to-use-much-less-energy-why-arent-they/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">behind the times</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when it comes to energy efficiency. Home buyers and renters would save more than enough money on utility bills to cover the upfront cost of better housing construction, but builders won’t voluntarily meet higher standards because it reduces profits. That should not be acceptable. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legislation passed in 2021 directed the Board of Housing and Community Development to consider amendments that would </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=212&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb2227" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">strengthen the building code</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. BHCD, which is dominated by builder and real estate interests, simply ignored the law. The matter is now </span><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FRavf8frX4tzyuHJ9qKIvFvPZtjLzGxb/view" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in litigation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (and the governor is trying to weaken the code </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/01/25/as-youngkin-takes-an-axe-to-the-deep-state-what-could-possibly-go-wrong/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">even further</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">), but the General Assembly could resolve the matter by directing BHCD to adopt efficiency measures at least as strong as the national standards set by the International Building Code Council (itself under fire for allowing builder interests to weaken efficiency standards), and to allow local governments to adopt stronger “stretch codes” to help residents save even more money and energy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Going further, new and renovated buildings should be required to use electricity in place of methane gas, oil or propane for heating, cooling and appliances wherever practicable. Though building electrification increases electricity consumption, electricity is a more efficient technology than burning fossil fuels in the home, so it contributes to lower energy costs for residents and a smaller carbon footprint for the state overall. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s a shame the General Assembly settled for simply not going backwards this year, but it is a good sign that Marsden and others are not waiting for next year to consider ways to get us back on the carbon-cutting wagon. With the </span><a href="https://climateclock.world/science" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">climate clock</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ticking, we have no more time to lose.</span></p>

(Library of Virginia)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We&#8217;re moving soon and our new house sits on land that&#8217;s been in my family for generations. Wanting a clearer picture of the ancestors who passed the property down to us, my husband and I asked my aunts, our family historians, to do some genealogical sleuthing. They identified our long-dead relatives who settled the land after the Civil War but, just as interestingly, they uncovered a deed for a nearby family parcel that contained a </span><a href="https://mappingcville.com/2019/01/20/racial-covenants/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">racial covenant</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The white parties in the 1940 deed agreed &#8220;not to sell the above described real estate to any one not of the caucasian race for the period of twenty-five (25) years from this date, with the exception of five acres thereof situated in the Northwest corner of the above described real estate which may be sold to Sally Bowles (colored).&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sally Bowles was my great-great-aunt and a Black woman entrepreneur in western Hanover County. White people in the area paid her to do their laundry and that&#8217;s probably why they deigned to sell her five measly acres of the 272 acres they were selling. Besides being proof of the historic, systemic exclusion of Black families from wealth building in Virginia and other southern states, my lingering questions about who my people were presents an opportunity to visit the Library of Virginia.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Library, founded in 1823, is the state&#8217;s deepest trove of Virginia&#8217;s cultural history and includes over 130 million books, maps, periodicals and other materials that tell the story of who we were and are. Since 2014, the Library has offered a genealogy workshop series to teach people how to use its records and other resources to research their heritage and family lineage. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We really began the series by focusing on beginning genealogy and then began expanding it to more specific types of records over the years,&#8221; Ginny Dunn, the Library&#8217;s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Archives &amp; Library Reference Services Manager, emailed me. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our military records, African American genealogy, and immigration records workshops have been among the most popular workshops.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I understand exactly why the African American genealogy workshop draws a lot of interest; although Black history doesn’t begin with slavery, that brutal institution robbed many Black families of being able to trace their roots beyond its reaches. That longing for our family, for knowing who we truly are and where they came from, has never left some of us. But finding out more about one&#8217;s familial past is a curiosity nearly everyone will experience at some point in their life. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About &#8220;one-in-seven U.S. adults (15%) say they have ever used a mail-in DNA testing service from a company such as AncestryDNA or 23andMe,&#8221; a Pew Research Center </span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2019/08/06/mail-in-dna-test-results-bring-surprises-about-family-history-for-many-users/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">survey </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">found in 2019. Eighty-seven percent of people who have used one of the kits said they did it to &#8220;learn more about where their family came from,&#8221; while 36% did it to &#8220;get information about their health or family medical history&#8221; and another 36% wanted to &#8220;connect with relatives they might have but didn&#8217;t know about.&#8221; People are getting to know themselves like never before and in our state, the Library of Virginia can aid those inquiries.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Many times when people come to the Library, they’ll say to us, ‘I want to search for my family,’ but they don&#8217;t know how to do it or what to do,” Dunn said. “We lead them through the steps, help them figure it out, and tell them you always start with yourself and work your way back through the records.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year’s series kicked off March 1 with a workshop that introduced 22 beginners to genealogical research, led by Dunn and education and program specialist </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anne McCrery. Dunn said the attendees enjoyed the experience and “asked a lot of questions.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In mid-April, the Library hosted the second workshop, “How to Trace Your Virginia Roots,” and the series will continue May 3 with a workshop on how to use little-known records — including “Virginia penitentiary records, Prohibition Commission records, state mental hospital records, court order books” — to trace Virginia genealogy. The series runs through October. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The things we find out about our kin when we dig into our family history may surprise us. I learned, for instance, that my great aunt Lillian — niece of Sally, mentioned above —  was a nightclub singer and pianist who performed frequently in Richmond’s historic haven of Black culture, Jackson Ward, in its heyday. How glamorous she sounds! I’d been researching (often at the Library, sometimes assisted by legendary historian/then</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">-director of educational and outreach services Gregg Kimball)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://richmondmagazine.com/news/features/a-leader-from-leigh-st/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">writing</span></a> <a href="https://richmondmagazine.com/news/richmond-history/reflections-of-the-past/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">about</span></a> <a href="https://richmondmagazine.com/news/features/coming-home/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jackson</span></a> <a href="https://richmondmagazine.com/news/features/still-standing/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ward</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for years without realizing I had a personal connection to the area.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Others may find themselves similarly shocked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We had a patron find that her grandmother&#8217;s real name was different than she thought and also that she was married a different year than she had been told,” Dunn told me. “Another interesting thing that people have found is that a physical description of an ancestor (often found on a military pension record) is very similar to a living descendant.” She’s also seen “people who found something about their ancestry that is very emotional, and they&#8217;ll start crying. You just don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s crying in a good way or something upsetting.”</span></p>

(Courtesy Richmond SCAN)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is no better way to recognize the significant impact of service and volunteerism — on our city, our state and in ourselves — than by amplifying the first-hand stories of Virginians who are making a difference. According to </span><a href="https://americorps.gov/about/our-impact/volunteering-civic-life/va" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">data </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> collected by AmeriCorps and the Census Bureau, nearly 2 million Virginia volunteers contributed 130.5 million hours of service through organizations, worth an estimated $4.0 billion, in 2021. These staggering figures show the amazing impact we make when we leverage our time and talent for the greater good, but it’s individual stories of service that give a face to these statistics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a </span><a href="https://servevirginia.org/about-us/governor-advisory-board/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">member</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the Governor’s Advisory Board on Service and Volunteerism, I am driven by a lifelong passion for helping youth and adults engage in their communities. As Senior Vice President of Civic Engagement at the Community Foundation for a greater Richmond, I lead a team that creates opportunities for people to give back, using their time and voice in ways that feel meaningful and generate the most impact. I love to see the “aha!” moment when a person identifies a need in the community and realizes they have the right resource to help, and that’s why I am pleased to join leaders and engaged community members across the country in celebrating National Volunteer Week, April 21-27. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volunteers play a critically important role in the lives of children engaged in the courts and foster care system, through the Richmond Court Appointed Special Advocates (CASA) program. CASA volunteers serve as advocates for children so that they don’t face the courts and foster care system alone. CASA volunteers across Richmond are members of our community, from all walks of life, who are motivated by the understanding that every child deserves a safe, loving home and want to do what they can to help.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am a CASA because I want to be a voice for children,” shared one Richmond CASA volunteer in a recent story of service from </span><a href="https://servevirginia.org/stories-of-service/richmond-casa/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Serve Virginia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the state service commission. “Being able to look at the circumstances from the eyes of the child and communicate that to the adults in their life gives me a chance to give them a voice. Being a CASA is like investing with exponential returns.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am grateful for the dedication and service of everyday heroes like the Richmond CASA volunteers and other community members who invest their time in service to others, who are helping make our city a more vibrant, better connected and healthier place to live. I know that a robust volunteer sector is an effective strategy to meet critical community needs and improve individual lives.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the recent Virginia Community Engagement Index (VCEI) </span><a href="https://servevirginia.org/why-serve/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> led by Serve Virginia, data collected from more than 6,000 respondents confirmed that many Virginians are already engaged in their communities, volunteering time and talents. The VCEI found that 67% of respondents regularly volunteer more than once a month, and 82% of all active volunteers have maintained or increased their level of volunteerism over the past year. As importantly, volunteers consistently report that their service is personally fulfilling and additional data shows that it fosters healthy social connection and increased levels of happiness. When people feel fulfilled and that what they do is meaningful, they are more likely to engage and remain engaged in volunteerism.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginians’ willingness to give of themselves in service to others stands as one of our greatest strengths as a commonwealth. It is also an opportunity to continue to build and leverage volunteerism to engage an even larger and more diverse group of Virginians. To do so, we must work together to identify community needs and commit to becoming active in creating solutions through service, volunteerism, and civic action.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This National Volunteer Week, I am taking time to recognize the impact of volunteerism and thank those who serve — you can do the same. The Richmond CASA volunteer’s story, which I shared above, is just one of millions of stories of service happening every day in our communities. This week we join together to thank volunteers for their commitment, and also pledge to do our part to strengthen Richmond and the state through increased awareness and appreciation of service and volunteering year-round. </span></p>

																						<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="845" height="913" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/171295228911679835.jpeg" class="attachment-large size-large wp-post-image" alt="" style="margin-bottom: 10px;" decoding="async" loading="lazy" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/171295228911679835.jpeg 845w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/171295228911679835-278x300.jpeg 278w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/171295228911679835-768x830.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 845px) 100vw, 845px" /><p style="font-size:12px;">Tim Murtaugh, author of “Swing Hard In Case You Hit It.” (provided photo)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s get this out of the way at the outset: Tim Murtaugh and I agree on little when it comes to politics, particularly his most famous boss: Donald Trump.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve known Tim for three decades. Early on, he was a member of the Virginia Capitol Correspondents Association by virtue of his job as Richmond correspondent for Charlottesville’s NBC affiliate, WVIR-TV.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then he hopped the fence into Republican Party politics, serving a variety of roles with candidates and GOP organizations in Virginia and beyond. We came into each other’s orbits most closely when he was the chief spokesman for George Allen’s successful 2000 U.S. Senate campaign. We would intersect frequently in his spokesman roles with Jerry Kilgore’s attorney general office and Kilgore’s unsuccessful gubernatorial bid.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tim’s sharp mind made him one of the best at what he did when he was on his game. And by “on his game,” I mean sober. Because much of the time, he wasn’t, a fact as plain as it was tragic. He went through more high-profile political jobs in a few years than most people can hold in a lifetime and many ended badly, victims of his rapacious alcoholism.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I couldn’t help but like Tim. He is engaging and witty. We share an affinity for the niche film “O Brother, Where Art Thou?” and would frequently greet each other with lines from it. We bonded over a mutual love of sports, a family legacy for him. His grandfather,</span><a href="https://www.mlb.com/news/danny-murtaugh-could-talk-and-manage-like-few-others" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Danny Murtaugh</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, managed the Pittsburgh Pirates in the 1960s and ’70s when they won two World Series championships, and it’s a stain on the Baseball Hall of Fame that he’s still not in it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, covering Virginia government for The Associated Press, I had to keep my political leanings locked in a vault and out of my copy. There were times when I agreed with Tim and others when I did not. Differences aside, I respected him and what he </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">could</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> be professionally if only he could put the bottle aside.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were times from 2000 to 2012 when I saw Tim alarmingly drunk. Turns out, I didn’t know the half of it. This month, he raised the curtain on his grim, long-running addiction and the resolute struggle that ultimately brought him to lasting sobriety in an</span><a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Swing-Hard-in-Case-You-Hit-It/Tim-Murtaugh/9798888453247" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">unsparing autobiography</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> titled “Swing Hard In Case You Hit It.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His book starkly recounts his two arrests for driving under the influence, many more for public intoxication, and days spent incarcerated because of it. He writes unflinchingly of his five stints in rehab and how, after each, he quickly put a drink in his hand. One cringes as he chronicles one firing after another and the disqualifying behavior that led to each. It’s a litany of opportunities gained and subsequently squandered. Reading those accounts is like watching a train hurtling toward a washed-out bridge over a deep gorge — awful to behold, helpless to stop, impossible to look away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The book — indeed, much of the credit for the redemption of Tim Murtaugh — he attributes to his patient, loving and steadfast wife, Dena, who somehow stood beside him at his worst.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I would be dead or in jail if it weren’t for Dena,” he said in a Zoom interview this week from the home the couple share with their two young sons near Leesburg. “That’s obvious to me, knowing the state that I was in at the time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was not always something she did gladly. The destruction his drinking wrought was hard to endure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Why she decided I could be saved — or was worth saving — I don’t know,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The book, he said, could never have been written while he was still in alcohol’s daily grip, even to the point of having to start each day swilling Jägermeister and continue drinking through the day just to function.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His moment of clarity came in May 2015 when he awoke in the Fairfax County Jail after being arrested for public intoxication from a blackout-level bender at a bar along U.S. 1 near Alexandria. The offense was a misdemeanor, but it would have violated terms of his probation from his second DUI conviction and subjected him to 80 days behind bars, something he recognized as fatal to both his career and his marriage. His attorney convinced a prosecutor that this time, Murtaugh would change for good, and the public drunkenness charge was dropped with the stern warning never to appear in court again for an alcohol-related offense or face the full wrath of the law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next month marks nine years since Tim last tasted alcohol. Since then, he has held communications posts for the U.S. secretary of agriculture and as the chief spokesman for Trump’s 2020 reelection campaign, appearing frequently on national telecasts defending his boss.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through it all, even when alcohol held the upper hand, Murtaugh said he was drawn to books other alcoholics had written about their battles with addiction — the success stories as well as the tragedies. Once he got sober and stayed that way, he said, the idea of writing his own memoir appealed to him as a way to help others with their journey.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I thought that if I ever wrote a book, then I would write one of those because those books helped me a lot,” he said. “If somebody is having a hard time and they pick up my book for 10 minutes, if, in that time that they’re holding my book, they don’t pick up a drink, then it was worth writing, even if that only happens one time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dena, whom he first met when she was on the U.S. House staff of then-Rep. Thelma Drake, R-Va. whose reelection campaign he was advising, also made the wise argument that a thorough confession could inoculate him from having his past used against him in the Machiavellian world of partisan politics. The decision to proceed, he said, was surprisingly easy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For years, I did regard it as deep, dark secrets that I would protect at any cost. I was deathly afraid of anybody finding out about the true depths of the trouble that I’d been in. But over time, I’d talk about it in (Alcoholics Anonymous) meetings … in rehab, at home where my wife knows all about it. It became less of a scarlet letter and more just part of my background and part of who I was,” he said. “Now, it helps a lot that I wasn’t doing those things anymore and that I could accurately talk about them as though they were things of the past because they were.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After Trump grudgingly left the White House in January 2021, Murtaugh said he sought to leverage his high-visibility post serving a former president into work outside politics but found his association with Trump made him too much of a liability for major corporations. So he stuck with the field he knows and formed his own company, Line Drive Public Affairs, that advises political clients on a contract basis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tim is a man more at ease now: his eyes clear, his future instead of a drink in his hands. He knows that resisting alcohol’s whispered seductions will be a day-to-day fight for the rest of his life. He appreciates what he’s gained and knows how easily he could lose it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My two little boys have never seen their dad take a drink,” he said, “and I want it to stay that way.”</span></p>

Early in our marriage, Jeanne gave me a nickname: “Walk Slow, Stand Around.” Yep, that’s me. Sure, it’s funny. And it’s true. But I’m not lazy; I just wonder a lot. As a farmer, I’m exposed to so many things in nature that just leave me in a state of awe.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_38430" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:1024px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/RNWmonarchBB-scaled.jpeg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-38430 size-large" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/RNWmonarchBB-1024x768.jpeg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/RNWmonarchBB-1024x768.jpeg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/RNWmonarchBB-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/RNWmonarchBB-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/RNWmonarchBB-1536x1152.jpeg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/RNWmonarchBB-2048x1536.jpeg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  A Monarch butterfly alights on Virginia native plant Button Bush in one of the riparian forest buffers planted at a Shenandoah Valley farm co-owned by Bobby Whitescarver. (Bobby Whitescarver)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I asked Jeanne, “What gives you a sense of wonder?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She didn’t hesitate: “Daffodils and young calves running.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wonder at those, too. A bunch of newborn calves running with their tails in the air and their mothers chasing after them is a sight to behold. I stand in amazement every time our border collie does an outrun to bring a herd of cattle to the barn. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tree swallows arrived on our farm this year on March 14. Each year, I wonder when they will come; that’s when spring begins for me. They migrate here from Florida, Cuba, and Mexico to nest and raise their young. We put up nesting boxes for them. Their metallic blue wings and white breast are unmistakable. They fly in squadrons all summer in pursuit of flying insects. I stand around and watch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I see rays of sunshine beaming through holes in big white and gray puffy clouds, I have to stop and wonder. It’s just so beautiful and awe inspiring. A ray of that light starts one of the greatest natural processes on the planet: photosynthesis. It’s what gives us green pastures for our cows to graze in. It’s what makes trees’ leaves grow and then fall into streams to feed the aquatic ecosystem. We had thousands of native trees and shrubs planted along the water courses on our farm to support this miraculous process and to provide wildlife habitat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My wife and I are regen farmers. “Regen” is short for “regenerative,” meaning we produce wholesome food while regenerating our land’s ecosystem services, such as the production of clean water, clean air, wildlife habitat and renewable energy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We raise beef cattle — they’re ruminants, which have multiple stomachs that make them capable of digesting the cellulose in grass. Cows, and other grazing ruminants such as sheep and goats, are mobile cellulose-digesting protein and fertilizer factories. These animals harvest their own food and fertilize the soil, which makes the grass grow more vigorously. This regenerative cycle helps the planet too: The more vigorously a plant grows, the more carbon it captures from the air, reducing greenhouse gasses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rays of sun beam down. The grasses and trees grow, capturing carbon from the air. The rays of sun also beam down on the solar panels we installed on one of our barns, producing renewable energy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I stand and wonder as the direct current from the solar panels hums through the inverters, converting it to alternating current before it enters the grid. We would like to install more solar panels, but our utility company limits the production of renewable energy that can go into its grid. We also have some land well suited for solar panels, but our local government, and many others across the commonwealth, have severely restricted farmers’ rights to install them.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_38429" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:1024px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/RNWbuffer23-scaled.jpeg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-38429 size-large" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/RNWbuffer23-1024x768.jpeg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/RNWbuffer23-1024x768.jpeg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/RNWbuffer23-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/RNWbuffer23-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/RNWbuffer23-1536x1152.jpeg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/RNWbuffer23-2048x1536.jpeg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Riparian forest buffers planted in December 2021, pictured here in July 2023 at one of the Shenandoah Valley farms co-owned by guest columnist and regenerative farmer Bobby Whitescarver. (Bobby Whitescarver)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those human actions inspire a different kind of wondering: Why would the utility companies and the government restrict our ability to produce renewable energy? And that kind of wondering should lead to action, not standing around.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB697" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 697</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, introduced this past legislative session, intended to remove local government authority for utility scale solar until the locality reached a cap of 4% of its land in panels. Control of solar siting rested with the State Corporation Commission. The bill was tabled until next year because it met with so much resistance from local governments, but that gives us an opportunity to work together and get the bill right. I wonder: Can we reduce the cap to 1% or 2% with the caveat that localities adopt stringent siting ordinances?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We don’t have time to stand around. The demand for electricity in Virginia has never been higher or more complicated. The Virginia Clean Economy Act sunsets fossil fuel electric generation by 2050. And Virginia is now the world’s epicenter for data centers, which suck </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/11/21/a-5-point-plan-for-data-centers/#:~:text=As%20of%20late%202022%2C%20data,much%20of%20Data%20Center%20Alley"><span style="font-weight: 400;">at least 20%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Dominion Energy’s supply, and plans for more data centers are in the unsecured “nobody’s watching” pipeline.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the country observes Earth Day, our Virginia legislators could — and should — remove barriers for </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/09/21/utility-scale-solar-is-coming-to-a-farm-near-you/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">properly sited</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> solar installations.</span></p>

																						<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="1024" height="768" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_6542-1024x768.jpg" class="attachment-large size-large wp-post-image" alt="" style="margin-bottom: 10px;" decoding="async" loading="lazy" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_6542-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_6542-300x225.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_6542-768x576.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_6542-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_6542-2048x1536.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p style="font-size:12px;">Spring has arrived at the Virginia Capitol. (Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s legislature and governor are embroiled in a “two scorpions in a bottle” fight over the new biennial budget, which must be passed by June 30, 2024, to fund the government. On Wednesday, both sides return to Richmond for the “reconvened” or “veto” session.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Budget battles in the commonwealth are not unusual, but this one is unique, both in the number of changes Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin proposed to the bipartisan spending plan and the rhetoric that has accompanied the process. Youngkin called the bill a “backward budget” and traveled the state on this theme. Legislators fired back, did their own tour and likened Youngkin’s actions to </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/03/26/this-is-what-spoiled-brats-do-democrats-blast-youngkin-on-budget/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“ what spoiled brats do when they don’t get what they want.”</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The governor has vetoed a record number of bills, including measures to protect reproductive rights and enhance gun safety. Since overriding a veto requires a two-thirds vote, expect the governor to win most of these contests.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="q5bzeOq3NY"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/02/20/the-politics-of-gotcha/">The politics of &#8216;gotcha&#8217;</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;The politics of &#8216;gotcha&#8217;&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/02/20/the-politics-of-gotcha/embed/#?secret=LkltpIUtiT#?secret=q5bzeOq3NY" data-secret="q5bzeOq3NY" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fight over the budget bill will be different. Youngkin was initially expected to use the power of the “line-item veto,” by striking specific provisions in the budget and then challenging the legislature to produce a two-thirds vote to override them. His targets were thought to be a tax on digital services he originally proposed and language that requires the commonwealth to rejoin the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI). But he abandoned this approach when legislators shrewdly drafted these provisions to make a line-item veto legally problematic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin instead proposed a record number of 233 separate amendments to the budget bill. Expect few of substance to pass. Each requires a simple majority vote to be included in the budget, and Democrats are still fuming over Youngkin’s rhetoric and vetoes over the last month. Youngkin will then face a difficult choice: He can sign the budget “as presented,” or veto the entire plan, demand a special session and a new budget. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The July 1 deadline for a new budget will then loom large. Fearing a government shutdown, agencies and local governments would scramble to construct contingency plans. Such uncertainty might even prompt a revisiting of Virginia’s celebrated Triple A bond rating, a fixture for more than 50 years. A lot is at stake. Ultimately, the legislature will get most of what it wants, even if it takes a special session to do so.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The legislature is the most powerful branch of government</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin is now learning what his predecessors discovered a long time ago — that the legislature is the strongest branch of government, and the commonwealth’s legislature is perhaps the strongest of all the states.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia General Assembly&#8217;s power over governors is a function of history, strong leadership and most importantly, the Virginia Constitution. Leery of executive power that evidenced itself in dictatorial colonial governors, our founders wrote the state constitutions to favor governance that is closest to the people — the legislature. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This legislative advantage is found in the Virginia Constitution. Virginia is the only state where the chief executive cannot serve consecutive terms, making it difficult for governors to extract concessions from legislators who will serve much longer. In their first year, they are learning the system. By their third year, they are viewed as “lame ducks.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This dynamic is now playing out in the budget bill. When Virginia governors take office, they are dealing with a two-year budget prepared by the previous chief executive. In most states, </span><a href="https://higherlogicdownload.s3.amazonaws.com/NASBO/9d2d2db1-c943-4f1b-b750-0fca152d64c2/UploadedImages/Budget%20Processess/NASBO_2021_Budget_Processes_in_the_States_S.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">newly elected governors submit a budget</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the beginning of their term. Not so in Virginia!  Newly sworn governors can propose budget amendments, but they are painting on a canvas that has been provided by their predecessor. The only budget plan that is uniquely theirs is created at the end of their second year in office. In their final year, they prepare another two-year budget, but they leave office before the legislature debates it in a new session with a new governor. This gives the legislature an edge in budget deliberations, and further fuels the adage frequently heard in Richmond that “governors come and go; the legislature is forever.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The commonwealth is now considering the only budget that is Youngkin’s alone. His best chance to leave a legacy is this budget; but his relationship with the legislature is putting this at severe risk.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Virginia’s legislature is uniquely powerful</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The power of the Virginia legislature extends beyond appropriations. The body has greater appointment powers than most state legislatures and can derail key nominees that the governor desires. Virginia’s State Corporation Commission (SCC) is a good example. Almost its own branch of government, its decisions affect everything from utility rates to insurance regulation. SCC judges are solely appointed by the legislature. In other states, not only do similar bodies have less power, but the regulators are either elected by citizens or appointed by governors.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, our legislature appoints the entire judiciary. Judges in most states  — including state supreme court members — are either appointed by the governor or elected by the citizenry. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is not the case in Virginia. The commonwealth and South Carolina are the only states where the legislature has total control of these selections. A Virginia governor cannot dispense political perks through judicial appointments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The system appears almost quaint by comparison to the rough and tumble statewide political campaigns for state supreme court positions recently witnessed in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. As more fundamental rights are litigated in the state courts, greater attention will be paid to the legislature’s choice of judges. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week, Richmond is focused on the budget, and my bet is that the legislature eventually will get most of what it wants. And it will then continue to exercise powers that its colleagues in other states cannot, and that arguably makes it the most powerful legislature in the country. </span></p>

Inflation has boosted the cost of housing construction. Plus, vacant, usable land has become more expensive over the years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are in a perfect storm right now,” Hruska told me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I interviewed him after his Habitat chapter announced it was postponing</span><a href="https://www.shrhabitat.org/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">the application process</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> because it hadn’t been able to acquire land for the 2025-26 building season. Applications had been scheduled to open May 1.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said vacant lots in his region were selling for $30,000 to $35,000 in 2018. Yet they averaged $75,000 last year, Hruska said, even though the lots were about the same size and sat in school divisions with the same reputation for quality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hruska’s challenge isn’t unique. Other Habitat</span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2024/03/18/peninsulas-habitat-for-humanity-cant-take-applications-for-first-time-in-39-years/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">affiliates in Virginia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have also postponed the application process, some for the first time in decades. Studies and statements by the</span><a href="https://jlarc.virginia.gov/pdfs/summary/Rpt559Sum-1.pdf" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">General Assembly’s watchdog agency</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="https://www.gao.gov/blog/affordable-housing-crisis-grows-while-efforts-increase-supply-fall-short" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">the federal government</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and others speak of the longstanding problem to secure affordable housing, especially by Americans who aren’t rich.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Land prices increased 60% from 2012-2019, and the cost of homes more than doubled from 1998 to 2021,” reported the U.S. Government Accountability Office.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just last week,</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/04/10/dc-regional-housing-targets/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The Washington Post reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the D.C. metropolitan area has fallen way behind in meeting a 2019 goal of building 320,000 units over the next decade to handle that region’s growth. “Fairfax County, the most populous jurisdiction in the region,” The Post said, “is on pace to build only 36 percent of its target.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One obvious factor: Elected leaders there set the goal before the devastating COVID-19 pandemic occurred and shredded the economy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inflation, lack of developable land and the desire by builders to erect expensive houses to recoup their investments are factors in the dearth of affordable housing, both in Virginia and nationwide. Incentives for developers to build multifamily units aren’t always enough to propel construction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Even if they decided to be benevolent, to take a modest fee for themselves … their costs to build homes are really high,” said Erica Sims, president of Richmond-based</span><a href="https://www.hdadvisors.net/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">HDAdvisors, a consulting firm specializing in affordable housing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Builders also want to tap into water and sewer lines to help keep costs low, Sims told me. If developers have to install roads and sewer themselves, they might decline those projects.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s Joint Legislative and Audit Review Commission – the aforementioned Assembly watchdog agency – notes what many housing and poverty advocates say: Families are “cost burdened” when they spend more than 30 percent of their income on housing expenses. Such a predicament means it’s difficult for households to pay for other necessities, and it increases the likelihood of eviction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Approximately 29 percent of Virginia households (905,000) were housing cost burdened in 2019, and nearly half of these households spent more than 50 percent of their income on housing,” JLARC said in a 2021 report.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That means many families are just one job layoff, medical emergency or major car repair away from losing a roof over their heads. It’s a stressful way to live.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Renting a home can help families avoid the upfront costs of homebuying, JLARC noted, but the commonwealth “has a shortage of at least 200,000 affordable rental units for extremely and very low-income households.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are the possible solutions to this lack of affordable housing?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It requires a heavy investment at the state and federal levels,” Sims said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Cities have land, and they should set some aside for affordable housing,” said Hruska. Localities that bar homes on smaller lots, he added, could alter zoning regulations to permit them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(In August, </span><a href="https://dhcd.virginia.gov/governor-youngkin-announces-over-52-million-affordable-and-special-needs-housing-loans" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Glenn Youngkin announced $52 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in affordable and special needs housing loans for dozens of projects.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Home ownership is important. It tends to make individuals more concerned about their neighborhoods because they have a stake in their success. A home is usually the largest monetary investment a family owns.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want working-class families to have the American Dream, and that way we have better neighborhoods and better citizens,” said Hruska, the local Habitat official.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Look no further than Andrew and Linda Layne, who moved into their Chesapeake Habitat home in 2018.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andrew Layne, 59, didn’t know I was going to drop in last week to his one-story home with three bedrooms, 1½ bathrooms and roughly 1,100 square feet. Yet he was wearing a red T-shirt from the housing nonprofit when I stopped by.</span></p>

(Roger Chesley/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s quite an endorsement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s the first house I’ve ever owned,” he told me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The house rose on a former vacant lot.  A green front lawn now greets visitors. Solar panels adorn the roof.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He and his wife earlier lived in a Virginia Beach townhouse. Layne sought out Habitat after suffering a serious accident while working as a longshoreman in 2012. “I almost died,” he said, adding that he received disability payments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Laynes contributed hundreds of hours of “sweat equity” to the organization, including at the site of their home. The city’s redevelopment and housing authority helped fund the construction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It makes me a very proud person,” he said, while showing me room-by-room through the home and their cozy backyard. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The family’s pit bull and chocolate husky barked at and sniffed me before deciding I was harmless. They then returned to their usual perches in the living room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Habitat is awesome,” said 54-year-old Linda Layne, who recently started a cleaning job at the year-old Rivers Casino in Portsmouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The nonprofit’s good works, though, can only go so far to reduce the affordable housing shortage. Roughly 3,700 families have bought homes through Habitat affiliates since the late 1970s, a state Habitat official told me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many more Virginians, though, want to experience the same level of belonging expressed by the Laynes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s one of pride in having a home of your own. </span></p>

Glenn Youngkin recently took action on a flurry of Virginia legislators’ measures related to reproductive health, mostly blocking bills designed to preserve the public’s access to abortions and birth control as these same issues roil national debates and as other states pass laws that restrict womens’ bodily autonomy and roll back decades of abortion protections. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, a surprising signoff: Youngkin, a Republican, </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB78" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">signed a bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Del. Vivian Watts, D-Fairfax, that prevents electronic menstrual data — often collected in period-tracking digital apps — from being subject to search warrants, subpoenas or court orders. Watts said in a phone interview Wednesday that her bill is a “preventative measure” that, considering the social climate of the nation, is warranted.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="bAa0vHLXBJ"><p><a href="https://azmirror.com/2024/04/10/the-1864-abortion-ban-is-a-feature-not-a-bug-of-the-gops-assault-on-reproductive-rights/" target="_blank">The 1864 abortion ban is a feature, not a bug, of the GOP&#8217;s assault on reproductive rights</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;The 1864 abortion ban is a feature, not a bug, of the GOP&#8217;s assault on reproductive rights&#8221; &#8212; Arizona Mirror" src="https://azmirror.com/2024/04/10/the-1864-abortion-ban-is-a-feature-not-a-bug-of-the-gops-assault-on-reproductive-rights/embed/#?secret=xix0dTUif4#?secret=bAa0vHLXBJ" data-secret="bAa0vHLXBJ" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Arizona Supreme Court just allowed a law that goes back to the 1800s to override a law passed within the last decade,” Watts said, referencing the state’s recent decision to uphold a 160-year-old statute that bans virtually all abortions and reject a 2022 law that allowed abortions up to the 15th week of pregnancy. When the newly-reenacted antebellum era law was first created, Arizona wasn’t a state, women couldn’t vote, and slavery was an ongoing American tradition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arizona’s near-total abortion ban is the latest example of how access to abortions has been increasingly limited since the Supreme Court of the United States overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, removing Constitutional protections for the procedure that is often </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1N2TC0VD/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">necessary</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to save womens’ lives or health. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My surprise at Youngkin greenlighting Watts’ bill isn’t based on the common sense merit of the measure. Protecting individuals’ private health information should be the standard of any state that respects its citizens. And it’s just downright creepy to imagine a Virginia judge or law enforcement officer scrutinizing the date and duration of peoples’ periods.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That Youngkin advanced that bill while vetoing several other reproductive health measures is what seemed like an unexpected mixed message to me, Virginia abortion </span><a href="https://x.com/ProtectChoice/status/1776404452678783176" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">advocates</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and Watts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am amazed that there&#8217;s the recognition of the importance of privacy as a basic human right,” Watts said of Youngkin signing her bill, “that&#8217;s not being recognized in the other abortion-related legislation, where the right of a private decision is not being respected.”</span></p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;As Texans fight for life-saving abortions, don&#8217;t take our reproductive rights for granted, Virginia&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/12/08/as-texans-fight-for-life-saving-abortions-dont-take-our-reproductive-rights-for-granted-virginia/embed/#?secret=C9535ogAoY#?secret=Em7s3V6jEr" data-secret="Em7s3V6jEr" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which pieces of related legislation did the governor reject or alter?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He shot down a </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB15" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> carried by Sen. Barbara Favola, D-Arlington, to prevent the extradition of people who come to Virginia for an abortion from other states where the procedure is illegal, should that person face related criminal charges in their home state. The bill’s extradition protection would have extended to doctors and medical workers who performed or assisted with out-of-state patients’ Virginia abortions, too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“By vetoing this bill, the governor has refused to provide a layer of protection that Virginia healthcare professionals believe is necessary to ensure that they can provide abortion care without the fear of prosecution,” Favola</span><a href="https://x.com/BarbaraFavola/status/1776595597404917998" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> posted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on social media platform X. Doctors and women seeking abortions in the state “deserve the peace of mind this bill would’ve provided,” she added.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB716" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bills</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Del. Candi Mundon King, D-Dumfries, and Sen. Jennifer Carroll Foy, D-Prince William, </span><b> </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">that would have protected medical professionals who provide abortion care from disciplinary actions by the Board of Medicine also met Youngkin’s ax.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said no to a </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB1098" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Del. Sam Rasoul, D-Roanoke, mandating companies with 50 or more employees provide workers up to 10 days of unpaid bereavement leave after a family members’ death, but also, importantly, after a miscarriage, an unsuccessful “reproductive technology” procedure like in vitro fertilization, a stillbirth or following a medical diagnosis that “negatively impacts pregnancy or fertility.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB609" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Del. Marcia Price, D-Newport News to establish a right to access and use birth control regardless of the American Constitution’s requirements was, like Watts’ bill, an effort to protect reproductive health care from future federal restrictions that may be on the horizon. Youngkin </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+ful+HB609H1" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">amended</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and weakened, the bill by predicating Virginians’ right to contraceptives on landmark Constitutional contraceptive protections, ones that could be overturned just like Roe. v. Wade. By doing so, he took the teeth right out of it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin didn’t fully reject a </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB819" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">measure</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Sen. Ghazala F. Hashmi, D-Richmond, and King to mandate insurance companies cover birth control; he amended it by adding a loophole allowing insurers to be exempt based on their religious or ethical beliefs. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2016/06/21/where-major-religious-groups-stand-on-abortion/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Religious beliefs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about the God-given sanctity of life are the bedrock of America’s anti-abortion movement. Some use their religious beliefs to </span><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/06/20/lgbtq-people-americans-largely-oppose-religious-based-discrimination/70335484007/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">discriminate against LGBTQ+ people</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Slaveowners used their religious beliefs to condone owning human beings, even </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/the-bible-was-used-to-justify-slavery-then-africans-made-it-their-path-to-freedom/2019/04/29/34699e8e-6512-11e9-82ba-fcfeff232e8f_story.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reading Bible passages</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about servants obeying their masters to enslaved Black people. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The problem with the governor tacking on a religious beliefs exemption to Hashmi’s bill is that, historically and presently, religious beliefs have been a convenient way for some people to excuse their bad behavior, spread prejudices and enforce their agendas at the expense of others’ lives, liberty and wellbeing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia is the last Southern state to preserve access to abortion with no new restrictions after Roe’s overturning. Our commonwealth is now a sanctuary of last resort for people who can’t get abortion care that they desperately need where they live. As the reproductive health culture wars rage on, it’s imperative that Virginia’s laws reflect what citizens need and want: laws that support their health and ensure the best quality of life possible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Immediately after torching most abortion bills and diluting one to cement birth control as a human right, Youngkin started touting his </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/news-releases/2024/april/name-1025084-en.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">revised budget</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as a way for state lawmakers and their constituents to reach “common ground.” But by rejecting the legislature’s reproductive health measures, our governor also rejects the rights and will of many Virginians and contributes to the deepening political and cultural divides fracturing our country.</span></p>

(Photo by Beck Faircloth, courtesy of Elektra Walraven) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What do estheticians, barbers, auctioneers, athlete agents, and “</span><a href="https://reason.com/2023/02/27/virginia-next-for-occupational-licensing-reform/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">temporary wrestlers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” all have in common?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">None present a threat to public health or safety, yet in the commonwealth of Virginia, anyone who wishes to enter these professions must first earn an occupational license. In fact, this sort of superfluous licensing exists nationwide.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Occupational licensing requirements, which require citizens to gain regulatory approval before working certain jobs, weaken the American economy tremendously. These restrictions cost millions of jobs and hundreds of billions in inflated consumer costs, according to </span><a href="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/thp_kleinerdiscpaper_final.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a 2015 analysis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the Brookings Institution. And </span><a href="https://reason.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Raising-Barriers-Not-Quality-WEB.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">research has found</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that, in most cases, they fail to meaningfully protect consumers. While it makes more sense for regulators to vet certain high-skill, high-risk positions — heart surgeons, for example — many licenses do nothing but protect industry incumbents from new entrants and interstate competition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Occupational licensing standards have persisted largely due to political pressure from self-interested tradespeople, who wish to control the supply of new entrants — i.e., new competition — into their fields. And since full overhauls of licensing codes seem unlikely, many states have settled on incremental measures. The best of these is universal license recognition (ULR), which allows individuals with out-of-state licenses — and, in some states, relevant work experience — access to an expedited relicensing process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In March 2023, Virginia </span><a href="https://legiscan.com/VA/bill/SB1213/2023" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">became</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the </span><a href="https://ij.org/legislative-advocacy/states-reforms-for-universal-recognition-of-occupational-licensing/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">20th state</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to enact </span><a href="https://reason.com/2023/02/27/virginia-next-for-occupational-licensing-reform/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">universal recognition</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Since that law took effect in July of that year, 276 workers have earned licenses under its provisions (as of mid February), according to data provided by the Virginia Department of Professional and Occupational Regulation (DPOR). Of these, tradespeople (e.g., electricians and plumbers), real estate professionals, estheticians and other beauty professionals have accounted for most of the new licensees, the DPOR said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the Virginia General Assembly approved universal recognition in February 2023, Gov. Glenn Younkin </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/news-releases/2023/february/name-994216-en.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">praised</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it as a means of “resolving worker shortages.” DPOR director Kishore Thota said state officials continue to view it that way:  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">One industry that has been particularly hurt by labor shortages is the waterworks and wastewater works operators,” Thota wrote in a recent email exchange. “Over 10% of the licenses issued under ULR have been waterworks operators and wastewater works operators. ULR will continue to provide an easier pathway for qualified operators to come and work in Virginia,” he continued.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These professions experience a particularly difficult time transferring licenses from state to state […] as each state uses different license types and regulatory authorities to oversee water and wastewater treatment.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Occupational licensing reform offers states the simplest solution for worker shortages: to stop preventing already-qualified, already-available workers from working.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One such worker, real estate professional Alex Pentivolpi, secured his Virginia license under the ULR statute in November. Alex’s wife serves in the military, and per her orders, the family has lived around the U.S. and abroad.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having first earned his real estate license in Hawaii, Alex moved to Texas, which </span><a href="https://ij.org/legislative-advocacy/states-reforms-for-universal-recognition-of-occupational-licensing/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lacks ULR</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Accordingly, Alex said, the state required him to re-complete practically the entire licensing process — six 40-hour weeks of intensive training and rigorous testing, for which he paid handsomely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To get his Virginia license, however, all he had to do was submit relevant paperwork and take the state’s exam. ULR has particular importance for a peripatetic family, like Alex’s. “I’m not going to be here too long … as a new person living in the area, I’ve got to get a clientele base,” Alex said. “Gotta hustle compared to people that have lived here a lot longer,” he added with a chuckle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The DPOR director’s analysis aligns with </span><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4389898" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a 2023 study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from West Virginia University’s Kihwan Bae and Edward Timmon. Bae and Timmon wrote that the benefits of ULR have accrued primarily in fields with “low portability licenses” — that is, licenses whose approval processes tend to vary among states, making the relicensing process onerous for anybody who has moved across state lines. Sure enough, the WVU researchers offer electricians and real-estate brokers — major beneficiaries of Virginia’s reform — as examples of trades with low portability licenses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to occupational licensing, portability is an essential factor for workers. People move for a plethora of reasons which often have nothing to do with professional opportunity. Census data shows the number one reason people moved in </span><a href="https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2023/09/why-people-move.html#:~:text=Reasons%20For%20Moving,-The%20CPS%20ASEC&amp;text=There%20are%2020%20specific%20reasons,accounting%20for%2041.6%25%20of%20movers." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2021-2022 </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">was housing, accounting for over 41% of movers. The next most cited reason for moving was family (26%). Only 16% of movers cited employment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For many, however, the opportunity cost of relocation is paid in lost employment, as Bae and Timmon detail. And once relocated, many professionals face burdensome — </span><a href="https://www.atlasnetwork.org/stories/psychologist-heals-community" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">if not functionally insurmountable</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">— obstacles to continuing to work in their chosen field, causing many simply to remain without work, or start over on their careers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This problem is largely fixable. Bae and Timmon report that ULR reform simultaneously raises workforce-participation rates and lowers unemployment rates. Specifically, the researchers found that reform entices married individuals to rejoin the workforce. Put differently, with ULR, a spouse can escape an unwanted early retirement or reliance on government benefits. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bae and Timmon also “observe[d] some decline in the unemployment of married individuals and a significant reduction in the unemployment of non-married individuals.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In general, they wrote that ULR reform likely “reduce[s] the unemployment spell of job seekers with out-of-state licenses,” relieving the economic and psychological tolls joblessness imposes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, by resolving these tensions, ULR reform promotes interstate mobility. “By license portability, the migration rate into states with universal recognition increased by 1.31 percentage points or 82.4% among individuals with low portability licenses a year after the policy change,” Bae and Timmon wrote. Migration effects were particularly stark in neighboring states, they add. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All this suggests that licensing reform — by removing a looming, arbitrary professional disincentive — frees individuals to live where they choose, bettering their lives and, through their work, the lives of their new neighbors. In a creatively destructive capitalist economy, freedom from regulatory barriers, particularly those that amount to uncut cronyism, gives workers critical flexibility not just to survive but to flourish.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed, rigid occupational licensing has long benefitted special interests at the worker’s expense. In 1776, in his masterwork “The Wealth of Nations,” Scottish economist Adam Smith </span><a href="https://www.aier.org/article/adam-smith-provided-a-moral-foundation-for-workers-freedoms/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">decried</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> such regimes as violations of liberty for workers and employers alike. Smith further railed against laws that restricted workers’ freedom to move about England. He endorsed a free system under which “a poor workman, when thrown out of employment either in one trade or in one place, may seek for it in another trade or in another place, without the fear either of a prosecution or of a removal.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While some, this author included, would favor foundational reforms, ULR offers non-doctrinaire state officials a relatively politically palatable — and, from a consumer’s perspective, </span><a href="https://reason.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Raising-Barriers-Not-Quality-WEB.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">eminently safe</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — first step. Such reform may be incremental, but it is not insignificant. Although far from offsetting the millions of jobs lost to occupational licensing regimes noted by the Brookings report, Bae and Timmon write that a “back-of-the-envelope calculation based on our estimate suggests that universal recognition is expected to add at least 67,000 new jobs to the United States.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s tens of thousands of Americans empowered to live and work how and where they see fit, creating economic and social value for the communities in which they choose to live. It means increased competition, lower consumer prices, and less protectionist cronyism. States like Virginia have already enjoyed significant benefits from reform, benefits that can only compound going forward.</span></p>

Here, the SDO spacecraft captures an image of a partial eclipse on Aug. 21, 2017. (www.science.NASA.gov photo)</p><p>Let’s avert our eyes from Virginia&#8217;s state <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/03/26/this-is-what-spoiled-brats-do-democrats-blast-youngkin-on-budget/">budget battle</a> for a moment and look toward the skies.</p>
<p>Actually, before you do that, make sure you have a pair of special solar viewers. That’s right, ladies and gentlemen and children of all ages, we have a solar eclipse on the way. Enjoy these 15 questions and answers — informed by actual experts — about the big event.</p>
<p><b>Wait! There’s going to be a solar eclipse?</b></p>
<p>Yes! On Monday, April 8, 2024, to be precise. The partial eclipse will be visible from roughly 2:20 p.m. to 3:30 p.m., with the total eclipse lasting from 3:28 p.m. to 3:35 p.m., <a href="https://eclipse-explorer.smce.nasa.gov/" target="_blank">depending on your location</a> in the state.</p>
<p><b>What’s a solar eclipse again?</b></p>
<p>According to our <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/eclipses/future-eclipses/eclipse-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">friends at NASA</a>: “A total solar eclipse happens when the Moon passes between the Sun and Earth, completely blocking the face of the Sun. The sky will darken as if it were dawn or dusk.”</p>
<p>Just imagine that you’re watching an important TV program and your beloved spouse passes in front of the set. They instantly become much less beloved.</p>
<p>Now, let’s equate your TV set with the sun and your spouse with the moon. It’s just like that.</p>
<p><b>Who will get to see it?</b></p>
<p>Everyone in Virginia should witness at least some degree of the solar eclipse, although the state is not in the path of totality. Richmond and most areas of central Virginia are expected to see about 83% to 85% of the moon covering the sun during the celestial spectacle, according to NASA.</p>
<p>In Southwest Virginia, about 87% to 90% of the sun will be blocked during the eclipse&#8217;s peak, 3:00 to 3:20 p.m.</p>
<p>The Hampton Roads region will see the least of the eclipse, with Virginia Beach and localities close to the coast expected to witness just 80 to 83% of sun blotted out by the moon.</p>
<p>The best views of the eclipse will happen in Northern Virginia, where several counties will experience about 90% visibility or above.</p>
<p><b>How much will I see if I, you know, decide against traveling?</b></p>
<p>I advise <a href="https://eclipsesoundscapes.org/eclipse-lookup-tool/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this handy website</a>, sponsored by a NASA grant. It lets you to enter any ZIP code and reveals the eclipse extent for your neighborhood.</p>
<p><b>Any advice on watching it?</b></p>
<p>Don’t look at the eclipse with your naked eyes. Let me repeat that, in italics: <em>Don’t look at the eclipse with your naked eyes</em>.</p>
<p>The sun is usually so bright that we can’t physically stand to look at it. An eclipse cuts down on the brightness, but doesn’t stop solar radiation that can cause <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/eclipse-safety-how-to-view-the-eclipse-safely" target="_blank" rel="noopener">major vision damage</a>. This happens to people. It literally scars their retinas. They see a phantom image of the sun for the rest of their lives.</p>
<p><b>But I can still sneak a peek, right?</b></p>
<p>Please don’t do that. If you don’t believe me, listen to Shannon Schmoll, the director of the Abrams Planetarium at Michigan State University.</p>
<p>“We don’t ever, ever want to look directly at the sun. It will harm our eyes and can cause permanent damage,” she told journalists during a <a href="https://www.sciline.org/environment-energy/total-eclipse-2024-solar-eclipse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">briefing organized by SciLine last week</a>. “So to look at this, you need to use either eclipse glasses or some sort of eclipse viewers.”</p>
<figure id="attachment_2732" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-2732 size-full" src="https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/eclipse_map_2024_QR_1920.png" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/eclipse_map_2024_QR_1920.png 1920w, https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/eclipse_map_2024_QR_1920-300x150.png 300w, https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/eclipse_map_2024_QR_1920-1024x512.png 1024w, https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/eclipse_map_2024_QR_1920-768x384.png 768w, https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/eclipse_map_2024_QR_1920-1536x768.png 1536w" alt="" width="1920" height="960" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i> This map show the path of a total solar eclipse across the United States next week.

<p><b>So where do I find those solar viewers?</b></p>
<p>The American Astronomical Society <a href="https://eclipse.aas.org/eye-safety/viewers-filters" target="_blank" rel="noopener">maintains a list</a> of reputable manufacturers and retailers. For the record, they do not recommend going to your prominent online retailer of choice and searching for “cheap eclipse glasses.” You can do better. For goodness’ sake, think of those eyes.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dcr.virginia.gov/state-parks/solar-eclipse" target="_blank">Virginia State Parks</a> are selling eclipse glasses for $1 per pair; check the visitors&#8217; center at any of the 42 locations statewide.</p>
<p><b>Could I just use a camera instead?</b></p>
<p>Nope. An unfiltered look at the eclipse will leave your fancy digital camera <a href="https://www.space.com/how-to-photograph-a-solar-eclipse" target="_blank" rel="noopener">literally smoking</a>. You need a specialized <a href="https://www.cnn.com/cnn-underscored/outdoors/how-to-take-photos-total-solar-eclipse" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lens filter</a> to take photos of the event with a standalone or phone camera.</p>
<p><b>Okay, okay. Let’s get glasses and filters aplenty. But does this mean the world is about to end?</b></p>
<p>No. Millennia of eclipses have come and gone, and <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/eclipse-apocalypse-end-of-the-world" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the world remains</a>, for better or worse.</p>
<p><b>People are handling this totally normally and rationally online, right?</b></p>
<p>Haha. Of course they aren’t!</p>
<p>A bonkers story from online technology website <a href="https://gizmodo.com/tiktokers-convinced-solar-eclipse-will-break-simulation-1851371946" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gizmodo rounds up</a> some of the wilder claims circulating online. Among them: The eclipse will bring down electrical grids and cellphone service, it will disrupt the “<a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/do-we-live-in-a-simulation-chances-are-about-50-50/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">simulation</a>” in which we all live, and assorted Biblical nonsense.</p>
<p><b>Will animals act all weird?</b></p>
<p>Take a read through the <a href="https://www.sciline.org/environment-energy/total-eclipse-2024-solar-eclipse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">briefing mentioned above</a>. In short, we know that birds and insects quiet down during an eclipse, but they don’t freak out or anything.</p>
<p>“The eclipse is strong enough to suppress that daytime diurnal activity — of day-flying insects and birds going to roost — but it’s not strong enough to initiate the kind of typical nocturnal behaviors we see at sunset,” said Andrew Farnsworth of the Center for Avian Population Studies at the Cornell University Lab of Ornithology.</p>
<p><b>Any other safety tips?</b></p>
<p>The Virginia Department of Transportation sent out <a href="https://www.vdot.virginia.gov/news-events/news/statewide/make-plans-to-rotate-travel-around-solar-eclipse.html" target="_blank">several tips</a> for staying safe on the roads if you plan to travel during the eclipse. Beyond reminding drivers that the darkened skies will reduce visibility and encouraging them to turn on their headlights, VDOT also advised:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not pull over and park on the shoulders or ramps of highways to view or photograph the eclipse</li>
<li>Choose a safe location to stop and see the celestial event</li>
<li>After choosing a safe viewing location, be sure to exit your vehicle cautiously</li>
</ul>
<p>Also among the tips: Don’t drive with your eclipse glasses on.</p>
<p><b>Any events in Virginia I should know about?</b></p>
<p>Again, <a href="https://www.dcr.virginia.gov/state-parks/solar-eclipse" target="_blank">all 42</a> Virginia State Parks are hosting eclipse viewing events, so there&#8217;s sure to be one near you.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://smv.org/explore/things-to-do/eclipse-viewing-party/" target="_blank">Science Museum of Virginia</a> invites the public to The Green (in front of the building) for a free, family-friendly eclipse party in Richmond. You can snag some glasses and buy some ice cream, while you&#8217;re there.</p>
<p>There are loads of opportunities to take in the eclipse in Northern Virginia, according to <a href="https://www.insidenova.com/headlines/celebrate-the-solar-eclipse-with-viewing-events-around-northern-virginia/article_735d668a-f0e4-11ee-9c83-87f482caf868.html" target="_blank">InsideNoVA</a>; one example is a viewing party at the National Air and Space Museum&#8217;s Udvar-Hazy Center in Sterling. If you&#8217;re inclined to venture into D.C., there will be a Solar Eclipse Festival on the National Mall from 12:00-4:00 p.m.</p>
<p>Southwest Virginia peeps, head to Virginia Tech&#8217;s Drillfield, 2:30-4:30 p.m., for an <a href="https://www.science.vt.edu/get-involved/events/eclipse.html" target="_blank">eclipse viewing party</a> complete with free glasses and Moon Pies.</p>
<p><b>When will we get to do this again?</b></p>
<p>That’s a great question! The next eclipse to reach Virginia won’t be until 2078. This article from <a href="https://www.astronomy.com/observing/how-often-do-solar-eclipses-occur/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Astronomy</a> discusses why and how often eclipses occur.</p>
<p><b>Is this good for the country in some way?</b></p>
<p>I can’t imagine it being good or bad for the United States or Virginia. However, the Washington Post opinion section <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2024/03/31/total-solar-eclipse-america/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bravely charged forward</a> with a hot take.</p>
<p>“A four-minute spectacle will not repair the fabric of our country rent by years of mutual distrust, yet if enough of us stand in the path of the moon’s shadow on April 8, the eclipse may remind us of the unity we long to restore,” wrote science correspondent <a href="https://www.american-eclipse.com/author/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">David Baron</a>.</p>
<p><em>This piece was adapted for Virginia. The <a href="https://kansasreflector.com/2024/04/02/solar-spectacle-15-questions-and-answers-about-the-great-kansas-eclipse-of-april-8-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">original</a> was published at the Kansas Reflector, which like the Virginia Mercury, is part of States Newsroom, a nonprofit news network supported by grants and a coalition of donors as a 501c(3) public charity.</em></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These attacks are intensifying each year; to avert them, Congress could work with our nation’s innovators to build up our cyber defense capabilities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2023, the U.S. reported 2,365 total cyberattacks, a number that has more than </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1367217/us-annual-number-of-cyber-attacks-leading-data-compromises-by-type/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">doubled</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the last three years. Microsoft recently </span><a href="https://thehackernews.com/2024/03/microsoft-confirms-russian-hackers.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">found</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that a Russian hacker gained access to parts of the company’s source code. The extent and full impact of the breach has yet to be determined, but it is confirmed that the Kremlin-backed actor has tried to leverage the sensitive information it stole.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia has not been spared from escalating cyberattacks either. In 2021, Virginia’s Division of Legislative Automated Systems was </span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/officials-virginia-state-agency-hit-ransomware-attack-n1285913" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by a ransomware attack, resulting in panic and roadblocks during the midst of a legislative session. That same year saw the Colonial Pipeline attack, which shut down a gasoline pipeline that services the large majority of Virginia’s gas stations, leading the governor to declare a state of emergency. These attacks were targeted, premeditated and measured to inflict the highest level of disarray.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adversaries like China have made it very clear that they would like to surpass America’s global technological leadership, </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/id-b43da0d919ee46efb0e185668a2be263" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">stating </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">that their intention is to be a leading global economic power by 2030. The global tech race is upon us, and the U.S. is at risk of falling behind if we don’t protect our ability to innovate.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the wake of near-constant threats from nation-state hackers, America’s ability to protect its national security is even more of a priority. Just this year, the Department of Defense (DOD) released its first </span><a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/3644527/dod-releases-first-defense-industrial-strategy/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">long-term</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> industrial defense strategy to ensure America has the technology in place to protect us now and in the future. The strategic priorities set out by DOD include resilient supply chains as well as economic deterrence that can produce and secure existing and emerging technologies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given the stakes of this issue, Congress could work with America’s tech innovators to bolster our cybersecurity infrastructure, rather than passing legislation that would handicap our ability to innovate and adapt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I founded Priority Defense in response to this critical security gap, answering the call to help protect infrastructure by strengthening companies’ security programs in Virginia and beyond. As a U.S. Air Force Veteran, I see the essential role our defense industrial base plays in our nation’s security and advancements.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="S9NzB1MfNs"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/02/05/virginia-legislators-should-be-learning-all-they-can-about-ai/">Virginia legislators should be learning all they can about AI</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cybersecurity is national security, and continued investment in the industry will help protect us at home and abroad. Virginia’s geographical location, access to top talent and investment in the next generation of professionals has </span><a href="https://www.vedp.org/industry/cybersecurity" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">helped</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the state become a national leader in cybersecurity. And with about 88,000 cybersecurity workers, the commonwealth has the </span><a href="https://www.vedp.org/industry/cybersecurity#:~:text=Virginia%20is%20Renowned%20for%20its%20Cybersecurity%20Talent%20The,the%20country%2C%20with%20about%2088%2C000%20cybersecurity%20workers%20%28Emsi%29." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">second</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> largest cyber workforce in the country. The opportunity for cybersecurity workers is vasts vast, and the threat sophisticated hackers pose is no longer a warning to prepare for; it is here, and our country is suffering every day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Policymakers should continue to support our state’s cybersecurity workers and our tech sector at large by looking critically at restrictive legislation that may impede innovation. By continuing to lift our tech sector, we empower the organizations maintaining our state and national security.</span></p>

(Roger Chesley/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marvin L. Lake – journalist, Renaissance man, holder of many professional “firsts” – was made of decidedly sterner stuff.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Otherwise, he couldn’t have withstood the racial slights and outright prejudice he fought after becoming The Virginian-Pilot’s first Black summer intern in 1966 and later,</span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2024/04/02/marvin-lake-the-virginian-pilots-first-black-reporter-dies-at-80/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">in 1969, its first Black reporter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He understood the long game, though: Rise through the newspaper ranks. Become a mentor to legions of young journalists – especially African Americans and others of color. Be a conduit between the paper and Hampton Roads’ Black community, which distrusted The Pilot</span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2007/12/16/after-41-years-diversity-fairness-efforts-stand-out/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">for its biased depictions of Black people</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They were tasks the Norfolk native relished in a career that eventually spanned 41 years at the newspaper.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He and I worked together on The Pilot editorial page from my arrival in 2000 until his retirement in 2007. I edited his public editor columns during that period – with him often saying “I’m writing it in my head” as he busted deadlines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lake, 80, died last week at his Norfolk home after a long illness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His professional “offspring,” some from as far away as California and Florida, returned to Norfolk on Tuesday. His funeral took place at a church across from Norfolk State University, where Lake had earned a bachelor of arts degree in sociology in 1967.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The roughly 200 mourners this week included a top magazine editor, a college educator and other media professionals. U.S. Rep. Bobby Scott, a Norfolk Democrat, was among the politicians who attended.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Derek Dingle first met Lake in November 1979 when he became a copy aide, or assistant, at The Pilot, he said at Shiloh Baptist Church. “Marvin became my mentor at that moment,” Dingle said, and Lake encouraged him to report and write – though he sometimes endured Lake’s exacting, tough editing via a red pen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I was close to tears!” Dingle said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a lesson Dingle learned well.</span><a href="https://www.blackenterprise.com/management/derekdingle/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">He’s been the top editor for years at Black Enterprise</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and has held other senior positions there.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.jou.ufl.edu/staff/herbert-lowe/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Herbert Lowe</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, onetime Pilot reporter and now a senior journalism lecturer at the University of Florida, told me Lake helped edit a piece he’d written long after Lowe had left Norfolk. It was an exceptional display of help to a former colleague.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kia Morgan Smith, who I interviewed by phone in Atlanta, called Lake a father figure. “It was his style, his presence. He really cared about young Black kids,” said Smith, who later worked at Black Enterprise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lake’s mentees relayed stories of tough love, consistent support and even financial help. They noted his patience and the fact he rarely raised his voice in anger.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not surprisingly, Lake earned his share of professional accolades. Among them: In 1997, he developed and edited a newspaper series, “Church Street: What Was Lost,” and narrated and hosted an award-winning television documentary, “Church Street: Harlem of the South,” about the onetime Black hub in Norfolk.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">He was inducted into the</span><a href="https://news.vcu.edu/article/inductees_announced_for_virginia_communications_hall_of_fame" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Communications Hall of Fame in 2007</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also ended several prejudicial habits in the paper. As he wrote </span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2007/12/16/after-41-years-diversity-fairness-efforts-stand-out/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in his farewell column</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a white reporter often peppered stories with comments from a “source close to the black community.” The source, Lake learned, “was a white man frequently critical of Blacks.” Treachery at its worst.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s no exaggeration to say Marvin overhauled the coverage of The Pilot and altered the trajectory of the careers of many journalists. That’s a fitting epitaph. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crisis is not too strong a word to describe the unchecked proliferation of power-hungry data centers in Northern Virginia and </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/business/hanover-data-center-ashland-lithium-batteries-environment/article_9d03721e-ed32-11ee-9023-ff54a278984b.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">around the state</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Virginia utilities do not have the energy or transmission capacity to handle the enormous increases in energy consumption. Dominion Energy projects a doubling of CO2 and a new fossil fuel buildout. Drinking water sources are imperiled. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The governor is unfazed. Legislators are going to study the matter. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to data </span><a href="https://www.pjm.com/-/media/planning/res-adeq/load-forecast/load-forecast-supplement.ashx" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">gathered by regional grid operator PJM</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, half of the coming surge will occur in parts of Virginia served by Dominion Energy. In its </span><a href="https://www.scc.virginia.gov/docketsearch/DOCS/7rwl01!.PDF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2023 Integrated Resource Plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (IRP), Dominion said it would meet the higher demand by increasing its use of expensive and highly polluting fossil fuels and building new methane gas-fired generating plants. Dominion admitted this will push up carbon emissions at a time when the Virginia Clean Economy Act requires the utility to build renewable energy and cut carbon. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PJM projects equally huge data center growth in areas served by Virginia electric cooperatives, especially Northern Virginia Electric Cooperative (NOVEC). The cooperatives are exempt from most VCEA requirements, and NOVEC buys the bulk of its power from PJM’s fossil fuel-heavy wholesale market. NOVEC’s latest </span><a href="https://www.novec.com/About_NOVEC/upload/NOVEC_AR-2023-compressed-2.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">annual report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> cites load growth of 12% per year, almost entirely from data centers, but fails to even mention the increase in carbon emissions that will accompany that growth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Undeterred by these alarming statistics, the General Assembly put the growth on steroids with a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/03/02/a-dog-a-food-fight-and-other-energy-highlights-from-the-2023-general-assembly-session/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">new round of tax breaks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2023, while beating back any conditions that might have slowed the onslaught. This year it </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/03/13/in-virginias-legislature-climate-progress-requires-more-than-a-democratic-majority/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">turned away</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> every bill that would have placed limits on the industry or protected ordinary consumers from the inevitable cost increases. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, legislators rejected a host of bills that would have enabled more renewable energy development in Virginia and given customers a greater ability to secure their own electricity supply. Together these bills could have brought thousands of megawatts of new solar projects online, lowered demand growth through increased energy efficiency, and prevented the increases in carbon pollution that now appear inevitable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legislators did greenlight Dominion Energy and Appalachian Power’s ability to spend their customers’ money on initial development efforts for two nuclear reactors of up to 500 megawatts (MW), one for each utility. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is not a fix. It is like scheduling knee surgery for next year when you are having a heart attack today.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is, famously, </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/02/16/small-modular-nuclear-reactors-a-good-deal-for-southwest-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">much doubt</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about whether small modular reactors (SMRs) will prove viable in the coming decades, but there is no doubt whatsoever that the surge in data center development is happening right now. Virginia’s hoped-for nuclear renaissance would be both too little and too late to meet a data center demand that Dominion says </span><a href="https://materials.proxyvote.com/Approved/25746U/20240301/NOMNP_564058.PDF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">grew by 933 MW</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2023 alone. It’s expected to reach almost 20,000 MW by 2034, the year Dominion’s IRP shows its first small nuclear reactor delivering power.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In rejecting every serious measure to address data center demand, General Assembly leaders said they wanted to wait for a </span><a href="https://jlarc.virginia.gov/pdfs/resolutions/2024_Data%20centers_JLARC.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> being conducted this year by the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission (JLARC). What the General Assembly </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">didn’t</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> do was defer new data center development until the study is complete. Another year has to pass before lawmakers will even consider bills addressing land use, power and water concerns around data centers or make it easier for renewable energy to come online. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The consequences of inaction could be deadly. It was only a year ago that Virginia’s Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) proposed allowing certain Northern Virginia data centers to violate their air quality permits by running more than 4,000 highly-polluting diesel generators during periods of grid stress. It doesn’t take much imagination to picture the public health disaster we’d have had if 4,000 diesel generators kicked into operation last summer when </span><a href="https://www.vpm.org/news/2023-06-09/unhealthy-air-quality-canada-wildfires-smoke-virginia-tips" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">smoke from Canadian wildfires</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> had already made Virginia air quality hazardous.  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DEQ backed off its proposal after a massive </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/02/28/temporary-air-pollution-exception-for-data-centers-sparks-opposition-in-northern-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">public outcry</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but the idea is likely still percolating at the agency and might reemerge as an </span><a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/fossil-fuels/the-dark-side-of-californias-emergency-grid-rescue-plan-more-dirty-emissions-from-backup-generators" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">emergency demand-response measure</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Even without allowing the generators to provide grid support, more data centers with more diesel generators will worsen air quality with every power outage and every round of equipment testing.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I argued </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/02/15/building-more-virginia-data-centers-requires-increased-pollution-controls/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">at the time</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the diesel generator fiasco could have been avoided in the first place if data centers had been equipped with renewable energy microgrids and battery storage.  DEQ’s decision not to require battery storage as the first line of defense against power outages deprived Dominion of a demand-response option that would have been far cleaner and more useful than diesel generators.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the bills the General Assembly rejected this year would have prohibited the use of backup diesel generators by data centers that receive state tax subsidies, and would have required greater energy efficiency. It was a missed opportunity that means the problem can only get worse in the coming year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The governor, however, could still avert the crisis by imposing a pause in data center development while the JLARC study is underway. He could accomplish this through an executive order directing the Virginia Economic Development Partnership (VEDP) not to enter a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with any data center operator until the JLARC study is complete and legislators have had the opportunity to act on it. These MOUs are a requirement for data center operators to access Virginia’s generous tax exemptions. Without the tax subsidies, most data center developers would likely choose not to pursue development here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is not a novel idea. Last spring, data center reform advocates </span><a href="https://vasierra.club/LettertoVEDP.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">asked VEDP </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">to include stringent efficiency and siting conditions in MOUs it entered with Amazon Web Services. They never got an answer. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Down in Georgia, however, legislators </span><a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/georgia-senate-passes-bill-to-suspend-data-center-tax-exemptions/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">just passed a Republican-led bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to suspend that state’s data center tax subsidies for two years pending the results of a study of grid capacity. Legislators expressed concern about Georgia Power’s ability to provide electricity to all the data centers that want to come to the state. And as Republican Sen. John Albers also </span><a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/georgia-senate-gives-final-ok-to-suspension-of-tax-break-for-data-centers/5S365GWLDNFX7EVFG4QLTV6EIY/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">noted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, “The reality is these do not create many jobs. They create big buildings, but they do not create jobs.” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interestingly, the Georgia tax subsidies were modeled on the ones Virginia implemented in 2010, which pushed our data center growth into overdrive. Isn’t it interesting that Georgia lawmakers so quickly learned a lesson that Virginia leaders refuse to even acknowledge?</span></p>

<p><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+ful+HB1157H1" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 1157</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> cements actions laid out in a 2021 </span><a href="https://rosetta.virginiamemory.com/delivery/DeliveryManagerServlet?dps_pid=IE3440504" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">executive order</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by former Gov. Ralph Northam, including: creating an ombudsman to facilitate dialogue between the tribes, the governor and state agencies; establishing a process to notify tribes of projects requiring permits from the state; and requiring state leaders to seek and consider the tribes’ input on those projects.The Department of Environmental Quality and the Department of Conservation and Recreation, among others, would need to consult with tribes before permitting projects, under the legislation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This bill could save everyone — developers, businesses, state agencies and the tribes —  a lot of time and money, Chief Frank Adams of the Upper Mattaponi tribe told me. Adams is one of the tribal leaders who have been pushing this effort forward for the past two years. A </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/03/07/house-republicans-torpedo-bills-giving-virginia-tribes-state-consultation-rights/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill to give Virginia tribes consultation rights</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was shot down by House Republicans in 2022, although it won unanimous support in the Senate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re not asking for power to stop the permitting process. We are asking to be notified when departments in Virginia, like [the Department of Environmental Quality], are considering permitting a development or project. We need to be brought into the process early on, so we can speak up about any potential conflicts we see,” Adams said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Imagine finding out secondhand, through TV or newspaper reports, that a state agency gave the OK for a mineral mine to be built bordering your backyard. (Side note: Some of us don’t have to imagine, since our communities of color, </span><a href="https://www.epa.gov/environmentaljustice/learn-about-environmental-justice" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">historically</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, have been the usual spots where projects <a href="https://www.usccr.gov/files/pubs/envjust/ch2.htm" target="_blank">fraught with environmental risks</a> that white people don’t want in their neighborhoods develop.) Before many of us could even consider whether the mine would be profitable, or what it would mean for our environment and quality of life, we’d want to know why no one consulted us about it when the plan was first hatched. Shouldn’t the people who stand to be impacted most deeply by projects get a say in their development?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s tribes know their lands and sacred sites far more intimately than developers and regulators do. Of course they should be afforded the opportunity to weigh in on what happens there, before the first permit is issued or the first shovelful of dirt is dug. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adams emphasized that the Mattaponi and other federally recognized tribes are “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">not anti-development, not anti-business.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">” Their goal is not to block projects that could boost local and state revenues or create jobs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s actually the opposite. We don’t mind development but we want the opportunity to say, ‘This project is on or near our burial ground, but if you try to move it a mile down the road it won&#8217;t be a problem.’” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When that conversation doesn’t happen, and projects end up encroaching on sites of special meaning and memory, Adams said “yes, we will eventually protest, and it would cost developers and others lots of money and time. We don’t have to do it that way.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps the most striking example of the backwardness of Virginia’s current process of notifying tribes after a project is well underway is Rassawek.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the James River Water Authority, led by Louisa and Fluvanna Counties, announced its plans to build a pump station, water pipeline, and water treatment plant at Point of Fork in 2014, it sent shock waves through the Monacan Indian Nation. Carbon dating showed that the Monacan’s ancestors had occupied the capital town of Rassawek as early as 3,000 B.C. and Captain John Smith marked it in his 1612 map of Virginia. By the 1930s, researchers determined that the ancient Rassawek was likely located at present-day Point of Fork, and all doubts were removed when the Department of Historic Resources in 1980 officially pinpointed Rassawek’s location, after a gas pipeline’s construction at Point of Fork disturbed Native American burials there.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Monacans weren’t given the human remains revealed by the pipeline’s construction, according to a </span><a href="https://culturalheritagepartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/SaveRassawekTimeline_9-23-2020.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">by Cultural Heritage Partners, PLLC. At this moment in Virginia, “If you&#8217;re a developer that needs to move a burial ground, you can go to the Department of Historic Resources to get a permit, or go to a circuit court judge to get an order to move the cemetery,” Cultural Heritage Partners attorney Marion Werkheiser said. The more some things change, the more others stay the same.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DEQ issued a permit for the James River Water Authority’s project in 2015. The Water Authority didn’t notify the Monacan Nation of its plans for Rassawek until 2017. What followed was a protracted battle between the tribe and local and state authorities that finally concluded in 2022, when the Water Authority </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/water-authority-abandons-plans-to-site-pump-station-at-rassawek/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">gave up their project plans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at Rassawek and instead chose to develop a water intake and pump station on an alternative site.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just how long have Virginia Native American communities been asking for the type of consideration and respect that HB 1157 is designed to give them?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don&#8217;t want to be cute about it, but this goes back to the treaty the tribes made with the governor of Virginia in 1677,” answered </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Werkheiser. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adams said, “We’ve always wanted the state to consider our beliefs and our traditions more. That goes back to the beginning, for many of us.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It shouldn’t take that amount of time and the eyes of the world watching for Virginia agencies to take culturally competent, decently human actions to preserve sites that are extraordinary in their rareness and importance to Native American nations and Virginia history.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I hope, mightily, that Gov. Glenn Youngkin — who now wields the power to reject this long-sought measure or sign it into law — agrees. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having a roof over your head doesn’t solve everything — but it can be a critical start. It’s definitely better than the alternative.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://rga.lis.virginia.gov/Published/2022/RD636/PDF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A state report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> says Virginia — compared to other states — does a strong job fighting homelessness. For the 2021-22 fiscal year, for example, “the rate of homelessness per 10,000 on average in Virginia is 7, and remains the fourth-lowest including all 50 states and territories,” according to the report compiled by the Virginia Department of Housing and Community Development.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We can do even better, though.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pockets of homelessness are</span><a href="https://www.wavy.com/news/local-news/virginia-beach/new-waterfront-homeless-camp-sets-up-on-london-bridge-creek/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">noticeable statewide</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, from </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/05/29/homelessness-northern-virginia-fairfax/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">makeshift tent communities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/10/20/helping-panhandlers-involves-more-than-just-easing-bans-on-begging/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">panhandlers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to people queuing up</span><a href="https://rescuemission.net/meals/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">for free meals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> doled out by</span><a href="https://www.fairfaxcounty.gov/news/ways-you-can-help-fight-hunger-and-homelessness-fairfax-county" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">ministries</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Efforts by the latter are laudable, but they don’t help people thrive or radically alter their living conditions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Roanoke, Dawn Sandoval is the executive director of The Least of These Ministries. The nonprofit has transformed a former motel into Suites by TLOT, making it more than just a temporary shelter for the homeless. Officials opened 12 renovated units on Feb. 15, and they’re completing work on the remaining six units.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We currently serve the unsheltered population and have discovered that many of those experiencing homelessness are on a fixed income,” Sandoval told me by email. Soaring inflation makes rental homes unaffordable for them, Sandoval said, and many are also “wading through lengthy wait lists for Section 8 and HUD-VASH vouchers.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The acronym stands for the U.S. Housing and Urban Development-Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing program.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.theleastoftheseministry.org/suites-by-tlot.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ministry’s website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> notes that people pay an affordable rental rate at the renovated motel. Each room has a full-size bed, private bathroom, refrigerator and other amenities. TLOT also plans to shuttle residents to downtown Roanoke several days a week to help them get to work and take advantage of other essential services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a much larger and comprehensive scale,</span><a href="https://www.virginiasupportivehousing.org/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Supportive Housing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> connects the formerly homeless with secure housing. The nonprofit organization, founded in 1988, opened its first housing complex in 1992. VSH now operates 11 housing communities in Richmond, Charlottesville, Norfolk, Virginia Beach, Portsmouth and Chesapeake totaling 711 apartments, the agency said.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_38188" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_3834-scaled.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-38188" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_3834-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1920" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_3834-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_3834-300x225.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_3834-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_3834-768x576.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_3834-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_3834-2048x1536.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Heron&#8217;s Landing, with 60 apartments in Chesapeake, is one of several complexes statewide for the formerly homeless operated by Virginia Supportive Housing. (Roger Chesley/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The group seeks to end homelessness by providing permanent housing and supportive services, including counseling, case management and connecting folks to primary healthcare. People struggling with substance abuse or mental health problems, thus, aren’t just told to figure things out on their own.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It uses a model called “Housing First,” which prioritizes housing individuals as soon as possible, and then provides services to help maintain stability.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Allison Bogdanovic, VSH’s executive director, told me that in 2023, the organization assisted nearly 1,700 people living in its apartments as well as those who used the organization’s service programs. It had revenues of $16.4 million last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She proudly noted, by email, that 94% of its residents remain in stable, permanent housing. That means people are protected from the threats of violence, extreme weather conditions and more, all of which they might have experienced had they been on the streets. The average length of stay in VSH housing is six years, Bogdanovic added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We remain committed to ending homelessness in our existing footprint and are evaluating the feasibility of expanding into smaller communities,” she told me. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I learned about VSH when it opened the 60-unit</span><a href="https://www.virginiasupportivehousing.org/regions/hampton-roads/gosnold-apartments/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Gosnold Apartments in 2006 in Norfolk</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the group’s first foray into Hampton Roads. The $6 million development is in a former RC Cola bottling warehouse. Within the next year, the nonprofit plans a major renovation-expansion there to 100 units.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_38189" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:150px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Joel_Chambers-scaled.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-38189" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Joel_Chambers-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Joel Chambers was formerly homeless and now lives at Gosnold Apartments in Norfolk. The complex is one of 11 operated in the state by Virginia Supportive Housing. The complexes have more than 700 apartments. (Courtesy Joel Chambers)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joel Chambers has called Gosnold home since 2019. The 39-year-old Baltimore native, who suffers from multiple sclerosis and uses a wheelchair, had spent several months on the streets of the Virginia Beach Oceanfront after bouncing around jobs and serving a brief stint in jail.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Was he worried for his safety while homeless? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s a bond in that community,” Chambers told me. “You look out for me, we’ll look out for you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting connected to a home at the housing complex, though, has been a godsend. Housing advocates directed him to the vacancy. A federal voucher helps pay the rent.“Gosnold makes you feel as though it’s not all over,” Chambers said. “I have a bit of a sense of legitimacy, humanity, even.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He works from home for AbbVie pharmaceuticals as an ambassador resource specialist. “I love on people,” Chambers explained. He contacts patients who use the company’s medications, makes sure they have enough supplies and prescriptions and generally provides a kind ear.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Living at Gosnold means he doesn’t have to worry about where he’ll find long-term shelter. “I can use time and energy on myself,” he said, including getting to physical therapy. “It’s a calming effect.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Efforts like the renovated motel in Roanoke and Virginia Supportive Housing’s projects help fight homelessness. They transform lives and keep people safe. They’re worthy of publicity and support.</span></p>

(Style Weekly)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Posts began popping up in my social media feeds a couple of weeks ago from friends in my demographic: white, male and old enough to know better.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They linked back to stories in the</span><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/education/2903154/taxpayers-dei-university-of-virginia/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Washington Examiner</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or the</span><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2024/mar/5/uva-spends-20-million-year-on-dei-staff-opentheboo/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Washington Times</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about a report by the nonprofit group OpenTheBooks.com, asserting that the University of Virginia spends about $20 million a year on diversity, equity and inclusion staff.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twenty million dollars is no small pile of cash. But let’s view it in perspective.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If spotlighting non-essential, non-academic spending is the point, compare it to what UVA spends on its big-time sports programs.</span><a href="https://sports.usatoday.com/ncaa/finances" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Data gathered by USA Today</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> show that UVA spent about $150 million on intercollegiate athletics last year. About</span><a href="https://sports.usatoday.com/ncaa/finances/234076" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">$46 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of it went to pay coaches and another $22 million went to scholarships for Wahoo student-athletes. That ranks Virginia 17th nationally in athletics spending and 14th in gross revenue among college sports programs.</span></p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;By trying to demolish DEI initiatives, Va. Republicans dig in on history’s wrong side&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/05/08/by-trying-to-demolish-dei-initiatives-va-republicans-dig-in-on-historys-wrong-side/embed/#?secret=le9ALUUuhW#?secret=cJIYPRq12Z" data-secret="cJIYPRq12Z" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also contrast it to the value of the land and centuries-old structures and underlying infrastructure that are the centerpiece of the campus designed and founded by Virginia’s second governor, the nation’s third president and the author of the Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson. Good luck finding a definitive dollar-amount valuation for the Lawn, the Rotunda and the Academical Village built from 1819 to 1825, the year the university opened. University spokesman Brian Coy said he had never seen one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Who built much of that priceless repository of history, architecture and higher learning? Enslaved people. Lots of them — including some owned by Jefferson — doing backbreaking, uncompensated, dawn-to-dusk labor for years on end.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is no mention of the human bondage that was essential to UVA’s origins in</span><a href="https://www.openthebooks.com/substack-university-of-virginia-spends-20-million-on-235-dei-employees-with-some-making-587340-per-year/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">the piece</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> done by OpenTheBooks. It extols Jefferson and “Jeffersonian principles” without noting that this founding father owned slaves and</span><a href="https://www.monticello.org/thomas-jefferson/jefferson-slavery/thomas-jefferson-and-sally-hemings-a-brief-account/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">fathered six children</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with one of them, Sally Hemings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here, some personal disclosure is due. My ancestors in the 18th and early 19th centuries were also slaveholders who lived and owned farms over that time in Gloucester, Goochland and Albemarle counties — the latter along the Rivanna River abutting Jefferson’s estate. The dark and tormented history is detailed in “Jefferson’s Nephews: A Frontier Tragedy” (1976) by Boynton Merrill Jr. The passage of more than 150 years until my birth makes that inescapable fact of my heritage no less shameful to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether UVA spent $20 million on DEI salaries or just under $6 million, as the university contends, is not something I can independently ascertain. What is clear, as OpenTheBooks asserts, is that UVA has a robust DEI program.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coy said that the university’s accounting found that OpenTheBooks had inflated the cost by more than three times its actual amount partly by counting each of the 235 employees it identified as full time DEI staff when, in most cases, it was only a portion of their duties.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, Coy said in an email, Martin Davidson — listed by OpenTheBooks as UVA’s highest-paid DEI official at $587,340 in 2023 — spends most of his time as a tenured full professor in the Darden School of Business and executive director of the Contemplative Sciences Center.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Dr. Tracy Downs is a board-certified urologist who has a urological surgical practice and teaches in the School of Medicine as well as engaging in community and diversity work for the Health System,” Coy wrote of another faculty member identified in the report. (Spoiler alert: surgeons make good money.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coy further noted that OpenTheBooks erred by extrapolating the hourly wages paid to part-time employees into full time annual salary estimates significantly greater than their actual pay. Also, he wrote, more than 100 positions identified as faculty are actually student workers, “the majority of whom serve as tutors primarily in K-12 educational settings as part of a broadly available educational opportunity program.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OpenTheBooks did not seek an explanation of its findings from UVA or offer it a chance for balancing comment before the piece was published, Coy said. I contacted OpenTheBooks last week offering it a chance to comment for this column but received no reply by week’s end. The D.C. newspapers’ accounts of the study, to their credit, independently sought and included comment from the university.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The OpenTheBooks’ piece makes no pretense of balance. Its objective is plain from the start: setting the stage for doing at UVA what Florida and Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis recently did at the University of Florida, where all its</span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/03/04/1235725631/university-florida-cuts-dei-office" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">DEI programs were dismantled</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Reform or abolition [of DEI at UVA] must await this summer’s anticipated changes in the school’s Board of Visitors,” says the fourth paragraph, noting Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s summer appointments to UVA’s governing body, putting a majority of his designees in control. Youngkin’s belief that his boards of visitors appointees have</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/12/06/thought-policing-va-s-schools-youngkin-consolidates-his-grip-on-educations-ruling-boards/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">a duty to do his will</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> plus his antipathy toward DEI programs — especially </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/03/22/youngkin-considers-budget-proposal-to-redirect-diversity-office-funds/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the ‘E’ part</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> —</span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/youngkin-names-a-new-diversity-officer-for-the-state-orders-a-new-focus-for-the/article_fdbb1fdd-e6c9-581e-a7ad-b82e456843e8.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">is</span></a><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/03/05/whats-word-youngkin-takes-aim-equity/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">well</span></a><a href="https://youtu.be/gAiSKGp7GMs" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">chronicled</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“At least until then,” OpenTheBooks continued, “the highly compensated, generally non-teaching DEI staffers are safely embedded throughout the entire university — while costing students and taxpayers a fortune.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Define “fortune.” To me, $20 million certainly qualifies, but</span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/giacomotognini/2021/11/03/virginias-new-governor-glenn-youngkin-is-one-of-the-nations-richest-politicians/?sh=33fdcf2870fd" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">our governor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> might consider it penury. But, even assuming it is the correct figure, that represents 0.37% — less than four tenths of a percent — of UVA’s</span><a href="https://uvafinance.virginia.edu/budget-management/budgeting" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">$5.4 billion budget</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the current fiscal year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or should we define it in more prosaic terms as the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">good</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> fortune enjoyed by the white scions of Virginia’s and America’s gentry until the middle of the 20</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> century, a time when UVA was their exclusive preserve? The flip side is the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">mis</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">fortune of the enslaved who labored to build and open the university but, along with generations of their descendants, were denied enrollment and the privileges that a degree from the elite public institution conveys.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are there problems, inefficiencies or even abuses with DEI programs? I’ve never seen an initiative administered by the bureaucracies of government and/or academia that didn’t have at least some. Those things are reparable. Ill intent isn’t.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If DEI programs help correct historic wrongs — particularly at institutions in the South born in part through slave labor — and facilitate a fairer, more inclusive future, then it’s a worthy expense and too long overdue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s just one old white guy’s view.</span></p>
<p><i>Editor&#8217;s note: This commentary has been corrected to reflect that while $20 million is less than four one-thousandths of the university&#8217;s overall budget, in percentage terms it is less than four tenths of a percent.</i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of the best work of my career I wrote on assignment for the Mercury, then under the leadership of Robert Zullo. I chronicled the plight of </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2018/12/04/growing-forward-facing-historic-and-modern-challenges-virginias-black-farmers-look-to-bolster-ranks-and-grow-their-communities/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black farmers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Virginia who faced discrimination from the federal government, and investigated the state’s </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2019/03/05/birthing-while-black-african-american-women-face-disproportionate-risks-during-pregnancy/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">disproportionate maternal mortality</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> rates. I appreciated the chance to write about environmental justice issues around the state, like the implications of a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2018/09/26/its-not-right-cumberland-residents-say-planned-landfill-will-disturb-historic-school-burial-grounds/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">planned landfill in Cumberland</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, for example, and why alumni of a Rosenwald school within the area&#8217;s historic Black community objected to the facility. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My relationship with the Mercury gave me the chance to make connections with communities that still inform my work and understanding of the state’s dynamics. I met </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2018/11/08/state-board-will-decide-permit-for-buckingham-compressor-station-virginias-biggest-environmental-justice-debate/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">members of the Union Hill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> community who were waging an all-out war against the Atlantic Coast Pipeline, and tried to show the yearslong, statewide pattern of economic development at the expense of communities like the one I grew up in, where most people are Black, working class, good-hearted but tired of industry encroaching on them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;They are putting this [compressor station] in this neighborhood because we are black,” I remember Ms. Ella Rose telling me when I was reporting on Union Hill for the Mercury back then.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was anxious thinking the pipeline&#8217;s compressor station would excise her &#8220;bear friend&#8221; and other animals from the woods surrounding her home. She and other residents asked hard questions — namely, why was it OK to put the compressor in a historic Black neighborhood but not in an affluent white one? — that I couldn&#8217;t answer. But I did ask decision makers to answer those inquiries; that kind of accountability seeking is an essential point of local journalism and remains one of my top goals as a journalist. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am and have always been interested in the problems and possibilities in Virginia. In why things are the way they are politically and culturally in this Southern state, a bedrock of American history that’s slowly transformed from red to purple to blue, reflecting the shifting sensibilities of its citizens. My freelance </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2019/07/08/this-is-hanover-but-it-doesnt-have-to-be/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">columns</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the Mercury, and the </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/author/samantha-willis/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ones</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I wrote after becoming deputy/commentary editor here last year, often explored the ways our past influences our present. You’ve got to know where you’ve been to know where you’re going. I bring that same curiosity to my new role, continuing in the tradition of my predecessors Zullo and Sarah Vogelsong.</span></p>

I intend to keep supporting their rigorous reporting on state policies that shape Virginians’ lives. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In many ways, Virginia is a bellwether of progressive ideals. We enacted the first </span><a href="https://encyclopediavirginia.org/entries/house-of-burgesses/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“democratically elected legislative body”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the New World.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the state’s identity continues its evolution, I am grateful for the opportunity to lead our team in meeting our mission: giving Virginians a new look at the Old Dominion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If there are issues you think our reporting should address or voices that we need to hear, please write to me: swillis@virginiamercury.com. Thank you for reading the Virginia Mercury.</span></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong/Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When are we going to finally dispel the fiction that the conservation of tree canopy is costly, anti-housing, and detrimental to Virginia’s economy and interests?  The tree legislation currently before the governor, described in a recent Virginia Mercury </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/03/11/bills-to-preserve-trees-during-home-building-awaiting-action-from-governor/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">article</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, is full of misleading statements by home construction lobbyists, who once again seek to blame the preservation of small amounts of tree canopy for the imminent collapse of their industry. Nothing could be further from the truth.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Oxy4QmEm8J"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/03/11/bills-to-preserve-trees-during-home-building-awaiting-action-from-governor/">Bills to preserve trees during home building awaiting action from governor</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bills merely provide Virginia localities with the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">option</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of adopting reasonable standards for tree conservation and replacement in local tree ordinances, yet the homebuilders incorrectly state that the legislation is an onerous statewide requirement. The bills do not</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> require any jurisdiction to create such a tree ordinance if they do not want to. In fact, the current bills set strict limits on the amount of tree preservation that localities can require, from 10 to 30% of lot coverage, depending on the number of units per acre. This limitation was specifically added at the request of the Home Builders Association during General Assembly negotiations on this legislation! Why do they oppose the bills now?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The homebuilders repeat their stock line that the bills will have a chilling effect on development, particularly of affordable housing. I challenge the homebuilder lobbyists to identify a single community in Virginia that is opposing development strictly for the sake of tree preservation. The real story is that growth will continue to happen where consumer demand requires it. Affordable housing will be built whenever localities provide the right incentives for developers to do so. The real truth is that a moderate percentage of tree cover will only enhance the value and livability of neighborhoods across the commonwealth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The environmental benefits of preserving and enhancing tree canopy should be evident to anyone living in today’s world. Tree canopy is widely recognized as an essential element in maintaining the health of our communities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it’s not just environmental benefits that the tree legislation will provide. The social, health, and economic benefits of conserving and replacing trees are huge. </span></p>
<p>The tree canopy of my home county of Arlington is only 80% of what it was in 2017, according to a recent study by the Green Infrastructure Center. This decline is due largely to clear-cut development, resulting in hotter neighborhoods, diminished habitat, local flooding, more pollutants in the Chesapeake Bay watershed — the list goes on. <span style="font-weight: 400;"> And with so many communities facing increased storm impacts and flooding, leading to spiraling storm water management costs, it is clear that trees provide cost-effective alternatives to reduce those risks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reasonable tree canopy options are not a problem. They are a cost-effective solution that can help communities to maintain a good quality of life. Gov. Glenn Youngkin has a golden opportunity to show that Virginia is a national leader in achieving a smart balance between continued growth and reforestation that can provide prosperity for all. The homebuilders have another chance to get on board and support this goal, as well.</span></p>

It seemed possible the General Assembly might pass much-needed initiatives modest enough to avoid a veto from a Republican governor.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apparently not. Democrats did fend off attacks on the VCEA and Clean Cars, and killed a lot of terrible bills. Through the budget process, they’re trying to require Virginia’s renewed participation in the carbon-cutting Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. But Gov. Youngkin won’t even get his shot at most of the priority bills from the environmental community. Of the bills that did pass, most were so watered down as to make their usefulness questionable. A few bills died even when they went unopposed. Some successful bills seem likely to add to Virginia’s energy problems rather than help solve them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot of the blame can be laid at the feet of Dominion Energy, which took a bipartisan </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/03/02/a-dog-a-food-fight-and-other-energy-highlights-from-the-2023-general-assembly-session/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">drubbing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the 2023 session, but was back this year </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/02/27/in-this-arms-race-the-public-loses/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">stronger than ever</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> like a plague that surges when we let our guard down.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="XJIdsSuIzT"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/02/27/in-this-arms-race-the-public-loses/">In this arms race, the public loses</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But that’s only half the story. As a party, Democrats seemed to have simply lost interest in the fight. Climate change may be an urgent issue in the rest of the world, but in Virginia, a lot of lawmakers seem to think they already checked that box. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Two steps forward</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the spirit of optimism, let’s start with the positive highlights of the session, though admittedly they were more like flashlight beams than floodlights.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most consequential for the energy transition is </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB729" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> establishing a statewide green bank, a requirement for accepting hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funding for clean energy projects. The House and Senate versions are different and will go to a conference committee. A show of opposition from Republicans in both chambers could attract a veto, but most governors welcome free money.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similarly, new </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+ful+HB1002ER+hil" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> directs the Department of Energy to identify federal funding available to further the commonwealth’s energy efficiency goals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another encouraging piece of </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+ful+HB151ER" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> updates and expands on existing energy efficiency requirements for new and renovated public buildings, a category that would now include schools. Provisions for EV charging capabilities, resilience measures, and onsite renewable energy and storage are included. The measure attracted only a couple of Republican votes, so it may be at risk of a veto.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+ful+SB313S2+hil" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">change</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will bring sales of residential rooftop solar within the consumer protections that apply to other contractors. Virginia’s Board for Contractors will be required to issue regulations requiring relevant disclosures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The net metering law that supports customer-sited solar will now include provisions for the leasing of solar panels and the use of batteries under a </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+ful+SB271ER" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">measure</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that is not expected to draw a veto. A solar facility paired with a battery of equal capacity will be exempt from standby charges, and the customer may use the batteries in demand-response and peak-shaving programs. Though none of the bill’s provisions were controversial, Dominion exacted a price in the form of a line directing the SCC to “make all reasonable efforts to ensure that the net energy metering program does not result in unreasonable cost-shifting to nonparticipating electric utility customers.” Our utilities hope this will undermine the current full retail value for net metered solar when the SCC considers the future of net metering in proceedings later this year and next year.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB1088" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to require the Board of Education to develop materials for teaching students about climate change passed mainly along party lines. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+ful+HB746ER+hil" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> allows, but does not require, local governments to create their own “local environmental impact funds,” to assist residents and businesses with the purchase of energy efficient lawn care and landscaping equipment, home appliances, HVAC equipment, or micro mobility devices (like electric scooters). Almost all Republicans voted against it, so modest as it is, it may draw a veto.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both chambers have agreed to </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+ful+SB276ER" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">request</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the SCC form a work group to consider a program of on-bill financing for customer energy projects such as renewable energy, storage and energy efficiency improvements. The SCC will also be </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HJ30" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">asked</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to study performance-based regulation and the impact of competitive service providers. Dominion will now also </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+ful+HB862ER+hil" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have to assess</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the usefulness of various grid enhancing technologies in its Integrated Resource Planning at the SCC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Efficiency advocates had high hopes for a bipartisan measure they dubbed the SAVE Act to strengthen requirements for Dominion and APCo to achieve energy efficiency savings and to make it easier for efficiency programs to pass SCC scrutiny. Unfortunately, the final </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+ful+HB746ER+hil" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> does almost nothing, with most improvements pushed off to 2029. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HJ6" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> passed that designates each October 4 as Energy Efficiency Day. (I said these were small victories.)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, in a rejection of one of the more </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/01/25/as-youngkin-takes-an-axe-to-the-deep-state-what-could-possibly-go-wrong/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">inane initiatives</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the governor’s regulation-gutting agenda, both Houses overwhelmingly passed </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+ful+HB950H1" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> preventing changes to the building code before the next regular code review cycle. I imagine the governor will have to veto the bill, and Republican legislators will then be caught between party loyalty and a duty to govern intelligently, but any way you look at it, eggs are meeting faces.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Two steps back </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Failure to pass a bill might seem to leave matters where they are, with no winners or losers. Inaction in the face of climate change, however, means we lose time we can’t afford to waste.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inaction can also have devastating consequences in the here and now. Solar projects on public schools and other commercial properties in Dominion Energy’s territory have been delayed or outright canceled for more than a year due to new rules imposed by Dominion in December of 2022 that raised the cost of connecting these projects to the grid exponentially. </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB117" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> promoted by the solar industry and its customers would have divided responsibility for grid upgrades between the customer and the utility, while giving Dominion the ability to recover costs it incurred. Through its lobbyists’ influence on legislators, Dominion</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/02/21/bill-to-shift-grid-upgrade-costs-for-small-virginia-solar-projects-fails/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> killed the bills</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> not for any compelling reason, but because it could. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion’s obfuscations and half-truths often work magic when the subject is technical. But of all the votes taken this year on energy bills, this one actually shocks me. No one listening to the committee testimony could have misunderstood the significance of the legislation, affecting dozens of school districts and local governments. In desperation, the solar industry offered amendments that (in my opinion) would have given away the store, to no avail. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A cross-check of votes and campaign contributions shows the legislation failed due to the votes of committee members who happen to accept large campaign contributions from Dominion. This dynamic tanked a number of other climate and energy bills as well, and underlines why utilities must be barred from </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/02/27/in-this-arms-race-the-public-loses/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">making campaign contributions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion’s influence also killed a priority </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB638" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the environmental community that would have required the SCC to implement the Commonwealth Energy Policy, slimmed down SCC review of efficiency programs to a single test, increased the percentage of RPS program requirements that Dominion must meet from projects of less than 1 megawatt, and increased the percentage of renewable energy projects reserved for third-party developers. Two other bills that were limited to the Commonwealth Energy Policy provision also failed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion’s opposition was also enough to kill a </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb118&amp;submit=GO" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> designed to expand EV charging infrastructure statewide, especially in rural areas, in part by protecting gas station owners who install electric vehicle charging from competition by public utilities. Sheetz and other fuel retailers testified that they want to invest in charging infrastructure but won’t take the risk as long as Dominion can install its own chargers nearby. The reason is that using ratepayer money allows a public utility to undercut private business. Other states have dealt with this by prohibiting utilities from getting into the EV charging business. Here, the retailers asked for 12 miles between themselves and any utility-owned chargers. Dominion opposed the bill, and the fuel retailers lost in subcommittee. A second </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb107&amp;submit=GO" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that would have created an </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/03/04/bill-to-help-build-electric-vehicle-infrastructure-in-rural-areas-moves-along/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">EV rural infrastructure fund</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> passed the House but could not get funding in the Senate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bills in both the House and Senate would have required most new local government buildings to include renewable energy infrastructure, especially solar. The House bill, though unopposed, was killed by Democrats in Appropriations because a fiscal impact statement erroneously said it might cost something, in spite of bill language exempting situations where the improvements would not be cost-effective. Then the same committee felt tradition-bound to kill the </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=sb79&amp;submit=GO" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when it came over, although that bill carried no fiscal impact concerns and it was by then clear that killing the House bill had been a mistake. A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, but also of mindless rules. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moving along: all of the bills that would have put limits on the ability of localities to bar solar projects in their jurisdictions failed, as did legislation that would have given solar developers essentially a right to appeal an adverse decision to the SCC.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">None of the many bills supporting customer choice in electricity purchasing passed. </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB644" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to allow localities to regulate or ban gas-powered leaf blowers also failed, as did a </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=HB109" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that would have required Dominion and APCo to reveal how they voted in working groups advising grid operator PJM. This bill passed the House but, like so many others, it died in the heavily pro-utility Senate Commerce and Labor committee.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Two steps sideways?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Community solar, known as shared solar in Virginia, staggered a few steps forward, or maybe just sideways. Readers will recall that the Dominion program authorized in 2020 has proven a success only for </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/08/11/thousands-of-low-income-virginians-set-to-get-access-to-shared-solar/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">low-income customers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who don’t have to pay the high minimum bill Dominion secured in the SCC proceeding that followed enactment. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trying to make the program work for the general public was the goal of </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB253" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that advanced this year but may or may not help. As passed, the compromise language offers an opportunity to expand the program a little bit and to take the argument about the minimum bill back to the SCC with a different set of parameters.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to modifying the program in Dominion territory, shared solar now has a modest opening in Appalachian Power territory under a similar </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB108" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Again, the final bill offers far less than advocates hoped, and it lacks even the special provisions for low-income subscribers that make the original Dominion program work at all. Like Dominion, APCo fought the bill, though unlike Dominion, APCo’s rate base has been shrinking, so losing customers to alternative suppliers is a more legitimate concern. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(At least for now. All APCo needs to do to reverse the decline is to lure a couple of data centers from up north. Data centers are such energy hogs that they would swamp any losses from shared solar, and residents of NoVa would be glad to forgo a few. Or for that matter, a few dozen.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other new measures garnered support from many in the environmental community, but don’t really move the needle. One allows geothermal heat pumps, which reduce a building’s energy demand but don’t generate electricity, to qualify under Virginia’s renewable portfolio standard (RPS). Another allows an old hydroelectric plant to qualify for the RPS, a move that adds no new renewable energy to the grid but means the electric cooperative that gets the electricity from the plant can now sell the renewable energy certificates to Dominion and APCo.</span></p>
<p><b>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Lying down and rolling over</h4>

	 </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the face of the </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/03/07/ai-data-centers-power/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">single greatest threat</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to Virginia’s — and the nation’s — energy security and climate goals, the General Assembly’s leaders chose to do nothing. In fact, doing nothing was their actual game plan for data centers. A quick death was decreed for </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB116%27" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> requiring data centers to meet energy efficiency and renewable energy procurement requirements as a condition of receiving state tax subsidies. Also killed were a </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB191" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that sought to protect other ratepayers from bearing the costs of serving data centers, and </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/01/15/as-data-centers-continue-spreading-across-virginia-state-lawmakers-propose-new-development-rules/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more than a dozen bills</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> dealing with siting impacts, water resources, noise abatement, undergrounding of transmission lines and other location-specific issues. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The excuse for inaction is that the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Committee is </span><a href="https://jlarc.virginia.gov/pdfs/resolutions/2024_Data%20centers_JLARC.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">undertaking a study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to examine the energy and environmental effects of data centers. However, legislators did not impose a concomitant pause in data center development while the study is ongoing. Instead, for at least another year, Virginia’s leaders decreed that there will be no restraints or conditions on the growth of the industry, even as ever more new data center developments are </span><a href="https://www.henricocitizen.com/articles/conceptual-plan-shows-13-data-centers-on-622-acre-sandston-site/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and community opposition increases. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">And falling for the boondoggle</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nuclear energy has always had its true believers at the General Assembly, and the prospect of small modular reactors (SMRs) has excited them again. Many of the same legislators who busied themselves killing climate and energy bills this year insist Virginia needs SMRs to address climate change. They are more than happy to let utilities charge ratepayers today for a nuclear plant tomorrow &#8212; or rather, ten years from now, or maybe never if things go as badly here as they did in </span><a href="https://www.facingsouth.org/2019/03/institute-index-south-pays-dearly-nuclear-industrys-failed-renaissance" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">South Carolina</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/07/31/vogtle-u-s-nuclear-energy-00106597" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Georgia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/nuscale-cancels-first-of-a-kind-nuclear-project-as-costs-surge/#:~:text=The%20Oregon%2Dbased%20company%20and,for%20six%20small%20modular%20reactors.&amp;text=The%20country%27s%20first%20expected%20commercial,to%20the%20advanced%20nuclear%20industry." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Idaho</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More cautious lawmakers say if Dominion or APCo wants to go all in on an unproven and risky technology like small modular reactors, they should shoulder the expense themselves and only then make the case for selling the power to customers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion has achieved a terrific success rate with boondoggles over the years. (See, e.g. its </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2020/03/05/the-wise-county-coal-plant-should-never-have-been-built-why-fight-to-keep-it-open/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">coal plant</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Wise County, spending on a </span><a href="https://powerforthepeopleva.com/2014/03/10/2014-legislative-session-ends-with-modest-progress-on-solar-not-much-else-to-brag-about/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">North Anna 3</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reactor that was never built, and the so-called </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2021/10/18/dominion-attorney-general-and-scc-staff-reach-deal-in-contentious-rate-case/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rate freeze</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, followed by the also-lucrative legislation undoing the rate freeze.) By now you’d think more legislators would have joined Team Skeptic. But as always, utility donations and lobbyists’ promises are the great memory erasers. So once again, the General Assembly voted to </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/03/07/virginia-lawmakers-pass-competing-proposals-to-encourage-small-modular-reactor-development/?emci=368f4409-0bdc-ee11-85fb-002248223794&amp;emdi=0364953a-7adc-ee11-85fb-002248223794&amp;ceid=340786"><span style="font-weight: 400;">allow ratepayer money</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to be spent on projects that may never come to fruition. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year APCo is in on the act as well. Two bills, one for </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB1491" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">APCo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the other for </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB454" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, will allow the utilities to charge ratepayers for initial work on nuclear plants of up to 500 MW. The final language of both bills requires SCC oversight and imposes limits on spending. That is, for now.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Will the real climate champions please step forward?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This round-up might leave readers thinking there aren’t many lawmakers in Richmond who take climate change seriously. Fortunately, this is not the case. Close to two dozen legislators introduced bills targeting stronger measures on energy efficiency, renewable energy, electric vehicles and utility reform. Del. Rip Sullivan, D-Fairfax, led the pack both in the sheer number of initiatives he introduced and the tenacity with which he pursued them, but he was not alone. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few Republicans also supported good energy legislation, and even, in the case of Del. Michael Webert, R-Fauquier, sponsored priority bills like the SAVE Act. With groups like Energy Right and Conservatives for Clean Energy making the case from a conservative perspective, maybe we will see progress towards a bipartisan climate caucus to build on Virginia’s energy transition. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If that sounds too optimistic, consider that the alternative right now is the near-total inaction that marked this year’s session; we just don’t have time for that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> In our Commonwealth, the </span><a href="https://www.opengovva.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Coalition for Open Government</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> helps citizens keep government operating in the sunshine all year with its </span><a href="https://www.opengovva.org/virginias-foia-resources" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FOI Citizens’ Guide</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. VCOG was founded in 1996 by a diverse group of news and civic organizations including the </span><a href="https://www.vla.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Library Association</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, where I serve on the Intellectual Freedom committee. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like newspapers, libraries draw their purpose from the </span><a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-1/#:~:text=Constitution%20of%20the%20United%20States,-First%20Amendment&amp;text=Congress%20shall%20make%20no%20law,for%20a%20redress%20of%20grievances." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">F</span></a><a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-1/#:~:text=Constitution%20of%20the%20United%20States,-First%20Amendment&amp;text=Congress%20shall%20make%20no%20law,for%20a%20redress%20of%20grievances." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">irst Amendment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> protections of free speech, freedom of the press and the rights of assembly and petition. Authors may have relied on the Freedom of Information Act for research to create the books and other publications in a library. Internet access and meeting rooms in libraries can help people organize to petition government officials. Librarians assist information seekers in evaluating as well as locating factual sources. Readers expect that they will be able to freely access the information they want through the library. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginians can turn to two Freedom of Information Acts, one </span><a href="https://www.foia.gov/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">federal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and one state. The federal law dates to 1967 and the </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title2.2/chapter37/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia FOIA</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was passed a year later. The law covers both public records and open meetings. Often people think FOIA is only for obtaining documents, but it also protects your right to attend government meetings, or know the reason why </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the meeting is closed to the public</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. To move into a closed session, a public body must publicly vote to do so, and state which part of the FOIA law permits them to meet in private. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As our Virginia law says, “The affairs of government are not intended to be conducted in an atmosphere of secrecy since at all times the public is to be the beneficiary of any action taken at any level of government.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://foiacouncil.dls.virginia.gov/foiacouncil.htm" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Freedom of Information Advisory Council</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a resource to guide officials in following the law. Its advice is needed because, in the years since 1968, the General Assembly has created many exemptions to the Virginia FOIA. Some of them exist to protect your privacy; for example, personal library use records are exempt from FOIA. Some, however, are used to protect officials from public scrutiny. That’s why we read frequent news stories about public officials trying to use a FOIA exemption to hide something — not necessarily wrong-doing, perhaps just something embarrassing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stories like those in the Virginia Mercury’s </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/category/transparency/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FOIA Friday</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> column show why we need investigative reporters backed by a news organization that’s willing to pay the bill for requested documents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VCOG </span><a href="https://www.opengovva.org/virginias-foia-resources" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">explains</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, “The government can charge for the actual, reasonable cost of locating, copying and providing the records in response to your request. You can ask the government to itemize in advance approximately how much your request will cost.” However, exorbitant estimates of the cost of obtaining a record have been used to discourage many FOIA requests. This year, if signed by the Governor, </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB324" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 324</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would put some limits on those fees. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Occasionally, submission of multiple FOIA requests appears to be intended to disrupt the regular operations of a government agency. Even so, librarians continue to be strong supporters of Freedom of Information. The American Library Association observes </span><a href="https://www.ala.org/advocacy/FOI-Day" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Freedom of Information (FOI) Day</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> annually on March 16, the birthday of James Madison, who, as the association states, “is widely regarded as the Father of the Constitution and the foremost advocate for openness in government.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Madison said in an 1822 </span><a href="https://www.loc.gov/resource/mjm.20_0155_0159/?sp=1&amp;st=text" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">letter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: “A popular Government, without popular information, or the means of acquiring it, is but a Prologue to a Farce or a Tragedy; or, perhaps both. Knowledge will forever govern ignorance: And a people who mean to be their own Governors, must arm themselves with the power which knowledge gives.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keith Weimer, Chair of the Virginia Library Association’s Intellectual Freedom Committee, agrees. “The system of public libraries and public school libraries was developed to help people arm and govern themselves with knowledge. Libraries make Madison’s vision a reality,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As has been observed many times since its founding, our form of government depends on the participation of informed citizens who vote </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who communicate with those they elect. In this major election year as we celebrate our freedom of information, remember that libraries are an essential part of ensuring that the people’s civic engagement is informed and effective. </span></p>

(Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A proposal to build an arena in Alexandria for two pro sports teams may not be dead, but it’s facing increasingly uncertain odds after Virginia legislators declined to add it to the two-year state budget they released right before the legislative session ended. The situation reflects Virginia’s perennial challenge of balancing developments to boost the state’s economic health against the will and needs of the people who live where the developments unfold.</span></p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Youngkin: legislature flouting ‘broad bipartisan support’ in excluding arena from state budget&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/03/07/youngkin-legislature-flouting-broad-bipartisan-support-in-excluding-arena-from-state-budget/embed/#?secret=E0XvOH6pG3#?secret=DJF9HYSqSV" data-secret="DJF9HYSqSV" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The arena’s exclusion from the budget “befuddled” Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who has been the biggest advocate for the plan that he designed with the billionaire whose company owns the Washington Wizards and Capitals. In response to the legislature’s rejection of the arena project, which was to be partially funded by $2 billion in state bonds stemming from your tax dollars and mine, Youngkin said in a Thursday press conference he couldn’t understand why this “truly transformative” opportunity for Virginia to reap $12 billion in economic benefits wasn’t in the spending plan. He blamed the plan’s most vocal opponent, Sen. Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, without calling her name, for being the “single roadblock” to the plan’s progress. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s true Lucas has been loudly, proudly dead set against the arena project almost since its unveiling late last year. She hasn’t been shy to share her concerns that the “GlennDome,” as she and others on Twitter called it, would have negative implications for the state’s finances and credit rating. She pointed to other priorities that billions of taxpayer dollars could be spent on, like Hampton Roads toll relief and increasing public education funding. She’s not the only one of her political peers who were skeptical of the arena plan, but perhaps more importantly, many Alexandria residents also made it clear that they don’t want the arena in their backyard. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So let me see if I can add some clarity to relieve our governor’s confusion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a community says, “We don&#8217;t want this development here,” too often, local and state governments will dismiss or ignore their opposition in the almighty name of economic opportunity. If boards of supervisors, councils, mayors or governors believe a profit will be made by inviting a corporation to settle down someplace, the promise of profit frequently trumps the opinions of the people who live there.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Look at Wegmans in Hanover County’s Brown Grove. That community said repeatedly, and clearly, that they didn’t want a huge regional distribution center built in their tiny neighborhood. Yet they —  Wegmans, incentivized by former Gov. Ralph Northam’s</span><a href="https://www.vedp.org/press-release/2019-12/wegmans" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 2019 promise of $2.35 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in state dollars to build the facility and Hanover’s majority-Republican Board of Supervisors, who welcomed Wegmans with open arms and rezoned the area to make the project possible — forced it on them anyway. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wegmans promised its $175 million distribution center would create 700 full-time jobs, and that seemed to satisfy Northam and local leaders, so much so that they tuned out the steadily louder chorus of residents’ protests and environmental justice concerns. The gargantuan center now hulks on nearly 2 million square feet in the middle of a historically Black community that has been the unwilling host of one industrial project site after the other. This kind of thing happens a lot in economically disadvantaged and Black communities inside and outside Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a woman who grew up in Brown Grove told me last year, “We’re tired of hearing how much good this [facility] is going to do for everybody, how it’s going to bring new jobs and all of that. Nobody who’s saying that will have to live with this thing in their neighborhood, they won’t have to hear it or see it or deal with the extra traffic. They say it’s good for everybody but it’s bad for us. Nobody cares, though.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Should possible benefits to many outweigh actual harm to a few?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many other examples of profits-over-people developments in communities statewide, often supported and enabled by local or state government, and the arena project would probably be one more on the list.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A</span><a href="https://www.change.org/p/stop-the-arena-at-potomac-yard" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> petition</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by an opposition group of Alexandrians has over 3,000 signatures from folks who buck the prospect of the arena becoming their neighbor. They worry the arena will worsen traffic, raise taxes, put off noise pollution, decrease property values and disrupt their quality of life, among other concerns. Those worries are valid, and if I lived there, I probably would share some of them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve been following discussions about the arena project on social media. Some in the digital courts of public opinion don’t like that Virginia lawmakers weren’t consulted about the plan earlier in its development process. Others question why they and other Virginia residents should pay for a billionaire’s big idea, and whether the actual cost of the thing would end up being more than the projected total. Again, all of those are fair inquiries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m not naive enough to believe that legislators’ decision to drop the arena deal like a hot potato is due only to their care for constituent concerns. Many are almost certainly using the issue as a political chess piece or for posturing purposes. Still, their blocking the arena also amplifies the voices, needs and desires of the commonwealth’s citizens, which is always a good thing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When, and if, the arena proposal goes away for good, it will give Gov. Youngkin a chance to focus on </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/03/04/va-democrats-fast-track-marriage-equality-gun-bills-headed-to-youngkin/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">priority issues</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that have emerged this session that, unlike the arena, impact people&#8217;s everyday lives — like raising the minimum wage, enhancing gun safety measures, making childcare more affordable and expanding access to </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/contraception-coverage-bills-head-to-youngkins-desk/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reproductive health care</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. A </span><a href="https://cnu.edu/wasoncenter/surveys/archive/2024-01-24.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">majority of Virginians</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> want a retail marijuana market, and it’s included in the state budget, yet the governor is as against it as Lucas is against the arena. It’s 2024, not the Prohibition era; maybe it would be wise to rethink his stance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s still a chance Youngkin could send down a bill that brings the arena back to life and compels lawmakers to discuss it in a special session or he could add it as a budget amendment. But arena or no, Youngkin should review what matters most to his constituents and take action accordingly. </span></p>

This, however, is precisely how the present system works. It must be changed.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m proud to have been on the editorial board that wrote the opinion piece in 2001.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Less so the fact the high cost for families is still an issue in the commonwealth. Many relatives of those behind bars are poor. Exorbitant phone fees place an extra, unnecessary burden on them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inmate advocacy and re-entry groups, as well as equity-minded state legislators, have worked to change the past parasitic formula. The current rate is a little more than 4 cents a minute; the department reduced it to that amount in 2015, the</span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/bill-headed-to-governor-aims-to-cut-prison-phone-costs/article_80c19932-d739-11ee-90b9-1f51c7b402f2.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Richmond Times-Dispatch reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Before then, the rate had been 33 cents a minute for prepaid calls, and the department had collected commissions between 35% and 41%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Sam Rasoul, D-Roanoke, sponsored a bill this General Assembly session requiring state prisons to use pay phone and debit-card calling services at the lowest possible rate.</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb801" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">HB801</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> passed both chambers easily after Rasoul’s bid to offer free calls in corrections facilities was amended.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Staying in touch with family motivates incarcerated people to engage in prosocial behavior and rehabilitation while serving their sentence and is critical to their successful re-entry into society upon release,”</span><a href="https://rga.lis.virginia.gov/Published/2022/RD500/PDF" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">noted a 2022 report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by a work group studying phone fees, among others, in Virginia correctional facilities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The increased contact with relatives benefits prisoners, their families and the public, the report added.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="u0qwu3cXov"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/02/13/va-house-panel-rejects-bills-to-boost-prison-oversight-give-inmates-free-phone-calls/">Va.

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Va. House panel rejects bills to boost prison oversight, give inmates free phone calls&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/02/13/va-house-panel-rejects-bills-to-boost-prison-oversight-give-inmates-free-phone-calls/embed/#?secret=FM6GyAC5si#?secret=u0qwu3cXov" data-secret="u0qwu3cXov" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other states even decrease the cost for these services. The report cited Illinois, which has a prison population similar to Virginia’s, for charging families roughly a penny per minute per call.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s true the situation regarding prison communication costs is better today than the unseemly treatment families in Virginia faced at the start of the 21</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">st</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> century. Back then, WorldCom Inc. –</span><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/worldcom.asp" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">which later became synonymous with accounting fraud</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – imposed a $2.25 surcharge and up to 37 cents per minute per call.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gordon-gekko.asp" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gordon Gekko</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would have been proud.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state also got a 40% commission for the punitive practice. The lucrative deal made officials slow to change the status quo. Department of Corrections bigwigs even rejected a WorldCom proposal to lower rates, The Pilot’s 2001 editorial noted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So much for compassion for the families. They pay the overwhelming amount of such costs because prisoners are limited in how much they collect for their labor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thankfully, the state no longer gets a commission on calls. It receives some money on a separate contract to provide tablets with products and services. Global-Tel Link now provides prison phone services in the state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rasoul’s legislation now heads to Gov. Glenn Youngkin. A spokesman told me by email the governor is reviewing all bills that reach his desk – a typical non-indicator from this administration of which way the guv is leaning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we want people leaving jails and prisons to reintegrate into society successfully, everyone should support policies that connect people to their families. After all, many incarcerated individuals are freed each year in Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The nonprofit</span><a href="https://www.prisonpolicy.org/profiles/VA.html#:~:text=Virginia%20has%20an%20incarceration%20rate,incarcerated%20in%20Virginia%20and%20why." target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Prison Policy Initiative</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, for example, reported that nearly 300,000 people are released from state jails and prisons annually in the commonwealth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About 95% of people incarcerated eventually return to the community at some point, Sheba Williams, founder and executive director of Richmond-based nonprofit Nolef Turns, told me in an interview.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s a benefit for the community” to maintain those familial ties, added Williams, who was part of the state work group that studied onerous prison fees. “There are vendors that will provide lower costs than what the Department of Corrections has contracted for.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rasoul’s bill “is a step in the right direction,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sandra Brandt is the longtime executive director of Norfolk-based STEP-UP Inc., which fights recidivism among former prisoners. “The rates used to be outlandish,” Brandt told me, recalling one woman who racked up a phone bill of $1,000 while contacting a relative behind bars.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rasoul’s legislation “will be a blessing for a lot of families,” Brandt continued.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This bill should be an easy choice for Youngkin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can be tough on crime while also fighting recidivism. Reducing the cost of communications is one way to do just that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With these funds and enforcement actions, we can, we must, still do more than just address this crisis. As a Board-certified physician in both internal medicine and critical care, I see firsthand the devastating impact of opioids across the commonwealth every day. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the Capitol in Richmond, legislators have advanced </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB699" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 699,</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">important legislation that would require patients being prescribed an opioid to also be provided warnings about the risks of addiction and overdose associated with opioid drugs.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Specifically, this information would include that opioids are highly addictive, even when taken as prescribed. The bill would also require that patients be provided information on any alternative treatments that may be available.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The impact of the opioid crisis on our youth is especially heartbreaking. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">My parents instilled in me the importance of education and community; everyone has dreams and aspirations, including young people. If we allow opioids to rob our youth of their opportunity to obtain an education and contribute to our community, the world loses the potential they had to offer.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s encouraging that our General Assembly representatives have moved positively on this bill.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, more than ever, with the Super Tuesday primaries tomorrow and the general election approaching, it is imperative that voters – particularly those of us who have been convicted of felonies in Virginia – check our voter registration status to ensure our voices are heard in the upcoming elections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a person whose right to vote was revoked based on a wrongful conviction, I know that voting is not a privilege; it is a fundamental aspect of citizenship that shapes the direction of our communities and our nation. As a young, single mother of three, who was burdened with the associated legal costs for something I did not do, I was forced to sit out multiple elections. Even though I never spent a night in jail nor prison, and was sentenced to five years on probation, I was banned from voting for over nine years due to my inability to pay my fines, fees and restitution. I could knock on doors and get others registered, but I could not use my voice to vote for the things my family needed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the Voting Rights Act of 1965 prohibits racial discrimination in voting, too often felony voting bans only deepen existing racial inequality. </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9930477/#:~:text=In%20the%20South%2C%20more%20than,vote%20due%20to%20felony%20convictions.&amp;text=But%20perhaps%20more%20shocking%2C%20is,were%20old%20enough%20to%20vote." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Studies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have shown that African Americans and other people of color are more likely to be disenfranchised due to felony convictions — a result of the systemic racism that plagues our criminal legal system. As a matter of fact, in Virginia, over 10 percent of Black voting age adults are</span><a href="https://www.sentencingproject.org/reports/locked-out-2022-estimates-of-people-denied-voting-rights/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> banned from voting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. I know how this feels firsthand, as I am one of several Black Virginians in my family who have had their rights taken away then restored.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As such, efforts to purge voter rolls must be scrutinized through a lens of racial equity, and every precaution must be taken to prevent the further marginalization of communities of color. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s also important to consider that banning people who have been incarcerated from voting does nothing to advance public safety or prevent crime. There is nothing safe about people not participating in our political process; quite the opposite. Research consistently demonstrates that </span><a href="https://www.sentencingproject.org/app/uploads/2023/07/Increasing-Public-Safety-by-Restoring-Voting-Rights.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">restoring voting rights for people with felony convictions can improve community safety</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, by allowing returning citizens to remain engaged in their communities and the policies that shape their lives. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For many Virginians with felony charges, the restoration of their voting rights symbolizes a second chance, a chance to reclaim their stake in society and contribute to the shaping of their communities. To strip them of this right, especially right before elections, is to deny them their full citizenship and undermine the very fabric of our democracy. In a time when the right to vote seems more fragile than ever, checking your voter registration status is a simple yet crucial action that every voter must take. It ensures that you are still registered to vote and that your voice can be heard on Election Day. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortunately, checking your voter registration status is easier than ever before. Whether you have a felony or not, taking a few moments to verify your registration ensures that you are prepared to participate in upcoming elections. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, individuals can check their voter registration status online through the</span><a href="https://vote.elections.virginia.gov/VoterInformation/Lookup/status" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Department of Elections website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or by contacting their local registrar&#8217;s office. By taking this proactive step, you not only safeguard your own right to vote but also take a meaningful stand against attempts to disenfranchise vulnerable communities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fight for voting rights is far from over, but together, we can ensure that every eligible citizen, including Virginians impacted by the criminal legal system, has the opportunity to participate in our democracy. You can check your voter registration status today, and help protect the integrity of our electoral system and the rights of all Virginians.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Together, we can ensure that democracy prevails in Virginia.</span></p>

(Baskerville)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twining unseen within the loamy soil of Richmond’s Shockoe Bottom are the stories of the enslaved who unwillingly traversed this low-lying land that once distinguished itself by the sheer volume of Black bodies it saw sold into slavery. Here, across 10 acres that rooted Richmond as the nation’s second-largest flesh market of the American slave trade, a new story seems about to begin, built on the old.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a splashy ceremony inside the cavernous upper level of Main Street Station last week, Richmond leaders unveiled before an audience of hundreds the Shockoe Project, a sprawling memorial pavilion dedicated to the hundreds of thousands of African Americans bought, sold and held there in the 19th century and their experiences as currency in Richmond’s prosperous slave economy. To call it ambitious is an understatement: The $265 million project is slated to take nearly 15 years to complete and will feature seven components that reveal the history of the site, and give it new meaning fit for a 21st century Virginia defined as much by its future as it has always been by its past.</span></p>

(Baskervill)</p></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are choosing to move forward by telling Shockoe’s complete story and by honoring and memorializing the lives of enslaved Africans,” outgoing Richmond Mayor Levar Stoney said Tuesday evening, placards of each of the project’s sites curving in a half circle along the front of the airy, glassed-in space, trains leaving and arriving at the outdoor platform a stone’s throw away. The plan proposes a 62,000 square foot National Slavery Museum, the Shockoe Institute, billed as the park’s introductory gateway housed inside Main Street Station, communal and green spaces, and then a restaurant and retail pavilion. All this, combined with existing elements including the African Burial Ground, the Trail of the Enslaved, Lumpkin’s Jail and Winfree Cottage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stoney said the Shockoe Project already has about $38 million in funding: $25 million stemming from the </span><a href="https://www.vpm.org/news/2023-05-09/richmond-budget-fiscal-2024-3billion-tax-housing-revenues" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Capital Improvement Plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ensconced in the city’s 2024 fiscal year budget; $13 million in state dollars from the Virginia General Assembly, and an </span><a href="https://www.mellon.org/grant-details/shockoe-heritage-campus-center:-transforming-richmond's-core-commemorative-landscape-20451741" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$11 million grant</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the Mellon Foundation. “We’re choosing to embrace its complete history and use its unique position to tell a national and even global story of how slavery was intricately connected to this nation’s history, economy, culture and complexity,” Stoney said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That sounds like a very worthy endeavor; yet, much of this plan we’ve heard before, expressed through various, disjointed efforts by historians, politicians, racial justice advocates, preservation organizations and local and state entities. Stoney admitted that it has been at least a decade since the first plans to illuminate Shockoe’s dark history on a grander scale were proposed. People have been debating what to do with Shockoe Bottom for much longer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former Gov. L. Douglas Wilder </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/two-decades-later-donors-wondering-what-happened-to-plans-for-slavery-museum/2012/01/27/gIQAbEPe6Q_story.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">first pitched</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the National Slavery Museum idea in the 1990s, slated for completion in 2004, with Wilder elucidating his vision of historic grandeur over and over. Not only was it never built, but the organization filed for bankruptcy in 2012 and the former governor, the grandson of enslaved people and America’s first Black governor, </span><a href="https://www.wtvr.com/2014/05/08/wilder-slavery-museum" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">then suggested</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> moving the location of his elusive entity to Shockoe Bottom, where it was also never built. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.rva.gov/slave-trail-commission/richmond-city-council-slave-trail-commission" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richmond Slave Trail Commission</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, founded in 1998, oversaw the installment of a </span><a href="https://www.rva.gov/sites/default/files/2022-06/Slave%20Trail%20Brochure.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">walking path</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that winds up from Manchester Docks through the bowels of Richmond’s slave market, allowing modern Virginians and visitors to follow in the footsteps of the bound, passing such horrors as Lumpkin’s Jail – the human holding pen appropriately nicknamed “the Devil’s Half Acre” – and the African Burial Ground (which was until, very recently, coated over with asphalt, a 20th century developmental disrespect to the sacred space which also bore witness to the </span><a href="https://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=15116" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">execution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of enslaved blacksmith and literal freedom fighter </span><a href="https://encyclopediavirginia.org/entries/gabriels-conspiracy-1800/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gabriel</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). The commission’s longtime chair, Del. Dolores McQuinn, D-Richmond, said at Tuesday’s unveiling that the group’s yearslong effort to more fully pay homage to Shockoe’s history – including plans to build a museum at the Lumpkin’s Jail site, excavated in 2008 –  has at times seemed “insurmountable.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2013, former Richmond Mayor Dwight Jones put forward a monstrous plan to build a </span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/richmond-mayor-plans-ballpark-near-site-slave-cemetery-prompts-outcry-flna2d11594917" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hybrid ballpark-slavery memorial</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Shockoe Bottom; thankfully, this very bad idea prompted public outcry and never made it off the bench. You should be sensing a theme by now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The memorial park, a foundational aspect of the Shockoe Project, comes courtesy of the </span><a href="https://www.sacredgroundproject.net/p/contribute.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sacred Ground Historical Reclamation Project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which proffered a community-led proposal for a nine-acre memorial park in 2015. Ana Edwards, a public historian, assistant professor in Virginia Commonwealth University’s African American studies department and Sacred Ground’s chair, is part of the Shockoe Project’s curatorial team. Among this esteemed group of historians whose job it is to “get the story right,” Edwards said she’s an accountability partner who has every reason to believe that this time, Shockoe’s story will be fully, finally told.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What’s different is, all of these elements have come together into a comprehensive plan,” Edwards said in a phone interview. “That&#8217;s never happened before. There’s never been so much collective cooperation on this effort before, and much of it comes directly from [the] community.” The intention that the space will emotionally, spiritually, economically and socially benefit Black people, who have so often endured social injustice in this state and country, is another key piece that is starkly different from past endeavors, said Edwards.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This Black cultural resource is for humanity, but it cannot come into being and generate revenue for the city without it benefitting the Black community. That is baked into this.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By incorporating the Trail of the Enslaved, McQuinn depicted the Shockoe Project as a new way to “leave … a legacy of truth, narrated by the living and by those who we cannot see, but who see us. Narrated from the grave.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many may doubt that the Shockoe Project can be manifested from renderings and grand pans into reality; given the history, it’s understandable if they do. But I want to believe that this project will come to fruition. I would love to take my family there, not to wallow in the suffering of our ancestors, but to show my sons part of our historic narrative as the descendants of free and enslaved Black Virginians. I want to reflect on our peoples’ strength in a space specifically designed to imbue those ancestors with the dignity they were denied in life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a state radically reshaped by the racial justice protests after George Floyd’s murder in 2020, by the monuments to enslavers finally coming down, by the </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/02/09/united-daughters-of-the-confederacys-tax-breaks-are-on-the-chopping-block-its-about-time/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">peeling away of privilege</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/01/08/biased-lending-is-a-major-barrier-to-black-homeownership-in-virginia-still/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">demands for equity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/01/12/diversity-must-be-more-than-skin-deep-in-virginias-2024-legislature/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">calls for accountability</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, maybe we’ve finally reached a moment when it’s possible to scale a $265 million mountain in a quest for long-delayed, lasting, public recognition of historic Black narratives and experiences that inform who we are today and who we can be tomorrow. The first phase of the project, the Shockoe Institute, is scheduled to open next summer; may the climb continue.</span></p>
