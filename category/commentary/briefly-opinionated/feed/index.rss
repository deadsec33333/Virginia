(Roger Chesley/Virginia Mercury)
</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aunt Louise holds a special place of honor on my Christmas card list this year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She’s the last living aunt or uncle, for that matter — following the deaths of several family elders since the start of 2023. Aunt Lou is the Washington football franchise’s biggest fan, and the 96-year-old has the Commanders’ paraphernalia and knowledge of pigskin strategy to prove it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We snail mail cards to the homes of 90 relatives, longtime friends and journalism colleagues annually, sometimes with updates on the expanding careers of our adult children. Email missives and impersonal text chains just won’t do the trick for The Boss and me.</span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2012/10/13/a-holiday-card-truly-from-the-heart-requires-paper-postage/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Mailing cards</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, even with the ever-rising costs of stamps, has been a pleasant, longstanding ritual for us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Christmas card list also represents an evolving microcosm of our lives and relationships.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Relatives and friends who are now widowed dot the lineup. We acknowledge the deceased by supporting those still living and adapting to loss.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other spots, divorces mean we send out cards to different addresses where one previously sufficed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adult nieces and nephews — we have a bunch — now receive their own cards. Before, they were lumped in with their parents. How did one-time youngsters get so old, anyway?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve become more respectful of folks who aren’t Christian, be they Jews, Muslims, from other faiths or no faith at all. They get cards touting “Happy Holidays” and notes wishing them well in the season. I’m far from offended by this inclusive practice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Families with new children crop up on the list occasionally. That’s a rarity, though, since The Boss and I have attained AARP status.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So consider this my special card to all of you, even if it doesn’t arrive in your mailbox: Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays. May you have health, happiness and peace.</span></p>

																						<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="710" height="535" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Jonas-Salk.jpeg" class="attachment-large size-large wp-post-image" alt="" style="margin-bottom: 10px;" decoding="async" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Jonas-Salk.jpeg 710w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Jonas-Salk-300x226.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 710px) 100vw, 710px" /><p style="font-size:12px;">Dr. Jonas Salk developed the polio vaccine, which has saved millions of lives. A simple story about a polio victim changed the writer’s mind. (Senator John Heinz History Center)

</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I remember, when I was maybe just 5 years old, chewing a sugar cube to ward off a horrible, deadly disease.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My father was with me in the long line some 60 years ago as we fought polio,</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2022/06/18/polio-vaccine-young-children-jfk/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">an affliction that killed people or left them paralyzed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Polio was — and to a small extent, still is — generally contracted by exposure in water that had fecal matter in it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We were in a large auditorium or maybe a community center in Washington, D.C. My dad and I each gulped down a cube that contained a weakened version of the live virus. No shots, no pain, just sweets. (An earlier vaccine developed in the mid-1950s</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2022/06/18/polio-vaccine-young-children-jfk/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">by Dr. Jonas Salk required a series of injections</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Decades ago, polio survivors often had to use iron lungs to help them breathe. Photos of the bulky metal contraptions, to this impressionable child, suggested spherical torture chambers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Polio is</span><a href="https://asm.org/articles/2024/september/polio-s-last-stand-the-global-fight-for-eradicatio" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">nearly eradicated today</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, endemic only in Pakistan and Afghanistan. Children now usually get a polio vaccine at 2, 4 and 6 months, and then a final dose at 4-6 years old, Dr. Leah Rowland, a pediatrician at Children’s Hospital of The King’s Daughters in Norfolk, told me by email.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The vaccine is “extremely effective, offering lifelong immunity of 99-100%,” Rowland said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fact that Americans rarely even talk about polio nowadays is a testament to the vaccine’s effectiveness and acceptance. It’s a huge success story.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which is why the possible elevation of vaccine critics</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/12/13/vaccines-protect-your-children-and-others-too/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2024/12/15/dave-weldon-trump-cdc-vaccine-skepticism/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Dave Weldon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — to head the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, respectively, in a second Trump administration — is so alarming.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If not outright insane.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., the chamber’s minority leader, is a polio survivor. He’s assailed Kennedy for seeking to rescind approval of the polio vaccine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Efforts to undermine public confidence in proven cures are not just uninformed — they’re dangerous,” McConnell said in a statement, according to Politico. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People my age probably have vague recollections of the earlier, unusual sugar rush of the polio vaccine. Such memories should remain ephemeral.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They won’t, however, if misguided officials encourage conspiracy theories over proven vaccines. We don’t need a resurgence of diseases that are so easily preventable.</span></p>

(Chris McGrath/Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s so simple – and soooo seductive – to sign up for offers touting cheap “teaser” rates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You know what I mean: Just $10 for a gym membership for three months. Or a free trial period from retail-order conglomerates. Online news websites are fond of introductory fees of, say,</span><a href="https://subscribe.nola.com/defaultnolanding?ofrgp_id=161&amp;g2i_source=festivals" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">$1 for six months</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The problem comes when the trial period ends.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consumers often don’t track or remember the date when the discounted rate ceases. Their credit cards automatically get billed with the higher fees. The densely laden “terms and conditions” section they clicked on earlier may explain how tough it is to cancel – but who reads all that lengthy gibberish?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortunately, a new Virginia law that took effect July 1 forces companies – if you sign up for a 30-day free trial – to inform you about cancellation options before they actually ding your credit cards,</span><a href="https://www.axios.com/local/richmond/2024/10/04/virginia-cancel-subscription-reminder-free-trials" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Axios</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reported.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del.</span><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+mbr+H340" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Michelle Lopes Maldonado</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, D-Prince William, sponsored</span><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb744" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">the bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that got overwhelming support in both chambers this year. Gov. Glenn Youngkin then signed it into law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s a ‘gotcha moment’” when subscriptions automatically renew, Maldonado told me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s not just individuals who get caught up in this. Small businesses might have licensing agreements” that are similarly onerous, she said, adding that the legislation is part of her ongoing consumer protection efforts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Raheel Sheikh, a Northern Virginia businessman, reached out to Maldonado after receiving costly automatic renewal charges from a website maintenance firm. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The legislation puts some responsibility on the vendors,” he said. “All the responsibility was on the consumers.”</span></p>
<p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/23/some-states-including-virginia-want-to-make-it-easier-to-cancel-subscriptions/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Mercury noted last month</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the commonwealth is one of several states that have enacted similar measures. The laws give more protection to people previously flummoxed by abruptly rising automatic charges.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of us – with jobs, children to feed and busy lifestyles – simply lose track of all that we’ve signed up for online and elsewhere. A survey of 2,343 adults in March</span><a href="https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/subscription-creep-costs-us-consumers-more-than-1000-a-year-cnet-survey-finds/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">by CNET</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a consumer-oriented website, found 48% of respondents said they’d signed up for a free trial of a paid subscription, and then simply forgotten to cancel it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s about time consumers got more help against these expensive costs and shady business practices.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though it might be cumbersome logistically, I hope the county approves the program. More communities should try doing something different, instead of being perennially exasperated at the sight of people begging motorists and pedestrians for money.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A special city task force recently presented</span><a href="https://legistarweb-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/attachment/pdf/2658888/Item_4-B.pdf" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">a possible project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to Prince William’s Board of County Supervisors.</span><a href="https://www.princewilliamtimes.com/news/county-supervisors-mull-hiring-pandhandlers-to-pick-up-roadside-litter/article_f0ef1d7e-2879-11ef-9e57-73629aa3e75f.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The program would pay</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> panhandlers $13 an hour to pick up roadside litter while working two, three-hour shifts a week.</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/10/20/helping-panhandlers-involves-more-than-just-easing-bans-on-begging/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve written previously</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about similar projects nationwide.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A supervisor had asked county staff to report on panhandling at intersections and businesses. Nikki Brown, a county spokeswoman, told me by email Tuesday she didn’t have statistics on how often panhandling occurs there, “but we have received several complaints and anecdotal information from our residents” and county supervisors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lack of specifics makes me wonder how bad the problem actually is in the county of nearly a half-million people. But I digress.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Estimates for such a project aren’t complete, nor is it clear who would pay for it. The nonprofit Keep Prince William Beautiful would administer it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fairfax County has run a similar program since 2019 called</span><a href="https://www.fairfaxcounty.gov/publicworks/oss" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">“Operation Stream Shield”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that employs homeless individuals to remove litter and non-native invasive plant species in waterways. However, during a brief search, I didn’t find other localities running such projects in Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A couple of laudable goals in Prince William County’s proposal stand out:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One, the county would direct panhandlers, who are often homeless, to services they need and provide work opportunities. Second, people inclined to give a few dollars to those begging would be urged instead to donate to homeless community partners, who are better equipped to help long term.</span></p>

(Roger Chesley/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marvin L. Lake – journalist, Renaissance man, holder of many professional “firsts” – was made of decidedly sterner stuff.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Otherwise, he couldn’t have withstood the racial slights and outright prejudice he fought after becoming The Virginian-Pilot’s first Black summer intern in 1966 and later,</span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2024/04/02/marvin-lake-the-virginian-pilots-first-black-reporter-dies-at-80/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">in 1969, its first Black reporter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He understood the long game, though: Rise through the newspaper ranks. Become a mentor to legions of young journalists – especially African Americans and others of color. Be a conduit between the paper and Hampton Roads’ Black community, which distrusted The Pilot</span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2007/12/16/after-41-years-diversity-fairness-efforts-stand-out/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">for its biased depictions of Black people</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They were tasks the Norfolk native relished in a career that eventually spanned 41 years at the newspaper.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He and I worked together on The Pilot editorial page from my arrival in 2000 until his retirement in 2007. I edited his public editor columns during that period – with him often saying “I’m writing it in my head” as he busted deadlines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lake, 80, died last week at his Norfolk home after a long illness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His professional “offspring,” some from as far away as California and Florida, returned to Norfolk on Tuesday. His funeral took place at a church across from Norfolk State University, where Lake had earned a bachelor of arts degree in sociology in 1967.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The roughly 200 mourners this week included a top magazine editor, a college educator and other media professionals. U.S. Rep. Bobby Scott, a Norfolk Democrat, was among the politicians who attended.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Derek Dingle first met Lake in November 1979 when he became a copy aide, or assistant, at The Pilot, he said at Shiloh Baptist Church. “Marvin became my mentor at that moment,” Dingle said, and Lake encouraged him to report and write – though he sometimes endured Lake’s exacting, tough editing via a red pen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I was close to tears!” Dingle said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a lesson Dingle learned well.</span><a href="https://www.blackenterprise.com/management/derekdingle/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">He’s been the top editor for years at Black Enterprise</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and has held other senior positions there.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.jou.ufl.edu/staff/herbert-lowe/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Herbert Lowe</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, onetime Pilot reporter and now a senior journalism lecturer at the University of Florida, told me Lake helped edit a piece he’d written long after Lowe had left Norfolk. It was an exceptional display of help to a former colleague.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kia Morgan Smith, who I interviewed by phone in Atlanta, called Lake a father figure. “It was his style, his presence. He really cared about young Black kids,” said Smith, who later worked at Black Enterprise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lake’s mentees relayed stories of tough love, consistent support and even financial help. They noted his patience and the fact he rarely raised his voice in anger.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not surprisingly, Lake earned his share of professional accolades. Among them: In 1997, he developed and edited a newspaper series, “Church Street: What Was Lost,” and narrated and hosted an award-winning television documentary, “Church Street: Harlem of the South,” about the onetime Black hub in Norfolk.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">He was inducted into the</span><a href="https://news.vcu.edu/article/inductees_announced_for_virginia_communications_hall_of_fame" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Communications Hall of Fame in 2007</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also ended several prejudicial habits in the paper. As he wrote </span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2007/12/16/after-41-years-diversity-fairness-efforts-stand-out/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in his farewell column</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a white reporter often peppered stories with comments from a “source close to the black community.” The source, Lake learned, “was a white man frequently critical of Blacks.” Treachery at its worst.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s no exaggeration to say Marvin overhauled the coverage of The Pilot and altered the trajectory of the careers of many journalists. That’s a fitting epitaph. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Readers of the nonprofit organization’s annual calendar, though, would learn just how savagely this country has treated the powerless, who often have been Blacks, Latinos and Native Americans. The day-to-day bloodshed and savagery cannot be ignored.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s why, even today, we should all fight racial stereotypes and scapegoating.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jan. 3, 1895: Nineteen Hopi leaders are imprisoned on Alcatraz Island for opposing government assimilation efforts.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jan. 13, 1904: A mob of white men lynches General Lee, who’s Black, for allegedly knocking on the door of a white woman’s home in Reevesville, S.C.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The calendar recounts events of naked terrorism. They usually were committed by whites who knew they wouldn’t be punished. The capacity for hate will shock those ignorant of America’s past – and present.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The chronology also has mini-essays detailing acts of second-class treatment, lynchings of children and</span><a href="https://minorityhealth.hhs.gov/infant-mortality-and-african-americans" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Black infant mortality rates</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span><a href="https://www.history.com/news/gi-bill-black-wwii-veterans-benefits" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.history.com/news/gi-bill-black-wwii-veterans-benefits" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 1944 G.I. Bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, for example – designed to help military veterans with housing, education and jobs – left the administration of the law’s provisions to the states. That meant Southern states, especially, were free to discriminate against Black veterans and deny them a chance to improve their lives and enter the middle class.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Feb. 23, 2020: Ahmaud Arbery, a 25-year-old Black man, is pursued and fatally shot in a south Georgia neighborhood. No one is arrested until the lack of charges sparks widespread protests nationwide.</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m writing about the calendar produced by the Montgomery, Ala., nonprofit for two reasons:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One, folks who castigate Blacks and others for failing “to pull themselves up” should understand the multitude of actions – by legal code or common practice – that prevented racial equality in America.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such steps were taken to promote white supremacy. They frequently occurred through extrajudicial terror or were promulgated through legislative action.</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/02/17/blacks-live-every-day-with-hurdles-that-former-health-chief-tried-to-diminish/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Vestiges of those incidents</span></a><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/08/23/blacks-others-shouldnt-have-to-obliterate-their-presence-to-receive-fair-home-value/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">have not been extinguished</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia-based </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/14/business/navy-federal-credit-union-black-applicants-invs/index.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Navy Federal Credit Union</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, for example, has the widest disparity in mortgage approval rates between white and Black borrowers of any major lender, according to a CNN analysis</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest bit of nonsense occurred in Newnan, Ga., near Atlanta.</span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/black-fisherman-repeatedly-confronted-white-neighbors-ask-s-rcna96310" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Anthony Gibson was approached by a woman</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> questioning why he was using a residents-only pond in his own neighborhood. The avid fisherman, who’s Black, had fielded so many annoying queries that he began posting the encounters</span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@fishingbay2ga" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">on social media</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Police were called on him at least once.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gibson told NBC News two white men fishing nearby had been dipping their poles in the pond for seven years and never been questioned – even though they didn’t live there. Fancy that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The incident reminded me of one</span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2011/02/28/incident-at-pool-is-a-reminder-of-time-we-thought-had-long-past/?clearUserState=true" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">I covered in Chesapeake years ago</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. A young Black woman who lived in a pricey subdivision was interrogated about using the private community pool there in 2009.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You don’t look like you live in the neighborhood and you need to get out,” a white official in the homeowners association told her, according to a lawsuit Brandy Hudgins filed in circuit court.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When she wouldn’t show the official her pool key, he called police. They arrived, the recent Hampton University graduate showed them her driver’s license and pool key, and police told the official to leave Hudgins alone. Her $850,000 lawsuit was later settled out of court.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marvin Chiles, assistant professor of African American history at Old Dominion University, told me Wednesday these incidents often happen in communities where middle-class Blacks and whites are just starting to live together. Biases are at play.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Many people believe that if Black people are in an affluent neighborhood, they don’t belong,” Chiles added.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/stereotypes-harm-black-lives-and-livelihoods-but-research-suggests-ways-to-improve-things/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Historical tropes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are never far from the surface, though, that paint unidentified Black people as a menacing threat. The woman in New York City’s Central Park who called 911 about a bird-watcher in 2020 made a point that</span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/nyregion/amy-cooper-false-report-charge.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">an “African-American man” was threatening her</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Christian Cooper’s video told a different story, and he had asked the woman to leash her dog in a section where it was required.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People of all colors usually have a right of being exactly where they are. Let’s cease the vengeful tattling.</span></p>

Hopefully, litigation will yield better results.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Associated Press</span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/voting-rights-felony-convictions-lawsuit-af720e316859e25b2e99ab8e69ee4af9" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">reported Monday</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the lawsuit, brought by the ACLU of Virginia and the nonprofit voting rights group Protect Democracy, alleges that Virginia’s current restoration-of-rights regimen violates a Reconstruction-era law Congress passed setting terms for readmitting Virginia to the Union.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="https://encyclopediavirginia.org/entries/an-act-to-admit-the-state-of-virginia-to-representation-in-the-congress-of-the-united-states-january-26-1870/" target="_blank">1870 Readmissions Act</a>, signed by President Ulysses Grant, bars the commonwealth from disenfranchising people other than those who were convicted of “common law” felonies during the Reconstruction period following the Civil War. Among those serious crimes were murder, arson, rape, robbery, manslaughter and larceny.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since then, the AP reported, Virginia expanded its list of felonies that carry automatic lifetime loss of voting rights, including drug offenses. And that is the root of so much of the current system’s inequity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This isn’t an argument against prosecuting those who traffic in drugs that are increasingly ubiquitous and dangerous, particularly fentanyl and the prescription opiates that have devastated massive swaths of Appalachia. If anything, efforts to interdict those drugs and punish those who distribute them should redouble.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, as the bromide goes, the punishment should fit the crime.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An 18-year-old drug runner who was convicted as a felon faces lifetime disenfranchisement in Virginia even after he has returned to society as a productive, tax-paying citizen. That’s a punishment indistinguishable from a convicted drug cartel captain. And it comes at a dismaying, racially disparate cost.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black people comprise just</span><a href="https://www.census.gov/library/visualizations/interactive/racial-and-ethnic-diversity-in-the-united-states-2010-and-2020-census.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">18.3%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Virginia’s slightly more than 8.6 million residents. Yet they account for almost half of the 312,000 Virginians — the fifth-largest number of any state — who can’t vote because of a felony conviction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia, however, is not alone. According to the FBI’s most recent</span><a href="https://ucr.fbi.gov/nibrs/2019/tables/pdfs/arrestees_race_by_arrest_offense_category_2019.pdf" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Uniform Crime Report in 2019</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Black people accounted for 32% of arrests for crimes against persons, including assault, homicide, kidnapping and human trafficking, 30% of property crime arrests (including 57% of robbery arrests, 41% of embezzlement arrests and 37% of stolen property arrests), and 28% of “crimes against society” including 26% of drug offense arrests.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black people are imprisoned at five times the rate of whites, meaning that one out of every 81 Black adults in the United States is incarcerated, according to</span><a href="https://www.sentencingproject.org/policy-brief/shadow-report-to-the-united-nations-on-racial-disparities-in-sentencing-in-the-united-states/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">a 2022 analysis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by The Sentencing Project, a nonprofit criminal-justice reform research and advocacy organization based in Washington, D.C., and the ACLU.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A state</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?212+sum+SJ272" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">constitutional amendment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that would restore felons’ voting rights was enacted by a Democratic-controlled General Assembly in 2021 and signed by then-Gov. Ralph Northam, also a Democrat. But to make it to a statewide ballot for voter ratification, constitutional amendments must pass </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">twice</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with a legislative election in between. Republicans won control of the House of Delegates and the governor’s office in the 2021 election, and the bill was</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+sum+SJ1" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">left to die in a House committee</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2022.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Three governors of both parties — Republican Bob McDonnell and Democrats Terry McAuliffe and Northam — all significantly boosted the number of felons whose voting rights were restored. In March, Gov. Glenn Youngkin announced that he was</span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/06/us/virginia-youngkin-voting-former-felons.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">ending his predecessors’ policy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of automatically granting voting rights restoration for felons who’ve completed their sentences.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Societal and racial dynamics notwithstanding, it’s an unfair, feudal arrangement that’s out of step with the majority of states. Virginia is</span><a href="https://test.ncsl.org/elections-and-campaigns/felon-voting-rights" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">one of 11 states</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with the most restrictive processes for restoring felons who’ve paid their due to full citizenship, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where’s the incentive to reform and rehabilitate, if the hope for regaining one’s dignity resides solely in groveling to the governor and beseeching his favor?

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though he never mentioned former President Donald Trump by name in the tweet, Youngkin fell in line with partisan acolytes such as South Carolina Sen.</span><a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/testy-exchange-lindsey-graham-argues-trump-stronger-after/story?id=99986555" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Lindsey Graham</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, U.S. Reps.</span><a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/what-youre-saying-just-doesnt-make-sense-dana-bash-to-jim-jordan-on-trump-declassifying-documents/vi-AA1crKZC" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Jim Jordan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Ohio and</span><a href="https://www.newsweek.com/marjorie-taylor-greene-trump-indictment-defund-doj-1806077" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Marjorie Taylor Greene</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Georgia, and unsuccessful Arizona gubernatorial candidate</span><a href="https://www.newsweek.com/kari-lake-issues-nra-warning-over-donald-trump-indictment-not-threat-1805721" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Kari Lake</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and even Trump’s fiercest primary rival, Florida Gov.</span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ron-desantis-donald-trump-indictment-classifed-documents/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Ron DeSantis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, all eager to score points with Trump’s legion of MAGA activists. Some vowed to pardon Trump if they win the presidency. Lake implied armed domestic conflict could result.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s beyond disappointing for a governor who ran and won two years ago as a sunny, hopeful and pragmatic Republican </span><a href="https://youtu.be/W_x1seKBM9I" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in the mold of Ronald Reagan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, calmly brushing aside shrill Democratic assertions that Youngkin was a closet Trumper. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, we’re left to wonder: Were the Democrats on to something?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still new to the political game, Youngkin may nurture the delusion that he can have his cake and eat it, too. He’s level-headed Uncle Glenn in zip-up vests bearing his campaign logo and talking up</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/06/12/youngkin-gets-it-right-in-stripping-degree-preferences-from-most-state-job-postings/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">commonsense reforms</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> one moment. Then he’s  cynically titillating GOP hardliners with discredited tropes about a “two-tiered justice system” afflicting a filthy-rich ex-president and, in some mystifying corollary, parents of public school pupils.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Think of it: the loudest elements of the “law-and-order” party now falsely assert that justice on a national scale is a tool of deep-state leftists intent on persecuting conservatives, all because a former president with a record of</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/01/24/trumps-false-or-misleading-claims-total-30573-over-four-years/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">gratuitous, habitual lying</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is held to account.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their attacks are bereft of substance, predicated mostly on </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">what-aboutism</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">: “What about President Joe Biden, who was found to have unsecured classified documents in his Delaware home dating to his vice presidency?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The difference so far is there is no suggestion Biden tried to hide and lie about the documents to the National Archives or to a grand jury, as Trump is alleged to have done repeatedly. And if the Biden classified documents investigation by special counsel Robert Hur finds incriminating evidence against the president, I am confident that he, too, will be (and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">should</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> be) charged.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some Republicans have refused to go along with the orchestrated gaslighting, including former governors and now Trump primary rivals</span><a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4046308-haley-says-trump-incredibly-reckless-if-charges-in-indictment-are-true/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Nikki Haley</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of South Carolina, </span><a href="https://youtu.be/agYgBHbeRBw?t=22" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asa Hutchinson</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Arkansas and</span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/09/us/politics/chris-christie-trump-indictment.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Chris Christie</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of New Jersey as well as Trump’s own attorney general,</span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/anafaguy/2023/06/11/former-ag-barr-shocked-by-trump-document-charges-if-even-half-of-it-is-true-hes-toast/?sh=3bb54e0582d3" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Bill Barr</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu, who took himself out of the presidential race recently, said in an interview: “I’m actually surprised the other candidates running against him for president are not more aggressive about calling [it] out for what it is. It’s a huge problem — and mostly, it’s a huge problem for the Republican Party.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin also could have also followed the more discreet example of other GOP leaders such as Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky or Minority Whip John Thune of South Dakota and just kept silent on Trump’s indictment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was an especially dumb tweet in Virginia, where Trump lost both presidential bids and where voters punished Republicans who sought statewide office throughout Trump’s candidacy and his White House years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2021, I and many others hoped Youngkin’s victory was a template for a new, better and more honorable post-Trump GOP. The governor unraveled that Friday morning in just 73 words.</span></p>

So it was no surprise that, as The Washington Post reported,</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2023/05/16/black-communities-excess-deaths/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">African American communities suffered an excess 1.6 million deaths</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> compared with white populations over the past two decades.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What shocked me, though, were these lines in the article: “The shorter life expectancy of Black Americans means they do not derive what they have invested in Social Security. People born in 1960 can start receiving their full Social Security benefits at age 67, but </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hus/2018/004.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Black men born that year had an average life expectancy of just 61 years.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those facts are extremely personal to me:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was born in 1959. I began earning a regular paycheck – and thus contributing to the payroll tax – at 16 (thank you, Burger King).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neither my father nor my two older brothers lived past 70. Yet my maternal grandfather, a farmer from Prince Edward County, reached 102 and was physically mobile and mentally sharp throughout his life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Discerning how long I’ll live is a crapshoot. Life expectancy in Virginia decreased during COVID-19, and the pandemic “exacerbated long standing health disparities,” </span><a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/content/uploads/sites/110/2022/05/EPI-Report-Life-Expectancy-in-VA-5-4-22.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the state’s Department of Health. Regarding Social Security, though, I may have paid into a system the odds suggest I won’t fully benefit from, to paraphrase The Post.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve declined to take program benefits so far because of investments and savings I share with The Boss, my no-nonsense, shrewd spouse. The longer I delay, the more I can earn at my full retirement age, just shy of 67. I’d earn even more if I hold off ‘til  age 70.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The differences are substantial. If I began taking cash today, I’d be getting just 79% of the amount at full retirement and 63% of the monthly benefits at 70.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s one way to look at it. The other is a debate Michelle Singletary, the decades-long personal finance columnist at The Washington Post, and her husband waged among themselves –</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/get-there/wp/2018/01/08/early-or-late-one-senior-says-ignore-the-conventional-wisdom-of-waiting-to-take-social-security-take-it-at-62/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">and in the newspaper</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He wanted to take Social Security benefits at age 62 because it would take many years to make up for the cash lost from delaying until age 70.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since The Boss is 60, if I die before collecting she “could be eligible for a surviving spouse benefit,” Shawn Fordham, a spokesman for the agency, told me. Other categories of family survivors who could get the money that individuals earn</span><a href="https://www.ssa.gov/pubs/EN-05-10008.pdf" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">are on the Social Security website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some folks, though, might face circumstances</span><a href="https://www.ssa.gov/benefits/survivors/onyourown.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">limiting the amount of cash to survivors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Or maybe they have no close relatives who would qualify. “If there are none, those funds remain a part of the trust fund to pay current beneficiaries,” Fordham noted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The conversation about when to cash out is crucial, especially for African American men and families.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Better to get 79% of something, instead of 100% of nothing.</span></p>

I am not an alumnus of his school. To the best of my recall, I have never been on GMU’s campus in Fairfax. But I applaud Mr. Washington.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He did what many leaders in academia are unwilling to do these days: He stood up to demands to bar a speaker whose positions many on his campus abhor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The speaker in this case is the governor of Virginia, Glenn Youngkin. After he was invited to be GMU’s spring commencement speaker, a student launched an</span><a href="https://www.change.org/p/oppose-youngkin-as-gmu-commencement-speaker" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">online petition</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> calling for the governor’s invitation to be rescinded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the grounds posited in the petition were his administration’s advancement of policies that limit rights of trans people, that restrict access to literature and that suppress racial equity in  public school curricula. Those actions, the petition asserts, result in “historically marginalizing communities comprising Mason,” and asks Washington to exercise an official, preemptive “</span><a href="https://www.mtsu.edu/first-amendment/article/968/heckler-s-veto" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">heckler’s veto</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” on the petitioners’ behalf.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I get it. I have voiced objections to all of those policies. The actions against trans people – particularly students – are, in my estimation, wrong and mean-spirited. I understand how they cause real angst, anger, hardships and emotional harm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The First Amendment, however, prevails over hurtful, hateful, sometimes even </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">inciteful</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> speech, as the U.S. Supreme Court</span><a href="https://www.mtsu.edu/first-amendment/article/728/village-of-skokie-v-national-socialist-party-of-america-ill" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">has</span></a><a href="https://www.mtsu.edu/first-amendment/article/55/de-jonge-v-oregon#:~:text=Society%2C%20public%20domain)-,In%20De%20Jonge%20v.,combined%20with%20conduct%20or%20action." target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">ruled</span></a><a href="https://www.mtsu.edu/first-amendment/article/425/terminiello-v-chicago#:~:text=the%20Associated%20Press)-,In%20Terminiello%20v.,for%20making%20inflammatory%20public%20comments." target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">repeatedly</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In a society that values free expression, Youngkin has every right to speak, including at Virginia’s largest state-supported university.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">America, sadly, is a culture that increasingly accepts demands to shut down protections that the First Amendment affords us all, especially from radicalized and growing segments of both the political left and right.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The headlines are packed with stories of school boards </span><a href="https://www.windsorweekly.com/2023/03/10/isle-of-wight-county-schools-bans-teaching-on-systemic-racism/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">muzzling a truthful accounting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in public school history curricula of the historical mistreatment of African Americans and the</span><a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/14-books-being-removed-from-spotsylvania-school-libraries/3317248/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> banning of books</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that discuss subjects of gender and sex.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">College campuses, traditionally havens for the free exchange of ideas, informed inquiry and robust debate, are not exempt. The Foundation for Individual Rights in Education reports that students</span><a href="https://www.thefire.org/student-censorship-and-academic-growth-paradox-higher-education" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">increasingly support disinviting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> speakers from their campuses. It found that Democratic students were 19 percentage points more likely than Republican students to concur that there are times when speakers should be canceled. Last spring at the University of Virginia, the charge to disinvite former Vice President Mike Pence came from none other than the campus newspaper, the</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/04/18/when-a-student-newspaper-calls-for-banning-campus-speech-basic-freedoms-are-threatened/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Cavalier Daily</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s put aside the fact that a public university has no legal or moral business taking sides and censoring a public policy debate absent a credible threat of violence. There’s a more practical argument against silencing disfavored speech: it doesn’t work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No one is being forced to accept what Youngkin says. But what harm comes from listening firsthand to what the speaker is actually saying? How does one effectively rebut a speaker’s assertions without understanding them?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, nothing prohibits opponents from peacefully expressing their own views. The same constitutional right that protects the speaker allows opponents (even graduates in their robes) to turn their backs in protest. People can distribute literature or hold a news conference contradicting a speaker’s points. They can boo or, more unsettling, meet applause lines with cold silence </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">— </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">all under the media’s unblinking eye.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And what is to be gained by denying a speaker a campus forum where he or she can be challenged face-to-face? Those interested in what the speaker would say can easily find it on the internet, often in forums free of the dissenters’ balancing arguments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Calling for adversarial speech to be silenced is lazy and counterproductive. Competing in the marketplace of ideas with your own concepts is hard but it works. It comes down to how much you really believe in the might and merit of your argument.</span></p>

Otieno, 28, died of asphyxiation after a group of deputies and Central State Hospital workers piled atop his shackled body following a mental health crisis Mar. 6. (Samantha Willis/The Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Within the cavernous sanctuary of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">First Baptist Church of South Richmond on Wednesday, hundreds of mourners viewed a vignette of Irvo Otieno&#8217;s brief life. Photos and videos showed him sporting a wide grin alongside classmates and football buddies. His rich baritone voice rapped lyrics to a song he&#8217;d written about his love for his family. Altogether, these elements gave a glimpse of who he was, and who he could have been, had his life not been smothered out of him on the floor of a mental hospital a few weeks ago.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yuxu-1iYzSI" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The funeral</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> started almost an hour late; the delay gave me time to ponder how many premature deaths like Otieno&#8217;s — the tragic deaths of Black people who perished at the hands of people entrusted to uphold public safety — I&#8217;ve covered in the last decade. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the choir sang, &#8220;God is my rock, hope of salvation, a strong deliverer; in Him will I always trust,&#8221; and the crowd erupted in shouts of praise, I saw again the faces of those </span><a href="https://interactive.aljazeera.com/aje/2020/know-their-names/index.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lost ones</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in my mind&#8217;s eye. Michael Brown of Missouri, Tamir Rice of Ohio, Breonna Taylor of Kentucky, Philando Castile of Minnesota, Eric Garner of New York, George Floyd of Minnesota, Marcus-David Peters of Virginia. I saw Otieno&#8217;s mother Caroline Ouko and scores of relatives staring at his casket covered in white flowers, pain painted on their faces, and I asked myself why.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why was Otieno asphyxiated to death, shackled and sprawled on that hospital floor, 10 people having piled atop him? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why did Virginia&#8217;s Marcus Alert system not prevent this tragedy that stemmed from Otieno&#8217;s mental distress? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why was Otieno treated as a criminal and not someone in desperate need of medical help? And, even if Otieno had been a criminal, as </span><a href="https://twitter.com/MercuryVirginia/status/1638982623778291712" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">some fools on Twitter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are quick to allege, why would that justify his indecent, barbaric death? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Will one of my brown-skinned sons meet the same fate as Otieno one day? Will my husband, father, uncles or loved ones? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How many more of these tragedies will happen, how many more Black people must needlessly die, before a change comes? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Civil rights leader Rev. Al Sharpton posed some of these same questions during his delivery of Otieno&#8217;s eulogy and asked one directly of Gov. Glenn Youngkin too: &#8220;Mr. Governor, on your way to wherever you&#8217;re going, what about Irvo?&#8221;</span></p>

Al Sharpton delivered the eulogy at Irvo Otieno&#8217;s funeral at First Baptist Church of South Richmond on Mar. 29. (Samantha Willis/The Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The governor, who did not attend Otieno’s funeral but sent two members of his administration instead, proposed a </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/12/14/youngkin-proposes-230-million-behavioral-health-overhaul/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$230 million mental health overhaul plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this budget cycle. While sweeping, it includes no specific provisions to address the types of mental health crisis situations that seem to leave a lot of Black folks dead. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So here’s another question: If legislators fund the &#8220;Right Help, Right Now&#8221; plan, will it be enough?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sharpton called for an &#8220;Irvo Law&#8221; at the funeral that sounded great but brought up a bit of bitterness in me. We already have a </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/02/09/in-virginia-people-suffering-mental-health-crises-too-often-become-felons-when-police-intervene/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">law that is supposed to help people like Irvo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but it didn’t save his life. We need a real solution, and</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it must start with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">police, medical professionals, lawmakers and everyday citizens seeing, affirming and valuing the humanity of Black people every day, in every way. </span></p>

I treasured them for the same reason I loved fishing poles: they meant time spent hunting or fishing with my dad, granddad or uncle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guns didn’t scare me because I respected them. I was taught early that they are not toys and drilled on how to use and store them safely. I’ve done that as a father to two sons of my own, both now grown, when they were old enough to hunt and own a shotgun.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I was young, gun-owners’ organizations devoted more time and resources to shooter education than to lobbying for essentially unrestricted, universal access to even the deadliest war weapons.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, with the modern Republican Party as the gun lobby’s groveling footman, even modest, common sense gun safety legislation is shredder fodder when GOP lawmakers get their hands on it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s happening now in the Virginia General Assembly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/01/31/most-gun-storage-bills-appear-doomed-in-virginia-general-assembly/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Mercury reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this week,</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB2350" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that would require households in which children reside to safely store their firearms is dying before Republican-dominated committees in the House.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill by Del. Marcus Simon, D-Fairfax, was a sensible response to a 6-year-old boy who allegedly took a legally purchased 9 mm handgun from his home and shot his teacher in an elementary school classroom in Newport News. A similar bill that passed the Senate likely faces the same fate in the House.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We can speculate all day about why Newport News school officials didn’t find the gun despite multiple warnings that the child had it in his possession at school.</span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/lawyer-for-teacher-shot-by-6-year-old-student-says-administration-failed-to-act-on-warnings-that-boy-had-a-gun/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">A lawsuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the wounded teacher, Abigail Zwerner, plans to file against the school district is likely to yield some damning answers. The child is too young to prosecute. No charges have been brought against his parents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond speculation, however, is that if a child so young could get his hands on the weapon, take it to school and shoot someone, it was </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">not</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> secured.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are more guns in America than there are Americans to shoot them,  but there’s far  less accountability. Efforts to compel some accountability get buried in absurd rhetoric that casts “good, law-abiding and responsible gun owners” as victims.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They’re not victims; they’re heroes, and they have nothing to fear from these bills. My father, granddad and uncle were imminently responsible gun owners who would bristle at such implied victimhood.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The only people who should fear this legislation are adults who can’t  – or </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">won’t</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – keep their weapons out of small children’s hands.</span></p>

I eagerly tore open the envelope the credit reporting firm sent me.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Would the check be a cool $125,</span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/16/opinion/equifax-settlement.html?searchResultPosition=4" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">as the feds originally touted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in helping reach the class-action settlement? Or, given the humongous number of claimants, something much, much less?  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company’s inattention to detail led to a massive</span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/22/business/equifax-breach-settlement.html?searchResultPosition=3" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">data hack in 2017.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The intrusion compromised the personal data of 147 million people – nearly half the U.S. population.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I had to file a claim and keep abreast of developments. It took several years for the payouts to start. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2019,</span> <a href="https://www.vpm.org/news/2019-07-22/virginia-consumers-get-4-million-in-equifax-data-breach-settlement" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">then-Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> said that, despite knowing about a key vulnerability in its software, Equifax didn’t fully patch its system or replace software that monitored its network for suspicious activity.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was among 4 million Virginians affected.</span> <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/28/payments-from-equifax-settlement-over-2017-data-breach-are-going-out.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our names, birthdates and Social Security numbers were imperiled,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> though</span><a href="https://www.equifax.com/newsroom/all-news/-/story/equifax-statement-on-distribution-of-benefits-by-the-court-appointed-third-party-settlement-claims-administrator/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Equifax still says</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> there’s no proof the data “has been sold or used.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ll see. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Would the settlement check let me go on a mini-shopping spree? Or could I barely afford a combo meal? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drum roll: It was a measly $5.21.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Class-action lawsuits like this one, with millions of plaintiffs, usually mean individuals receive negligible amounts. Besides, the lawyers representing the class get a major cut.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A $425 million consumer restitution fund was established as part of the Equifax settlement, but the “fine print”</span> <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/equifax-settlement-payment-explained-data-breach-2022-12" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said just $31 million was being used for reimbursements</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If more than 248,000 people submitted claims – a tiny percentage of 147 million – payments would be lower than $125 to each person. Folks could opt for free credit monitoring instead. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I tried reaching Kenneth Canfield in Atlanta and Norman Siegel in Kansas City, two of the attorneys representing consumers as part of “class counsel.” I wanted to know, in part, how much they received. Neither responded to my messages by Tuesday afternoon.  </span></p>
<p><a href="https://topclassactions.com/faqs/who-pays-legal-fees-in-a-class-action-lawsuit/#" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A legal website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> noted plaintiffs’ counsel often “receives 25 to 33 percent of the amount of damages as their attorney fees.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A spokeswoman for Equifax directed me to a company</span> <a href="https://www.equifax.com/newsroom/all-news/-/story/equifax-statement-on-distribution-of-benefits-by-the-court-appointed-third-party-settlement-claims-administrator/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">statement on the disbursements</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the</span> <a href="https://www.equifaxbreachsettlement.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">settlement administrator’s website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You bet I’m cashing the check.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And cursing Equifax for its cavalier and cheap response to data security. </span></p>

(SDI Productions/Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state Attorney General’s Office doth protest too much.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Victoria LaCivita, spokeswoman for Attorney General Jason Miyares, says the Virginia NAACP owes the office’s lawyers and other employees</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/11/29/after-9-5k-foia-bill-naacp-releases-records-on-virginias-election-integrity-unit/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">“an apology”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for reputedly “groundless attacks” about starting a 20-person election integrity unit to root out voting irregularities.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She and Miyares shouldn’t hold their breaths. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The NAACP blasted the unit at a news conference this week after obtaining documents about it under the Freedom of Information Act. The integrity unit is “a public relations ploy to pander to election deniers and conspiracy theorists, who are the real force undermining public confidence in our elections,” said NAACP Virginia President Robert N. Barnette Jr.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He and other critics are right. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Context here is essential:  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Miyares created the office </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">after </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">insurrectionists had attacked the U.S. Capitol in early 2021 while attempting to overturn the presidential election results. Donald Trump had incited his supporters after repeatedly lying about Joe Biden’s victory.  </span></p>
<p><a href="https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-voting-rights-florida-georgia-4db14ddccf37e4597cb9b7f20ec499b4" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia is one of three states</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that created special units after the 2020 election, all involving </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican governors, attorneys general or legislatures. Their “discoveries” of wrongdoing have been negligible – especially given the total number of ballots cast. They haven’t uncovered systemic problems, the Associated Press reported. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, a 2021 state audit in Virginia</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/03/31/audit-overwhelmingly-confirms-virginias-election-results/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">verified Biden’s comfortable win</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the commonwealth. Similarly, an</span><a href="https://www.13newsnow.com/article/news/politics/elections/audit-results-2021-virginia-election/291-e1964eb2-1edf-4fff-a668-9b09a8b3f656" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">audit this year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found the 2021 statewide results – in which Miyares and other Republicans won – accurate, too.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state unit is prosecuting a former top election official in Prince William County over</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/10/07/top-prince-william-election-official-says-hes-quitting-amid-dispute-with-local-gop/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">misconduct allegations.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> But its creation is overblown given the lack of electoral problems in Virginia.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The unit was both a restructuring of resources already existing in the office,” LaCivita told me by email Thursday, “and a fulfillment of a campaign promise, because Virginians expressed concerns to him about our elections as he traveled across the Commonwealth.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If those concerns are irrational, though, should they be indulged? Isn’t it better to proclaim the system’s reliability and accuracy, as obviously is the case?  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">True, the AG’s office has often noted Virginia’s election system is strong – as Miyares wrote in a</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/10/19/jason-miyares-election-integrity-unit-virginia-fair-elections/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Washington Post op-ed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in October. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was no widespread voter fraud in Virginia or elsewhere in the country,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Too bad the attorney general neglected to say that in</span><a href="https://www.oag.state.va.us/media-center/news-releases/2452-september-9-2022-attorney-general-miyares-announces-new-election-integrity-unit" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">the Sept. 9 announcement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the unit’s start. The omission was glaring. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, what other units will his office create when there’s scant evidence of wrongdoing? Miyares “believes in being proactive, rather than reactive,” LaCivita wrote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That tack strains credulity. You don’t investigate a nonexistent problem – unless you’re politicizing it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is pandering to a populace that’s disinclined to listen to facts. This sop to election deniers harms democracy and undermines election workers. The unit should be disbanded. </span></p>

</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several Republican officials around the country, including at least two in Virginia, are now saying publicly the party should cut ties with or disavow Donald Trump, the former president and de facto boss of the GOP. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hooray for this “come to Jesus” moment.</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/11/10/virginia-winsome-sears-trump/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/11/09/why-a-firebrand-virginia-republican-says-its-time-to-divorce-trump/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Tim Anderson</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Virginia Beach assailed Trump’s influence after their party’s lackluster performance in last week’s midterm congressional elections. (Earle-Sears and Anderson won their current seats last year.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just don’t kid yourselves about why some GOP leaders – finally – want a divorce from Trump. It’s not because of some newly found valor. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Au contraire</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rather, they fear Trump will drag the party down further as he continues to influence the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">entire </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">electorate – not just his sycophants. He already was an albatross for Republican candidates in the 2017 and 2019 General Assembly elections here in Virginia.  </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/11/13/1136103595/the-midterms-didnt-produce-a-wave-heres-what-thats-meant-historically" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite midterm results that historically favor the party not in the White House</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the U.S. Senate will remain in Democratic Party control.</span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/2022-election-results-house-races-democrats-majority/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The House of Representatives</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> won’t have a huge Republican majority, if at all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other Republicans who recently criticized Trump – or urged him to delay announcing a 2024 White House bid until after the Senate runoff in Georgia – include</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/11/11/trump-criticism-midterms-republicans/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mike Lawler, who won a U.S. House seat in New York state. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plenty of opportunities to repudiate Trump for his unhinged, racist and anti-democratic comments arose before. GOP elected officials usually remained silent, either because they didn’t want to risk alienating the base, or wholeheartedly supported the former president.  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans repeatedly gave Trump a pass, one that went beyond the usual partisan politics. That stance has been an affront to democracy and common decency. Many Republicans continue to be his apologists.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump deserves the intraparty criticism, but it should’ve happened years ago. There’s nothing courageous about it now. </span></p>

(Photo by Rob Carr / Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Washington’s NFL franchise – beset by</span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/washington-commanders-nfl-sports-business-football-3777ecab91f68e3fbbb0c1f62db8d088" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">investigations against the owner</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, complaints of a toxic culture in the front office and constant mediocrity on the field – wrote a bounced check for a 50-50 raffle it sponsored</span><a href="https://www.commanders.com/community/5050-raffle" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">to support its charitable foundation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s a perfect metaphor for the Washington Commanders (former name a slur) under the incompetent stewardship of Daniel Snyder. As a native Washingtonian, I’ve rooted for the once-proud team for more than half a century. That devotion has become tepid since Snyder bought the franchise in 1999.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drew Shipley, a season ticket holder, won a 50-50 raffle in September, only to learn later that the</span><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/commanders-5050-raffle-winner-says-teams-check-bounced-after-he-tried-to-cash-it/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">nearly $15,000 check bounced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. A team spokesperson said it was “a bank error” and that money was then wired to Shipley’s account. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These accidents happen, sure. It would’ve been forgivable if Snyder’s shiny plaything hadn’t been the culprit.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His fragile ego is such that staffers at FedEx Field, the Commanders’ home stadium, told fans</span><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/commanders-ask-fans-to-put-away-sell-the-team-signs-during-home-game-vs-packers/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">they couldn’t raise their “Sell the Team” signs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> during the Oct. 23 game. The organization said signs </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">must be “handheld, event-related, in good taste, and cannot obstruct another guest&#8217;s view.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For fans, maybe it was the allegations of</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2022/10/17/dan-snyder-dc-attorney-general-investigation/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">sexual harassment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> against team cheerleaders and women working in the organization. Or claims of </span><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/d-c-attorney-general-set-to-take-action-against-commanders-owner-dan-snyder-per-report/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">underreporting ticket sales</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Or Snyder’s frequent </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2020/12/29/dwayne-haskins-daniel-snyder-washington-football-team/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">meddling in personnel decisions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, with lousy results. The franchise even faced complaints</span><a href="https://washingtoncitypaper.com/article/238813/patriot-games/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">it sold peanuts from an airline that had gone out of business months earlier</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s gross.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snyder won’t go easily. An ESPN report, citing owner, league and team sources,</span><a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/34778123/washington-commanders-owner-dan-snyder-claims-dirt-nfl-owners-roger-goodell" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">claims Snyder has secrets on other NFL owners</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, making it tougher for them to force him out. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He should do himself, the rest of the league and long-suffering fans a favor and sell the team willingly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mr. Snyder, it would be one of the most honorable things you could do since buying the franchise.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goodness knows all the disrepute you’ve already caused. </span></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong / Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another case of likely racial discrimination in housing appraisals has cropped up, this time in Baltimore.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/18/realestate/housing-discrimination-maryland.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The New York Times</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> recently reported a Black husband and wife first received an appraisal of $472,000. After they “whitewashed” their home – removing family photos and having a White colleague stand in for them as the “owner” – a second appraisal came in at $750,000. That’s nearly $300,000 more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The process is infuriating for Black and brown families. It’s also exhausting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why does such bias persist? Why can’t people get what’s due?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The account of Nathan Connolly and Shani Mott is one of dozens that have gained media attention in recent years. Similar allegations have occurred in</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/12/06/black-couple-home-value-white-washing/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">California’s Bay Area</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="https://www.indystar.com/story/money/2021/05/13/indianapolis-black-homeowner-home-appraisal-discrimination-fair-housing-center-central-indiana/4936571001/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">central Indiana</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://www.wcpo.com/news/our-community/this-black-familys-home-appraisal-grew-by-92-000-after-they-removed-all-signs-of-their-race" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Cincinnati</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s very humiliating to strip yourself of your own home,” Connolly told The Times.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Appraisals often are subjective. Still, these stories suggest something more than chance is afoot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Federal statistics show nearly</span><a href="https://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat11.htm" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">98% of property appraisers are White</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The percentage, and the comments from Black homeowners, raise questions about bias. The Fair Housing Act of 1968 says it’s illegal to discriminate in appraising residences.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Homeownership is a key way to pass down wealth to future generations. When the housing industry shortchanges property value, it harms families depending on an unbiased review.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A</span><a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/devaluation-of-assets-in-black-neighborhoods/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">2018 Brookings Institution study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> noted that “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">owner-occupied homes in Black neighborhoods are undervalued by $48,000 per home on average.” It studied 113 metro areas with at least one majority-Black neighborhood. In Virginia, the areas were Virginia Beach-Norfolk-Newport News, Lynchburg, Richmond and Roanoke.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not that African Americans have been able to rely on equity when it comes to housing policies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The nation’s history is littered with racism in the market. This includes redlining,</span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/11/17/1049052531/racial-covenants-housing-discrimination" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">restrictive covenants</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and a</span><a href="https://www.commonlit.org/en/texts/how-the-gi-bill-s-promise-was-denied-to-a-million-black-wwii-veterans#:~:text=The%20GI%20Bill's%20Effect%20on%20Black%20Veterans&amp;text=Some%20could%20not%20access%20benefits,delivered%20on%20the%20bill's%20promise." target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">GI Bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that in practice denied mortgages and home loans to Black veterans.</span><a href="https://t4america.org/2020/12/07/four-recommendations-to-undo-the-damage-of-urban-renewal/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Urban Renewal projects</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, including highways, often destroyed Black communities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vestiges of those decades-old policies remain today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Isabel McLain, a research and policy analyst for Housing Opportunities Made Equal of Virginia, said Monday she didn’t have exact statistics on how often under-appraisals occurred in the state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">we understand that racially biased appraisals are a systemic problem in Virginia, based on national studies that have included or reported on Virginia communities,” she noted by email.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McLain cited, for example,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">a Freddie Mac report released in 2021 that </span><a href="https://nationalfairhousing.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2022-01-18-NFHA-et-al_Analysis-of-Appraisal-Standards-and-Appraiser-Criteria_FINAL.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">underscored biased devaluations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Researchers found a large portion of appraisers valued homes in majority-Black and majority-Latino neighborhoods below the contract price at rates much higher than they did for homes in majority-White neighborhoods.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These disparities were not driven by a few appraisers but reflect widespread trends across the profession, including appraisers in Virginia,” she noted. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blacks, Latinos – heck, everybody – just want to be treated fairly when it comes to housing. Numerous anecdotes and data indicate race in housing remains a fault line, one that hinders wealth and progress for people of color. </span></p>

The project ultimately disintegrated in 2009.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/government/local/dp-nw-king-william-reservoir-land-20220724-tyklqpkpzfd4xoqvdzugcsdtc4-story.html" target="_blank">The city of Newport News has begun selling off the nearly 1,500 acres it acquired</a>, but at just a fraction of the $8.3 million it paid for the land with public money. The city spent a total of $51 million on the overall project.</p>
<p>Talk about taking a bath.</p>
<p>I was on the (Newport News) Daily Press editorial board from 1998 to 2000, when the momentum was still strong to build the the 12.2 billion gallon reservoir. The board was a vocal, steadfast supporter of the public works project, despite the numerous groups that lambasted it. The latter included the Mattaponi tribe, environmentalists and residents in the area.</p>
<p>Newport News Waterworks is the city-owned regional supplier of drinking water. A colleague of mine used to joke that agency officials loved visiting board members because we were some of the few friendly faces waterworks officials encountered back then.</p>
<p>Their pleas, though heartfelt, were very speculative: We desperately need this guaranteed water source for residents. New businesses won’t come here without it. Better safe than sorry.</p>
<p>Looking back, I question whether my board colleagues and I were too dismissive of the legitimate concerns from detractors. They included the possible overestimates of water needed this century; the destruction of more than 400 acres of wetlands, which would’ve been the largest authorized in <a href="https://www.southernenvironment.org/news/newport-news-scraps-the-king-william-reservoir/" target="_blank">Virginia since the Clean Water Act of the 1970s</a>; and the impact on cultural sites important to Native Americans.</p>
<p>Hindsight, you know.</p>
<p>As it turns out, energy-efficient appliances, like toilets, reduced water consumption. <a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/opinion/article_ccc3e5be-b722-5986-b7cc-f86af653a31e.html" target="_blank">The opening of a desalinization plant</a> in the area in the late 1990s also helped. As The Virginian-Pilot just reported: “By the time the project ended in 2009, officials realized that the demand for water in the region was less than it had been in the late 1990s, according to waterworks director Yann Le Gouellec.”</p>
<p>The early estimates weren’t malicious, just wrong. Bureaucrats want to safeguard utilities as vital as drinking water, electricity and more. Besides, you can’t always predict the future from decades beforehand.</p>
<p>That’s important to recognize – for government officials and residents alike.</p>
<p><em>This story has been corrected to note that Newport News spent $8.3 million on the land acquisition. The remainder of the $51 million went toward project development costs.</em></p>

<p>Defendants and prisoners sought him out after other lawyers rejected their cases. Coggeshall represented people who faced insanely long prison terms based on their crimes.</p>
<p>The 71-year-old Connecticut native, who died earlier this month from cancer, didn’t claim his clients were innocent. Rather, Coggeshall questioned whether the justice system was more focused on vengeance, and he spotlighted the inequity of the inordinate sentences.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/news/columns/article_b8e8ba56-eb90-5ed9-861d-3a95fe270365.html" target="_blank">I wrote about one of his clients, Travion Blount, when I was a Virginian-Pilot columnist</a>. Then 15, Blount committed several crimes while at a house party in 2006. The teenager was sentenced to six life terms and 118 years for weapons violations.</p>
<p>His co-defendants, who were older, only got double-digit sentences.</p>
<p>As I wrote about Blount in 2013: “He&#8217;s one of several prisoners in the commonwealth sentenced to life without parole for a crime other than homicide and committed while a juvenile.”</p>
<p>Coggeshall won three conditional pardons on one day in 2018 from outgoing Gov. Terry McAuliffe. They included Blount and Lenny Singleton. All three are African-American — another sign of <a href="https://www.americanbar.org/groups/young_lawyers/publications/after-the-bar/public-service/racial-disparities-criminal-justice-how-lawyers-can-help/" target="_blank">the disparate racial treatment between Whites and Blacks</a> in arrests and sentencing in America.</p>
<p>Singleton, for example, was sentenced by a Norfolk judge to two life terms plus 110 years in prison for a week-long spree of robberies. He stole a total of $550; injured no one; and was unarmed in all but one robbery — that time with a knife. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/05/us/mass-incarceration-drug-offenses-zero-tolerance-prisons.html?searchResultPosition=3" target="_blank">The Navy veteran and college grad</a> was addicted to crack at the time.</p>
<p>Singleton told me Monday, in an interview from Tulsa, Okla., he couldn’t fathom the harsh sentence after the crime spree in 1995 – the same year the commonwealth abolished parole. Singleton said he had thanked the detective after his arrest, because he knew he needed help.</p>
<p>Singleton’s wife, Vandy, had reached out to Coggeshall seeking his legal skills. She ended up working with him nearly a decade, assisting with pardon petitions.</p>
<p>“You’re talking about a great human being who cares, who fights for the little guy,” Lenny Singleton told me. Yet, “he didn’t want people to know how soft his heart was.”</p>
<p>Coggeshall would want this: <a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/news/vp-nw-travion-blount-release-anniversary-20210226-gv24e4tbmzdr3bul2xzkmfmy2i-story.html" target="_blank">a return of parole in Virginia</a>. And a re-examination of the harsh sentences meted out by judges.</p>

Parker Michels-Boyce for the Virginia Mercury</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No one is shocked that Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears refused to say new gun restrictions are needed in the wake of the mass slaying at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, last week. After all, </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/05/25/virginia-lg-scheduled-to-speak-at-nra-fundraising-event-in-texas-this-week/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">she posed with a military-style rifle in campaign mailers while running for office in 2021</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For staunch believers in gun rights, the firearms can </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">never</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> be the problem. Even if the cognitive dissonance is galling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earle-Sears, a Republican, addressed a women’s luncheon at the National Rifle Association’s annual conference in Houston. It’s in the same state where last week’s horror occurred. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While decrying the deaths, she trotted out several red herrings to avoid blaming guns for the carnage. Among them:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We took prayer out of schools,” she said – even though students can still do so privately in public schools. Besides, the U.S. Supreme Court </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/01/16/796864399/exclusive-trump-to-reinforce-protections-for-prayer-in-schools" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">banned school-sponsored prayer more than a half-century ago</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">; it’s not a new phenomenon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have emasculated our men,” Earle-Sears added – as if the 18-year-old man who killed 19 young students and two teachers could’ve even defined the word.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Fatherless homes,” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“countless Black men murdering each other,”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and more were in her speech. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They are indeed societal problems. But so is the easy access to guns across the country. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all, </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2018/06/19/there-are-more-guns-than-people-in-the-united-states-according-to-a-new-study-of-global-firearm-ownership/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">we have more firearms than people in the United States</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It’s nothing to be proud of.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The NRA, the premier gun rights organization in the U.S., </span><a href="https://www.vpap.org/donors/137269-national-rifle-association/?start_year=all&amp;end_year=all" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">has donated the bulk of its $1.26 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Virginia to Republican candidates and committees, according to the Virginia Public Access Project. The organization, its members and other pro-gun advocates hold vast influence with the GOP in Congress, thus ensuring gun-control bills rarely become law. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s the case, even though </span><a href="https://twitter.com/nytopinion/status/1530942435932655622/photo/1" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The New York Times on Sunday graphically noted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> how many mass shootings involved attackers who </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">legally</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> obtained the firearms they used to kill, maim and cause immeasurable grief. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They included the assailant in Uvalde, who was eventually killed by authorities. He couldn’t even legally buy beer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A quote </span><a href="https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/upton_sinclair_138285" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">attributed to Upton Sinclair</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> comes to mind whenever these mass shootings occur: “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends upon his not understanding it.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican lawmakers know thousands of people die annually by gun violence. They know the NRA gives them buckets of money and holds sway with right wing voters. They know the group fights virtually every attempt at restricting ownership and usage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So for Earle-Sears – and many other Republican politicians – it can never be the guns. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They don’t dare speak the name.</span></p>

Kennedy Hyannis Museum</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> … </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Past the solemness and respect owed to a family that lost three men in service to America – in a wartime explosion and two assassinations that altered U.S. history …</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And past the images of JFK, toting around a gaggle of his nieces and nephews in something akin to a long, large golf cart, eliciting giggles all around … </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Visitors to the Massachusetts center learn the more things change, domestically and globally, the more things stay the same.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Boss and I toured the small Cape Cod museum while visiting our oldest daughter, who just relocated to the area. The exhibits and photos taught us more about Joseph Jr., sometimes called “the forgotten Kennedy,” a young Navy pilot killed during World War II. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A video narrated by respected broadcaster Walter Cronkite relays how the family compound in the area served as a remote White House during JFK’s frequent trips there. The numerous Kennedy offspring, children of JFK and his siblings, ride horses in part of the footage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My wife and I were young children when JFK and Robert F. Kennedy were shot dead – the former while president in 1963, the latter while trying to secure the Democratic Party nomination in 1968.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was also struck, though, by a couple of incidents in a detailed timeline of JFK’s brief presidential tenure in the early ‘60s. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In mid-1962, Southern segregationists </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2020/02/29/809740346/the-cruel-story-behind-the-reverse-freedom-rides" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">lured about 200 Black people North</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> by bus, including to Hyannis. It was a cynical, mean-spirited scheme to protest Northern civil rights activists traveling South to integrate buses and bus terminals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Northern-bound Blacks were told jobs, housing and a presidential welcome awaited them. It was all a lie. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/26/us/politics/abbott-immigration-texas-dc-biden.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">in protesting the Biden administration’s immigration policies this year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, has bused migrants from the border to the nation’s capital to try to sow chaos. The stunt has had mixed results.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The second event was the Cuban Missile Crisis, which thrust the United States and the then-Soviet Union to the brink of nuclear war. Those tense days in October 1962 ended </span><a href="https://www.history.com/topics/cold-war/cuban-missile-crisis" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">when the Soviets agreed to </span><span style="font-weight: 400">remove the missiles</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> after the U.S. promised not to invade Cuba, which it had tried unsuccessfully to do the previous year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Today, Russia has invaded its neighbor Ukraine attempting to seize the country. The United States and other allies have supported Ukraine with military and humanitarian aid – placing the two nuclear superpowers on a perilous course. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The museum, thus, is a somber history lesson. And a distressing warning. </span></p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why should anyone believe Alex Jones ever tells the truth? He’s an execrable conspiracy theorist, huckster of dietary supplements and vile tormenter of parents who lost children in the Sandy Hook massacre.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/nation-world/vp-nw-infowars-bankruptcy-20220418-fhbtsdvsozd5fnkqdri33s5yyu-story.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jones&#8217; Infowars site filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> recently in Texas, delaying civil litigation while his business reorganizes its finances. He claimed Infowars, based in Austin, has assets of only $50,000 or less and possible liabilities of $1 million to $10 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Believe that if you want. Jones, a serial provocateur, has zero credibility. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He’s also made news in Virginia – most of it outlandish.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://news.yahoo.com/judge-delays-alex-jones-trial-162351660.html?fr=sycsrp_catchall" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Texas judge</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last week pushed back a trial over how much Jones should pay the Sandy Hook families, after Jones called the 2012 killings a hoax; 20 first-graders and six educators were shot dead. The violence was very real to the relatives who buried them, who wept for them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The families said they were subjected to continued harassment and death threats because of Jones’ nonsense. The relatives already have won defamation lawsuits against him.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jones, belatedly, said he believes the shootings occurred. And isn’t that special, given all the torment he helped unleash on those families in Newtown, Conn.? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I asked John G. Merna, a Virginia bankruptcy attorney, what the filings mean. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The companies Mr. Jones put in bankruptcy either over-leveraged, meaning they took out too much debt, and revenues would not support payment of the debt and continue operation,” Merna said by email Thursday. “Or revenues dropped, thereby no longer supporting the existing debt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A Chapter 11 restructuring does not necessarily mean creditors don&#8217;t get paid. It does mean that Infowars and the other companies of Mr. Jones are seeking to reduce what they pay their creditors in order to continue operations.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, </span><a href="https://dailyprogress.com/news/august12/alex-jones-settles-unite-the-right-defamation-lawsuit/article_042e5c1c-ac6f-11ec-8816-bf61361681b0.html?eType=EmailBlastContent&amp;eId=44444444-4444-4444-4444-444444444444" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jones settled a defamation lawsuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for $50,000 filed by a witness of the 2017 Unite the Right car attack in Charlottesville. Former U.S. Foreign Service officer Brennan Gilmore had seen and filmed the deliberate crash that killed a counter-protester and injured others. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gilmore said Jones and others had spread conspiracies about him, leading to death threats against him and his family. Defendants including Jones and Infowars admitted defaming Gilmore.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then there was Jones’ stunt in early 2020, in which he traveled around Richmond in a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/local/infowars-founder-alex-jones-joins-virginia-gun-protest/2020/01/20/471b2ef6-fcde-4867-b229-085bdcf23b1a_video.html" target="_blank">what looked like an armored vehicle</a> and spoke through a bullhorn before a gun rights rally. He criticized the Democratic Party as “degenerate” and said rally supporters gathered “in defiance of the globalist tyranny and their attempts to trigger a civil war.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jones deserves whatever condemnation – and financial judgments – are levied against him. </span></p>
