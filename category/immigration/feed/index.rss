Apartment rent has fallen in major metropolitan areas around the U.S. over the past six months according to findings from The Wall Street Journal.  (Brandon Bell/Getty Images)</p><p>A recent immigration surge brought newcomers to every state this year, helping to offset a continued drop in U.S. births while contributing to a national upswing of about 3.3 million new residents, according to new U.S. Census Bureau estimates.</p>
<p>Texas and Florida continued to dominate state population growth, together adding more than 1 million people from mid-2023 to mid-2024 and making up almost a third of the nation’s population increase. The state numbers include births, deaths, immigrants and residents moving from other states.</p>
<p>Nationally, this year’s population growth was up from the 2.8 million increase in 2023 and the 1.9 million boost in 2022, according to state population estimates released Thursday.</p>
<p>The population jump — the largest single-year increase since 2001 — was buoyed by a 21% increase in net immigration.</p>
	<div class="newsroomSidebarContainer ">
	<div class="newsroomSidebar">Virginia saw a 0.9% increase in its population from July 2023 to July 2024, according to U.S.  Census Bureau figures, with 76,510 newcomers arriving in the commonwealth in that time.</p>
<p>Of that growth, 73.4% was due to immigration, with 56,155 migrants moving here over the same time period.</div>
	</div>
	
<p>Immigration has become a more significant factor in population changes, making up all or almost all the growth for 18 states in every part of the country this year, according to an analysis of the data by William Frey, a demographer for the Brookings Institution, a left-leaning think tank.</p>
<p>“This points up the importance of immigration, not just to a couple of big states but to a broad swath of our country,” Frey said. “It’s going to be very welcome in a lot of places that would not be gaining many people or [would be] losing people because of lower fertility and higher deaths.”</p>
<p>Immigration grew in every state, ranging from an increase of about 69,000 people in Florida and California and 57,000 in Texas, down to a few hundred in Montana and Wyoming. The growth in the immigrant population ranged from 19% in Alaska to 36% in Montana.</p>
<p>California and Illinois were among states that had lost residents earlier in the decade, and their growth over the past year could help both stem expected losses in congressional representation after the next nationwide census in 2030.</p>
<p>If the growth continues, it would trim California’s loss to three seats in the U.S. House of Representatives instead of four, and Illinois could lose one seat instead of two, said Kimball Brace, a Virginia-based redistricting expert.</p>
<p>Florida, where growth has slowed slightly, could gain one fewer congressional seat than predicted — three instead of four, he said.</p>
<p>“Clearly immigration is coming into play — a couple years ago you had people talking about California going off the deep end [with population loss] and now it doesn’t look so deep,” said Brace, president of political consulting firm Election Data Services Inc.</p>
<p><iframe id="datawrapper-chart-lc1Ro" title="Immigration sparks population growth" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/lc1Ro/6/" height="530" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" aria-label="Map" data-external="1" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></p>
<p>California ranked third in the number of new residents from July 1, 2023, to July 1, 2024, according to census estimates, with a gain of about 233,000, thanks to both immigration and people moving in from other states. The Golden State was followed by North Carolina (165,000) and New York (130,000). Illinois grew by about 68,000 and Louisiana by about 9,700.</p>
<p>Florida and Texas also were the leaders in percentage change, growing about 2% in that year, followed by Utah (1.8%), South Carolina and Nevada (both up 1.7%), and Idaho and North Carolina (both up 1.5%).</p>
<p>Only three states had population losses for the year, of a few hundred people each: West Virginia, Vermont and Mississippi.</p>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" title="“5 Southern states had most of the nation’s population growth” — Stateline" src="https://stateline.org/2023/12/20/5-southern-states-had-most-of-the-nations-population-growth/embed/#?secret=2GFSGOZpH2#?secret=nvaSVLIAUj" width="500" height="432" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" sandbox="allow-scripts" data-secret="nvaSVLIAUj" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></p>
<p>In Texas, the cities of Houston, Austin and Dallas added the most new housing last year — almost 40,000 new units among them — and are likely to be the centers of new population growth, according to a <a href="https://www.demographics.texas.gov/Resources/TDC/Presentations/6d12aaac-2724-4c5e-861e-6bc84f200cfa/2023_EstimatesWebinar.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">state report in November</a>. Collin County, a Dallas suburb, is also one of the state’s fastest growing areas, with more than 16,000 new housing units added last year and almost 64,000 since 2020, according to the report.</p>
<p>Florida’s recent growth was concentrated in Jacksonville, Port St. Lucie, Miami, Tampa and Orlando, according to a <a href="https://edr.state.fl.us/Content/population-demographics/reports/econographicnews_2024_Volume%201.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">state report this year</a>.</p>
<p>A surplus of births over deaths helped most in New York, California, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan.</p>
<p>New York City has built more housing, which helped stem net losses from people moving away, said Jan Vink, a senior extension associate at Cornell University’s Program on Applied Demographics.</p>
<p>That’s encouraging news for the state’s future, Vink said. In November, the <a href="https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2024/11/stark-population-decline-projected-nys" target="_blank" rel="noopener">university estimated</a> that New York’s population could shrink by as much as 2 million people over the next 25 years because of low fertility rates and aging, unless those losses are offset by new arrivals in the form of immigration or people moving from other states.</p>
<p>Texas, the Carolinas, Florida and Tennessee had the largest numbers of new residents moving in from other states, though the numbers were down in all those states from the previous year as high interest rates and housing prices led more people to postpone moves.</p>

Glenn Youngkin speaks at an early vote rally in Chesterfield on Oct. 26, 2024. (Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ahead of his annual budget presentation to lawmakers next week, Gov. Glenn Youngkin on Thursday announced a <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/embargo-dec-12.pdf">proposal</a> to block state funding from any locality implementing a “sanctuary city” policy and “refusing to comply with federal law to deport” undocumented immigrants who have committed a crime. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The term sanctuary city refers to localities that choose to have limited or no cooperation with the U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If adopted in the final state budget, the Department of Criminal Justice Services director will be required to withhold from sanctuary city localities state funding that is usually earmarked for local police departments. The Compensation Board will also be required to withhold state per diem payments to local and regional jails. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposal would also require local law enforcement and jail officials to provide notification to ICE 48 hours ahead of the release of  immigrants lacking permanent legal status who have committed a crime. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s administration noted a recent </span><a href="https://wjla.com/news/local/virginia-crime-herndon-virginia-man-arrest-repeat-offender-sexual-assault-rape-case-denis-humberto-navarette-romero-united-states-immigration-deportation-ice-illegal-immigrant-migrant-washington-old-dominion-railroad-trail-investigation" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">of an immigrant man in the U.S. illegallywith a previous criminal history who allegedly raped a woman on a running trail in Herndon, court documents show. Youngkin’s announcement also pointed out an instance this summer in Fairfax County where an undocumented person suspected of sex crimes against minors was </span><a href="https://wjla.com/news/local/fairfax-county-virginia-immigration-detainers-ice-services-migrants-undocumented-child-sex-crimes-tim-kaine-hung-cao-deportation?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">not detained</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A handful of cities and counties in Virginia have adopted policies to stop f law enforcement and municipal staff from voluntarily inquiring about a person’s immigration status, including  Arlington, Alexandria, Fairfax County and the city of Richmond. While most of the policies do entail compliance with ICE as federally mandated, they outline how municipal staff don’t need to make extra efforts to identify people who are potentially here illegally. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, Arlington’s 2022 Trust Policy states that the city “will comply with all applicable federal or state regulations mandating cooperation with ICE and other federal immigration</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">officials &#8230; but will otherwise restrict sharing of personally identifiable information that could be used to further immigration enforcement efforts.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A 2017 </span><a href="https://www.wtvr.com/2017/02/06/stoney-policies-of-inclusion" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">directive</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Richmond mayor Levar Stoney, however, entails noncompliance with ICE. Richmond City Jail and a few others around Virginia were listed as “non-compliant institutions” in an ICE report from June 2024. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of late November, according to the DCJS, nearly 1,000 incarcerated people in Virginia have had open immigration detainer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order for Youngkin’s proposal to take effect, it will need to be approved by the state legislature during 2025’s state budget negotiations. </span></p>

Main Street businesses are “storefront shops that help keep downtown areas vibrant.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Virginia immigrants generate $104 billion of economic output in the state, according to the study. Immigration to the state creates more job opportunities for more consumers, workers and business owners, which benefits U.S.-born workers.</p>

<p dir="ltr">“Immigration reform might be the one best thing that can be done by Congress to expand the American economy,” Democratic candidate Kaine said at the debate. “We need to protect the border and we need to have the workforce America needs going into the future.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Kaine said the mass deportation of over 10 million immigrants proposed by former President Donald Trump’s campaign would devastate the economy.</p>

It did not pass in either chamber, nor did a more recent <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/02/04/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-calls-on-congress-to-immediately-pass-the-bipartisan-national-security-agreement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/02/04/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-calls-on-congress-to-immediately-pass-the-bipartisan-national-security-agreement/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1730738906446000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1hFvWdktUs63D1hcHiim3r">effort</a>to help secure the border, which started with bipartisan support.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump ended the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy in 2017 and enacted a Muslim travel ban in 2018 that the U.S. Supreme Court overturned. If elected, he promised to complete the Mexico-U.S. border wall he started in 2018.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Virginia immigrants want reform and opportunity</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Several people who immigrated to Virginia told VCU Capital News Service they want reform and opportunity, something they hear about more from the Democratic Party.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Valesca Bonilla immigrated to Virginia from Honduras and is a member of CASA in Action, an organization which advocates for legislative change at the statehouse. The Democratic Party is receptive to the community and immigration reform, she said.</p>
<p dir="ltr"> “The more numbers we are, the better we are together,” Bonilla said. “If we don't try to educate ourselves and educate others and come together, we’re not gonna make it.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Bonilla said immigration reform begins with small steps, such as a smoother process for worker permits and more temporary protected status, or TPS, allowances for migrants whose native countries are considered unsafe. This program grants the ability to live and work in the U.S. for a fixed period of time, and is something Kaine has <a href="https://timkaine.com/issues/fighting-for-immigrant-communities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://timkaine.com/issues/fighting-for-immigrant-communities/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1730738906446000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3bnS0FPWHt5yaXfcOJ7_5O">defended</a> in the Senate.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Hector Joya, a Salvadoran immigrant, said programs like DACA and TPS are essential to immigrants in the country. There needs to be more programs that can help expand visa accessibility. He is an organizer with CASA in Action.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Joya cannot vote. But, he said immigrants can lean toward the Democratic Party because it is more receptive to immigrant needs and presence. Other voting groups should consider immigration policy because of the strong economic contributions from immigrants, he said.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Naturalized citizens not unified voting bloc</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Gabriela León-Pérez, an assistant professor of sociology at Virginia Commonwealth University, immigrated to the U.S. from Mexico. The U.S. has always been dependent on immigrant labor and not only in lower-skilled jobs, but also highly skilled jobs in fields like STEM.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“That is how Mexican immigration even started in the late 1800s, because of active recruitment of cheap labor,” León-Pérez said. “Not only are immigrants contributing to society in economic and labor terms, but also culturally, in the arts. There are many areas that immigrants play an integral role in society.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Her current research project asks immigrants what they would like the public to know about them and many set the record straight, she said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“They want people to know that they're not here to take jobs and that they're here to work and to contribute to society,” León-Pérez said. “Immigrants actually complement the U.S.-born population because the types of jobs that immigrants hold are different from the ones that the U.S.-born population holds, so, rather than taking away, they're complementing each other in the labor market.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, León-Pérez said it can be difficult to generalize policies that all immigrants hope for because it varies based on country of origin, class, legal status and how they arrived. León-Pérez believes naturalized citizens can’t be perceived as a voting bloc because of how varied the group is, she said. There is a wide range of political beliefs, although people think they’re more Democratic leaning.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“There’s a growing population of Latinos who support the Republican Party, so can’t really say that immigrants as a whole or even different racial, ethnic groups, support a specific political party,” León-Pérez said.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Former delegate and immigrant says: ‘Vote’</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Elizabeth Guzman, a former Democratic delegate who represented Prince William and Fauquier counties, is a naturalized citizen. On Election Day, a candidate’s stances on immigration guide her vote, she said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump previously made comments that immigrants poison the country and accused them of taking American jobs, according to <a href="https://www.themarshallproject.org/2024/10/21/fact-check-12000-trump-statements-immigrants" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.themarshallproject.org/2024/10/21/fact-check-12000-trump-statements-immigrants&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1730738906446000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1PJcgk0oAryYBjb_U45R2Q">The Marshall Project</a>. Guzman said this perception is unfair and disappointing.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We are just tired, being used for his campaign slogan but never acknowledge the contributions we have made,” Guzman said. “We are in a historic moment where we have immigrants leading government agencies … if they were given the job it’s because they were qualified to do that job and ready for that challenge.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Guzman, who is originally from Peru and a native Spanish speaker, said immigrants have to work twice as hard as their American counterparts to reach higher positions like elected office. Immigrants shouldn’t feel less American because of the color of their skin or their last name, Guzman said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We’re here to work, and we’re here to succeed and pave way for future generations,” Guzman said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Higher education should be accessible as long as immigrants pay taxes and respect the law, according to Guzman. Reform like that can increase their contributions to Virginia.</p>
<p dir="ltr">New voting generations must think about the future they want to grow up in, where everyone is treated with respect and dignity, Guzman said. Second-generation immigrants don’t want to live in a country where their tax-paying parents are disrespected and not valued.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Virginia has made it easier to participate in the election with early voting and people must decide whether they want to be a part of the solution or the problem, she said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Participate. Vote,” Guzman said. “Your vote is your voice and if you don’t participate, then don’t complain.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Election Day is Tuesday, Nov. 5. The polls will be open from 6 a.m. to 7 p.m. Same-day voter registration is allowed.</p>

Jen Kiggans faces Democratic challenger Missy Cotter Smasal this year in Virginia’s 2nd Congressional District. Both Navy veterans have been involved in their local communities for years – Kiggans as a former state senator and Smasal as a member of the Chesapeake Bay Commission. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While both women share some priorities, like reducing inflation and the costs of living, their divergence on abortion policy is something Smasal and Democrats are hoping can help flip the district. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Kiggans and Republicans hope that maintaining control of the House of Representatives can put America closer to completing former president Donald Trump’s proposal of building a wall along the U.S. &#8211; Mexico border. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smasal has the </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/virginia-congress-smasal-kiggans-hakeem-jeffries/article_955a0eac-d5bc-11ee-99ea-4f07936040ca.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">endorsement of democratic New York Rep. Hakeem Jeffries</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the likely next Speaker of the House should Democrats gain the majority there, while Kiggans </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/28/trump-rallies-in-chesapeake-backed-by-virginia-governor-gop-leaders/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">appeared at a rally in Chesapeake this summer for Trump</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and Gov. Glenn Youngkin</span><a href="https://x.com/GlennYoungkin/status/1837129505871184158" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> boosted her during a Fox News segment </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">in Virginia Beach on the first day of early voting. They’ve also both had helping hands from </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/27/national-dems-to-ship-2-5m-to-state-parties-aiming-beyond-presidential-battlegrounds/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">national political groups</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Virginia’s 2nd Congressional District: Republican lean, pockets of Democratic support</h4>

	</strong></p>
<figure id="attachment_39960" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:1490px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/va02-map_supreme-court-of-virginia/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-39960 size-full" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/VA02-map_Supreme-Court-of-Virginia.png" alt="" width="1490" height="1008" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/VA02-map_Supreme-Court-of-Virginia.png 1490w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/VA02-map_Supreme-Court-of-Virginia-300x203.png 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/VA02-map_Supreme-Court-of-Virginia-1024x693.png 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/VA02-map_Supreme-Court-of-Virginia-768x520.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1490px) 100vw, 1490px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Virginia Congressional District 2 (courtesy Supreme Court of Virginia)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A drive along Route 13 on the Eastern Shore shows Kiggans signs sprinkled along much of the highway, signaling the district’s Republican lean. But pockets in Northampton and Accomack went for Kiggan’s Democratic opponent Elaine Luria in 2022, as did portions of Chesapeake, Suffolk and Isle of Wight on Virginia’s mainland. Much of Virginia Beach, which anchors the district, is also Republican territory, but 51% of the area </span><a href="https://www.vpap.org/localities/virginia-beach-city-va/election-results-map/?electype=general&amp;election=10135" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">showed up for President Joe Biden in 2020</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Despite the GOP lean, the district has oscillated between the parties over the years and is among several competitive ones in Virginia and around the nation to help determine partisan control of the U.S. House of Representatives. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Candidates’ local impact</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smasal said constituent services is something that most excites her about potentially becoming a congresswoman. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That&#8217;s one of the most interesting parts,” she said. “And when I go across the district and (people) have stories for me … they remember when somebody in Elaine Luria’s congressional office helped them out.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kiggans, whose campaign did not follow through on organizing an interview with The Mercury, has kicked it local with some of her advertising. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recent digital advertisements featured the refrain “</span><a href="https://x.com/JenKiggans/status/1834947865824612859" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">that’s Jen Kiggans!</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” as people noted some of her voting records to include supporting veteran health care. Home to the largest naval base in America, veterans and active duty service members make up a sizable portion of the 2nd District. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, she supported the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/8580" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” which includes funding for VA health care programs and benefits. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Reproductive health</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As they prepare for an upcoming debate next month, a poll from Christopher Newport University released on Sept. 13 showed Kiggans with a </span><a href="https://cnu.edu/news/2024/09/13-cnu-wason/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">five point lead</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over Smasal. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also showed that surveyed voters trust Kiggans more with veterans’ concerns while Smasal is more trusted to handle reproductive rights issues like abortion access.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pew Research Center shows 55% of Virginians believe abortion should be </span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/religious-landscape-study/database/state/virginia/views-about-abortion/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in all or most cases. A top issue for Smasal, she hopes it’s key to unseating Kiggans so that she can help restore federal protections. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“People are talking to me constantly about protecting reproductive rights,” Smasal said. “It&#8217;s really the number one thing that I&#8217;m hearing from people they&#8217;re concerned about.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smasal took issue with Kiggans last year over how the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act played out when it passed the House and failed to progress in the Senate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill was part of a hullabaloo between parties with President Joe Biden’s administration </span><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/H.R.-8580-%E2%80%94-Military-Construction-and-Veterans-Affairs-and-Related-Agencies-Appropriations-Act-2025-SAP.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">opposing it</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, in part, for a provision that would revoke veteran access to funding should they need to travel out of state for an abortion if the location of their duty assignment bans the procedure. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over in the U.S. Senate Alabama Republican Tommy Tuberville </span><a href="https://alabamareflector.com/2023/12/05/tuberville-relents-on-months-long-blockade-of-most-military-nominees-blaming-democrats/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">held up military promotions in protest over the Biden administration’s VA  abortion travel policy.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> At the time, Kiggans told the media that she didn’t agree with his method but supported his reasons.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Taxpayers should not be funding elective procedures,” she </span><a href="https://www.wavy.com/news/politics/local-lawmakers-react-to-block-of-hundreds-of-military-promotions-by-alabama-senator-over-abortion-policy" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">told an NBC affiliate in Hampton Roads </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">last summer. “If I wanted to get a Hollywood nose job in California, I do not expect the Navy to pay for my travel expenses to get there.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Smasal stressed the complexities of why someone may want or medically need an abortion and how the national patchwork of state laws is creating various additional barriers for people. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don&#8217;t know how any female veteran could do that to other service women,” Smasal told Virginia Mercury in a recent interview.  &#8220;She went to Congress and voted to restrict reproductive rights, so she&#8217;s chosen to be more extreme.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>But Kiggans took aim at Smasal in a <a href="https://x.com/JenKiggans/status/1839824215807078560" target="_blank">recent video on her social media</a> and asserted that Smasal is lying when referring to Kiggans as someone who is &#8220;extreme.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the video, Kiggans cited her status as the 19th most bipartisan member of congress from a <a href="https://www.thelugarcenter.org/ourwork-Bipartisan-Index.html" target="_blank">Lugar Center and Georgetown University ranking report</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe it is an issue that should be legislated at the state level,&#8221; Kiggans added to clarify her abortion policy preferences. &#8220;I&#8217;ve always been an advocate for women to choose life, allowing for exceptions in the cases of rape, incest and the life of the mother.&#8221;</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no mention of <a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/two-women-two-pregnancies-two-agonizing-decisions/article_24e5d5fc-742d-11ee-984d-6befc702d5d0.html" target="_blank">fetal anomalies</a>, many of which are detected at or after 15 weeks of gestation.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And while Kiggans supports abortion laws being up to individual states, she has also </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/08/13/virginia-democrats-do-not-support-infanticide-but-heres-why-trump-keeps-saying-they-do/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">echoed a false claim</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that Democrats support it to “</span><a href="https://jenforcongress.com/issues/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the moment of birth.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” </span></p>
<p>On other reproductive health laws, both women have expressed support for protecting contraception access and family planning procedures like in vitro fertilization. As<span style="font-weight: 400;"> the incumbent, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kiggans has </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/4626/cosponsors" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">voted for expanded contraception access</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="http://mace.house.gov/media/press-releases/protecting-fertility-rights-urgent-legislation-addressing-deepening-concerns" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cosponsored a resolution to protect IVF</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Immigration views</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Immigration policy has featured prominently in both presidential and congressional campaigns this year. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans and Democrats tend to diverge on solutions when it comes to concerns about immigration. Republicans have favored ramping up deportations of people who enter America illegally while Democrats have proposed enhancing pathways to U.S. citizenship. This year, Democrats in congress worked with Republicans on </span><a href="https://missouriindependent.com/2024/05/24/bipartisan-border-bill-loses-support-fails-procedural-vote-in-u-s-senate/#:~:text=By%3A%20Ariana%20Figueroa%20%2D%20May%2024%2C%202024%207%3A15%20am&amp;text=The%20Senate%20bill%20failed%20to,aid%20package%20earlier%20this%20year." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">boosting funding for border security, but the efforts failed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Nobody&#8217;s done enough to fix things,” Smasal said. “Both Democrats and Republicans have failed on this issue.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, she was glad to see Democrats coming to the table with Republicans on the bipartisan border deal that was toppled earlier this year. It’s something she would have supported and something Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris has </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2024/09/10/harris-slams-trump-for-killing-border-bill-in-debate-here-are-the-facts/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said she would support</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“(Republicans in Congress and Trump) wanted the political issue (for this election) as opposed to doing something substantial to actually help address the border,” Smasal said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She stressed how supporting border security efforts can help detect drugs like fentanyl entering the country and combat human trafficking. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I firmly believe we need to be security minded,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On related legislation, Kiggans has co-sponsored the “</span><a href="https://chavez-deremer.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/chavez-deremer.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/Summary%20-%20Defending%20Borders,%20Defending%20Democracies%20Act.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Defending Borders, Defending Democracies Act.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” The </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/7372/cosponsors%5C" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which has not progressed past introduction, would suspend entry of some immigrants at the U.S. border and require asylum seekers to “remain in Mexico” during adjudication of their immigration status. </span></p>
<p>She also voted for the &#8220;<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/2/all-actions" target="_blank">Secure The Border Act</a>&#8221; which would expedite construction of border barriers. It passed the House but did not clear the Senate.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On her website, Kiggans called the rise in border crossings a “self-inflicted crisis” that is “threatening the safety of Americans and emboldening cartels, which are making massive profits off of drug trafficking and exploiting vulnerable migrants.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Addressing inflation</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a local-yet-national issue, both candidates have stressed how they want to curb inflation and rising costs of living. Kiggans’ campaign website points to her support of the </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/3746/summary/00#:~:text=This%20bill%20increases%20the%20federal,work%20requirements%20for%20federal%20programs." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which passed congress and was signed into law by the president. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smasal </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">said that addressing affordable housing is a key part of addressing the cost of living. If elected, she aims to start by championing federal legislation to prevent large corporations from purchasing housing stock and raising prices or creating more short-term rentals in places like Virginia Beach. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If everything is turned into an Airbnb, where are our teachers and our firefighters and our police officers going to find their housing?” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both women are also supportive of ways to help </span><a href="https://kiggans.house.gov/posts/kiggans-supports-bipartisan-bill-to-address-childcare-workforce-shortage" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">alleviate the nation’s growing childcare cost and access issues</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kiggans called it an “unfortunate reality” that some parents are feeling forced to leave the workforce, take on debt or tap into their savings as a result of the growing issue. </span></p>

<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Abortion</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the only state in the South that hasn’t restricted abortion access since the Supreme Court overturned Roe. v Wade in 2022, which made abortion a federal right, Virginia is a key player in the country’s reproductive health landscape. By dismantling Roe v Wade, the nation’s highest court laid the groundwork for each state to restrict or enhance access to abortion; a spate of state bans on abortion have since emerged, with 14 states making the procedure illegal. Abortion remains legal in Virginia and state Democrats will push to enshrine it as a right in the commonwealth’s constitution next year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many Republican candidates in Virginia’s congressional races assert that abortion access should be determined at the state level. In District 2, Republican incumbent U.S. Rep. Jenn Kiggans, a Navy veteran, nurse and former member of the state senate, has “consistently advocated for women to choose life, but respects exceptions for rape, incest, and life of the mother,” according to her campaign </span><a href="https://jenforcongress.com/issues/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Democratic challenger Missy Cotter Smasal, who is also a Navy veteran as well as the director of a nonprofit focused on women veterans, </span><a href="https://fb.watch/uhpo6DTiSN/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">declared herself</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “the only pro-choice Navy veteran in this race.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In District 7, anchored in Prince William County but also spanning rural parts of the state, Spotsylvania attorney and former Green Beret Derrick Anderson, a Republican, is challenging career military officer and Democrat Eugene Vindman for the seat currently occupied by Abigail Spanberger, who is running for governor next year. Anderson has expressed support for the overturn of Roe and </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/DerrickAndersonforVA/videos/my-life-story-is-pro-life-and-thats-how-i-will-serve-in-congress-my-mother-got-p/414067620643367/?locale=ms_MY" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">called himself “pro-life” while sharing on social media</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that his mother had him as a single parent at 17 years old. Vindman plans to support </span><a href="https://vindmanforcongress.com/issues/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">access to abortions and contraception along with in vitro fertilization</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In District 10, anchored in Loudoun County, Democratic state Sen. Suhas Subramanyam is running against Republican Mike Clancy to fill Rep. Jennifer Wexton’s seat. Wexton will not seek reelection due to a health issue, and endorsed Subramanyam during his democratic primary. He has supported an effort to </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+SJ255" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">enshrine abortion protections into Virginia’s constitution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and plans to support federal protections. Clancy said that he “does not support federal action on abortion.” His campaign website lists “respect life” as a campaign issue and notes his support for resources for pregnant people and families. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In District 9, incumbent Rep. Morgan Griffith faces Democratic challenger Karen Baker, a lawyer-turned-nurse. Griffith has voted against congressional efforts to protect abortion access and </span><a href="https://morgangriffith.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=402684" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">stated</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that Roe v. Wade had “produced decades of tragedy.” Baker wrote on her campaign website that “women’s choices must be respected.”</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Ksn63EC7JL"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/17/they-dont-like-abortion-but-kaines-gop-challengers-say-they-wont-seek-a-federal-ban/">They don’t like abortion, but Kaine’s GOP challengers say they won’t seek a federal ban</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;They don’t like abortion, but Kaine’s GOP challengers say they won’t seek a federal ban&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/17/they-dont-like-abortion-but-kaines-gop-challengers-say-they-wont-seek-a-federal-ban/embed/#?secret=H3VtqeFCdu#?secret=Ksn63EC7JL" data-secret="Ksn63EC7JL" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, who is seeking reelection, has co-sponsored the </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/kaine-others-reintroduce-reproductive-freedom-for-all-act/article_f6cbd514-a8a7-11ed-8ac8-e388ae499856.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reproductive Freedom For All Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which would protect access federally, now that Roe has been overturned. His Republican challenger, retired Navy veteran Hung Cao, told Virginia Mercury this summer that he </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/17/they-dont-like-abortion-but-kaines-gop-challengers-say-they-wont-seek-a-federal-ban/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">won’t support a federal abortion ban</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He has also </span><a href="https://www.hungforva.com/right-to-life/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">called himself “pro-life.” </span></a></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Housing </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Housing is an issue people experience practically and constantly, amid paying rent or mortgages. Local governments handle approvals or rejections of developments and craft zoning laws that guide development potential. But state and federal lawmakers have roles to play as well — largely through funding mechanisms or taking action where housing intersects with other policy platforms. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While many congressional candidates this year don’t have housing policy outlined on their websites, some have been talking about how they plan to help states and local governments from the federal level. The Mercury reached out to others for more details on what they would do to help with housing supply and affordability. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In District 2, Incumbent Rep. Jen Kiggans did not respond to inquiry for more details on housing policy by the time of this publication, though during her time in the state legislature as a senator, she voted in favor of the </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?212+vot+SV0271HB1889+HB1889" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Residential Landlord and Tenant Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her challenger, Democrat Missy Cotter Smasal, acknowledged the Mercury’s request for comment but did not follow through with a response in time for this publication. Her website touches on housing policy while addressing the economy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We need to stop the price gouging on groceries, and stop massive corporations from buying up houses and raising rent,” she wrote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In District 7, Democratic candidate Eugene Vindman expressed support for building more homes that middle-class families can purchase and “support programs that help first-time homebuyers buy a house.” He added that he’s concerned about out-of-state corporations buying homes that they then sell or rent at higher prices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In Congress, I will work to take on these speculators who are putting regular people&#8217;s American dream out of reach,” he said in an email. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican candidate Derrick Anderson said he’s going to focus initially on how Congress can help reduce inflation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The first thing I’d do is pass a federal balanced budget amendment – ridiculous inflationary spending drove up housing prices (and grocery costs, gas costs, etc),” he said in an email. “Let’s stop the spending and get inflation down for the sake of Virginians who are struggling to get by.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In District 10, Republican Mike Clancy could not be reached for comment by the time of this publication. His campaign website doesn’t include housing policy, but it does stress his goal of helping to reduce inflation and stimulate the economy by “unleashing American innovation” and energy as well as reducing regulations on small businesses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrat Suhas Subramanyam’s campaign replied to The Mercury’s inquiry but did not follow through with his housing policy plans should he become a congressman before publication. He has supported affordability measures as a state senator: This year he </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB597" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">co-sponsored a bill </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">to allow more Virginian localities to utilize Low Income Housing Tax Credits when approving developments, but it was vetoed by Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In District 9, Democratic challenger Karen Baker supports expansion of tax credits that can help spur construction of affordable housing available to various levels of area median income. She also wants to</span><a href="https://www.bakerforva9th.com/affordable-housing" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “work on tailored solutions that address the specific needs of rural communities,”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> like the Southwest Virginia ones she seeks to represent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his tenure as representative, Morgan Griffith has </span><a href="https://morgangriffith.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=402287" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">supported funding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> appropriations to his district meant to help with affordable housing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine has cited his early-career experience as a fair housing lawyer before he went into politics. As a member of congress, he pointed to a bill he co-sponsored, the </span><a href="https://www.kaine.senate.gov/press-releases/klobuchar-kaine-introduce-legislation-to-address-nationwide-housing-shortage" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Housing Supply and Affordability Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which would create a grant program for state and local governments to tap into. He’s also been involved with the </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/2797" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Low-Income First-Time Homebuyers Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which would establish fixed-rate 20 year mortgages for first-time buyers whose income doesn’t exceed a certain amount. Both bills have been introduced multiple times but have yet to become law. Kaine also supports expansions to Low Income Housing Tax Credits, which helps increase affordable housing supply. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine’s opponent, Hung Cao, </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/how-kamala-harris-new-policy-plan-could-impact-housing-in-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">echoes a stance of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump that ties housing issues to the U.S.-Mexico border</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“First and foremost, we need to secure the border,” Cao said in an email to The Mercury. “Everything that’s going wrong in our country right now is a direct result of our wide-open southern border. Housing costs are at an all-time high because there&#8217;s millions who were not here a few years ago for which we need to provide housing.” </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Guns</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Congress remains at a standstill as lawmakers fiercely debate the future of gun rights in America, with proponents of stricter gun control measures clashing with staunch defenders of the Second Amendment. Amid a surge in mass shootings and growing public outcry, both sides are digging in, setting the stage for what will likely be another defining battle over gun laws as the nation is headed toward the 2024 presidential election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the Senate, U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., who was governor of Virginia when the deadly mass shooting at Virginia Tech took place in 2007, co-sponsored the Virginia Plan to Reduce Gun Violence, which he said would enact the same gun safety provisions passed by the Democratic-controlled Virginia General Assembly in 2020 at the federal level. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hung Cao, Kaine’s Republican opponent, strictly opposes further legislation that he believes would infringe Second Amendment rights. Instead, Cao proposes that gun-related violence to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. Prosecutors who refuse to enforce the law must be held accountable, the retired U.S. Navy captain said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia’s 2nd Congressional District, U.S. Rep. Jen Kiggans, R-Virginia Beach, in 2023 received a 100% rating by Gun Owners of America (GOA), a national gun rights organization, and a 92% rating by the National Rifle Association (NRA) in the previous year. While in the Virginia legislature, Kiggans has voted against universal background checks, expanding red flag laws that take guns out of the hands of domestic abusers and those who pose a threat to Virginians, and against prohibiting guns in schools and childcare centers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Missy Cotter Smasal, Kiggans’ Democratic opponent, states on her campaign website that she is committed to legislation seeking to prevent gun violence, create safer communities, and prevent veteran suicide. Smasal said that there are “commonsense measures supported by large majorities of Virginians” that can make Virginia’s neighborhoods safer while also protecting individual rights.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In District 7, Derrick Anderson, the Republican nominee, has stated that Second Amendment rights are sacred and shall not be infringed upon. As a former special forces Green Beret, Anderson vows to be “a strong advocate for gun owners in the halls of Congress.” Earlier this year, the Republican turned to the social media platform X, where </span><a href="https://x.com/DerrickforVA/status/1774127722647687559" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">he said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that Americans have to “stand up for and protect our 2nd Amendment rights.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eugene Vindman, a former career military officer and the Democratic nominee, supports gun safety measures such as background checks and red flag laws to keep guns out of the hands of criminals, the mentally ill, and others who might cause harm. While he believes in the right of law-abiding gun owners to own firearms, Vindman also pushes for more legislation ensuring public safety. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Rep. Morgan Griffith, R-Salem, the incumbent in District 9, is a strong advocate for Second Amendment rights. Griffith said in a statement to The Mercury that he does not support government-mandated registrations of guns but that he backs harsher penalties for offenders who “abuse the right to have guns” by committing felonious crimes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrat Karen Baker, Griffith’s opponent and a gun owner, said she backs rigorous gun safety training for children in school. She is also pushing for enhanced gun safety laws, including tax credits for trigger locks, and she has called for enhanced mental health services for troubled individuals, and a legal mechanism to manage early reports of suspicious behaviors involving non-imminent ideation of shootings. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Across the state in District 10, constitutional lawyer Mike Clancy, the Republican nominee, has vowed to defend Americans’ constitutional rights without exception, including the Second Amendment right to bear arms. Instead of regulating gun ownership. Clancy is pushing for legislation to fully fund law enforcement to ensure law enforcement has the training and equipment to protect Virginia’s communities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During his time in Virginia’s state legislature, Sen. Suhas Subramanyam, D-Loudoun, Clancy’s opponent, has actively supported several gun safety laws, including </span><a href="https://www.suhasforvirginia.com/press-and-media/key-gun-violence-prevention-bills-from-senator-subramanyam-vetoed-by-gun-lobby-backed-governor" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">several measures which passed the General Assembly just this year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, two of which were signed by Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican. Suhas told The Mercury he believes America can achieve serious progress on this issue while respecting the Second Amendment, and without undermining the rights of responsible gun owners.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Education/Project 2025</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With divergent calls from some to eliminate the U.S. Department of Education and from others to improve teacher pay, public education is a top matter for voters in Virginia and across the nation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a Pew Research Center </span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2024/04/23/what-are-americans-top-foreign-policy-priorities/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> published in April, half of the Americans surveyed said that public K-12 education is going in the wrong direction. Some believe that schools should spend more time on core academic subjects. At the same time, communities, including those in Virginia, are sparring over what is taught in schools, particularly history, and gauging if students are falling behind in their studies and how to address that challenge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schools are also facing confrontation from parents over social issues, such as the types of books that are allowed in schools and the treatment of transgender students. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of these education issues and recommendations to address them are outlined in </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/04/what-could-project-2025-mean-for-education-in-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Project 2025</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — a conservative plan for how the country should operate if a Republican wins the White House. Some support the plan and others fear it could derail previous efforts to improve public education in Virginia.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the state’s District 2 congressional race, Republican nominee and incumbent Jen Kiggans has publicly supported</span><a href="https://jenforcongress.com/issues/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> prioritizing students&#8217; safety and security</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and equipping teachers with tools and resources to improve student outcomes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She voted for the </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/5" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Parents Bills of Rights</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a measure to “ensure the rights of parents are honored in public schools” and stands against critical race theory, a graduate-level framework that focuses on racial inequity and has not been found in Virginia curricula.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like the authors of Project 2025 and Kiggans, the Republican nominee for the District 10 seat Mike Clancy said he supports school choice. </span></p>
<p>Democratic nominee Eugene Vindman, in District 7, said he opposes book bans and the project, which he <a class="c-link" href="https://dailyprogress.com/opinion/column/eugene-vindman-project-2025-is-a-threat-to-democracy/article_709f3f3a-6a2a-11ef-927e-b310eb440bd5.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://dailyprogress.com/opinion/column/eugene-vindman-project-2025-is-a-threat-to-democracy/article_709f3f3a-6a2a-11ef-927e-b310eb440bd5.html" data-sk="tooltip_parent">sa</a>id his opponent and Republican nominee Derrick Anderson has failed to denounce.</p>
<p>Anderson said Vindman is “lying” and denied supporting the project&#8217;s proposal to eliminate the U.S. Department of <span class="c-mrkdwn__highlight">Education</span>.</p>
<p>He said he supports helping students in his home district “succeed” and will advocate for ensuring that “test scores go up and conflicts go down.”</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In District 9, Karen Baker, the democratic nominee, said she supports strengthening public schools, much like Vindman.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Baker’s </span><a href="https://www.bakerforva9th.com/issues" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">campaign website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, she supports making universal preschool “a reality for all families” in Southwest Virginia. She also supports investing in vocational education and making it accessible to the area. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Suhas Subramanyam, the Democratic nominee in District 10, said if elected, he will work to expand Pre-K, access to “critical“ job training into apprentice programs, and support providing resources to local schools to close the pandemic, learning loss gap.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He told the Mercury that if the recommendations for Project 2025 were implemented, it would “devastate” Virginia’s public education system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We must do the opposite: invest in our schools, support our parents and teachers, and make college and postgraduate education affordable,” Subramanyam’s campaign said in a statement.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Environment/Climate</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic candidates in Virginia’s congressional races largely have expressed the desire to address climate change by transitioning to zero-carbon generation sources. Some candidates differentiate themselves, like District 3 incumbent U.S. Rep. Bobby </span><a href="https://www.bobbyscottforcongress.com/the-scott-record" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scott</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who’s advocated for funding Norfolk’s flood wall to reduce sea level rise damage. District 6 contender Ken </span><a href="https://www.kenmitchellforvirginia.com/issues" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mitchell</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> highlighted a need to “transition public investments away from propping up fossil fuel companies” on his campaign site, while District 11 incumbent U.S. Rep. Gerry </span><a href="https://gerryconnolly.com/issues/environment/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Connolly</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has said he’s an advocate for environmental justice, an environmental lens that amplifies the voices and needs of overlooked and overburdened communities during development that could impact their area. District 9 candidate Karen </span><a href="https://www.bakerforva9th.com/coal-miners" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Baker </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">doesn’t address climate change on her website, but highlights a need to protect coal miners’ health.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Across the aisle, Republican congressional candidates also mostly fall in line with each other’s environmental policy views by advocating for  </span><a href="https://www.mikeclancyforcongress.com/services-5" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reducing regulations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.hungforva.com/enviornment/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">energy independence</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or promoting energy sources stemming from </span><a href="https://cline.house.gov/issues/energy/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fossil fuels</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><a href="https://sitkaforcongress.com/on-the-issues" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">nuclear</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Some candidates don’t take clear positions about their environmental policy plans. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taking unique approaches on the GOP side are District 2 incumbent U.S. Rep Jen Kiggans, who signed onto a letter with other House Republicans earlier this year asking for House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana to </span><a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/some-house-republicans-warn-against-climate-law-repeal/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">not repeal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> tax credits of the IRA, which have helped incentivize a burgeoning offshore wind </span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2024/07/09/south-korean-company-plans-to-build-681-million-offshore-wind-submarine-cable-plant-in-chesapeake/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">development</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> industry in the Hampton Roads region.

Some environmental groups say the bill includes some concessions for continued natural gas use. Whichever party gains majority control of Congress could determine the fate of that bill.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Election integrity</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Concerns over election integrity and the potential for voter fraud have sparked a renewed focus in Congress, as lawmakers from both parties debate how best to safeguard the democratic process. With allegations of fraudulent voting making headlines in recent election cycles, the issue has become a political flashpoint. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While some legislators call for stricter voting regulations to prevent potential abuse, others argue that such measures could suppress voter participation. As the 2024 election approaches, members of Congress are crafting new policies aimed at ensuring fair elections while addressing public concerns over security and accessibility.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the U.S. Senate, Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., has carried legislation such as the Freedom to Vote Act, which would implement provisions like automatic voter registration, same-day and Election Day voter registration, online voter registration, and no-excuse mail voting. Kaine has also co-sponsored the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, which seeks to restore and update crucial protections against voting discrimination that were weakened by recent Supreme Court decisions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine’s Republican opponent Hung Cao, a retired U.S. Navy captain who is backed by former President Donald Trump, has proposed few legislative means to secure the electoral process beyond a universal requirement for providing a voter ID in order to cast a ballot. But he said in a statement to The Mercury that “the only way to have election integrity is to have people watch the polls.” Cao has also suggested that the U.S. hold elections like the ones he witnessed in Iraq and Afghanistan, where people vote with their finger and blue ink. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In July, U.S. Rep. Jen Kiggans, R-Virginia Beach, who represents House District 2, voted in support of the </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/118/bills/hr8281/BILLS-118hr8281rh.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which passed in the House of Representatives by a 221-198 vote. Advocates of the SAVE Act say it would ensure that only citizens can vote in federal elections, partly by making it mandatory for states to obtain proof of citizenship to register voters and also requiring states to purge noncitizens from voter rolls. But President Joe Biden has vowed to veto the measure, stating that it would make it more difficult for eligible voters to register and increase “the risk that eligible voters are purged from voter rolls.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kiggans’ Democratic challenger Missy Cotter Smasal, who previously mounted an unsuccessful campaign in Virginia’s 8th Senate District, has talked little about election integrity legislation. But the U.S. Navy veteran has attacked her Republican opponent for being  a “big supporter of President Trump” for backing “Big Lie” conspiracy theorists in Virginia’s state legislature by being one of </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/02/24/virginia-youngkin-tax-cuts-house-senate/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">only four Senators to vote for an audit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the 2020 election that would have cost Virginia taxpayers $70 million.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Derrick Anderson, a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">former special forces Green Beret and the Republican nominee in District 7, has talked little publically about election integrity and he offers no clues about his views on his campaign website, but in </span><a href="https://dailyprogress.com/news/local/government-politics/elections/derrick-anderson-talks-biden-the-border-and-inflation-ahead-of-tuesdays-gop-primary/article_a009bd2a-2837-11ef-9cbd-0f478e969dbd.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an interview</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with The Daily Progress he acknowledged that Joe Biden is the legitimate president.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If elected, Anderson’s Democratic opponent Eugene Vindman, the twin brother of anti-Trump whistleblower Alexander Vindman, has vowed to work to pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and strengthen protections for election workers, “so that anyone who threatens a poll volunteer or election official in an attempt to undermine our vote is held accountable.” Vindman, whose family emigrated to the United States from the former Soviet Union, has also warned against downplaying the Jan. 6, 2021 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, which he blamed on a pro-Trump movement that did not recognize the nation’s norms of peaceful transfer of power and that he said undermines elections across the country to this day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Rep. Morgan Griffith, R-Salem, the incumbent in District 9, in 2023 sponsored the </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/4460" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">No Vote for Non-Citizens Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, seeking to ensure only eligible American citizens may participate in federal elections. The bill, which is still moving through the House, withholds some federal dollars that go to localities that allow non-citizens to vote in their elections. Griffith also voted for the SAVE Act. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrat Karen Baker, Griffith’s opponent, told The Mercury that Republicans have failed to provide any evidence of voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election and therefore there is no reason to believe that this year’s election will be different. Baker also stated that fears of undocumented immigrants voting are generated to induce distrust of election integrity but are absolutely without basis, and she has criticized Griffith for refusing to state that he will accept the outcome of the 2024 presidential election. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Mike Clancy, an attorney from Loudoun County and the Republican nominee in District 10, does not list election integrity as one of his legislative priorities on his campaign website, he has been outspoken on social media about strengthening election laws. “Congress must pass the SAVE Act,” Clancy </span><a href="https://x.com/MikeClancyVA/status/1811031488923586986" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said on X</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in July. “Only U.S. citizens should be voting in our elections.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State Sen. Suhas Subramanyam, D-Loudoun, Clancy’s opponent and a strict opponent of the SAVE Act, believes that “democracy is under attack” in America. The son of Indian immigrants, Subramanyam has vowed to continue to fight against “restrictive voter ID laws that are designed to suppress the vote, protect early voting to ensure greater access to the polls, and combat political gerrymandering.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Immigration</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Americans find that more migrants are turning to the United States for employment opportunities or to escape violent conflict in their home countries, among other reasons, they are increasingly interested in candidates&#8217; views on immigration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">America has become one of the most prominent destinations for migrants. However, over several years, many migrants have entered the country illegally, prompting backlash. At the same time, migrants have also been a staple of America’s workforce, including in the commonwealth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the </span><a href="https://map.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/locations/virginia/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">American Immigration Council</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, immigrants comprised about 12.6% of Virginia’s total population in 2022, and 16.2% of Virginia&#8217;s labor force.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the District 9 race, Republican nominee and incumbent Morgan Griffith said immigrants are welcome to come to the United States “legally” and share in the “American dream,&#8221; but supports “cracking down” on illegal immigration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While criticizing the House for ducking its responsibility, Democratic nominee Karen Baker in District 9 said Congress needs to pass comprehensive immigration reform. She said she supports the Senate&#8217;s template for more border control agents and asylum officers and advocates for a DACA bill to protect children who have lived in the U.S. their entire lives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the District 2 race, Jen Kiggans’ campaign said the Republican nominee and incumbent voted for legislation to increase security at the U.S. border by ensuring that federal immigration officials have the training and resources to stop the influx of illegal immigration, drugs and crime into the U.S. The measure has remained in the Senate since last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kiggans supports strict enforcement of existing federal immigration laws and holding President Joe Biden’s administration accountable. She also backed legislation to prevent the administration from using National Parks to house illegal immigrants.</span></p>
<p>Derrick Anderson, the Republican nominee for the District 7 seat, said he <a class="c-link" href="https://dailyprogress.com/news/local/government-politics/elections/derrick-anderson-talks-biden-the-border-and-inflation-ahead-of-tuesdays-gop-primary/article_a009bd2a-2837-11ef-9cbd-0f478e969dbd.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://dailyprogress.com/news/local/government-politics/elections/derrick-anderson-talks-biden-the-border-and-inflation-ahead-of-tuesdays-gop-primary/article_a009bd2a-2837-11ef-9cbd-0f478e969dbd.html" data-sk="tooltip_parent">supports</a> shutting down the border.</p>
<p>“It’s clear that the crisis at the border is hurting people right here in Virginia’s 7th District,” Anderson said in a statement. “Drugs, fentanyl, human trafficking – we need a serious change. We need to secure the border.”</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Suhas Subramanyam, the Democratic nominee in District 10, said with the U.S. immigration system being “broken,” he supports the country taking a comprehensive approach to the problem by starting with securing the border and ensuring that people who are doing “the right things the right way and contributing to our economy“ have a path to citizenship.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said the country must also fix its “broken” asylum system.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Foreign policy (Israel-Hamas conflict, China, Ukraine)</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Virginia voters are following their congressional candidates&#8217; views on common issues in the U.S., they are also considering their responses to global conflicts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a Pew Research Center </span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2024/04/23/what-are-americans-top-foreign-policy-priorities/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that was completed in April, two of the most important issues to Americans are limiting the powers of China and finding a solution to the Israel-Hamas conflict.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Americans are also interested in limiting Russia’s powers following its invasion of Ukraine in Feb. 2022.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., said he takes pride in the fact that he is among a wide slate of lawmakers President Vladimir Putin of Russia permanently banned from visiting Russia in response to his record of standing against Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine two years ago. Kaine has voted for aid to Ukraine, and earlier this year he helped pass a supplemental package that included support for the country to defend its sovereignty. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine also said he views the U.S.-China relationship as the most consequential bilateral relationship of the century. Kaine voted to pass the </span><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/08/09/fact-sheet-chips-and-science-act-will-lower-costs-create-jobs-strengthen-supply-chains-and-counter-china/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CHIPS and Science Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> designed to outcompete China by shoring up domestic supply chains and bringing manufacturing back to America. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After Hamas terrorists attacked Israeli territories on Oct. 7, 2023, Kaine has worked with Democrats, Republicans, and the Biden administration to ensure that Israel has defensive support. But Kaine has also called for a reduction of civilian casualties, supported the safe and swift delivery of humanitarian assistance to civilians in Gaza and the West Bank, and for long-term solutions to allow Palestinians and Israelis to live alongside each other in peace.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine’s Republican opponent and former U.S. Navy captain Hung Cao in a statement criticized the Biden administration and Congress for giving “blanket amounts of money” towards Ukraine’s defense effort, alleging the financial support instead helps fund Ukraine’s retired workers pension plans. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cao considers China an “existential threat” to the United States, and he has further called for the continued support of Israel, which he considers one of the United States’ closest allies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Jen Kiggans’ campaign, the District 2 Republican nominee and incumbent supports legislation to impose sanctions against China for its responsibility in the fentanyl crisis and </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/22/cosponsors" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">prevent selling any petroleum to Chinese Communist Party-controlled entities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her campaign also said she prioritizes protecting American jobs and intellectual property from being stolen by the CCP.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Derrick Anderson, the Republican nominee in District 7 and a former special forces Green Beret with six tours of duty overseas, including Afghanistan, Iraq, and various countries throughout the Middle East, told the </span><a href="https://jewishinsider.com/2024/04/virginia-congressional-candidate-derrick-anderson-military/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Jewish Insider”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in an interview in April that Congress needs to move quickly to provide additional aid to the Jewish state in its war against Hamas. He added that he was skeptical of sending more U.S. funds to the Palestinians, noting that other countries are providing aid. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like Anderson, his Democratic opponent Eugene Vindman, also a veteran, called for continued support for Israel, while asking that the U.S. continue to ensure that all the hostages — including Americans — are returned safe and sound to their families. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vindman has also pushed for the continued support of Ukraine in both military and economic terms, and for taking on China&#8217;s state-directed economic system, which he said unfairly competes in the market and compromises America’s national security. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While U.S. Rep. Morgan Griffith, R-Salem, voted for the Ukraine Democracy Defense Lend-Lease Act of 2022, which allowed the lending and lease of American defense material to the country in its defense of the Russian invasion, he also also voted to block similar legislation last year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Griffith </span><a href="https://morgangriffith.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=403045" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">has called</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> China a “dangerous, power-hungry actor” over the country’s territorial claims in the South China Sea, as well as its escalating efforts to control Taiwan, while </span><a href="https://morgangriffith.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=403086" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">criticizing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> President Joe Biden’s decision to hold an arms shipment to Israel last spring. Griffith also said that America’s dealings with other countries must be driven by a careful analysis of what best serves the United States and its citizens.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In relation to the conflict between Israel and Hamas, Karen Baker, Griffith’s Democratic opponent, has pointed out that while she acknowledged Israel’s right to exist, there are “bad acts on both sides.” Baker has also endorsed the continued financial and military support of Ukraine by the United States, </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Suhas Subramanyam, the Democratic nominee in District 10, said he supports the U.S. in opposing Russia leader Vladimir Putin&#8217;s territorial ambitions in Europe and standing up to China, which is “violating international law and illegally dumping goods to prop up their economy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also supports the CHIPS Act, which helped to boost domestic research and manufacturing of semiconductor chips.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for the Israel-Hamas war, Subramanyam said he supports the U.S. returning hostages, especially  American citizens, and helping to rebuild communities affected by the war.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also supports a two-state solution, adding that Hamas cannot be one of the states.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The human lives lost in this conflict have been devastating for all sides,” Subramanyam said in a statement. “I have visited the region, including the areas of Israel that were attacked, and made good friends there. I want to see an end to the war and a long-term path to peace.”</span></p>

<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Virginians’ views varied on presidential hopefuls’ immigration stances</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican presidential nominee and former President Donald Trump’s vision, and the GOP’s, has been to continue constructing a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and to ramp up deportations of those who’ve entered the country illegally. Democratic nominee Vice President Kamala Harris’, and  Democrats’, vision has been to enhance pathways to citizenship and address root causes that lead to spikes in migration. They’ve also attempted to work with Republicans on </span><a href="https://missouriindependent.com/2024/05/24/bipartisan-border-bill-loses-support-fails-procedural-vote-in-u-s-senate/#:~:text=By%3A%20Ariana%20Figueroa%20%2D%20May%2024%2C%202024%207%3A15%20am&amp;text=The%20Senate%20bill%20failed%20to,aid%20package%20earlier%20this%20year." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">boosting funding for border security, but efforts have failed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the state level, Republican Gov.</span><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2024/jan/24/glenn-youngkin-backs-greg-abbott-border-spat-joe-b/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Glenn Youngkin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and Attorney General Jason Miyares have been</span><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2024/jan/24/glenn-youngkin-backs-greg-abbott-border-spat-joe-b/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> critical</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the Biden administration’s border policies. Both endorsed Trump when he won primary elections this spring and both joined him when he held a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/28/trump-rallies-in-chesapeake-backed-by-virginia-governor-gop-leaders/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rally in Chesapeake</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this summer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump has an established history of false claims about immigrants. He alleged </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/29/politics/fact-check-trump-mental-institutions-migrants-doctor/index.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">without proof </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">that other countries are releasing droves of people from prisons and mental institutions to come into America, among other claims. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That rhetoric is a “desperate racist play to bring out white suburban voters,” said Del. Alfonso Lopez, D-Alexandria, who is among Virginia&#8217;s delegates who will vote for Harris at the Democratic National Convention this month. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile Loudoun County resident and longtime Republican activist Jo-Ann Chase said Trump’s hardline stance on immigration is one of the reasons she was excited to vote for him last month at the Republican National Convention as a Virginia delegate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are white, brown and Black,” Chase said of Latino and Hispanic voters, a group with which she personally identifies. A lifelong Republican, she’s spent time working on outreach for the party, particularly to Hispanic and Latino communities. She also served on Youngkin’s Virginia Latino Advisory Board. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chase said that she hasn’t been bothered by Trump’s rhetoric painting migrants from Latin countries with a broad stroke as criminals. In a speech announcing his first presidential candidacy in 2015, Trump </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/07/08/donald-trumps-false-comments-connecting-mexican-immigrants-and-crime/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that Mexico “isn’t sending their best” and that immigrants are “bringing crime, they’re rapists.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chase said it never offended her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I understood that he didn&#8217;t say that everyone was like that — but there were a lot of people like that,” she said. “And to ensure that [violent criminals don’t enter], he was going to make sure that the individuals coming across the border did it the right way.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Born in Puerto Rico, Chase has always been an American citizen, but she’s lived stateside and been active in Republican politics for much of her life. She feels the border policy during the Biden-Harris administration has been “rewarding” people for breaking the law by entering the country illegally. As she’s canvassed on behalf of the GOP over the past few months, a top concern she’s heard from potential Republican voters in Virginia is immigration policy and border security, she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former state delegate Elizabeth Guzman, who is originally from Peru, said she is excited to cast her vote for Harris at the DNC this month. Guzman said she thinks her daughters will see  Harris’ candidacy and“believe that they could be presidents one day,” since Harris is, like them, the daughter of immigrant parents. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She and Lopez said that recently, they’ve been frustrated by how Republicans are framing their party as soft on the border, because Democrats were working with them on the bill this year to bolster border security. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lopez alleged that Republicans reneging on the bill — a move that included one of its patrons — allowed immigration to remain a key talking point for Trump’s campaign, and that of congressional representative hopefuls, going into November. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s “hypocritical with a capital H” for the GOP to say “look at all this horrible stuff on the border” when they weren’t following through on a solution months prior, Lopez said</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michelle Mittlestadt, a communications director with the Migration Policy Institute, said the GOP messaging is “an expected move” given the salience of immigration for the party.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Immigration will continue to be a hot topic, regardless of whether Harris or Trump win the White House or which party controls Congress, Mittlestadt said. But, determining which parts of immigration and border security policy will take center stage is the question. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Continuing challenges, inside and outside the state</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seventy percent of new U.S. citizens last year reside in 10 states, including Virginia, according to </span><a href="https://www.uscis.gov/citizenship-resource-center/naturalization-statistics" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic lawmakers in Virginia have proposed legislation to support some of its immigrant populations, such as bills this year to allow undocumented minors access to state-funded healthcare and eligibility for careers in law enforcement to certain immigrants. The healthcare bill failed in committee and the law enforcement bill passed with bipartisan support before it was </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/news-releases/2024/march/name-1023794-en.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">vetoed </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">by Youngkin. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, U.S. immigration policy at the national level has been rather stagnant for decades. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Typically, to become a U.S. Citizen, people have to apply and have met certain criteria to continue the process. That includes having been a permanent resident in the U.S for at least five years — or in other words, have held a green card or special visa for that amount of time.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People in the immigration process can usually apply for special visas through family stateside sponsoring them or being married to a citizen. Others may qualify for refugee status. Some people — like the thousands of migrant farmers employed in Virginia — may hold temporary work visas.  Others seek employment-based green cards so they can live and work in the U.S. permanently. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there’s a cap on employment-based green cards at 140,000 per year, a number that hasn&#8217;t moved in decades. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“People that come here illegally do so because they can’t come legally,” Mittelstadt said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With an </span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/07/22/what-we-know-about-unauthorized-immigrants-living-in-the-us/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">estimated population of 11 million undocumented people</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in America, she said “that is a sign of the fact that the legal immigration system does not match employer, family reunification, and humanitarian protection needs.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Addressing the cap on green card types would be a place to start, she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Guzman noted some other “low hanging fruit” she hopes federal lawmakers could agree on, like pathways to citizenship for Temporary Protected Status holders and DACA recipients. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TPS holders are people coming from specifically designated countries that are dealing with issues that endanger citizens, such as ongoing armed conflict or environmental disasters.Some of these people may wish to live in America permanently as a result. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DACA stands for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. The roughly decade-old program has allowed for some children of undocumented immigrants to remain stateside, but it doesn’t guarantee them the opportunity to become citizens. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creating the DACA program was the “last time Congress really worked” on immigration issues successfully, Lopez said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You have to be able to pull multiple levers at the same time,” Mittelstadt of Migration Policy Institute said. “It can&#8217;t just be in border enforcement. It can&#8217;t just be dealing with root causes in Central America. It can&#8217;t just be, you know, individual ad hoc actions.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Addressing immigration issues will take sustained collective action by local, state and federal leaders, she said. Until then, she said, one thing remains apparent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The immigration system that we have today is not firing on all cylinders.” </span></p>

(Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images)</p><p>A new study shows that undocumented immigrants paid nearly $100 billion in federal, state and local tax revenue in 2022 while many are shut out of the programs their taxes fund. The findings run counter to anti-immigrant rhetoric that undocumented immigrants are <a href="https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/debates/trump-tries-to-tie-social-security-woes-to-illegal-immigration/" target="_blank">“destroying”</a> social programs.</p>
<p>In 40 states, undocumented immigrants paid higher tax rates than the top 1% of the income scale in those states, according to a <a href="https://itep.org/undocumented-immigrants-taxes-2024" target="_blank">study</a> released Tuesday from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a left-leaning, nonprofit think tank.</p>
<p>The study, which uses estimates of undocumented immigrants’ tax contributions as of 2022, shows those totaled $96.7 billion that year. Study authors also found that undocumented immigrants would contribute $40.2 billion more per year in federal, state and local taxes if all of the undocumented population had access to work authorization. The Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy reasoned that this boost would come from higher wages associated with employment authorization and easier compliance with income tax laws.</p>
<p>The report also shed further light on the tax revenue provided by undocumented immigrants on the state and local level. Undocumented immigrants are paying 46% of their state and local tax payments through sales and excise taxes. Six states — New Jersey, New York, California, Florida, Texas, and Illinois — were able to raise more than $1 billion each in tax revenue from undocumented immigrants, the nonprofit said. (Virginia received $689,800,000 in tax revenues from undocumented immigrants in 2022, according to the study.)</p>
<p>Undocumented immigrants pay property taxes and sales taxes, and federal payroll taxes taken from their wages, as well as income tax returns using Individual Taxpayer Identification numbers. Despite those payroll taxes funding Medicare, Social Security, and Unemployment Insurance, undocumented immigrants are not eligible to enroll in and receive regular benefits from these social programs. They can also face barriers to getting tax refunds, including getting scammed by unscrupulous tax preparers who target immigrant communities, said Jackie Vimo, senior analyst of economic justice policy at the National Immigration Law Center in a media call on the report.</p>

<p>“There are tons of laws that prevent undocumented workers from getting benefits…” said Richard C. Auxier, a principal policy associate at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan think tank that was not involved in the study. “…They get a lot of political attention. At the end of the day, they’re just normal people paying normal taxes.”</p>
<p>Alexis Tsoukalas, senior policy analyst at Florida Policy Institute, a nonprofit focused on economic mobility for Floridians, told reporters on Monday that she was struck by how much the state collected from undocumented immigrants in taxes compared to the wealthiest in the state. The current tax rate for undocumented immigrants in Florida is 8% compared to the top 1% of the state at 2.7%.</p>
<p>“This means hundreds of thousands of everyday people are contributing more than their share to public services they cannot even access meanwhile those with the most to give and the most to benefit contribute the least,” Tsoukalas said.</p>
<p>The study was released in the backdrop of a political climate where states have passed laws to <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2024/03/19/texas-sb-4-illegal-immigration/" target="_blank">arrest people</a> who they suspect of entering the U.S. illegally, which has been a federal power,  the Biden administration announced an executive action to <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/texas-immigrants-rights-groups-sue-biden-administration-over-asylum-restrictions" target="_blank">allow for the deportation</a> of many asylum seekers without processing their claims, and the 2024 Republican Party platform <a href="https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/2024-republican-party-platform" target="_blank">promises</a> the “largest deportation operation in American history” if former President Donald Trump is reelected over presumptive Democratic nominee Kamala Harris. Tax policy will also be front and center for Congress and the White House next year as provisions of Trump’s tax law, passed in 2017, are set to expire.</p>
<p>Aside from the human cost of deportations on families, policy experts and researchers are making the case that undocumented immigrants are a boon to the economy, making it an economic cost as well. Immigration and economic experts who spoke about the significance of the report on Monday highlighted the Congressional Budget Office’s July <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/60569#:~:text=CBO%20estimates%20that%20the%20immigration,2034%20in%20the%20agency%27s%20projections" target="_blank">report</a> on the rise in immigration and its effects on the economy and budget, which found that this increase in immigration would add $1.2 trillion in federal revenue from 2024 to 2034.</p>
<p>Carl Davis, research director at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, said there are economic ripple effects to consider in the deportation of undocumented immigrants in the U.S. beyond taxes.</p>
<p>“If you deported someone and they’re no longer making taxable purchases in their community, that number would reflect a reduction in their sales tax payments to the community but it wouldn’t capture that second ripple effect of the business has less profits because they have fewer customers,” Davis said in a media call on the study.</p>
<p>Auxier said that researchers have found children in an undocumented immigrant household are receiving education benefits that could be larger than the tax payments of the lower income working adults, but that this is more of an income issue than a specific immigration issue. The other side of that coin, Auxier notes, is that in the future, undocumented households may in fact give back more than they received.</p>
<p>“Those same studies tend to note that if the children go to school and they then go get jobs, now the American household is giving more than it got because the parents came here, worked, paid into Social Security, Medicare, and didn’t get any benefits,” he said. “The kid went to school and then they got a job and then they started earning enough money that they were a net contributor.”</p>
<p>Policy experts also pointed to a labor shortage — <a href="https://www.uschamber.com/workforce/understanding-americas-labor-shortage" target="_blank">8.1 million job openings and 6.8 million unemployed workers</a> — as a reason to embrace the economic contributions of undocumented immigrants. South Dakota, North Dakota, Maryland, Vermont, Maine, and South Carolina are some of the states facing the greatest labor shortages, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/02/14/migrants-states-labor-work-permit/" target="_blank">according to</a> a Washington Post analysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics data.</p>
<p>“Immigrants are already filling that [labor] gap and if we have mass deportations where millions of immigrants are torn from their family members and the country they have made home, we will not only have the human impact of this but we’ll have a severe effect on the economy and available workforce,” said Vimo of the National Immigration Law Center, a group that focuses on racial, economic and social justice for low-income immigrants.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With your help, we will win big on Super Tuesday,” Trump told the crowd of a few thousand at the Richmond Convention Center. “This November, Virginia is going to tell crooked Joe Biden, you’re fired, you’re fired, get out of here, get out of the White House.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A recent national </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/02/us/politics/biden-trump-times-siena-poll.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">poll</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> conducted by The New York Times and Siena College found Trump has a 5 point lead over Biden. But those results may not be mirrored in Virginia: In their last matchup in 2020, Biden beat Trump in Virginia by 10 percentage points. The results of a separate poll from the </span><a href="https://cardinalnews.org/2024/03/01/despite-low-approval-rating-biden-leads-trump-by-four-points-among-virginia-voters-roanoke-college-poll-says/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Institute for Policy and Opinion Research</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at Roanoke College released Friday found Biden had a 4 percentage point lead over Trump among Virginians. That poll also found that if Trump challenger Nikki Haley, a former South Carolina governor, were the Republican nominee, she would beat Biden in Virginia by a solid 9 points.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Calling himself a “political dissident” Saturday evening, Trump’s speech in Richmond largely focused on immigration and crime. He specifically cited the recent death of Laken Riley, a 22-year-old University of Georgia nursing student whom authorities say was beaten to death by a Venezuelan migrant, and the shooting death of a 2-year-old in </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/02/28/toddler-shooting-suspect-immigration-detainer/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Montgomery County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Maryland. Law enforcement has arrested five suspects in the latter case, one of whom is a Salvador national who was slated for deportation last year but was later released by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We now have a new category of crime, you know what it&#8217;s called? It&#8217;s called migrant crime. And this category is turning out to be worse than any crime we&#8217;ve ever had in our country,” Trump said. “I was going to call it Biden migrant crime. But if you do that it&#8217;s too long. It doesn&#8217;t work.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump pledged that if elected, he would “terminate every open border policy of the Biden administration” on his first day in office. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We will begin the largest domestic deportation operation in American history,” he said. “We have no choice. This is not sustainable by any country.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Immigration, he warned the audience, was also affecting schools: “In New York, they have pupils from foreign countries, from countries where they don&#8217;t even know what the language is. We have nobody that even teaches it,” Trump said. “These are languages that nobody ever heard of. They&#8217;re sitting in the school chairs of people, of kids, that were there, and those kids aren&#8217;t able to go to school any longer. There&#8217;s no place they can go. They&#8217;re taking the school, and they don&#8217;t speak a word of English.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richmond resident Joe Wilson, 27, who said he attended the rally not to support Trump but to witness the movement behind him, said “it’s kind of fascinating the amount of pandemonium he can cause. I just can’t wrap my head around it.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During his speech, Trump touted himself as “the first president in decades who started no new wars” and claimed that had he been in office in October, Hamas wouldn’t have “thought” of attacking Israel. Dealing with adversaries like China, Russia and North Korea, he said, was easier than “dealing with radical-left lunatics in the United States.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump’s stance on the U.S.’ global position resonated with attendee Brad Slaybaugh, 58, of Colonial Heights.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Where do you want me to start — you want to talk about China, you want to talk about Russia, you want to talk about Israel, you want to talk about Ukraine, you want to talk about the border, you talk about the economy, talk about fossil fuels?” Slaybaugh said in response to a question about what appealed to him about Trump. “Our status in the world’s fallen. The world is chaos, because we’re not strong and they know it.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump also struck many familiar themes on domestic issues Saturday: He urged oil producers to “drill, baby, drill” in order to secure U.S. energy independence, touted tax and regulatory cuts passed during his term and decried recent nationwide inflation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chesterfield residents Thomas and Debra Tubbs, 64 and 65, said cost of living was one of their reasons for supporting Trump.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A lot of medicine because of him came down in price, especially senior citizens in particular,” said Debra Tubbs. “We go to the store and spend $250, we come out of there with nearly nothing. It’s really affecting everything.”</span></p>

(Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump made no mention of Virginia Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who was long rumored to be toying with a presidential bid of his own. Youngkin’s rise to power in the increasingly blue-leaning Virginia — a feat he accomplished by keeping a careful distance from Trump but avoiding any overt criticism of the former president that could alienate supporters — was seen by many as offering a new playbook for Republicans in less deep-red states. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin, whom Trump took a swipe at in a bizarre </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/11/11/youngkin-avoids-criticizing-trump-after-chinese-swipe-by-former-president/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">social media post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in November 2022, did not attend the rally. He told the Richmond Times-Dispatch he had a previously scheduled family commitment. Youngkin’s name was also not included on a list of 40 Republican leaders endorsing Trump that his campaign released </span><a href="https://twitter.com/NickWTOP/status/1763696198295138810?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1763696198295138810%7Ctwgr%5E2cc24961211a6a2ade9301c61023c9dcf5cb022e%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwtop.com%2Fvirginia%2F2024%2F03%2Ftrumps-rally-in-richmond-concludes-ahead-of-super-tuesday-without-gov-youngkin%2F" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Friday</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Nor were Republicans Lieutenant Governor Winsome Earle-Sears, </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/11/10/virginia-winsome-sears-trump/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">who has called Trump a “liability to the mission</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” Attorney General Jason Miyares or Congresswoman Jen Kiggans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to Del. Wren Williams, R-Patrick, who addressed the crowd before Trump took the stage, in attendance for the event were U.S. Rep. Bob Good (R-Campbell), and state Sen. John McGuire (R-Goochland). Good and McGuire are locked in a heated battle to represent Virginia’s 5th Congressional District. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Tubbs said they thought former Ambassador and South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley would be a good pick for Trump’s vice president as a way to win over female voters. Haley stopped in </span><a href="https://www.wtvr.com/news/local-news/nikki-haley-richmond-virginia-visit-feb-29-2024" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">western Henrico</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Thursday for a rally of her own ahead of Super Tuesday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“She’s got a lot of good ideas,” said Debra Tubbs. Thomas Tubbs quickly added, “He’s got the balls to carry it out.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier in the day, Democrats held a counter rally in Richmond featuring U.S. Rep. Jennifer McClellan (D-Richmond), who focused on the threat Trump could pose to reproductive rights if elected to a second term. Most recently, </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/16/us/politics/trump-abortion-ban.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump has floated the idea of a 15- or 16-week ban on the procedure</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Even though Virginians stopped MAGA Republicans’ attempts to pass an extreme abortion ban here in Virginia by voting at the ballot box this past November, the stakes could not be higher for reproductive freedom this November,” McClellan said.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_38005" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/trump-protestor-scaled.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-38005" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/trump-protestor-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1707" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/trump-protestor-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/trump-protestor-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/trump-protestor-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/trump-protestor-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/trump-protestor-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/trump-protestor-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  A man holds up a sign stating former President Trump is a dictator. (Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While other Trump rallies have drawn sharp counter protests, Saturday’s event sparked little organized activity from opponents. A truck playing a video in support of Haley’s bid drove around the rally site before it began, and a few people held up signs, one of which called Trump a dictator.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Your Fellow AMERICANS are </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">NOT</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the Enemy,” read the other.</span></p>

<p>WASHINGTON — As Congress negotiates the White House’s $106 billion <a href="https://washingtonstatestandard.com/2023/10/20/israel-ukraine-global-aid-and-border-funding-would-hit-106-billion-under-biden-request/" target="_blank">supplemental aid request</a> for Israel, Ukraine and U.S. border security, fights over immigration policy have tied up the request.</p>
<p>The White House sent <a href="https://idahocapitalsun.com/2023/10/20/israel-ukraine-global-aid-and-border-funding-would-hit-106-billion-under-biden-request/" target="_blank">its proposal</a> that includes nearly $14 billion in supplemental border security funding to Congress in late October, but it will likely look different after going through the House and Senate.</p>
<p>Congress only has a couple of weeks until recess to pass the supplemental measure. A small bipartisan group of six senators in the Senate is trying to put together a border security package.</p>
<p>Those six senators include Democrats Chris Murphy of Connecticut and Michael Bennet of Colorado, independent Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona and Republicans Thom Tillis of North Carolina, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and James Lankford of Oklahoma.</p>
<p>However, Democrats object to some of those Republicans’ attempts to change asylum requirements and place more limits on humanitarian parole, as well as include a hard-line immigration bill passed in the House and advocated by Republicans.</p>
<p>Here’s a look at what’s in the White House request and where negotiations stand:</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What’s in the White House’s proposal?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.dhs.gov/news/2023/10/20/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-supplemental-funding-request" target="_blank">On Oct. 20, President Joe Biden released a request</a> for added funding to focus on border enforcement, deterrence and diplomacy.</p>
<p>The plan would beef up hiring. It includes 1,000 additional U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers and resources for U.S. Homeland Security investigations; an additional 1,300 Border Patrol agents; 300 Border Patrol processing coordinators; an additional 1,600 asylum officers and support staff; 30 new U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services officers to process work authorization documents; and 1,470 additional attorneys and support staff to match the 375 new immigration judge teams to help reduce the more than 2.5 million-case backlog in immigration courts.</p>
<p>The request also asks for additional funding for removal flights, additional beds at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities, and $1.4 billion in Shelter and Services Program grants to local governments and nonprofits for temporary food, shelter, and other services for recently arrived migrants.</p>
<p>This would aid border towns, as well as several cities that have taken in a majority of migrants, such as Chicago, New York City and Washington, D.C., among others.</p>
<p>It would also give Southwest Border ports of entry the technology to enhance inspection capabilities, such as fentanyl detection.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Is a pathway for Dreamers part of this request?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>No. A pathway to citizenship for the 800,000 people in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, who were brought into the country without authorization when they were children, is not part of these border security talks.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What’s the House position?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana wants to include in the supplemental aid package provisions of H.R. 2, <a href="https://georgiarecorder.com/2023/05/11/u-s-house-passes-bill-to-reinstate-trump-era-immigration-policies/" target="_blank">an immigration bill that House Republicans passed in May</a>.</p>
<p>H.R. 2 is a symbolic border security package that mirrors Trump-era immigration policies. It would resume the hundreds of miles of construction of a border wall, strip funding from nonprofits that aid migrants, beef up staffing of Border Patrol agents and restrict the use of humanitarian parole programs that the Biden administration has used to allow nationals from Haiti, Cuba, Nicaragua, Afghanistan, Ukraine and Venezuela to work temporarily in the U.S.</p>
<p>It’s a nonstarter for Democrats in the Senate.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What are the disagreements in the Senate?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Senate Democrats don’t agree with including H.R. 2 in the supplemental package, and Senate Democrats also oppose changes that Republicans want to make to the asylum and humanitarian parole system. The Biden administration has relied heavily on the parole system.</p>
<p><a href="https://arkansasadvocate.com/2023/02/21/biden-administration-proposes-major-new-limits-on-asylum-at-the-border/" target="_blank">The Biden administration already earlier this year placed new restrictions on asylum</a> that resulted in criticism from Democrats and lawsuits from immigration advocacy groups.</p>
<p>Nearly a dozen Senate Democrats have already said they are concerned about the permanent changes that Senate Republicans now want to the asylum and parole system.</p>
<p>Similarly, a group of nearly 200 immigration rights organizations sent a <a href="https://humanrightsfirst.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Joint-Statement-on-Asylum-Negotiations_December-2023-.pdf" target="_blank">letter</a> to Congress urging lawmakers to not make changes to asylum requirements or humanitarian parole and instead use funds “to improve asylum processing; reduce backlogs and work permit waiting times; resource states, localities and community shelter and support services; and fund legal counsel.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What are changes to the parole system that Senate Republicans want?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Republicans want a limit on Biden’s authority to create humanitarian programs by prohibiting the U.S. Department of Homeland Security from using broad criteria to grant humanitarian parole, according to <a href="https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/senate_republican_working_group_one_pager.pdf" target="_blank">a one-page summary</a> by GOP Sens. Lankford, Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Graham.</p>
<p>The GOP proposal would narrow the scope of the parole statute so that parole is only used in rare circumstances. It would also limit the time parole is granted to one year instead of two years.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What are the changes to asylum that Senate Republicans want?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Senate Republicans want to raise the bar for initial credible fear of persecution screenings that migrants present to asylum officers who decide whether a person can reside in the U.S. while their case is being presented before an immigration judge.</p>
<p>Now, to claim asylum under the fear of persecution, migrants must show there is a “significant possibility” they will face persecution. Republicans want to change that language and require asylum seekers to demonstrate that “more likely than not” they would face persecution if they remain in their home country.</p>
<p>Republicans have argued this would “weed out” meritless claims for asylum, but Democrats have contended it would deny lifesaving protection for vulnerable people.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Where are talks now?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>There is no agreement in the Senate or House and negotiations continue.</p>
<p>Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York has made it clear to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Johnson that any border security agreement has to be bipartisan. Schumer has raised concerns about Johnson wanting to include H.R. 2 provisions in the Senate’s supplemental border security package.</p>
<p>“Democrats are willing to work with Republicans on commonsense, realistic border security, but we can’t have the hard right essentially say it’s H.R. 2 or nothing,” Schumer said in a floor speech. “If Speaker Johnson, or for that matter the negotiators, feel they have to listen to what Speaker Johnson can pass just amongst his caucus, we’ll never get anything done.”</p>
<p>Schumer said he plans to hold a vote on the supplemental package as soon as the week of Dec. 4.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a parent, time can move fast and slow </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">simultaneously. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A year ago, Frederick Torres and his wife were preparing to send their little boy to kindergarten. Now, he’s about to be a “big boy” first-grader. The baby boy they carried in their arms when they fled Nicaragua is now a walking, babbling 2-year-old. The family also includes a 7-year-old son. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A year in their childrens’ lives passed in an instant. But a year in the couple’s lives felt like a century. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Torres family was forced out of Nicaragua after the government brutally confiscated the land they owned and relied on for survival. The Ortega regime has been on a rampage against its own citizens, jailing priests and human rights defenders, closing the offices of community aid groups and destroying the lives of families like the Torreses.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_36027" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:177px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/169084301511015057.jpeg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-36027" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/169084301511015057-177x300.jpeg" alt="" width="177" height="300" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/169084301511015057-177x300.jpeg 177w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/169084301511015057.jpeg 516w" sizes="(max-width: 177px) 100vw, 177px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Frederick Torres, in background with fist raised, shown with his wife and two sons.</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Frederick Torres and his family moved to Richmond, he hoped his anxiety wouldn’t follow. But President Biden still has not redesignated </span><a href="https://www.uscis.gov/humanitarian/temporary-protected-status" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">temporary protected status</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (TPS) for Nicaragua. If he did, Frederick and his family could apply for work permits, and the fear of deportation would subside. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I met Frederick through <a href="https://wearecasa.org/virginia/" target="_blank">CASA</a>, a community-led immigrant rights organization in Virginia where I lead organizing. We work with immigrants from many different countries, helping them learn about their new home and how to set themselves up for success. We teach English and financial literacy, and engage our members in grassroots campaigns to strengthen our communities, building people power for social change. Frederick quickly moved from just a member to an active community leader, eager to spread his story for immigrant justice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of those initiatives is calling on President Biden to re-designate TPS for people from Nicaragua, El Salvador, Honduras, and Nepal, and designate TPS for Guatemala. TPS is an immigration program the presidential administration can initiate when a country is in crisis and it would be unsafe to send people back there. TPS allows people from a designated country who are already in the U.S. to apply for work permits and not have to worry about deportation, for a while. Congress passed the law authorizing the president to designate countries for TPS in 1990 and each president decides how to use it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">President Bill Clinton first designated TPS for Nicaragua after Hurricane Mitch; it was </span><a href="https://www.history.com/topics/natural-disasters-and-environment/hurricane-mitch" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the deadliest Atlantic Ocean hurricane since 1780</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Presidents Bush and Obama extended TPS for Nicaragua, but importantly did not “re-designate” it, meaning that only those Nicaraguans who came to the U.S. before the hurricane in 1998 were eligible to benefit. President Trump tried to end TPS for all Nicaraguans,  but the community organized, filed a lawsuit, and prevented him from deporting our friends and loved ones. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recently, Biden extended TPS for Nicaragua, El Salvador, Honduras, and Nepal. But he didn’t take the opportunity to also re-designate TPS, something that is very much needed so that people who have come here more recently can apply.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the Biden administration extended TPS for Nicaragua, it admitted the political and safety crisis there is worsening. </span><a href="https://www.refworld.org/country,,UNHCR,,NIC,,63bc17264,0.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">More people are fleeing the nation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> than at the height of the Cold War, with Frederick being one of them and fleeing to Virginia for protection. This dangerous situation is clearly stated in the government’s own </span><a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2023-06-21/pdf/2023-13246.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">notice extending the program.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If it’s dangerous to send someone to Nicaragua, it doesn’t matter if they arrived in the U.S. years ago or last week. Danger is danger.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Something Frederick said recently really stuck with me. He said, “President Biden knows what it’s like to be a father. He knows about a parent’s duty to take care of their kids.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And that is why he, and I, believe President Biden still has a chance to do the right thing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have another name for TPS, one that I think really fits: Together, Protected and Safe. That’s what TPS is for Virginians who have it, and that’s what it is for Frederick and others who also need it.</span></p>

<p>WASHINGTON —  Two years ago, Farzana Jamalzada and her husband made the difficult decision to separately flee Afghanistan, after U.S. troops withdrew from the country and the Taliban took over.</p>
<p>It took days for the couple to be reunited at an airport in Qatar, where Jamalzada would show people a picture of her husband on her phone, asking them if they had seen him.</p>
<p>Once reunited, they were settled in the U.S. through the Biden administration’s humanitarian parole program for Afghans that extended protections for two years, allowing them to work and live in the U.S. Because Jamalzada worked for the U.S. government in Afghanistan, she was able to apply for a Special Immigrant Visa, which is available to those who were translators, interpreters or professionals employed by or on behalf of the U.S. government in Afghanistan or Iraq.</p>
<p>“It has been two years and every day we are in an uncertain situation,” she said in an interview with States Newsroom. “It is very frustrating.”</p>
<p>Legislation in Congress known as the Afghan Adjustment Act would allow Afghan refugees to apply for permanent legal residency after undergoing additional vetting, but it’s failed to advance. Without congressional action on a pathway to citizenship, most of the more than 76,000 Afghan refugees who came to the U.S. after the Taliban takeover are stuck in legal limbo.</p>
<p>The humanitarian program under which they arrived in the U.S., known as Operation Allies Welcome, does not provide a pathway to citizenship. But Afghans enrolled can apply for asylum, and those who qualify can apply for a Special Immigrant Visa. Claims for asylum and the Special Immigrant Visa have a major backlog.</p>
<p>“For most Afghans, they’re in this kind of limbo status and waiting to see,” said Julia Gelatt, the associate director of the Migration Policy Institute’s U.S. immigration policy program.</p>
<p>Jamalzada and her husband, now settled in New York City, have a hearing for their green cards scheduled for Sept. 12, but their work authorization expires at the end of August. The two-week gap means neither will be legally allowed to work in the U.S., risking termination from their jobs.</p>
<p>“You don’t have peace of mind,” she said. “Being away from your country, your family, you’re alone in a very strange world, and yet you don’t have that support,” she said, referring to permanent protections in the U.S.</p>
<p>Jamalzada, now 27, said she prays that either her and her husband’s work visas are reauthorized or that Congress passes the Afghan Adjustment Act.</p>
<p>For 20 years, the U.S. government relied on Afghans to help the government and military <a href="https://www.cfr.org/timeline/us-war-afghanistan" target="_blank">following the 2001 invasion</a>. Afghans worked as interpreters and helped run aid programs. Jamalzada worked on women’s empowerment projects with the United States Agency for International Development and at the Afghan presidential palace.</p>
<p>“Keep your promise and support the people who stood on your side and helped you,” she said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Parole set to expire</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Operation Allies Welcome evacuated and paroled 76,200 Afghans from August 2021 to September 2022.  <a href="https://www.wrapsnet.org/documents/FY%202023%20Reception%20&amp;%20Placement%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf" target="_blank">A majority settled in areas</a> with large military bases such as Texas, California, Maryland, Virginia, Washington and New York.</p>
<p>But two years after the fall of Kabul, only a fraction — fewer than 10%  — in the humanitarian parole program have secured permanent protections, through either asylum or the Special Immigrant Visa, said Krish O’Mara Vignarajah, the president of the Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service. Her organization has helped settle more than 14,000 Afghans in the U.S.</p>
<p>“One of the biggest issues, I think, that remains uncertain is whether they will be allowed to remain permanently, and that relates to the Afghan Adjustment Act,” she said.</p>
<p>While those who worked for the U.S. government can apply for the Special Immigrant Visa program, many Afghans had to flee the country without the proper documentation needed to show their employment history.</p>

<p>“Part of that was because if they had the documentation on them, and were caught by the Taliban, that could be a death sentence,” O’Mara Vignarajah said.</p>
<p>O’Mara Vignarajah added that other Afghans applied for refugee status in other countries through Operation Allies Welcome and are waiting to be resettled in the U.S.</p>
<p>“The grim reality is that they’re likely waiting for years,” she said.</p>
<p>Laila Ayub, an immigration attorney and co-director of Project Afghan Network for Advocacy and Resources, said many Afghans have had no choice but to try to find a way into the U.S., even while they are waiting for their parole to be accepted by Operation Allies Welcome.</p>
<p>“We increasingly have been assisting people who have made a very long and difficult journey to the Southern border,” she said.</p>
<p>U.S. border agents apprehended more than 2,100 Afghans last year.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Grassley blocks resettlement plan</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The closest Congress came to providing a quick pathway to citizenship for Afghans was last year, through the Afghan Adjustment Act, when Democrats controlled the House and Senate. However, those efforts were blocked by Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, and the bipartisan proposal was not included in an omnibus spending bill.</p>
<p>Grassley objected to the security and vetting processes for those Afghans.</p>
<p>He, along with several Senate Republicans, now are backing another bill by GOP Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, known as the Ensuring American Security and Protecting Afghan Allies Act.</p>

<p>That <a href="https://www.grassley.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/ensuring_american_security_and_protect_afghan_allies_act.pdf" target="_blank">bill</a> would apply to those Afghans who were evacuated and who are ineligible for an immigration status that leads to a green card for citizenship. Those evacuees would be eligible for a four-year conditional resident status, to allow for vetting, and, upon successful completion, would become green card holders.</p>
<p>“The Biden Administration’s disastrous departure from Afghanistan caused a chaotic migration from the region, and our government repeatedly failed to thoroughly evaluate evacuees arriving in the United States,” Grassley said in a statement. “This bill restores order to the system by ensuring Afghan evacuees are able to assimilate while preserving American security and better supporting those who provided direct support to the United States military.”</p>
<p>However, the bill would limit the president’s authority to establish humanitarian parole programs, which the Biden administration has used as part of its immigration policy. It’s designated parole programs for nationals of Ukraine, Nicaragua, Haiti, Cuba and Venezuela.</p>
<p>The Cotton bill “is definitely throwing a wrench” in gaining support for the Afghan Adjustment Act, said Jennie Murray, president and CEO of the National Immigration Forum.</p>
<p>“We have used (humanitarian parole) several times in U.S. history across party lines, different presidents have used it, and it’s an important tool that we have to be able to use at a moment like World War II or the Cuban missile crisis,” she said. “It’s something that presidents have to be able to use, and so we’re very worried about that competitive legislation.”</p>
<p>Murray helped out evacuation efforts for Afghans when she worked for Upwardly Global, where she worked to put together a workforce plan for those Afghans arriving in the U.S.</p>
<p>She said a potential last shot at getting permanent protections for Afghans is through the National Defense Authorization Act, an annual must-pass defense policy measure.</p>
<p>“They cannot go back to Afghanistan,” she said. “They cannot go back to the Taliban-led state because they partnered with us.”</p>
<p>The NDAA does not currently include any provisions for a pathway to citizenship for those Afghans, but Murray notes that the measure is still in conference between the House and the Senate.</p>
<p>When the House passed its version of the NDAA, a bipartisan group of lawmakers reintroduced the Afghan Adjustment Act in the Senate and in the House.</p>
<p>Democratic U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota sponsored the bill in the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/2327?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22afghan+adjustment+act%22%5D%7D&amp;s=1&amp;r=2" target="_blank">Senate</a> and Republican Rep.

</p><div id="modal-ready">
<p>WASHINGTON — In a last-minute push, U.S. senators are working on a bipartisan agreement to create a pathway to citizenship for undocumented people who were brought to the United States as children.</p>
<p>But the success of any major immigration deal appears unlikely, as a lame-duck session of Congress dwindles into its last days. Democrats are set to lose control of the House come January, making the prospect of an agreement next year much more difficult.</p>
<p>U.S. Sens. Kyrsten Sinema, an Arizona Democrat, and Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican, are still in talks on a draft proposal that would create a pathway to citizenship for up to 2 million undocumented people, often referred to as Dreamers, who are either enrolled in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program or would qualify for it. There is no legislative text and no deal has been finalized, Tillis told States Newsroom.</p>
<p>The possible agreement would also extend the <a href="https://newjerseymonitor.com/briefs/u-s-district-court-strikes-down-use-of-title-42-to-expel-migrants/" target="_blank">controversial Title 42 policy</a>, which allows the United States to turn away noncitizens seeking asylum during a health crisis, and allocate funding for border security. The outline would also include a pathway to citizenship for those under Temporary Protected Status, which is <a href="https://miracoalition.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/TPS-factsheet_May-2022.pdf" target="_blank">more than 350,000 people. </a></p>
<p>“We hope that those talks come to fruition,” U.S. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, told reporters at the U.S. Capitol on Tuesday.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Court ruling</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>More than 600,000 currently enrolled DACA recipients are in limbo after <a href="https://idahocapitalsun.com/2022/10/06/daca-ruled-unlawful-by-federal-appeals-court-but-program-continues-for-now/" target="_blank">a recent 5th Circuit Court of Appeals ruling</a> upheld a lower court decision that determined the DACA program to be unlawful — though current recipients are not yet affected — and blocked the government from accepting new applications.</p>
<p>Many immigration advocates have argued that it’s clear that DACA will be deemed illegal by the courts, leaving uncertainty for hundreds of thousands of Dreamers.</p>
<p>U.S. Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin of Illinois has said for weeks that he knows of roughly four or five Senate Republicans who are interested in striking a deal to pass legislation to create a pathway to citizenship for undocumented people enrolled in DACA. But Senate Democrats would need 10 Republican votes to overcome the filibuster threshold to pass such legislation.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/SenatorDurbin/status/1599832836445392896" target="_blank">On Twitter,</a> Durbin said he was interested in reviewing the draft proposal between Tillis and Sinema.</p>
<p>“I am determined to do everything in my power to help deliver a Christmas miracle for Dreamers,” Durbin wrote on Twitter.</p>
<p>Tillis said that he and Sinema have been talking for months about a possible immigration deal and felt that they had made progress. He said the framework for creating a pathway to citizenship for those under DACA “is more or less settled,” and the sticking point is “getting the final bricks of the foundation for border security — that&#8217;s still up in the air.”</p>
<p>As for timing of the proposal, Tillis did not say if a deal could be finished by the end of Congress’ lame-duck session.</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s gonna take a little while to get a draft that we would be comfortable with publishing,” Tillis said.</p>
<p>U.S. Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey, chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who has been pushing for a pathway to citizenship for DACA recipients, told States Newsroom that he has some concerns with the framework.</p>
<p>The extension of Title 42 and how asylum is treated were among his concerns, he said.</p>
<p>“Magical things can happen,” Menendez said. “But by the same token, you know, the clock is ticking.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">No details circulated</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Many senators said they are aware of the Sinema-Tillis framework but have yet to see any written specifics.</p>
<p>Republican Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania told reporters at the Capitol Monday that he knew of the Tillis-Sinema agreement, “but I have not seen the details.”</p>
<p>Republican Sen. Mike Rounds of South Dakota told reporters at the Capitol Monday that he was skeptical an immigration deal could be passed before the end of the lame-duck session. He said any deal on immigration would have to include border security.</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s not something you can airdrop,” he said, a term commonly used in Washington about proposals that have not seen any committee or floor action. He added that his office has not received any bill text of the proposal.</p>
<p>In 2018, Rounds and independent Sen. Angus King of Maine <a href="https://www.collins.senate.gov/newsroom/senators-unveil-bipartisan-amendment-protect-dreamers-strengthen-border-security" target="_blank">tried to pass an immigration proposal</a> that would have created a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers and provided $25 billion to the Trump administration to build a wall along the U.S -Mexico border.</p>
<p>White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said during a press briefing Monday that the administration was aware of a proposal but had not seen details.</p>
<p>“The president has repeatedly called on Congress to permanently protect Dreamers, farmworkers, essential workers, and others and to provide them with the pathway to citizenship,” she said. “So, that is certainly a priority for the president.  But we haven&#8217;t seen the detailed proposal, so I can&#8217;t comment … about that from here.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Advocates want ‘real solutions’</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Immigration advocates have lobbied <a href="https://minnesotareformer.com/2022/10/11/immigration-advocates-call-again-for-daca-renewal-in-congress-as-possible-end-looms/" target="_blank">Democrats for weeks</a> to pass a last-effort piece of legislation to give DACA recipients a permanent pathway to citizenship.</p>
<p>Greisa Martinez Rosas, the CEO of United We Dream, the largest youth immigration advocacy group, said in a <a href="https://unitedwedream.org/press/the-clock-is-ticking-we-need-real-solutions/" target="_blank">statement</a> that time to pass any DACA-related legislation is running out.</p>
<p>“We’ve heard of many leaked memos, conversations and ‘deals’ over the last 40 years,” Martinez Rosas said. “We don’t need DC gossip, we need real solutions, we need a pathway to citizenship now.”</p>
<p>Similarly, more than 70 mayors signed a bipartisan letter urging Congress to “enact permanent protections for Dreamers during the lame duck session.”</p>

(Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON — Eighteen months into the Biden administration, immigration reform has stalled despite campaign promises to reform the system, with the most recent movement on immigration policy doled out by the U.S. Supreme Court and in lower federal courts.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/21-954_7l48.pdf" target="_blank">ruled</a> in favor of the Biden administration in a 5-4 decision on June 30 that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security did not violate federal immigration law when it moved to end the Trump administration’s “Remain in Mexico” policy, known as the <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/migrant-protection-protocols" target="_blank">Migrant Protection Protocols.</a> It was a rare win for President Joe Biden amid a string of defeats at the end of the court’s term, including on abortion and climate change.</p>
<p>DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said during an interview with ABC News on Sunday that the agency is planning to end the Trump-era program that forced migrants seeking asylum to remain in Mexico while their cases were being processed through the U.S. immigration court system. But he said it will take time.</p>
<p>“We need to wait until the Supreme Court’s decision is actually communicated to the lower court, to the federal District Court and the Northern District of Texas, and, once that occurs, the District Court should lift its injunction that is preventing us from ending the program,” Mayorkas said.</p>
<p>There are about 30,000 pending MPP cases, <a href="https://trac.syr.edu/phptools/immigration/mpp1/" target="_blank">according to tracking by Syracuse University.</a></p>
<p>Sen. Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican, criticized the Biden administration for moving to end the “Remain in Mexico” policy.</p>
<p>“This decision will send yet another signal to the trafficking networks and cartels that America’s border is wide open,” Rubio said in a statement. “President Biden’s reckless rhetoric and actions are encouraging illegal immigration and hurting our country.”</p>
<p>https://twitter.com/RepBenCline/status/1542876698928111616?s=20&#038;t=bsPLHQ10uhx0k2Z36oa8pQ</p>
<p>But Sen. Ben Ray Luján, a New Mexico Democrat, said in a statement that the end of the program “is the first step toward remedying years of humanitarian injustice.”</p>
<p>“This dangerous, xenophobic policy established by the Trump administration has forced tens of thousands of vulnerable children, families, and other asylum seekers into unsafe conditions before their asylum requests can even be heard,” he said.</p>
<p>Luján added that he is continuing to work with his colleagues in the Senate “to continue my career-long push to fix our broken immigration system.”</p>
<p>Noting the horrifying discovery of 53 migrants <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/authorities-id-47-migrants-found-dead-abandoned-truck-san-antonio-rcna36931" target="_blank">who died in an abandoned tractor trailer in Texas </a>while attempting to cross into the United States, Mayorkas called for Congress to pass immigration reform. He also defended the administration messaging on deterring migrants from crossing the U.S. border. Republicans have repeatedly attacked Biden on border policy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because the border has been a challenge for decades, ultimately Congress must pass legislation to once and for all fix our broken immigration system,” Mayorkas said during the ABC interview.</p>
<p>Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott was quick to blame Biden for the deaths of the migrants found in the tractor trailer.</p>
<p>“These deaths are on Biden,” Abbott wrote on <a href="https://twitter.com/GregAbbott_TX/status/1541596214705135617" target="_blank">Twitter</a>. “They are a result of his deadly open border policies.”</p>
<p>While aboard Air Force One, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters that “the fact of the matter is the border is closed, which is in part why you see people trying to make this dangerous journey using smuggling networks.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Dreamers’ fate in the courts</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Without congressional action, the nearly 825,000 undocumented people covered by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, known as Dreamers, remain in limbo as oral arguments took place in a lower court in Louisiana on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The program allows children who were brought to the country illegally to obtain documentation for work and allows them to remain in the country.</p>
<p>Texas — in its lawsuit originally with Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Nebraska, South Carolina and West Virginia — argued that DACA placed an undue burden on the states and that the Obama administration didn&#8217;t follow proper procedures when implementing the program.</p>
<p>The program was meant to be a temporary fix, until a path to citizenship for those children, who are now adults, could be put in place by Congress, but in June the program entered its 10th year in place.</p>
<p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, said that Democrats need to be prepared to pass legislation creating a pathway to citizenship should they win the DACA case in the federal appeals court in New Orleans.</p>
<p>“We need to be prepared to make respect for our Dreamers the law of the land,” she said in a statement.</p>
<p>In Biden’s State of the Union Address earlier this year, he said that the country needs to “provide a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers,” and called on Congress to pass a bill, so he could sign it into law.</p>
<p>But any immigration reform has failed to pass Congress and remains largely stuck.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Title 42</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Biden administration has been blocked by conservative judges, including on an attempt to end the controversial Title 42 policy. That Trump-era policy allows the U.S. to expel migrants making asylum claims during a period of health crisis, such as the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>“We shouldn&#8217;t be using a public health law to enforce immigration law,” the president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, Jeremy McKinney, said. “Public health law should be driven by science and not election year politics, especially coming from the same ilk that has opposed every public health measure since COVID started.”</p>
<p>The Biden administration moved to scrap the program, but after Texas sued, <a href="https://lailluminator.com/2022/05/20/federal-judge-title-42-migrant-expulsions/" target="_blank">a Louisiana district court issued a nationwide preliminary injunction</a> and ruled that the White House had to keep the policy in place. The Justice Department has appealed.</p>

(John Moore/ Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON — The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced Friday the government will terminate a Trump-era policy that prevented migrants from claiming asylum during a health crisis, including the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>The policy will end on May 23, the CDC wrote in its notice.</p>
<p>“There is no longer a serious danger that the entry of covered citizens, as defined by the August order, into the United States will result in the introduction, transmission and spread of COVID-19,” according to the notice.</p>
<p>The CDC added that vaccination rates in the United States and abroad “provide an additional layer of protection.”</p>
<p>The order, known as Title 42, was enacted by the Trump administration in March 2020 as a way to prevent migrants from seeking asylum in the United States amid a health crisis, and expelled migrants to their home countries.</p>
<p>More than 1 million migrants have been expelled under Title 42, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection data.</p>
<p>The CDC had the authority to keep the policy in place, making a decision every 60 days whether to maintain it.</p>
<p>Once the order is terminated, families and single adults who enter the country without legal authorization must establish a legal basis for remaining in the U.S. or they will be removed, Department of Homeland Security and State Department officials said on a call with reporters Friday.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Months in the works</h4>

	
<p>DHS officials said they had been planning the ending of Title 42 for months, and have sent hundreds of law enforcement officials to the border to assist in processing, and will continue to send agents.</p>
<p>“We are coordinating across the whole of the government to ensure that we are prepared for any potential increase in border encounters as a result of termination of the Title 42 order,” a DHS official said.</p>
<p>DHS and State Department officials said that the CDC is putting in additional COVID-19 protocols, such as vaccination requirements for migrants.</p>
<p>Officials said they will begin to provide up to 2,000 vaccinations a day across 11 locations along the border and are working to expand to 27 locations in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>DHS and State Department officials said the U.S. needs an overhaul of its immigration system, and reiterated the president’s call on Congress to work on bipartisan legislation to address immigration reform.</p>
<p>“The only long-term solution to these periodic surges that we have seen over the last decade under presidents of both parties can only come from comprehensive legislation and lasting reform that can only happen with our friends in Congress,” a State Department official said.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Democrats react</h4>

	
<p>Democratic members of the U.S. House who lead a committee and subcommittee that manage border security, Reps. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi and Nanette Diaz Barragán of California, said in a joint statement that the Trump-era policy was never about public health and was inhumane.</p>
<p>“From the earliest days of this pandemic, the Trump Administration sought to exploit it to advance his anti-immigrant agenda and used Title 42 to single out migrants as a health risk,” they said. “It is not lost on (us) that folks who seized on the Trump Administration’s Title 42 restrictions to stoke fear about migrants bringing COVID into communities were among the first to lift indoor mask mandates and other restrictions.”</p>
<p>They continued: “Our government has the tools to safely process and screen people at the border, as required by law, in order to determine whether they qualify for asylum or other humanitarian protections.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Expediting asylum cases</h4>

	
<p>In preparation for the end of the order, the Biden administration announced in late March a new policy to expedite asylum cases at the U.S.-Mexico border in an attempt to resolve a years-long backlog.</p>
<p>The departments of Justice and Homeland Security issued a rule to allow U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services officials — rather than immigration judges — to make decisions on claims by migrants at the border that they cannot return to their home countries for fear of torture or persecution. This rule would not apply to unaccompanied children.</p>
<p>The current backlog of immigration cases handled by judges is nearly 1.5 million, according to tracking by Syracuse University.</p>
<p>But immigration advocates and attorneys expressed concern that the new policy could prevent asylum seekers from obtaining legal representation if their cases are denied.</p>
<p>Congressional Democrats and immigration advocates have pressured the White House to end the Title 42 policy. The White House has deferred to the CDC, arguing that it would not weigh in on a public health matter.</p>
<p>In the days leading up to the CDC announcement, amid news reports Title 42 would be lifted, Republicans criticized the White House and called on the CDC to keep the policy in place. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, said ending Title 42 would worsen immigration at the border.</p>
<p>“Ending Title 42 without any real border security plan in place would spark a humanitarian and security crisis like we’ve never seen,” he said.</p>
<p>Sergio Gonzales, the executive director of the Immigration Hub, an immigration advocacy center, said in a statement that the Biden administration was correct to end the policy.</p>
<p>“As we watch our European allies extend compassion to Ukrainian refugees abroad, we are reminded of our own values and history in welcoming those yearning to breathe free,” Gonzales said. “This is how we live up to our promise to the American public and those who are fleeing persecution, torture or war and seeking protection within our borders.”</p>

<p>&#8220;If somebody is not approved in the first instance, they&#8217;re going to be required to go through a pretty fast process to appeal,&#8221; Jennifer Ibañez Whitlock, an immigration attorney and policy counsel for the American Immigration Lawyers Association, said in an interview. &#8220;I firmly believe it&#8217;s going to affect people&#8217;s ability to get a lawyer.&#8221;</p>
<p>The departments of Justice and Homeland Security are issuing a rule to allow U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services officials, rather than immigration judges, to make decisions on claims by migrants at the border that they cannot return to their home countries for fear of torture or persecution. This rule would not apply to unaccompanied children.</p>
<p>If the USCIS officials determine a person cannot claim asylum, then those individuals will face deportation and proceedings will be handled within 90 days by an immigration judge.</p>
<p>But if the person seeking asylum is able to establish a credible fear of persecution, they get an appointment with an asylum officer 21 to 45 days after the determination is made. The officer then has 60 days after the interview to determine whether to grant asylum.</p>
<p>“Through this rule, we are building a more functional and sensible asylum system to ensure that individuals who are eligible will receive protection more swiftly, while those who are not eligible will be rapidly removed,&#8221; Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in a statement. &#8220;We will process claims for asylum or other humanitarian protection in a timely and efficient manner while ensuring due process.&#8221;</p>
<p>That decision currently falls on the nearly 500 immigration judges, and those backlogs can take years — but officials say this new rule would cut that time down to months. The <a href="https://trac.syr.edu/whatsnew/email.211115.html" target="_blank">current</a> backlog of immigration cases is nearly 1.5 million, <a href="https://trac.syr.edu/immigration/reports/675/" target="_blank">according</a> to tracking by  Syracuse University.</p>
<p>&#8220;It will help reduce the burden on our immigration courts, protect the rights of those fleeing persecution and violence, and enable immigration judges to issue removal orders when appropriate,&#8221; Attorney General Merrick B. Garland said in a statement announcing the rule.</p>
<p>An asylum case before a judge can take anywhere from two to three years, Whitlock said. If a migrant is granted asylum, then they are allowed to stay in the U.S. and qualify for permanent residency a year after that decision.</p>
<p>She added that USCIS has a high turnover rate of asylum officers, and she&#8217;s worried the staff won&#8217;t be able to handle the incoming cases when they have their own backlogs.</p>
<p>USCIS has a backlog of 9.5 million unattended applications, <a href="https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/us-immigration-backlogs-mounting-undermine-biden" target="_blank">according</a> to the Migration Policy Institute.</p>
<p>Rep. Andy Biggs, an Arizona Republican, questioned Mayorkas about staffing levels last year. The agency <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/document/foia/USCIS_asylum_officers-Representative_Biggs.pdf" target="_blank">reported</a> that in fiscal 2021, it had 769 asylum officers, with a goal of reaching 785.</p>
<p>“I have a feeling that people who are under this rule are going to go unrepresented,” Whitlock said.</p>
<p>A 2016 <a href="https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/sites/default/files/research/access_to_counsel_in_immigration_court.pdf" target="_blank">study</a> by the American Immigration Council found that only 37% of immigrants find legal representation in removal cases, and immigrants in detention centers were less likely to acquire legal representation.</p>
<p>The study also found that representation rates varied among nationality. Mexican immigrants have the highest detention rates, at 78%, and the lowest legal representation at 21%, compared to Chinese immigrants who had the lowest detention rate at 4% and the highest legal representation rate at 92%.</p>
<p>Immigrants who were detained, but had legal counsel, were “nearly 11 times more likely to seek relief such as asylum than those without representation (32 percent with counsel versus 3 percent without),” according to the study.</p>
<p>Whitlock said to expect someone seeking asylum to obtain their own legal representation, especially if their asylum case is denied, “doesn&#8217;t set people up for success.”</p>
<p>“It&#8217;ll get you fast decisions,” she said. “But if you&#8217;re trying to identify people who should be offered protection based under our laws, I think you&#8217;re gonna end up sending back a lot of asylum seekers to harm.”</p>
<p>Another sticking point is a language barrier, she said. A portion of migrants seeking asylum are Haitian. Those migrants denied asylum would have to find an interpreter or a lawyer fluent in Haitian Creole.</p>
<p>Another complication is Title 42, which allows the U.S. to expel migrants making asylum claims during a period of health crisis such as the coronavirus pandemic. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which reauthorizes Title 42, has a March 30 deadline to determine whether to continue the policy.</p>
<p>Title 42 is a Trump-era immigration policy that the Biden administration moved to scrap, but a Texas district court ruled that the White House had to keep the policy in place.</p>

(Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON — Senate Democrats and immigration advocates are pushing the White House to end a controversial Trump-era immigration policy enacted during the pandemic that allowed U.S. officials to expel migrants and asylum seekers at the border.</p>
<p>“I continue to be disappointed, deeply disappointed, in the administration’s response,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said during a Thursday call with reporters.</p>
<p>The policy, known as Title 42, was enacted by the Trump administration in 2020 as a way to prevent migrants from seeking asylum in the U.S. by citing a health crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. It also expelled migrants to their home countries.</p>
<p>More than 1 million migrants have been expelled under Title 42, <a href="https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/national-media-release/cbp-releases-operational-fiscal-year-2021-statistics" target="_blank">according</a> to U.S. Customs and Border Protection data. Enforcement and Removal Operations, under U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, carried out 36,654 air expulsions, according to a <a href="https://www.ice.gov/doclib/eoy/iceAnnualReportFY2021.pdf" target="_blank">report</a> released by ICE Friday.</p>
<p>It’s a policy that the Biden administration has kept in place, but amended to prevent unaccompanied children from being expelled.</p>
<p>Last week, a district court in Texas ruled that the Biden administration could not exempt children from the rule, and an appeals court in Washington, D.C., ruled the Biden administration couldn’t use Title 42 to expel migrant families to countries where they could face persecution.</p>
<p>The chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Sen. Bob Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat, said during the Thursday call with reporters that the Biden administration should continue to defend “its original decision to prevent children from being expelled.”</p>
<p>“Expelling children is not who we are as a nation,” he said, adding that Title 42 “is neither humane, nor effective in managing migration.”</p>
<p>Top officials at the Department of Homeland Security are planning to tell Mexico that the policy could come to an end as early as April, according to documents <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/hamedaleaziz/biden-border-plans-title-42" target="_blank">obtained</a> by Buzzfeed News.</p>
<p>Menendez said that he, along with the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, have asked the White House for a meeting with President Joe Biden to discuss Title 42, along with other immigration policies, but have yet to hear back.</p>
<p>He added that the White House should direct the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to not renew the policy, which was enacted as a public health measure.</p>
<p>The CDC makes the decision every 60 days whether to keep Title 42 in place. The next decision is April 1.</p>
<p>“Our focus has been on the administration, who has been really relying upon and using the CDC determination to effectuate this policy,” he said. “I have no doubt that if the administration decided that in fact they would no longer seek to use this policy, that the CDC would follow.”</p>
<p>Before Title 42 was in place, migrants arrested at the border could apply for asylum and wait for their claims to be processed to determine if they could remain in the U.S.</p>
<p>The chair of the House Homeland Security Committee’s border panel, Nanette Barragán, D-Calif., said during the call that a hearing on Title 42 will be held in the coming weeks. She recently <a href="https://kansasreflector.com/2022/03/02/u-s-house-panel-hears-from-dhs-about-problems-with-remain-in-mexico-immigration-policy/" target="_blank">held</a> a hearing that examined another Trump immigration policy that a Texas federal court was forcing the Biden administration to keep in place.</p>
<p>Lee Gelernt, the deputy director for the ACLU Immigrants’ Rights Project, said on the call that the organization is prepared to take legal action if the Title 42 policy remains in place.</p>
<p>He said the ACLU is urging the Biden administration to not appeal the D.C. appeals court’s decision and to reject the Texas ruling that would not let unaccompanied minors be exempt from Title 42.</p>
<p>“The way the administration can deal with both cases is simply by ending Title 42, so we urge the administration to do that,” he said.</p>
<p>Guerline Jozef, the executive director of the Haitian Bridge Alliance, said that under Title 42, more than 20,000 migrants have been expelled to Haiti. She added that those fleeing unstable countries should be able to seek asylum in the U.S. whether they are from Haiti or Ukraine.</p>
<p>A woman and three children from Ukraine were turned away at the U.S. Mexican border under Title 42, according to multiple media <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/10/politics/us-ukraine-refugees-title-42/index.html" target="_blank">reports</a>. More than 2 million people have fled Ukraine, following Russia’s attack on the country. The family was eventually allowed into the U.S.</p>
<p>“It is unacceptable for President Biden and his administration to continue the use of Title 42 to literally deport, expel some of the most vulnerable people,” Jozef said.</p>

<p>Ukrainians living in the U.S. as of March 1 of this year will be eligible for TPS designation of up to 18 months; it will not apply to Ukrainians arriving after March 1. The designation will allow those in the program to be protected from deportation, as well as apply for work permits.</p>

One million people have left Ukraine, <a href="https://www.unhcr.org/en-us/news/press/2022/3/62206a824/news-comment-1-million-refugees-fled-ukraine-week.html" target="_blank">according</a> to the United Nations Refugee Agency.</p>
<p>U.S. House lawmakers are also pushing the Biden administration to immediately designate Student Special Relief for Ukrainians.</p>
<p>A letter, led by Rep. Jimmy Gomez, a California Democrat, and signed by 98 members urged the president to extend both TPS and the student program for 18 months because “given the already unmet humanitarian need in the country and the effects of the armed conflict with Russia, the Ukrainian government is in no state to receive TPS and SSR eligible Ukrainians.”</p>
<p><a href="https://studyinthestates.dhs.gov/students/special-student-relief" target="_blank">SSR</a> would allow for the temporary suspension of certain requirements put in place by DHS for a foreign student studying in the U.S. “from parts of the world that are experiencing emergent circumstances.” Some of those requirements include “duration of status, full course of study and off-campus employment eligibility.”</p>
<p>Russia began its invasion into Ukraine on Feb. 24. Ukraine’s health ministry reported that at least 250 civilians have been killed in the attack.</p>
<p>Members of Congress praised the Biden administration for the TPS designation for Ukrainians.</p>
<p>Sen. Bob Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat and chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said in a statement that the TPS designation was the right thing to do “after a week of Vladimir Putin’s illegal and ruthless war against the people of Ukraine.”</p>
<p>“Temporary Protected Status was created by Congress for exactly this purpose — to protect people whose home countries have experienced armed conflict, an environmental disaster, or extraordinary conditions that prevent people from safely returning home,” he said.</p>
<p>The White House is also <a href="https://newjerseymonitor.com/2022/03/03/white-house-wants-10-billion-for-ukraine-aid-22-5-billion-for-more-covid-help/" target="_blank">asking</a> Congress to approve $10 billion in aid for Ukraine to help bolster soldiers in neighboring countries around Ukraine and to send military equipment to the country. The Biden administration has announced it would place <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-sanctions-putins-personal-assets-readies-forces-nato-deployment" target="_blank">sanctions</a> on Russia’s President Vladimir Putin and the country as well.</p>
<p>Some legal groups agreed with the TPS designation, but criticized DHS for its backlog of TPS designation for Black-majority countries.</p>
<p>Lisa Parisio, the Director of Advocacy at the Catholic Legal Immigration Network, said in a statement that the Biden administration should also use TPS for “Ethiopia, Cameroon, Mauritania and other countries whose nationals face grave danger if they are forced to return.”</p>
<p>“The backlog of TPS designations for Black-majority countries here in the U.S. mirrors the anti-Blackness we’re seeing as African students and others in Ukraine are denied access to escape the conflict,” she said.</p>
<p>CLINIC, along with nearly 200 <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/60b79f3630f94f1039bd0125/t/62192c6bd79c925d2f4e34d2/1645816939898/Ukraine+TPS+DED+SSR+Sign+On_Feb+24.pdf" target="_blank">organizations</a>, petitioned for the Biden administration to allow Ukrainians in the U.S. to use TPS.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.kaine.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/228.22tpsukraineletter.pdf" target="_blank">letter</a> to the White House, a bipartisan group of 42 senators advocated for the TPS designation, arguing that “it is obviously too dangerous for Ukrainian nationals to return to Ukraine due to the ongoing armed conflict.”</p>
<p>Senators who led the letter include Illinois Democrat Dick Durbin, chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee; Menendez; and Ohio Republican Rob Portman, top GOP member of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.</p>
<p>“Forcing Ukrainian nationals to return to Ukraine in the midst of a war would be inconsistent with America’s values and our national security interests,” they wrote. “As a nation, we must do our part to protect the safety of Ukrainians in the United States by designating Ukraine for TPS.”</p>
<p>Other senators who signed the letter include Democrats Tim Kaine and Mark Warner of Virginia, Ron Wyden of Oregon, Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith of Minnesota, Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, Michael Bennett and John Hickenlooper of Colorado, Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, Cory Booker of New Jersey, Gary Peters and Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, Catherine Cortez Masto and Jacky Rosen of Nevada, Mark Kelly and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, Raphael Warnock of Georgia and Martin Heinrich of New Mexico.</p>

Federal officials first passed legislation requiring states to transition to a centralized 988 number.(Jane Norman/ States Newsroom D.C. Bureau)</p><p>WASHINGTON — U.S. Department of Homeland Security officials told House members on Wednesday that there are major problems with a Trump-era immigration policy that federal courts are forcing the agency to follow.</p>
<p>One of the Department of Homeland Security officials, Blas Nuñez-Neto, said that the court-ordered Migrant Protection Protocols is a flawed policy program and the agency believes it should be terminated.</p>
<p>MPP requires migrants from Mexico who are seeking asylum to remain in Mexico while their paperwork is processed, but many advocates have documented separation and deaths to those who must comply with the program.</p>
<p>“These flaws include that it imposed unjustifiable human costs on migrants, subverted the asylum system, pulled resources and personnel away from other priority efforts, and failed to address the root causes of irregular migration,” he said in his opening statement.</p>
<p>Nuñez-Neto is the acting assistant secretary for border and immigration policy at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.</p>
<p>Republicans on the House Homeland Security subcommittee were dismayed to hear officials from DHS criticize the program, also referred to as “remain in Mexico” policy.</p>
<p>“Why would we expect DHS to implement this in good faith?” the panel&#8217;s top Republican, Clay Higgins of Louisiana, asked. “We expect compliance with the law.”</p>
<p>The program was implemented under the Trump administration in 2019. The Biden administration sought to terminate the program in June 2021, but the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas determined in <i>Texas v. Biden</i> that the termination memo was not issued in compliance with the Administrative Procedure Act and ordered the Department of Homeland Security “enforce and implement MPP in good faith,” which the agency has done.</p>
<p>Nuñez-Neto and Emily Mendrala, the deputy assistant secretary of Western Hemisphere affairs at the U.S. Department of State, both said the MPP policy was still in place and being carried out.</p>
<p>Mendrala said that one of the flaws of the program is many “MPP enrollees were preyed upon by criminal groups upon reentry to Mexico.”</p>
<p>Rep. Andrew Clyde, a Georgia Republican, asked Mendrala if she supported the program.</p>
<p>“That’s the law of the land,” Clyde said, adding that he thinks it’s a fair program.</p>
<p>She said the administration has been clear that it does not support the program, but will continue to implement it as required by the court.</p>
<p>The Republican witness, Tim Roemer, the director of Arizona’s Department of Homeland Security, defended the program, and said it helps “keep the situation at the border under control.”</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, the Biden administration’s reversal of these policies chipped away at the progress made securing the border under the previous administration to make a political statement while putting public safety at risk,” he said.</p>
<p>The chair of the subcommittee on Border Security, Facilitation, &amp; Operations, Rep. Nanette Diaz Barragán, a California Democrat, said that the border is not open, like Republicans on the panel and Roemer were arguing, because of Title 42, which allows the government to prevent non-citizens from entering the country during a health crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>“This notion that the border is open is completely false,” she said. The United States should “get back to the process of what is legal in this country, and what is legal in this country is to allow migrants to come to a port of entry,” she added.</p>

<p class="m_5591957247764611574MsoNoSpacing">As our nation faces the unprecedented crisis of a worker shortage, a perfect solution is staring members of Congress right in the face. By investing in the men and women who build and maintain our nation’s infrastructure, Congress can actually ‘Build Back Better’ through a work permit legalization proposal to protect millions of hard-working immigrants from the threat of deportation.</p>
<p class="m_5591957247764611574MsoNoSpacing">Our nation has not been this close to real immigration reform in 36 years.<u></u><u></u></p>
<p class="m_5591957247764611574MsoNoSpacing"><u></u>That’s why it’s incumbent upon responsible leaders, like Virginia Sens. Tim Kaine and Mark Warner to rise above the partisanship that blocks relief and make this historic breakthrough possible.<u></u><u></u></p>
<p class="m_5591957247764611574MsoNoSpacing"><u></u>An overwhelmingly immigrant-essential workforce kept our economy from total collapse during the pandemic. They paid with their lives, getting sick and dying of COVID-19 at some of the highest rates to build back our economy, working at a higher rate (88 percent) than the overall population (63 percent), doing the jobs that most Americans won&#8217;t do.<u></u><u></u></p>
<p class="m_5591957247764611574MsoNoSpacing"><u></u>The facts are plain to see throughout the Washington-Maryland-Virignia area where nearly 40,000 Salvadoran TPS holders have lived and worked legally for decades, holding together the region’s service industry that would lose tens of thousands of workers in construction, hotels, restaurants and child care should these workers face deportation. Over 10,000 “Dreamers” in Virginia were brought to this country by their parents, gained an education, became gainfully employed, law-abiding taxpayers and even served our nation in the military through the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA).<u></u><u></u></p>
<p class="m_5591957247764611574MsoNoSpacing"><u></u>As a devout Catholic, there’s no doubt that Sen. Kaine has been moved by the gut-wrenching, emotional appeals from Dreamers and TPS holders, who know that Kaine is one of the few in Congress whom they can rely on. Because Sen. Warner has strong business sense and experience, he understands the dramatic impact DACA and TPS has on Virginia’s economy.<u></u><u></u></p>
<p class="m_5591957247764611574MsoNoSpacing"><u></u>Businesses that would otherwise lose employees as well as their customers are counting on Virginia’s senators to do the right thing. Economists widely agree that that <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fed-kashkari-idUSKBN1AN269" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fed-kashkari-idUSKBN1AN269&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1639522786053000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1Y9z_CHoPRAs3oVaV78rR8">restricting immigration would restrain growth and that</a> <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/trump-immigration-plans-bad-for-us-economy-and-workers-2017-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.businessinsider.com/trump-immigration-plans-bad-for-us-economy-and-workers-2017-2&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1639522786053000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1VZEY3l4KyuNIjtwLVzPGb">steady immigration is key to a diverse and healthy economy</a>, with population growth alone making an important contribution.<u></u><u></u></p>
<p class="m_5591957247764611574MsoNoSpacing">Even the U.S. Chamber of Commerce wants to ensure more than<a href="https://www.uschamber.com/series/above-the-fold/what-we-re-watching-state-the-union-2018" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.uschamber.com/series/above-the-fold/what-we-re-watching-state-the-union-2018&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1639522786053000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1kmGTBAmthGPj-sM-y0Nb7"> 1 million individuals</a> who are currently allowed to work here legally can stay in the U.S., including Dreamers who are currently allowed to work here legally – but are at risk of losing that status. Deporting Dreamers and TPS holders will not create a single job but it would in fact exacerbate our workers shortage.<u></u><u></u></p>
<p class="m_5591957247764611574MsoNoSpacing">This hits close to home for local businesses like Total Quality, a janitorial services company that employs hundreds of immigrants with Temporary Protective Status (TPS), who maintain federal office buildings throughout the Washington area. If we end TPS for Salvadorans, the company would immediately lose 26 percent of its workers and would have to terminate contracts just to avoid breaking the law.<u></u><u></u></p>
<p class="m_5591957247764611574MsoNoSpacing"><u></u>That’s why it’s critical for Kaine and Warner to stand firm against efforts to verify workers&#8217; status in the workplace — such as E-verify — that will lead to unfair firings, racial profiling and enormous discrimination of workers, regardless of their lawful status. It will also push workers further into the underground economy, eroding wages for all workers.<u></u><u></u></p>
<p class="m_5591957247764611574MsoNoSpacing">Because the overwhelming majority of Americans support Dreamers and TPS holders, protecting these groups is not politically risky. <a href="https://horse-chimes-658d.squarespace.com/s/Immigration-Hub-Memo-F100821.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://horse-chimes-658d.squarespace.com/s/Immigration-Hub-Memo-F100821.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1639522786053000&amp;usg=AOvVaw17cZxe7reffhPKijy1vpIL">Recent polling</a> shows broad support for a path to citizenship and other forms of legalization, including <a href="https://horse-chimes-658d.squarespace.com/s/Immigration-Hub-Memo-F100821.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://horse-chimes-658d.squarespace.com/s/Immigration-Hub-Memo-F100821.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1639522786053000&amp;usg=AOvVaw17cZxe7reffhPKijy1vpIL">battleground</a> voters (take note Virginia) who strongly support Congress passing lasting protections for undocumented immigrants, especially among unmotivated Democratic voters who are crucial turnout voters in the midterm election.<u></u><u></u></p>
<p class="m_5591957247764611574MsoNoSpacing">Most of these young Dreamers in the Commonwealth would be sent back to El Salvador, a nation I fled at age 13, to avoid imminent death during a bloody civil war. I still remember helping my father, an ambulance driver prop up our mattress against the door to block the gunshots that often rained into homes, intentionally and accidentally claiming lives every day. Sadly, El Salvador is even more dangerous and uninhabitable today.<u></u><u></u></p>
<p class="m_5591957247764611574MsoNoSpacing">When I served our country in the U.S. Navy, after coming here undocumented in the 1990s, I was protecting American values of freedom and democracy. We urge Sens. Kaine and Warner to do everything in their power to restore those values by protecting Dreamers and TPS holders, who share their love and commitment to this nation. It was immigrants who built this nation and now die for this nation.<u></u><u></u></p>

(Robin Bravender/ States Newsroom Washington Bureau) </p><p>WASHINGTON — The Biden administration on Monday unveiled a proposed new rule that would strengthen the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program to protect undocumented people in the program from legal challenges.</p>
<p>The proposed rule, announced by the Department of Homeland Security, would “preserve and fortify” the DACA program, an Obama administration-era initiative that protects from deportation about 600,000 undocumented people who came to the U.S. as children.</p>
<p>A DHS statement said: “The rule embraces the consistent judgment that has been maintained by the Department—and by three presidential administrations since the policy first was announced—that DACA recipients should not be a priority for removal.”</p>
<p>The proposed rule is in response to a Texas lawsuit in July that ordered the government to close new applications to the DACA program. DHS can only grant renewals to those already enrolled. The Biden administration is currently appealing that ruling.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="BVm4qc65Ok"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2020/02/12/house-senate-pass-long-anticipated-immigrants-rights-bills/">Virginia House, Senate pass long-anticipated immigrants&#8217; rights bills</a></p></blockquote>

<p>“The Biden-Harris Administration continues to take action to protect Dreamers and recognize their contributions to this country,” DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in the statement.</p>
<p>“This notice of proposed rulemaking is an important step to achieve that goal. However, only Congress can provide permanent protection. I support the inclusion of immigration reform in the reconciliation bill and urge Congress to act swiftly to provide Dreamers the legal status they need and deserve.”</p>
<p>In response to the Texas ruling, President Joe Biden said in a statement at the time that Congress needed to act to preserve the DACA program.</p>
<p>“While the court’s order does not now affect current DACA recipients, this decision nonetheless relegates hundreds of thousands of young immigrants to an uncertain future,” he said. “The Department of Justice intends to appeal this decision in order to preserve and fortify DACA. And, as the court recognized, the Department of Homeland Security plans to issue a proposed rule concerning DACA in the near future.”</p>
<p>Immigration advocates have pushed for the Biden administration to not only preserve DACA, but also expand it. There are about 12,000 DACA recipients in Virginia.</p>
<p>The move also follows the U.S. Senate parliamentarian’s decision last week to reject Democrats’ plan to include a pathway to citizenship for millions of undocumented people, including those in the DACA program, in the $3.5 trillion reconciliation package.</p>
<p>The proposed rulemaking will be published Tuesday and DHS will open a public comment period for 60 days.</p>

(Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. Senate parliamentarian has turned down a plan to include a pathway to citizenship for millions of undocumented people in the $3.5 trillion reconciliation package, a blow for Democrats and immigration advocacy groups when the decision was disclosed late Sunday.</p>
<p>“We are deeply disappointed in this decision but the fight to provide lawful status for immigrants in budget reconciliation continues,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, (D-N.Y.), said in a statement. “Senate Democrats have prepared alternate proposals and will be holding additional meetings with the Senate parliamentarian in the coming days.”</p>
<p>The opinion by Elizabeth MacDonough, the Senate’s nonpartisan parliamentarian, was a setback for the Biden administration and Democrats who would have to reach 60 votes in the Senate for any immigration reform, rather than a simple majority through reconciliation, <a href="https://budget.house.gov/publications/fact-sheet/budget-reconciliation-basics" target="_blank">a process </a>reserved for matters that affect spending, revenues, the deficit or the debt limit. The Senate is evenly split between the parties.</p>
<p>Schumer said that his party will “continue fighting to pursue the best path forward to grant them the ability to obtain lawful status.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.marylandmatters.org/2021/09/07/u-s-house-budget-reconciliation-package-would-provide-path-to-citizenship/" target="_blank">If accepted by the parliamentarian,</a> the Senate’s proposal would have provided the Senate Judiciary Committee with $107 billion for “lawful permanent status for qualified immigrants.”</p>
<p>The House’s proposal is more specific and would have provided a pathway to citizenship for those in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, often referred to as Dreamers; farmworkers; those who hold a Temporary Protected Status, meaning they are unable to return to their countries; and essential workers.</p>
<p>There are more than 11 million undocumented people in the U.S., according to the <a href="https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/frequently-requested-statistics-immigrants-and-immigration-united-states#Unauthorized%20Immigrants" target="_blank">Migration Policy Institute</a>, a nonpartisan think tank that studies migration. The proposal would have affected dozens of states with high immigrant populations such as Florida, California, Texas, Georgia, New Jersey, Virginia, Maryland and Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Our fight is far from over. The United States depends on the immigrant workforce for economic recovery. We are confident that our next steps will help get immigrant families the protections and dignity they deserve.”</p>
<p>Immigration grassroots advocacy groups like Living United for Change in Arizona, or LUCHA, and We Are CASA, expressed their disappointment.</p>
<p>“The thing that I want to say to you at this moment is that we are still in this game, and we are not going to back down,” CASA Executive Director Gustavo Torres said in a statement. “The Dems have the power to deliver, and they have committed to doing that. This is a movement moment and we must be committed to holding the line.”</p>
<p>The co-executive directors for LUCHA, Alex Gomez and Tomas Robles, said that the Biden administration and congressional Democrats should find other avenues to provide a pathway for citizenship.</p>
<p>They also called upon U.S. Sens. Kyrsten Sinema and Mark Kelly of Arizona, both Democrats, to take up the fight as well.</p>
<p>“Tonight&#8217;s decision by an unelected Senate staffer is unacceptable, but it&#8217;s not the end, they said. “It&#8217;s been 35 years since the last time major reform was passed. We are in a once-in-a-generation opportunity to once and for all provide citizenship this year for millions of immigrants who continue living in the shadows while providing essential services to our communities and the economy.”</p>
<p>Monica Sarmiento, executive director of the Virginia Coalition for Immigrant Rights said reform advocates aren&#8217;t finished.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are prepared with other proposals to make sure immigrant families get justice. The Senate Parliamentarian’s ruling does not mean we will take a step back when immigration has always been good for our economy,&#8221; she said. The Pew Research Center estimated there were about <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/hispanic/interactives/u-s-unauthorized-immigrants-by-state/" target="_blank">275,000</a> undocumented immigrants in Virginia in 2016.</p>

(VCU Capital News Service) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia immigration advocacy groups are urging Sens. Tim Kaine and Mark Warner, both Democrats, to use the budget reconciliation process to pass immigration reform bill H.R.6 rather than continue to push for bipartisan support.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We can’t have a patchwork immigration system in the United States,” said Del. Alfonso Lopez, D-Arlington at a press conference last week organized by New Virginia Majority. “We have to have comprehensive immigration reform at the federal level, and the federal government, specifically the United States’ Senate, needs to act.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sweeping bill, called <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/03/us/politics/immigration-infrastructure-budget-reconciliation.html" target="_blank">the American Dream and Promise Act of 2021</a>, has already passed through the House. It would offer both protection from deportation and a pathway to citizenship for recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, </span><a href="https://www.uscis.gov/humanitarian/temporary-protected-status" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">TPS holders</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and those with Deferred Enforced Departure. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the legislation </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">faces an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/03/us/politics/immigration-infrastructure-budget-reconciliation.html" target="_blank">uphill battle</a> in the Senate, where it would require a 60 vote majority that looks less and less attainable as bipartisan deliberation continues. The slow pace of talks has advocates pushing for Senate Democrats to explore an alternative path: budget reconciliation, a parliamentary procedure that would sidestep a potential filibuster by including the reform in budget bills, which can pass with a simple majority. They&#8217;re targeting Kaine and Warner in their advocacy because they both sit on the Senate&#8217;s budget committee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Although we all have this hope for bipartisan support, that doesn’t mean we need it in order to pass something this year,” said Monica Sarmiento, executive director of the VA Coalition for Immigrant Rights. “Since both Sen. Warner and Sen. Kaine sit on the Senate Budget Committee, we need their leadership to be outspoken and say, ‘It’s ok if only Democrats vote for a pathway to citizenship for our community, because our community deserves something this year.’”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine said in a statement that he would prefer a bipartisan approach, but is open to reconciliation if talks continue to stall. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are currently having good-faith discussions with our Republican colleagues to see if we can get to a bipartisan immigration bill with 60 votes,” he said. “However, if Republicans do not want to provide much needed relief to Dreamers, TPS holders, and other immigrants who helped our country through the pandemic, then Democrats will need to consider using reconciliation to move forward.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Warner has said he’s supportive of the bill but has not commented specifically on reconciliation. </span></p>

(Contributed photo)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Angel Romero arrived in Virginia when he was two years old, completely unaware of his parents’ status as undocumented migrants from Mexico.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under DACA, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy enacted by former President Barack Obama&#8217;s administration in 2012, he’s been allowed to live and work legally in the U.S. But the protections are limited, the program has faced legal challenges and there is still no permanent path to citizenship for participants.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like many other children of the undocumented, Romero says he’s struggled to feel accepted, lived in constant fear of deportation and been denied educational and career opportunities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 22-year-old Stafford County resident &#8212; <a href="https://www.oag.state.va.us/media-center/news-releases/1539-september-30-2019-herring-continues-fight-to-preserve-daca-and-protect-dreamers?highlight=WyJkYWNhIiwiZGFjYSdzIl0=" target="_blank">one of 12,000</a> people in Virginia covered under DACA &#8212; now works as an advocate for children who find themselves in similar situations as a canvass manager for the immigrant advocacy group CASA in Action.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the ninth anniversary of the program, Romero spoke to the Mercury about his experience as a Dreamer. The following interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.</span></p>
<p><b>Virginia Mercury: What do you remember about first coming to the United States?</b></p>
<p>Romero: <span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t remember what it was like coming here. My first memories were actually </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">in</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the United States. I remember living with my cousins for the first couple months that I was here. For the first couple years of my life pretty much until I had DACA I was largely unaware of the situation regarding immigration.</span></p>
<p><b>How and when did you become aware of DACA?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Immigration was a taboo topic in our household, we were told not to talk about that outside of our household out of fear of outing ourselves. It was basically a process of discovering breadcrumbs. So in middle school I found out, ‘Oh I&#8217;m definitely not a citizen, something is definitely weird there.’ But then in high school when I actually applied for DACA, which was after DACA was put in place, I had heard about “dreamers”</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">but didn&#8217;t really know that that was a label that applied to me until I was actually doing my DACA application with CASA. They did an event for applications, there was a line out the door. I had to go to Maryland for that. </span></p>
<p><b>Was the DACA application process straightforward? Did anyone help?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was honestly kind of a confusing process, not really knowing what I was applying for. Basically my parents were the ones that were gathering all of the materials that you need, like my passport, records. It was kind of strange sitting in this room with like 10 to 20 people at one time that were being processed for their initial DACA applications. You were asked all these questions for the first time like, ‘Have you ever been involved with a gang?’ &#8212; all these questions that felt kind of intrusive. It was stuff that I didn’t even think about before that point.</span></p>
<p><b>Did things change for you in Virginia after your DACA approval?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The year before I applied for DACA I was offered this internship that I wasn&#8217;t able to actually apply for because of my immigration status. But after that a bunch of doors opened. I didn’t start working at that point but I knew that it was a possibility for me. And it wasn’t until after high school that I started working with CASA.</span></p>
<p><b>Were you and your family paying attention to Trump’s rise in 2016? Did you think there was a real chance he could win? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the beginning it was just tweets, just jokes. Nobody thought that he was actually running until he actually got the nomination. At that point it was sort of like disbelief, that he wasn’t going to be </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">that </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">bad, he was just preaching to his choir. It was that for his whole presidency </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ‘Oh he can&#8217;t possibly do this.’ But then he does it.</span></p>
<p><b>What kind of toll did that take on you and your family? Especially in 2017 when he actively rescinded DACA. </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Trump was elected I was right out of high school That was actually a really bad time because right out of high school I was going to go to George Mason’s Honors College, but because of financial reasons and because of not being able to apply for any financial aid federally, that was just not a possibility anymore. I went up to the point of going to orientation, I had my schedule. I was holding back, seeing if I&#8217;ll get some sort of financial aid, but I didn’t know how to navigate that. After that I wasn&#8217;t involved with CASA in Action yet but my sister was. On Election Day when we got the news, I was watching results roll in. Honestly, I didn&#8217;t even know how that could be possible. Everyone thought there was literally no way he was going to win.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The day <a href="https://time.com/5670018/daca-rescinded-dreamers/" target="_blank">DACA was rescinded in 2017</a> &#8212; by then I was working with CASA in Action, it was my first year getting involved with the movement. And that day instead of canvassing for elections we went to DC and were in front of the White House protesting. That made that day a lot easier because I had a whole community.</span></p>
<p><b>What do you think about ICE’s role in all of this?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I do believe in the abolition of ICE. They have been so harmful, especially in the county that I grew up in, Prince William. They had a 287(g) agreement with the Prince William Police Department — basically collaborating with ICE and sending detainees directly to ICE. It was really devastating for our county because everyone just left, including my family. We had to move to the neighboring county. Due to the work CASA has done in the county though that agreement is no longer in place. </span></p>
<p><b>President Biden has “preserved” DACA. How do you feel about his administration’s efforts to do that? And more broadly, how do you feel about DACA’s role in the immigration process?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the Biden administration is definitely a step up from Trump’s administration, in his first 100 days he promised to provide some sort of immigration reform, and he hasn&#8217;t fulfilled that promise. Right now, we’re waiting on HR6</span><b>, </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">which, funnily enough, the hearing is going to be on the anniversary of DACA, which would be a comprehensive immigration reform. And that’s really what we want to see.</span></p>
<p><b>Can you talk about what CASA in Action is and what you’re working on currently?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah, so it is CASA’s sister organization, we do political work and here in Virginia, we’ve been knocking doors since either 2015 or 2016. And I’ve been with them since 2017 working as a canvasser, now I&#8217;m a canvass manager and I&#8217;ve been that ever since 2019. With CASA in Action I’ve been able to take on a team of mostly young people who, just like when I started with CASA in Action, are largely unaware of the system and not very informed on how things work. I&#8217;m able to educate them and put in my part in making change.</span></p>
<p><b>What are your plans for the near future?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortunately here in Virginia, there was some new legislation &#8212; I don&#8217;t really know the specifics of it &#8212; but I heard that there is limited free college, and I&#8217;m not sure if it applies to any of the fields I&#8217;m interested in, but I&#8217;m definitely looking for opportunities out there, because I do want to continue pursuing my education.   </span></p>

<p><b>Anything specific you’d want to do?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Honestly that’s something that I&#8217;m really grappling with right now. Now that I’m more aware of how things work it&#8217;s really tricky. I want to go into something where I could help people without contributing to any of the systems that actively oppress our people. When I first got out of high school I was either going to go into business or some sort of tech route, and I wouldn&#8217;t want to exploit people by taking a job at a military contractor or something like that.</span></p>
<p><b>What is your vision for immigration reform as someone who has experienced this grueling process?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well I think the first step that needs to be taken to fix our broken immigration system is passing HR6 because we have to make sure that we’re not leaving anyone out of the solution. We have to have a comprehensive immigration solution that includes people and has a real pathway to citizenship.</span></p>
<p><b>It’ll be nine years since DACA on Tuesday, do you feel like you can say you’re in the position you are now because of DACA?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Definitely in these past couple years, I&#8217;m in a much better position than I would’ve been without DACA. I honestly don’t know what I would be doing right now if it weren&#8217;t for DACA. And I’m really glad that we have DACA, but I’m gonna keep on fighting until we have that permanent solution.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.immigrationresearch.org/system/files/Implications-of-Immigration-Enforcement-Activities-for-the-Well-Being-of-Children-in-Immigrant-Families.pdf" target="_blank">Hundreds of thousands of immigrant families have been separated by deportation</a> from the United States, in many cases with a parent on one side of the border and children on the other, according to estimates by the Urban Policy Institute and Migration Policy Institute. Reunification is a priority in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/18/us/politics/house-democrats-biden-immigration.html" target="_blank">President Joe Biden’s proposed immigration overhaul</a> and in bills that both the <a href="https://lindasanchez.house.gov/sites/lindasanchez.house.gov/files/2021.02.18%20US%20Citizenship%20Act%20Bill%20Text%20-%20SIGNED.pdf" target="_blank">House</a> and <a href="https://www.menendez.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/USCitizenshipAct2021BillText.pdf" target="_blank">Senate</a> will debate in coming weeks.</p>
<p>Both bills have provisions to preserve “family unity.” These include giving immigration judges increased discretion in deportation cases and allowing the secretary of homeland security or attorney general to waive deportation orders or allow deported parents of U.S. citizen children to return to the U.S.</p>
<p>Under U.S. immigration law, any noncitizen – including legal permanent residents – may be <a href="https://theconversation.com/deported-veterans-stranded-far-from-home-after-years-of-military-service-press-biden-to-bring-them-back-154320" target="_blank">deported for committing a serious crime</a>. Undocumented immigrants may be removed simply for being in the country without a valid visa and banned for 10 years or more.</p>
<p>Since 2016, I have coordinated a digital storytelling project called “<a href="http://humanizandoladeportacion.ucdavis.edu/en/" target="_blank">Humanizing Deportation</a>,” which has published personal narratives, in audiovisual form, from over 250 migrants. It is <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/acrefore/9780199366439.013.855" target="_blank">the world’s largest qualitative database</a> on the human consequences of deportation and other harsh penalties of U.S. immigration law.</p>
<p>Our research shows that deportation doesn’t just hurt the migrants who get deported – it also does serious harm to <a href="https://globalmigration.ucdavis.edu/deported-mothers-mental-health-and-family-separation" target="_blank">their families, especially children</a>.</p>
<p>Here are two such stories, told by the separated families themselves. Our project does not verify migrants’ stories, and what you read here is based on their recollection of events.</p>
<h2><strong>Tania’s story</strong></h2>
<p>Tania Mendoza arrived in California in 1989 at age 3, brought by her parents from Mexico, undocumented, to escape poverty.</p>
<p>In 2010 Tania was arrested after <a href="http://humanizandoladeportacion.ucdavis.edu/en/2018/11/05/115a-dreaming-in-the-shadows/" target="_blank">a domestic dispute with a guy she was dating</a>. Though no charges were filed and Tania had no criminal record, she was turned over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement and deported. She was 24 and a mother.</p>
<p>Just two years later, Tania would have qualified as an undocumented childhood arrival, or “Dreamer,” and been protected from deportation by the Obama-era <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/what-is-daca.html" target="_blank">Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals</a>.</p>
<p>Her toddler daughter remained with the child’s father in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Tania recalls her daughter watching her get detained by the L.A. Police Department: “That was the last time I ever saw her,” <a href="http://humanizandoladeportacion.ucdavis.edu/en/2018/11/05/115b-feelings-are-feelings-and-family-is-family-part-ii/" target="_blank">she told us tearfully</a>.</p>
<figure class="align-center "><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
<p>Tania says separation from her daughter was the hardest part of life after deportation. Since she shared custody with the father, she could not take her daughter with her to Mexico without his consent.</p>
<p>Mother and daughter stayed in touch by phone until 2016, when the father – to whom she was not married – cut off all contact.</p>
<p>“He took her phone away and just decided she was better off without me,” Tania said. “So my heart broke even more.”</p>
<p>After two years without contact, a family court judge awarded Tania phone visitation rights – the best proxy for enforcing the existing shared custody agreement due to Tania’s removal from the country.</p>
<p>Tania has communicated regularly with her daughter since but has not seen her, except on a screen, for over 10 years.</p>
<p>Nowadays, she says, getting a simple text like “Hi, Mom, how was your day?” fills Tania with feelings of hope.</p>
<h2><strong>Losing mom or dad</strong></h2>
<p>Family separation made headlines during the Trump administration, when Central American families seeking asylum were separated at the border. <a href="https://www.voanews.com/usa/immigration/obstacles-persist-reuniting-families-separated-us-mexico-border" target="_blank">About 500 families remain separated</a> today.</p>
<p>But family separation <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/oct/15/immigration-boy-reform-obama-deportations-families-separated" target="_blank">occurred during the Obama administration</a>, too. Between 2009 and 2016, the U.S. expelled an <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/immigration-statistics/yearbook/2019/table39#" target="_blank">average of 383,000 immigrants per year</a>, according to Department of Homeland Security data. That surpasses Trump, whose government deported 325,000 annually over the first three years of his administration. George W. Bush’s administration averaged 252,000 deportations a year.</p>
<p>So many <a href="http://humanizandoladeportacion.ucdavis.edu/en/about-the-project/" target="_blank">deported immigrants who’ve shared their stories with us</a> tell of the deep and enduring damage inflicted when their removal meant that their children lost their mom or dad.</p>
<p>Parents are <a href="https://theconversation.com/deported-twice-man-struggles-to-help-his-family-survive-90734" target="_blank">rarely able to provide or care for their families from abroad</a>. And the trauma of losing a loved one for an extended, indefinite period can be significant, <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Ftra0000177" target="_blank">especially for children</a>. Psychologists have observed <a href="https://theconversation.com/living-on-the-edge-are-americas-deportation-laws-traumatising-immigrants-74663" target="_blank">anxiety, depression, hyperactivity and other symptoms commonly associated with post-traumatic stress disorder</a> in children who’ve lost a parent to deportation.</p>
<p>Why don’t deported parents just take the kids with them? As Tania’s story shows, this is not always practical, or even possible.</p>
<h2><strong>Rosa and Zuri</strong></h2>
<p>When Rosa Ortega’s husband was taken to an immigration detention center in San Bernardino, California, in 2017, and then deported to his native Peru, it was a devastating ordeal for the couple’s three young children.</p>
<p>In the <a href="http://humanizandoladeportacion.ucdavis.edu/en/2017/12/04/steppin-in/" target="_blank">story Rosa and her daughter Zuri recorded for us that same year</a>, Rosa says she didn’t know how to explain to the children why their father was taken from their house in handcuffs, nor answer their questions about how long he would be gone.</p>
<p>Rosa’s eldest child, Zuri, a teenager, had to step in and assume responsibilities usually handled by her father.</p>
<p>“Instead of him being there on [my sister’s] first day of kindergarten, it was me,” Zuri told us.</p>
<p>She said losing her father had forced her to “mature and grow up” and that she deals with “more than what you are supposed to” because she is “filling in that role as a parent but still being a child at the same time.”</p>
<p>Zuri is among the thousands of children who just might get to see their dad again under Biden’s immigration reform plan.</p>
<p>But it has to pass the House and Senate first.</p>

(VCU Capital News Service) </p><p><strong>By Diane Burkley Alejandro and Luis Aguilar </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a ground-breaking measure, the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors last week unveiled its </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“trust policy”</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">to prohibit voluntary cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The policy forbids county employees, including police, from asking about or disclosing a person’s immigration status unless required by law, a judicial warrant or court order. It also limits the collection and sharing of other personal information with those outside of local government. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.fairfaxcounty.gov/topics/sites/topics/files/assets/documents/pdf/fairfax-county-trust-policy.pdf" target="_blank">The trust policy</a> responds to the concerns of local immigrants, as shown in a recent CASA survey, that any contact with the county government can lead to their deportation because of inter-governmental cooperation. This absence of trust has been painfully apparent during the COVID-19 pandemic, with many immigrant residents afraid to apply for assistance or seek county services despite the disproportionate impact it has had on their community. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lack of trust is also a threat to public safety because it impedes cooperation with local law enforcement. As one ACLU People Power Fairfax member testified, “my husband and I were at a Latino restaurant when we heard a commotion outside. We saw a crowd surrounding a man face down in a pool of blood. When the sound of a police siren was heard, the crowd quickly disappeared. Who wants to risk deportation to be a witness?” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Board Chair Jeff McKay promised that the trust policy “marks a new chapter in Fairfax County” and that the “days of fear in Fairfax County are over. We will do everything we can to help people, [to] protect them from association with ICE but, more importantly, help them get the services and the access to their county government they need. It’s also important that people in our community feel comfortable coming forward when they’re victims of crime.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The policy prohibits voluntary cooperation with ICE civil enforcement, including sharing citizenship and immigration status information by all county agencies. It also restricts the collection or sharing of other types of personal information to the minimum “required to fulfill the mission or obligations of the Fairfax department.” Agencies must develop written directives and review forms to ensure these standards are met. The trust policy also expands the type of identification documents that can be used when a photo ID is required for government services, including an ID issued by a pre-approved non-profit organization. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The expanded privacy protection benefits all Fairfax residents, who rightfully are concerned with identity theft, release of arrest records and other intrusions into their personal lives. It is especially critical, however, for immigrants. ICE has exploited the weaknesses of federal and state privacy law to track down its &#8220;targets.&#8221; Addresses, social security numbers or their absence, date of release from jail, place of birth and national origin can be used to locate </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">individuals it seeks to apprehend. Data-mining technologies largely run by contractors like Amazon, Lexus-Nexus and Thomson-Reuters collect such information for ICE without the restrictions placed on government agencies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under this policy, cooperation with criminal law enforcement will continue. But ICE’s civil enforcement lacks the constitutional protections of criminal law; its “administrative warrants” are based on a faulty database, leading to the arrest of U.S. citizens and authorized immigrants by mistake. These arrests tear people away from their families, place them into an unjust and inhumane incarceration system, put their jobs, health and safety and lives at risk and doom many to exile in a country they fear or left so long ago they do not even know. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Fairfax Trust Policy could have kept families together, such as the family of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liliana Mendez</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Liliana was deported to El Salvador, even after receiving a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">pardon</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">for her traffic infraction. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maintaining and promoting trust in Fairfax is an ongoing challenge. It is not yet clear when the Sheriff’s Office and schools will be covered by the policy, although we are working toward this goal. We commend Fairfax Commonwealth’s Attorney Steve Descano for already adopting key </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">protections for immigrants; we are working with him to expand and finalize his interim trust policy. At the end of the day, county residents interact with one local government, and for there to be trust, it is a two-way street. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even under a new presidential administration with promised reforms, there is no guarantee that ICE will transform its practices. The administration </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/feb/08/us-ice-immigration-customs-enforcement-haiti-deportations" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">has deported 20 children to Haiti</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> despite implementing new directives limiting such deportations.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fundamental result of the Fairfax Trust policy is not that it should create trust or calm the  concern or even fear that some of its immigrant residents may have; it is the creation of a more  just county and society that engages all of its residents through an equitable approach. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fairfax is the first locality in the commonwealth to end voluntary cooperation with ICE. It must not be the last. </span></p>
<p><strong><i>Diane Burkley Alejandro and Luis Aguilar co-led the years-long advocacy campaign for adoption of the Trust Policy. Alejandro is a social justice government-relations attorney and the lead advocate for the grassroots organization ACLU People Power Fairfax. Aguilar is the Virginia director of CASA, the largest immigrant justice group in the region. </i></strong></p>

<p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. House took up two bills Thursday that would grant legal status to broad groups of immigrants living and working in the United States, including a pathway to citizenship for hundreds of thousands of undocumented people brought to the country as children.</p>
<p>The measures mark the first step towards what advocates for immigration reform hope will be a year or two of substantive action on the issue. However, as debate on the House floor on Thursday made clear, the caustic rhetoric surrounding a recent upsurge of young migrants crossing the Southern border shows that chances for bipartisanship are dwindling.</p>
<p>Overall, nine Republicans supported the measure giving a path to citizenship to immigrants protected under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, compared to seven who voted in favor of the measure in 2019. It passed 228-197.</p>
<p>However, rather than reflecting new broad support in the congressional GOP for this policy, the uptick is likely attributable to more Republicans holding swing district seats after sweeping the November elections.</p>
<p>For instance, Florida Reps. María Elvira Salazar and Carlos Gimenez, who beat Democrats Donna Shalala and Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, respectively, were new lawmakers to vote for the Dreamer bill. So was Rep. David Valadao, a Californian in his fourth term.</p>
<p>Other moderate Republicans supporting the measures included Reps. Mario Diaz-Balart of Florida, Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania and Fred Upton of Michigan.</p>
<p>After casting her vote, Salazar told reporters that she thought the bill was little more than a partisan gimmick, but wanted to show Democrats a gesture of good faith, because she has a competing bill in the works that would pair a pathway to citizenship with more border security.</p>
<p>“I want to send the right message to the Democrats that I&#8217;m willing to work with them,” she said. “Let&#8217;s see if now they&#8217;re going to work with us, so they will not say that the Republicans are the racists, or the Republicans are the uncompassionate ones.”</p>
<p>Democrats said the legislation is a moral imperative. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, a Maryland Democrat, said during debate on the bills that immigrants with temporary status and others living in the shadows, including Dreamers and farmworkers, deserve relief.</p>
<p>“Immigrants are a reason why America became the world’s most powerful and most prosperous country,” he said. “This legislation today is a major achievement and will hasten the moment when 3 to 4 million immigrants and their families can breathe a little easier, a little freer, knowing that they are welcomed and valued here in America, that they are truly a part of our country.”</p>
<p>Others centered the issue as a matter of local importance. For instance, U.S. Rep. Greg Stanton, a Democrat, said he voted “Yes” for the roughly 24,000 Dreamers in his home state of Arizona, many of whom work as essential employees, doing everything from stocking grocery shelves to practicing medicine.</p>
<p>“We are telling Dreamers all over our country, ‘We see you. we hear you. and we know your home is here in the United States of America,’” he said. “Dreamers are essential to rebuilding our economy and it&#8217;s long past time we put them on a path to citizenship.”</p>
<p>However, predicting a tougher road for the legislation in the U.S. Senate, Republicans by and large opposed both measures, citing the familiar objections to “amnesty” for people who came here without prior authorization, especially in the wake of an unfolding overwhelming situation of increased migration at the Southern border.</p>
<p>“On the heels of this border crisis that is going on right now, there&#8217;s a bill on the House floor to create amnesty, to create a bigger magnet, saying, ‘Come to the Southern border,’” House Minority Whip Steve Scalise, (R-La.), said on the House floor.</p>
<p>Other hard-right Republicans objected to specific items in the bills. For instance, Rep. Jim Jordan, an Ohio Republican who was managing floor debate on the Dreamer bill, objected to a section that would create a grant program to fund nonprofit organizations who help immigrants through the application process.</p>
<p>“This bill gives amnesty to 3 million illegals and uses American tax dollars to help those same illegals apply for the amnesty,” Jordan said. “The disrespect that the Democrats have for the American taxpayer, it&#8217;s astounding to me.”</p>
<p>House members were expected to vote on a bill to give legal status to undocumented agricultural workers later Thursday night.</p>
<p>One Republican member who voted for a similar bill in 2019, Rep. Mike Simpson of Idaho, laced into members of his own party on the House floor for tying the issue to the current migrant situation.</p>
<p>“This bill is not about what is happening on the border, but that seems to be what all the debate is about,” he said. “This bill is not amnesty, it does not grant anybody amnesty. It allows individuals to get right with the law and to become legal workforce in the United States. It&#8217;s about providing a stable legal workforce for the people who put food on our tables.”</p>
<p>A senior White House official told reporters Thursday they are indeed seeing an increase in unaccompanied children coming across the border — 29,000 so far this fiscal year, in fact — but said the administration is trying to clean up the mess left by the Trump administration, and would be happy to work with Republicans on doing so.</p>
<p>The Biden administration released statements earlier in the day supporting House passage of both bills, but also noting they want Congress to take up broader immigration reform, like the U.S. Citizenship Act. That bill, based on Biden’s policy outline, would pair these measures with broader efforts to give legal status to millions more immigrants, as well as some border security measures and aid to Latin American countries to address what the White House sees as root causes of northbound migration.</p>
<p>U.S. Sen. Bob Menendez, (D-N.J.), a New Jersey Democrat who is carrying that bill in the U.S. Senate, told reporters Thursday that he appreciates the House is moving the conversation along, but wants to include these pieces of legislation in a larger conversation about broad, bipartisan immigration reform.</p>
<p><strong><em>CORRECTION:</em></strong><em> A list of Republicans in this report who voted in favor of the DREAM Act mistakenly included Rep. Mark Amodei of Nevada.</em></p>

(Ned Oliver/ Virginia Mercury)</p><p><strong>By Yely Montano</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a daughter of immigrants, Virginia has always been a home for my family. It wasn’t until I got older when I started hearing how other immigrant families outside of the state perceived Virginia. Virginia is unsafe for immigrants. Virginia is where the police will hand you over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Virginia is where they discriminate against you. Virginia is not welcoming. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, new leadership in the General Assembly has begun to change that, and groundbreaking laws passed in the last year have made this Virginian proud. Virginia made headlines by extending driving privileges to the immigrant community in 2020 — long overdue and years behind its neighbors in Maryland and the District of Columbia. Virginia also granted in-state tuition eligibility to all students, regardless of immigration status. Both were major victories for the immigrant community, and this year we celebrate more. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2021 Virginia legislative session passed </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=212&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb2138" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB 2138</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which authorizes the Department of Motor Vehicles to issue a non-driver photo identification option to immigrant adults and children who cannot or have no interest in operating a motor vehicle. Many of us don’t think about this daily but having a form of identification grants us access to schools, health care clinics and other institutions. It’s what we need to set up a bank account or cash a check, allowing us to better engage in our economy. It’s what we rely on in cases of emergencies or interactions with law enforcement. Once this bill becomes law, all Virginians will have greater access to services, better security, and dignity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The General Assembly also passed </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=212&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb2163" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB 2163</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, limiting the release and dissemination of data from the DMV for civil immigration purposes. For years, ICE has taken advantage of DMV data in other states that have extended driving privileges to immigrants. In passing this legislation, Virginia is taking the necessary steps to protect all consumers. It’s encouraging the immigrant community to apply for credentials at the DMV safely while bolstering greater trust between the two, which is vital, especially during this time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia demonstrated its commitment to supporting our future leaders and professionals by passing legislation that would allow undocumented students to apply for state financial aid and assistance programs in passing </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=212&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb2123" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB 2123 </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=212&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=sb1387" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SB 1387</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Virginia joins the </span><a href="https://www.nilc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/table-access-to-ed-toolkit.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">14 states</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">that have extended this option, giving our undocumented students an equal opportunity to accessing higher education, allowing them a better chance of achieving their career goals and contributing to our economy and communities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A virtual, 45-day legislative session brought exceptional progress for the immigrant community and our state as a whole, especially in criminal justice reform. During the 2020 special session, the state passed numerous police reform measures. Historic changes like abolishing the death penalty, legalizing future adult marijuana use and establishing an automatic expungement process for certain records passed this year. We are steadily evolving our policies to reflect our values and represent </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">all </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginians. But there is still a lot of work ahead of us. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Immigrants continue to get left behind on accessing preventive health care coverage and COVID-19 services, and now, vaccinations. Language and interpretation service options and quality are poor in health care spaces and governmental outreach and communication efforts. Immigrants are ineligible for public and social services and their trust with government and law enforcement is low, which, as the pandemic has demonstrated, can result in adverse outcomes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As someone who was born and raised in Virginia, I am proud of my state. I am proud to see what it&#8217;s becoming, but I know we can only continue on this path of progress with the right leadership — and challenging that leadership when necessary. By passing inclusive policies, the characterization of Virginia as unwelcoming to immigrants is shifting. I believe we are headed in the right direction, and we are only witnessing the beginning. Virginia is home. Let&#8217;s keep up the good work.</span></p>

<p>Abbie Arevalo and her lawyer cited <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/02/18/969083367/biden-tells-ice-to-chill-new-rules-limit-who-immigration-agents-target-for-arres" target="_blank">new guidelines</a> issued by President Joe Biden’s administration, which allowed her to obtain a one-year stay of removal while her asylum case works its way through immigration courts.</p>
<p>“When I came here, I knew no one and I was afraid,” Arevalo, 33, said in a statement thanking the congregation for taking her in. “Today I am happy to have my freedom but am reminded I made good friends here.”</p>
<p>In recent days, news outlets reported similar outcomes from immigrants sheltering in churches <a href="https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/metro/reunited-alex-garcia-honduran-immigrant-and-father-leaves-sanctuary-in-maplewood-church-after-3-years/article_c1d8c913-b6d8-549d-9d33-4848598f4959.html" target="_blank">around</a> the <a href="https://www.dispatch.com/story/news/2021/02/23/another-columbus-woman-released-immigration-sanctuary/4564025001/" target="_blank">country</a>.</p>
<p>Arevalo fled Honduras with her daughter in 2013 to escape an abusive husband, seeking protection she said she could not get from her country’s court system.</p>
<p>She was living in Richmond and working as a roofer in 2018 when Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents ordered her deportation while her case was still pending. Instead of surrendering to ICE, she joined what was then a growing sanctuary movement, in which dozens of immigrants facing deportation took up residence in houses of worship, which ICE classifies as “sensitive locations” and prohibits immigration raids.</p>

<p>For the past 32 months, she lived in the basement of the First Unitarian Universalist Church of Richmond, which converted Sunday school rooms into bedrooms. In 2019, <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/07/21/ice-ordered-her-deportation-instead-shes-spent-the-last-year-living-in-a-richmond-church-i-will-not-dare-to-put-a-foot-outside/" target="_blank">a year into her stay</a>, she told the Mercury through an interpreter that she had no option other than to “just wait for something to change.”</p>
<p>Last month, that change came when Biden issued an order ending the crackdown on immigration initiated by President Donald Trump, directing ICE to prioritize national security and pubic safety when making arrests and directing deportation &#8212; a step Arevalo’s lawyer, Alina Kilpatrick, said cleared the way for her to leave sanctuary without fear of detention.</p>
<p>She moved back in with her family in Henrico last week.</p>
<p>“This was the right result. I am grateful to the Biden administration for keeping its promise to immigrant families,” said Kilpatrick, who for a time lived in the church with Arevalo in case agents attempted to breach the church, in a statement. “Abbie will continue to pursue her legal options as a free woman. Her children deserve to have a mother who can hold their hand at the doctor, cheer at their sports games and play with them in the park. Now, they have that.”</p>
<p>Likewise, the church’s executive minister, Rev. Sherman Z. Logan Jr., celebrated the news.</p>
<p>“Oh, Happy Day!,” he wrote. “During the past 32 months, I was impressed with the way Abbie handled her ordeal with grace, dignity, courage and faith. We all could learn a lesson on how to deal with adversity from Abbie, as I most certainly did.”</p>

The location is in an area where migrants frequently turn themselves in and ask for asylum in the U.S. after crossing the border.  Approximately 1,000 migrants per day were being released by authorities in the El Paso sector of the U.S.-Mexico border amidst a surge in asylum seekers arriving at the Southern border.

<div id="modal-ready">
<p>WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden signed three executive orders on Tuesday evening that will reverse controversial policies from the previous administration, including one that resulted in the separation of migrant children from their parents.</p>
<p>Biden made it clear during the signing that he was not creating new immigration policies with the executive orders, but reversing those crafted under the Trump administration.</p>
<p>“I’m not making new law,” he said to reporters during the signing. “I’m eliminating bad policy.”</p>
<p>Fulfilling a promise Biden made during his campaign, one of the executive orders will eliminate the Trump administration’s “zero tolerance” policy, meant to deter immigrants from crossing the border, and instead create a task force to help reunite parents with their children.</p>
<p>Under the Trump administration, more than 5,500 immigrant families were separated. A recent court <a href="http://cdn.cnn.com/cnn/2020/images/12/02/ms.l.ice.joint.status.report..pdf" target="_blank">filing</a> found that 628 children remain separated from their parents.</p>
<p>“This task force will work across the U.S. government, with key stakeholders and representatives of impacted families, and with partners across the hemisphere to find parents and children separated by the Trump Administration,” according to a White House press release.</p>
<p>The signing of the orders came just after the Senate confirmation of Alejandro Nicholas Mayorkas to be secretary of Homeland Security, the agency in charge of immigration law, in a 56-43 vote.</p>
<p>Republican Sens. Rob Portman of Ohio, Susan Collins of Maine, Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, Mitt Romney of Utah and Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan of Alaska voted with all 50 Democrats to confirm Mayorkas.</p>
<p>Mayorkas is the first Latino and immigrant to lead the agency.</p>
<p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) in a statement praised the executive orders.</p>
<p>“These Executive Actions honor our values by reunifying separated families, reforming our asylum process and promoting inclusion of new Americans into our communities,” she said.</p>
<p>“And they restore sanity and common sense to our immigration system —replacing the chaos and cruelty of the Trump approach with stepped-up and more constructive engagement with our partners in the region to address the root causes of migration.”</p>
<p>Biden’s second executive order will review reasons for migration, work with regional partners to provide protection for asylum seekers and will “ensure that Central American refugees and asylum seekers have access to legal avenues to the United States.”</p>
<p>“The situation at the border will not transform overnight, due in large part to the damage done over the last four years,” according to the White House. “But the President is committed to an approach that keeps our country safe, strong, and prosperous and that also aligns with our values.”</p>
<p>The third executive order re-establishes a Task Force on New Americans, which will help establish that the U.S. “legal immigration system operates fairly and efficiently.”</p>
<p>Juliana Macedo do Nascimento, the state and local policy manager for United We Dream, an immigrant advocacy group, said in an interview that she’s hoping the Biden administration continues to work on progressive immigration reform, since these orders are mostly designed to review and set up task forces rather than implement policy.</p>
<p>She pointed to one of Biden’s executive orders that will review a policy enacted by the Trump administration to punish immigrants for using social services such as WIC, food assistance for women and children. The public charge rule was created under DHS in 2019 and could deny immigrants access to green cards if they receive public benefits such as housing or food assistance.</p>
<p>“It was a cruel policy that was designed to instill fear in immigrant communities,” she said.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At a pediatric clinic in Northern Virginia, two sisters were having a hard time sitting still as they waited to be seen for the first time. The youngest proudly exclaimed that she was three. Their parents introduced themselves and proceeded to recount the girls’ complicated medical histories. Both suffer from epilepsy, and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">without their medications, have uncontrolled seizures.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The girls’ parents explained the numerous hardships that their young children have already faced — seizures, hospitalizations and painful procedures. But they now face an additional challenge that most do not.  In Virginia, neither child has access to public health insurance due to their undocumented immigration status. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result, their ability to receive life-saving medications is fraught with obstacles. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The medications the girls require cost thousands of dollars a month. Obtaining them with insurance is already challenging and nearly impossible without it.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> For a time, family friends sent medicines from abroad, but delays in these shipments brought the family to seek help now. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They needed a neurologist in Virginia and a stable source of medication. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As pediatricians, we recognize that any other documented child in this same situation would not only have medications but would also have an EEG or an MRI or genetic testing. Yet the reality is that these girls will not. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> As young doctors who are optimistic, energetic and not burnt out; we can make a lot of phone calls coordinating care for patients and can get a lot done. But we cannot come up with a lasting and permanent solution to help these kids.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, the challenge that these sisters face is not unusual. While some other states ensure that all children, regardless of immigration status, have access to health coverage, Virginia is not among them. Here, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">an estimated 13,000 immigrant children lack any form of health insurance. This number is likely increasing. In 2019 alone, more than 4,000 unaccompanied migrant children fleeing unsafe conditions across the border settled with sponsors in Virginia. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many are from El Salvador, where teenagers <a href="https://theconversation.com/central-american-kids-come-to-the-us-fleeing-record-high-youth-murder-rates-at-home-99132#:~:text=A%20child%20living%20in%20Guatemala,lives%20in%20the%20United%20States.&amp;text=Homicide%20data%20comes%20from%20numerous%20government%20and%20non%2Dgovernmental%20sources." target="_blank">are 10 times more likely to die</a> by homicide than in the United States. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite ongoing medical needs and enduring psychological trauma, these vulnerable children lack adequate access to health care.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first step to finding any solution is to understand the existing problem.  As members of the Virginia Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, we support a proposal for the current 2021 General Assembly to begin this important work.  Sen. Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond, and Del. Paul Krizek, D-Fairfax, have introduced budget amendments that request the Department of Medical Assistance Services convene a workgroup to explore the current disparity in health care access for children in Virginia. This would include researching the medical and financial implications of expanding coverage for undocumented children. This is a measure that would have no immediate fiscal impact and would begin the necessary conversation around improving access to healthcare for all children.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. famously said, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Of all the forms of inequality, injustice in healthcare is the most shocking and inhumane.”  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Immigrant children arrive in our commonwealth for a variety of complex reasons, many times fleeing unsafe conditions with or without a parent, seeking a place of safety.  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As pediatricians, we believe that every child has a right to healthcare, and that every child has a right to grow and thrive to their fullest potential, in all circumstances and without any conditions.  We ask that the Virginia General Assembly begin this critical discussion on how we can work together toward achieving this more equitable goal.</span></p>

<div id="modal-ready">
<p>WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden is poised to send a sweeping immigration reform bill to Congress Thursday that would lay out a path for nearly 11 million undocumented people to obtain citizenship within eight years.</p>
<p>Immigration has been one of the toughest issues for Congress to tackle, and the legislation’s fate is unclear in a House in which Democrats wield narrower control than in the past and a 50-50 Senate where Vice President Kamala Harris can break a tie vote for Democrats. There were an estimated 275,000 undocumented immigrants in Virginia as of 2016 according to <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/hispanic/interactives/u-s-unauthorized-immigrants-by-state/" target="_blank">Pew Research</a>.</p>
<p>But Biden has pledged to act swiftly on immigration, and his proposed legislation is accompanied by executive actions including halting construction on the border wall, ending the Trump administration ban on U.S. entry for people from  Muslim-majority nations and pausing some deportations.</p>
<p>The Biden administration released a <a href="https://mailchi.mp/bidentransition/ascertainment-news-statement-3590430?e=076c33e6d6" target="_blank">summary</a> of its bill, the U.S. Citizenship Act of 2021, which would also allow applicants in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival to apply for permanent residency.</p>
<p>DACA is an Obama administration initiative for individuals brought into the country illegally as children, and there are more than 700,000 people enrolled.</p>
<p>The proposal is a stark difference from the Trump administration, which spent four years assaulting any form of immigration in the U.S., from trying to eliminate the DACA program to separating families at the border. The last time the U.S. passed sweeping immigration reform was 1986.</p>
<p>“Today, President Biden turned the page on a dark chapter in American history,” House Homeland Security Chairman Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.) said in a statement. “The time to fix our broken immigration system is long overdue, and I look forward to working with President Biden and his Administration towards securing much needed reforms.”</p>
<p>If passed by Congress, the bill would allow undocumented individuals such as DACA recipients, Temporary Protective Status holders and “immigrant farmworkers who meet specific requirements” to apply for temporary legal status. After five years, those individuals could apply for green cards if they pass background checks and show they pay taxes.</p>
<p>After three more years, those green card holders could apply to become citizens if they again pass background checks and pass the citizenship test.</p>
<p>While the bill would likely pass the House, it’s unclear if Democrats have enough votes in the Senate.</p>
<p>The last time Democrats tried to pass a bipartisan immigration bill that would have laid out a path to citizenship within 13 years for undocumented people was in 2013. It passed the Senate, 68-32, but was never brought to the House floor under Republican control.</p>
<p>Even without Congress, the Biden administration Department of Homeland Security is moving forward with pausing removal of noncitizens who are under deportation orders “to ensure we have a fair and effective immigration enforcement system focused on protecting national security, border security, and public safety,” <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/21_0120_enforcement-memo_signed.pdf" target="_blank">the agency said in a memo Wednesday.</a></p>
<p>“The pause will allow DHS to ensure that its resources are dedicated to responding to the most pressing challenges that the United States faces, including immediate operational challenges at the southwest border in the midst of the most serious global public health crisis in a century,” the agency said.</p>
<p>Biden’s bill reforms family-based immigration by allowing “immigrants with approved family-sponsorship petitions to join family in the United States on a temporary basis while they wait for green cards to become available.” It also clears backlogs, eliminates wait times and increases the number of per-country visa caps.</p>
<p>The bill would also improve immigration courts by expanding programs to manage family cases, which would reduce backlogs in court and also expand training for judges to handle those cases.</p>
<p>A large section of the proposal also aims to deal with the causes of mass migration.</p>
<p>The bill allocates $4 billion to address migration in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, with the goal of reducing “corruption, violence, and poverty that causes people to flee their home countries.” It would also reinstate the Central American Minors program, which reunites children with their relatives in the U.S., and would also create “the Central American Family Reunification Parole Program to more quickly unite families with approved family sponsorship petitions.”</p>
<p>Republicans and other members of the GOP have already voiced their opposition to Biden’s immigration reform plan.</p>
<p>National Republican Senatorial Committee Spokesman Chris Hartline said in a statement that the proposal was radical.</p>
<p>“The proposal by President Biden would give amnesty to eleven million illegal immigrants with no effort whatsoever to secure the border,” he said.</p>
<p>However, the proposal does address security at the border and focuses on using technology to screen for narcotics and other contraband at various checkpoints.</p>
<p>It also allows for the expansion of investigations into drug trafficking and allows DHS to develop strategies to improve ports of entries for asylum seekers.</p>

(Susan J. Demas/ Michigan Advance)</p><p>In 2016, Virginia-based immigration lawyer Hassan Ahmad sent the University of Michigan a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to access sealed papers donated to the university by John Tanton, a prominent anti-immigration activist from Michigan.</p>
<p>But the public university denied the request until 2035.</p>
<p>After years of lower court battles and lawsuits, the issue went <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/MichiganCourts" target="_blank">before</a> the Michigan Supreme Court Wednesday.</p>
<p>The initial interest in the <a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/b/bhlead/umich-bhl-861056?byte=55030716;focusrgn=contentslist;subview=standard;view=reslist" target="_blank">boxes</a> of papers stored in the university’s library began when Ahmad saw a photo of former Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, who is known for his strong anti-immigration policies, with then President-elect Donald Trump in 2016. Kobach at the time was vying to be Trump’s pick to head the Department of Homeland Security.</p>
<figure id="attachment_5944" class="wp-caption aligncenter" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5944"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-5944 size-large td-animation-stack-type0-2" src="https://www.michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Steve-Bannon-Kris-Kobach-Ken-Coleman-photo-1024x681.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" srcset="https://www.michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Steve-Bannon-Kris-Kobach-Ken-Coleman-photo-1024x681.jpg 1024w, https://www.michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Steve-Bannon-Kris-Kobach-Ken-Coleman-photo-300x199.jpg 300w, https://www.michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Steve-Bannon-Kris-Kobach-Ken-Coleman-photo-768x511.jpg 768w" alt="" width="696" height="463" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-5944" class="wp-caption-text">Steve Bannon and Kris Kobach speak at Cobo for a “We Build the Wall” event, March 14, 2019 | Ken Coleman</figcaption></figure>
<p>Ahmad said he feared what Trump’s administration would mean for his clients and what he would be able to do as an immigration attorney.</p>
<p>So Ahmad started looking into who in Trump’s cabinet could affect immigration policies and what they believe.</p>
<p>“Well, if Kris Kobach is going to be the type of person that’s going to be brought into this administration, we need to figure out who else is going to be on there and where they are tied to,” Ahmad said. “And the more you look, all roads lead back to John Tanton.”</p>
<h2><b>So who is John Tanton?</b></h2>
<p>Tanton, who died in 2019 in Petoskey, Michigan, from Parkinson’s disease, is known as the founder of the modern anti-immigration movement.</p>
<p>He was a leader in population-control activism and promoted eugenics, heading organizations like Zero Population Growth. He also chaired Sierra Club’s National Population Committee and founded the Northern Michigan chapter of Planned Parenthood.</p>
<p>Tanton pushed for English to be the only national language of the United States, a border wall with Mexico and a limit on the number of authorized immigrants allowed in the country.</p>
<p>He founded a network of anti-immigration organizations, commonly known as the Tanton Network. According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, Tanton established seven organizations, including the Center for Immigration Studies, Federation for Anti-Immigration Reform (FAIR) and the Social Contract Press. He also funded another five anti-immigration organizations and sat on the board of Population-Environment Balance.</p>
<p>“They’re the ones that end up filing amicus briefs and advising members of Congress and policy makers and getting quoted in the media as simply the opposing side to immigration,” Ahmad said. “All the while never being taken to task seriously on the fact that their founder and ethos was rooted in eugenics, race science and White nationalism.”</p>
<p>Many of Tanton’s beliefs helped shape core conservative policies on immigration, which Trump campaigned on and pushed for throughout his presidency.</p>
<p>“I knew who [Tanton] was, but I didn’t appreciate the centrality of his role in actually building this entire movement,” Ahmad said. “It was then that I came across for the first time the fact that he had donated his papers to U of M-Ann Arbor. And when I went on to the Bentley Historical Library website, I found curiously that half of his papers were sealed until 2035.”</p>
<p>Tanton donated 25 boxes of documents to the university under the agreement that 10 of the boxes not be “utilized, possessed, or retained in the performance of any official University function.”</p>
<p>Ahmad became invested in finding out what is in those sealed boxes.</p>
<h2><b>The battle for the papers </b></h2>
<figure id="attachment_35412" class="wp-caption alignright" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-35412"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-35412 td-animation-stack-type0-2" src="https://www.michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/542011.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="216" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-35412" class="wp-caption-text">Hassan Ahmad</figcaption></figure>
<p>Ahmad submitted a FOIA request to U of M for access to the 10 sealed boxes, thinking that it wouldn’t turn into much of an issue, he said.</p>
<p>But the university fought him tooth and nail, denying his initial request and denying him again when he appealed. So in 2017, Ahmad sued the university.</p>
<p>“I started to think that there must be something here,” Ahmad said. “What’s going on? Why are they fighting so hard to keep these papers secret?”</p>
<p>According to the university’s library, the sealed boxes contain FAIR meeting minutes dating back to 1979, nine folders labelled ‘Pioneer Fund,’ which is a group that promotes eugenics, folders on state-specific immigration policies, information on a number of anti-immigration organizations and Tanton’s private correspondences.</p>
<p>The lawsuit was initially thrown out by the state’s Court of Claims ruling in favor of the university. But in July 2019, the state’s Court of Appeals dismissed the lower court’s decision, ruling that the sealed documents are public records and should be made available.</p>
<p>The university then appealed the case to the Michigan Supreme Court.</p>
<p>“The reason the university appealed this case to the state Supreme Court is because we do not want would-be donors to be deterred from donating private records of historical significance to a historical library at a public university, in this case, the Bentley Historical Library,” U of M spokesperson Rick Fitzgerald said. “That would negate FOIA’s purpose of enhancing public access to information and make it more difficult for scholars, students and the broader public to understand Michigan history, including its flaws and its challenges.”</p>
<p>For Ahmad, the issue with this lawsuit and the challenge from the university is two-fold.</p>
<figure id="attachment_8863" class="wp-caption aligncenter" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-8863"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-8863 size-large td-animation-stack-type0-2" src="https://www.michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/DSC07887-1024x683.jpeg" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" srcset="https://www.michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/DSC07887-1024x683.jpeg 1024w, https://www.michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/DSC07887-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://www.michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/DSC07887-768x512.jpeg 768w" alt="" width="696" height="464" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-8863" class="wp-caption-text">Michigan Supreme Court | Susan J. Demas</figcaption></figure>
<p>Ahmad says the case is a government transparency issue, but he also believes the public deserves how key immigration policies that integrated in our current political climate originated.</p>
<p>“I think it’s problematic. Aside from the public importance of public interest in these papers that shed a light on the intellectual blueprint of the entire movement that has been creating the policies that we’ve seen implemented over the past four years, it’s just a basic issue of government transparency,” Ahmad said. “I mean should a public entity, like the University of Michigan, be allowed to contract this way around FOIA and not even have to show the contract? That’s really what this case is about right now.”</p>
<p>In Ahmad’s <a href="http://www.hmalegal.com/uploads/3/7/9/2/3792932/pkg_ahmad_v_umich_web_20170605_hma.pdf" target="_blank">lawsuit</a>, he includes a 1989 letter from the Bentley Historical Library asking to preserve Tanton’s papers, where the university states that the papers “reflect his important role in virtually every major contemporary conservation effort in our state and nation.”</p>
<p>“I think it’s a bit disingenuous for the university to now claim that they are worried about the potential chilling effect this could have,” Ahmad said. “Look, there’s a number of different things Tanton and the university could have done if he really was that concerned about not passing on his papers. He knew he was dealing with a public university. He obviously was concerned about who was going to see his papers, and it would have been very easy for him to either bequeath them to the university in his will or to create a trust to have the papers pass after a certain period of time. He did none of that.”</p>
<p>Ahmad believes that under Michigan’s laws, the papers are public records and subject to FOIA because they are possessed by a public entity.</p>
<p>The university isn’t arguing that any FOIA exemptions, such as sensitive law enforcement information, apply to the papers, Ahmad said.</p>
<p>“They’re not saying that any of those apply. What they’re saying is that the papers will not become public record until April 6, 2035,” said Ahmad. “There is no exemption that says that you can contract your way around. The issue is: When does a document that is given to a public entity or created in the public entity become subject to FOIA? And the answer to that question is when it is used as asked or retained by that public entity in furtherance of an official purpose … It’s kind of hard for the university to argue that they weren’t doing it for an official purpose when they were the ones seeking the papers out to begin.”</p>
<h2><b>‘It’s high time’ to trace the history of these policies</b></h2>
<p>“There’s something in there that even Tanton thought was not worthy or needed to be hidden until 2035 when he knew that he was going to be long gone,” Ahmad said.</p>
<p>But there has been a shift in politics in the last four years. An emboldened right-wing has echoed the Tanton-esque policies that energized Trump’s rallies and built his base.</p>
<p>People have asked Ahmad whether or not he would drop the fight now that President-elect Joe Biden is gearing up to take over the White House in a few weeks, but the issue has existed long before Trump’s political power and will likely carry on beyond Biden, Ahmad said.</p>
<p>“I would remind them that [anti-immigration activists] have been able to be successful and push their policies regardless of who’s in the White House. Except now, they have a galvanized and organized base,” he said. “They have succeeded, installing immigration reform under both Democrat and Republican administrations. There is no reason to expect that they will not be able to do the same under Biden.</p>
<p>“So we ignore these groups at our own peril. They are emboldened, they are well funded, they are together, they are coherent. And I think it’s high time that they be called to task for where they actually came from.”</p>

<p>WASHINGTON — President-elect Joe Biden is promising to reinstate an Obama-era program that shields deportation for some undocumented people who were brought to the United States by their parents when they were children.</p>
<p>But immigration advocates are pushing for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program to not just be reaffirmed but expanded, and written into law. They view that as a minimum goal in immigration policy, with deportation protection for DACA recipients’ family members extended as well.</p>
<p>“During the Trump administration we’ve seen how fragile the program is and how easily it can be taken away,” said Krsna Avila, a staff attorney at the Immigrant Legal Resource Center. President Donald Trump tried to dismantle DACA, but earlier this year was thwarted by the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>While the largest numbers of those enrolled in DACA live in California, Illinois and Texas, they are scattered across the nation. Some states with large numbers of DACA recipients include Florida, Colorado, Georgia, North Carolina, Nevada and Arizona, according to <a href="https://www.governing.com/gov-data/other/daca-approved-participants-by-state.html" target="_blank">data</a> from the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services and the 2016 Census. Virginia had more than 12,000 as of 2017.</p>
<p>The DACA program was highlighted on Monday when Biden said he intends to nominate its architect, Alejandro Mayorkas, as his secretary of Homeland Security.</p>
<p>Mayorkas during the Obama administration served as the leader of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services and also as deputy director of DHS, which handles implementation and management of immigration policy.</p>
<p>“When I was very young, the United States provided my family and me a place of refuge. Now, I have been nominated to be the DHS secretary and oversee the protection of all Americans and those who flee persecution in search of a better life for themselves and their loved ones,” Mayorkas <a href="https://twitter.com/AliMayorkas/status/1330937834908250115" target="_blank">tweeted</a> Monday.</p>
<p>If confirmed, Mayorkas would be the first Latino to run the department, as well as the first immigrant.</p>
<h2><strong>Trump target</strong></h2>
<p>The Obama administration created DACA in 2012. Those enrolled were protected from deportation and also allowed to obtain a temporary work permit and driver&#8217;s license, and qualify for in-state-tuition for higher education.</p>
<p>DACA, though, was a target for Trump, who rescinded the program in 2017, halting new applications and sending 700,000 recipients across the country into limbo. The Supreme Court in June <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/19pdf/18-587_5ifl.pdf" target="_blank">ruled against the Trump administration</a>, and a federal judge earlier this month <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/18/politics/daca-garaufis/index.html" target="_blank">ruled</a> new administration rules on DACA are invalid.  <a href="https://www.nilc.org/issues/daca/" target="_blank">That case and related ones are pending</a> and more rulings are expected soon.</p>
<p>Trump’s sweeping actions on immigration during the last four years have pushed advocates and immigration lawyers to lobby the Biden-Harris transition team to not only reinstate DACA, but expand the program to include both recipients and their families.</p>
<p>Making those changes permanent through legislation, not just executive orders, would prevent uncertainty and an assault on immigration from happening again, advocates say.</p>
<p>“Status really controls your life,” said Madhuri Grewal, the federal immigration policy counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union.</p>
<p>But advocates also recognize that passage by a divided Congress likely would be tough. Democrats will control the House, though by a narrower margin, and Republicans could hold on to their majority in the Senate, depending on the results of two runoff races in Georgia.</p>
<p>Reinstatement of the DACA program by Biden is something that advocates either expect to see on day one of the new administration, or within the first 100 days Biden is in office. The incoming administration will be transitioning in the middle of a pandemic and has said that handling COVID-19 will be its first priority, along with several policies, including immigration.</p>
<p>Grewal added that not only does there need to be a change in the law for DACA recipients to have a path for citizenship, but also for the millions of undocumented people in the U.S. It’s estimated that there are more than 11 million undocumented people living in the U.S., according to the <a href="https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/frequently-requested-statistics-immigrants-and-immigration-united-states#Unauthorized%20Immigrants" target="_blank">Migration Policy Institute</a>, a nonpartisan think tank that studies migration.</p>
<h2><strong>Medicaid benefits</strong></h2>
<p>Health care is another DACA concern.</p>
<p>Only two states with the highest number of DACA recipients — New York and California — offer Medicaid benefits to Dreamers, which is what those eligible for DACA are sometimes called. As the U.S. struggles to contain a pandemic that has killed more than a quarter of a million Americans, advocates want the incoming Biden administration to require all states to offer Medicaid benefits for DACA recipients through the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.</p>
<p>“So many front line (DACA) workers don&#8217;t even have health care,” said Megan Essaheb, director of immigration advocacy for Asian Americans Advancing Justice-AAJC. Under an Obama administration memo, DACA recipients were excluded from Medicaid.</p>
<p>“It’s just been such a roller coaster ride with the Trump administration trying to end the program,” Essaheb said. “It&#8217;s really hard to plan for your future.”</p>
<p>She added that a public campaign to reach out to undocumented people from the Asian community, where there’s been a low sign-up rate, would be beneficial as well.</p>
<p>“There’s more stigma in Asian immigrant communities around being undocumented,” she said, adding that there is also a “fear and mistrust in government and a lack of campaign for Asian immigrants.”</p>
<p>Often public campaigns about DACA are targeted for Latinos and there is less stigma about being undocumented, Essaheb said.</p>
<p>While Mexico is the top country of origin for the U.S. undocumented immigration population, the second-fastest growing group of undocumented immigrants is Asians, according to <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/08/20/key-findings-about-u-s-immigrants/" target="_blank">Pew Research</a>.</p>
<p>There are about 30,000 DACA recipients in the Asian community, according to Immigration Advocacy for Asian Americans Advancing Justice-AAJC.</p>
<p>DACA recipients are also supposed to be allowed to leave the U.S. for work reasons or to take care of family abroad and return into the country, but under the Trump administration, “that is something that has not been safe,” Essaheb said.</p>
<p>Advocates are hoping that with the Biden administration reinstating the program, those recipients can resume travel out of the country if needed.</p>
<h2><strong>Parents, too</strong></h2>
<p>But reinstating the DACA program is the bare minimum, said Avila, the staff attorney at ILRC, adding that the Biden administration should expand the program and lay out a legislative pathway for citizenship.</p>
<p>“Helping undocumented youth isn’t just about reinstating DACA, so advocates want to see that administration show us that they really care about our communities,” he said. “We’re asking for a long overdue legislative fix that not only protects undocumented youth, but our parents as well.”</p>
<p>Grewal, from the ACLU, points out that the incoming Biden administration can be bold on immigration policies, similar to how the Trump administration tested the limits of the U.S. immigration system.</p>
<p>Some of the most consequential policies the Trump administration carried out included the separation of migrant children from their families, the building of the wall at the Southern border and and increased incarceration of undocumented immigrants.</p>
<p>“The flip side of that is that we have seen what the executive branch can do on immigration,” she said. “In order to see a reversal of what Trump did, the Biden administration needs to be as equally bold and visionary on immigration in order to offer relief to the families that have really borne the brunt of four years of attacks on their communities.”</p>

<p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday salvaged an Obama-era program that has allowed hundreds of thousands of young, unauthorized immigrants known as “Dreamers” to remain in the country without immediate fear of deportation.</p>
<p>In a 5-4 decision, Chief Justice John Roberts sided with the court’s liberal wing in finding that the Trump administration broke the law in 2017 when it rescinded the program, known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA.</p>
<p>Roberts wrote the majority opinion and was joined by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Elena Kagan, Stephen Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor.</p>
<p>The court held that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s decision to end the program was “arbitrary and capricious” and therefore in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act.</p>
<p>“We do not decide whether DACA or its rescission are sound policies,” Roberts wrote. “‘The wisdom’ of those decisions ‘is none of our concern.’&#8221;</p>
<p>But the department, he said, “failed to consider the conspicuous issues of whether to retain forbearance and what if anything to do about the hardship to DACA recipients. That dual failure raises doubts about whether the agency appreciated the scope of its discretion or exercised that discretion in a reasonable manner.”</p>
<p>The ruling drew cheers from liberal lawmakers and advocates across the country.</p>
<p>“By rejecting the Trump administration’s illegal attempt to end DACA, the Supreme Court provided a critical measure of relief to DACA recipients and their families at a time when they — like all Americans — are experiencing significant fear and uncertainty as a result of the coronavirus pandemic,” Neera Tanden, president and CEO of the Center for American Progress, said in a statement.</p>
<p>Justice Clarence Thomas called the ruling “mystifying” in a dissenting opinion. “Today’s decision must be recognized for what it is: an effort to avoid a politically controversial but legally correct decision,” he wrote.</p>
<p>Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring, among a group of attorneys general who sued over the Trump administration&#8217;s attempt to end the program, called the decision &#8220;truly historic.&#8221;</p>
<p>“Today’s win for DREAMers was only possible because of brave individuals all across Virginia and around the country who stood up and demanded the rights and respect that they deserve,” Herring said. “This country is the only home most of these young people have ever known and now they will be able to live, work, and raise families here without the fear of deportation looming over them.</p>
<p>The ruling will likely inflame partisan tensions ahead of the 2020 presidential contest. It comes days after the court issued an unexpected ruling protecting LGBTQ workers from job discrimination.</p>
<p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) called the pair of rulings “a bright ray of sunshine” during difficult times. “This is a wonderful, wonderful day,” he said in a statement.</p>
<p>The DACA program was created in 2012 to allow certain immigrants who arrived in the United States before age 16 to apply for temporary protection from deportation and work permits. Herring&#8217;s office said there were more than 12,000 DACA recipients.</p>
<p>https://twitter.com/MarkWarner/status/1273619671074340864</p>
<p>About 700,000 people have participated in the program nationwide, according to the court. A <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/immigration/news/2017/08/28/437956/daca-recipients-economic-educational-gains-continue-grow/" target="_blank">2017 survey</a> of DACA recipients found that nearly all respondents were either employed or in school, according to the Center for American Progress.</p>
<p>President Donald Trump vowed on the campaign trail to “<a href="https://time.com/3923128/donald-trump-announcement-speech/" target="_blank">end</a>” the program. His administration made good on his promise in 2017, but lower courts blocked the decision from taking effect.</p>
<p>The administration could try to end the program again, the court noted. If it does, it will have to do so in a way that complies with federal law governing such decisions.</p>
<p>Last June, the U.S. House <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/6?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22hr6%22%5D%7D&amp;s=1&amp;r=1" target="_blank">passed legislation</a> that would safeguard the program and provide a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers. The bill has not been taken up in the U.S. Senate.</p>
<p>“President Trump’s decision to end DACA plunged hundreds of thousands of innocent young people into legal limbo and wreaked havoc upon nearly every area of American life. I’m so thankful the Court has put an end to this Administration’s ill-conceived broken promise,&#8221; Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., said. &#8220;Congress should now pass the HEROES Act to prevent the deportation of undocumented essential workers during the pandemic and the American Dream and Promise Act to permanently protect these kids and young adults.”</p>

Ralph Northam, left, and Secretary of Health Dr, Daniel Carey, right, at a news conference on Capitol Square in last year. (Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Latino Virginians among those with the highest infection rates of the new coronavirus and afflicted by the severe disease it causes – COVID-19 – Latino leaders are asking why government outreach and aid to their sizable community has been negligible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite assurances of aggressive assistance by Gov. Ralph Northam and the Virginia Department of Health, little has materialized, the leaders said. Spanish-language outreach, coronavirus testing, accommodations for those who need to be quarantined and aid covering costs of medical treatment is sorely lacking, they said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am very disappointed in how this is being handled,” said Luis Aguilar, the Virginia director of CASA, a nonprofit that advocates for Latinos and low-wage workers nationally and in several Virginia localities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They’re pretending as if this pandemic affects all of us equally and that everyone has equal access. They do not. It’s absolutely clear that the governor does not understand what inequality means,” Aguilar said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Statewide, Hispanic and Latino Virginians account for 29 percent of the confirmed coronavirus cases and COVID-19 hospitalizations for which racial and ethnic information is known, according to VDH data as of Friday. Yet Hispanics and Latinos accounted for slightly less than 10 percent of Virginia’s population of 8.5 million, according to U.S. Census figures from July 2018.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The disparity is more pronounced in areas with heavy immigrant populations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the Fairfax Health District, for instance, Hispanic or Latino patients accounted for 46 percent of its 7,245 confirmed coronavirus cases and 41 percent of its 1,050 COVID-19 hospitalizations as of Friday, even though the group accounts for only about 16 percent of Fairfax County’s population. The health district for the adjacent city of Alexandria reported almost identical numbers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nearly three of every five hospitalized COVID-19 patients was Latino in the Prince William Health District, which encompasses the three jurisdictions with Virginia’s heaviest Latino percentages: Manassas Park (40 percent); Manassas city (38 percent); and Prince William County (24 percent).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also holds true for rural areas with many Latino immigrant workers for industries such as poultry processing and agricultural labor. In the Central Shenandoah Health District, home to numerous poultry plants along the Interstate 81 corridor, 42 percent of its 1,163 confirmed cases and one third of its hospitalizations were Hispanic or Latino. And in the Eastern Shore Health District, also home to large poultry facilities, Latinos accounted for 16 percent of the cases and 21 percent of the 14 deaths, although they comprise just 9 percent of the population.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">President Donald Trump ordered poultry and meat-packing plants to remain open during the pandemic under the Defense Procurement Act.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Northam spokeswoman Alena Yarmosky defended Virginia’s efforts in an email to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Mercury</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Governor Northam is committed to protecting the safety of all Virginians during this crisis. Working closely with the Virginia Department of Health and our cross-agency Health Equity Working Group, the administration is working to provide culturally-relevant outreach to the Latino community and address unique concerns,” she said. Accompanying her statement was a</span><a href="https://documentcloud.adobe.com/link/review?uri=urn:aaid:scds:US:fcfb6396-cec8-4225-8ce1-2eb214623418" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">two-page summary</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of programs launched — from translating announcements to health department guidance for migrant labor camps — and various calls and meetings with Latino leaders and stakeholders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But those leaders say very little assistance of any kind from any level of government is reaching those who desperately need it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have a problem, a big problem, with the level of assistance that the vulnerable Latino community is getting right now in Virginia,” said Walter Tejada, president of the </span><a href="https://www.virginialatinoleaderscouncil.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Latino Leaders Council</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and former chairman of the Arlington County Board of Supervisors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These are frontline workers – frontline heroes – who do not have the luxury of staying home and making a living doing Zoom conferences or teleworking. They wipe our floors, pluck feathers, pick crops, clean our rooms,” he said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">African-Americans have also suffered disproportionately from the coronavirus. Though they account for 23 percent of the confirmed cases according to Thursday’s VDH data, they are 19 percent of Virginia’s population.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A key differentiator is language and fear among immigrants that those without documentation could be subject to deportation by a hostile federal government should they show up seeking testing or treatment, said Edgar Aranda-Yanoc, the executive director of the</span><a href="http://vacolao.org/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Coalition for Latino Organizations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a nonprofit advocacy group.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Many of those in the Latino community are essential workers and they have to go to work where they are not having the appropriate protections,” said Aranda-Yanoc, who is also the senior lead organizer for the</span><a href="https://www.justice4all.org/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Legal Aid Justice Center&#8217;s</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Immigrant Advocacy Program. “And there are also many Latinos who have lost their jobs.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other than</span><a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/coronavirus/resources-and-support/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Web-based instruction in Spanish</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, active outreach to Latinos to provide information on protecting themselves from the virus and what to do if they have symptoms has been lacking, the leaders said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What we need are bilingual staffs that can penetrate into our community, speaking English and Spanish,” Tejada said. “We need a phone bank or a strike force that can reach people and talk to them.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Testing at commercial labs and doctors’ offices is beyond most Latino families’ means, and free testing is difficult to find, Aguilar said. Things only get tougher for those who test positive for the virus or show symptoms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It becomes very hard to stop the spread because then they go back to homes where there may be five to eight people in one apartment, just two rooms. There’s no place for them to isolate and this is an issue that this government needs to address,” said Aranda-Yanoc. “We know that there are hotels with rooms that could be used but are not.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aguilar said that it’s folly for the state to imagine that it’s effectively fighting the virus for which there’s no cure or vaccine when it’s not effectively managing the outbreak in the demographic the disease has hit the hardest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want to be a part of the solution, and the only way to do that is to include us in the solution,” he said. “If not, the whole community becomes a victim of circumstance.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />

(Ned Oliver/ Virginia Mercury)</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>By Jennifer Romero</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">As a DACA recipient and daughter of undocumented parents, surviving the COVID-19 pandemic has become a struggle. My father&#8217;s boss has cut several hours off his job, and my mother can’t work for the next few weeks due to her health condition.</p>
<p dir="ltr">My brother and I will receive stimulus checks from the federal government because we have a social security number thanks to the <a href="https://www.ilrc.org/daca" target="_blank">Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals</a> program. However, my parents won&#8217;t receive a penny, even though they have paid their taxes on time every year.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Like my family, hundreds of thousands of immigrant families’ sources of income have been sidelined by the COVID-19 crisis. Others are essential workers who lack health insurance. Many immigrant workers have been left entirely out of the federal relief package.</p>
<p dir="ltr">My mother is a professional caretaker, caring for senior citizens since we came to the United States nearly two decades ago. Unfortunately, she underwent an emergency surgery last week and will not be able to work anytime soon. No one in our family was able to go to the hospital to see her due to the quarantine measures. Because of the pandemic, my mother had to wait an additional two days in pain by herself before a space opened up for her to get surgery. It was very hard to leave her in the emergency room, knowing that she would go through recovery all alone.</p>
<p dir="ltr">For decades, my parents have been economically sound, but with the pandemic taking away their jobs, they face a dire reality: My parents don&#8217;t know how they will pay for the hospital bills and medications since they don’t have enough. To make matters worse, the Trump administration announced that the stimulus help that will pull so many out of dire straits won’t provide them any relief whatsoever. Because they don’t have Social Security Numbers, they as taxpayers, won’t receive the government aid they deserve. Especially now when they need it most.</p>
<p dir="ltr">But, we aren’t going to wait for the Trump administration to do the right thing. We all know how that’s gone in the past. He’s tried <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/11/11/20943523/daca-supreme-court-trump-dreamers-immigration" target="_blank">to kill</a> the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. He’s tried to roll back health care coverage from the Affordable Care Act. His rhetoric has<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hatecrimes-report/victims-of-anti-latino-hate-crimes-soar-in-us-fbi-report-idUSKBN1XM2OQ" target="_blank"> incited hate crimes</a> against the Latino community.</p>
<p dir="ltr">That’s why my brother and I are taking the situation into our own hands.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span class="il">CASA</span>, the largest member-based Latino and immigrant organization in the mid-Atlantic region, is advocating for aid and protections to all those likely to get exposed: frontline workers, the incarcerated and the under- and uninsured. They’ve sent letters to local and state governments demanding action. Better yet, the organization has started the Solidarity Fund to support folks like my parents, hard workers who deserve government aid but won’t receive a thing. Through this initiative, <span class="il">CASA</span> will directly distribute cash benefits to members who need our help now more than ever.</p>
<p dir="ltr">My brother and I will use our stimulus checks for good and donate to the Solidarity Fund. Yes, my family has had to buy less food, and, fortunately, our landlord can give us options to pay the rent. However, there are many immigrant families who have lost their jobs because they work in the hardest hit sectors, do not have enough to feed their children and are experiencing homelessness due to rent not being addressed at any level of government.</p>
<p dir="ltr">When local, state and federal governments fail to support our communities and continue the pattern of exclusion via any stimulus packages, we as a community must stand strong.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We as a united community can have a tremendous impact that can keep us all afloat. But, to do it, we must stick together.</p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>Virginia lawmakers voted Saturday to grant driver privilege cards – but not full-fledged licenses – to undocumented immigrants.</p>
<p>“I cannot tell you all how important this is for about 300,000 people living in Virginia,” said Sen. Scott Surovell, D-Alexandria. “This bill is going to change people’s lives.”</p>
<p>Currently undocumented immigrants are not able to get licenses, leading many to simply drive without one. Lawmakers framed the proposal as a way to allow immigrants living here to take care of their basic needs while also improving public safety by ensuring everyone on the road has passed a driving test and is insured.</p>
<p>The General Assembly had been debating <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/virginia-lawmakers-vote-to-allow-undocumented-immigrants-to-apply-for-drivers-licenses/" target="_blank">two proposals</a>. One, proposed by Surovell to issue privilege cards, and one proposed by Del. Kathy Tran, D-Fairfax, which would have allowed immigrants to get full-fledged licenses.</p>
<p>Surovell said he favored the broader approach proposed by Tran and approved earlier this legislative session by the House, but said that their wasn’t enough support for the measure in the Senate.</p>
<p>The main difference between driver privilege cards and a license is that the privilege cards must be renewed annually and applicants must file a tax return or be listed as a dependent on one.</p>
<p>The privilege cards will also state that they are not to be used for voting or federal benefits.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+sum+SB34" target="_blank">language</a> lawmakers adopted is drafted to block federal officials from obtaining a list of applicants to address concerns that the information could be used to target undocumented immigrants for immigration enforcement purposes.</p>
<p>Advocates supporting the legislation packed the House and Senate galleries for the votes.</p>
<p>“The ability to drive and live your daily life and be able to go work, take your kids to school … without additional stress, worry and fear will be tremendously life changing,” Tran said.</p>

</p><p><strong>By Unni Kirandumkara</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">This month, Americans began the process of selecting the next president of the United States. The Iowa caucuses kicked off Feb. <span style="font-size: 12.5px;">3</span>, and Super Tuesday will be here before we know it. As Virginians consider who to vote for, we need to start thinking smarter about immigration. That’s especially true in Richmond, where the number of foreign-born voters is growing and the role these voters play in our local economy becomes increasingly vital. In short, the fearmongering we’ve heard over the last four years is not going to fly with voters in 2020.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We need to distinguish fact from fiction. President Donald Trump has <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/10/02/trumps-most-insulting-violent-language-is-often-reserved-immigrants/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/10/02/trumps-most-insulting-violent-language-is-often-reserved-immigrants/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1581535389337000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGVeGKcgtMNfVWYjT6o08pEkAFZiA" target="_blank">called immigrants</a> “criminals” and “rapists” and referred to migration as “an invasion.” Richmond shows something quite different. In 2017, the local immigrant entrepreneur population grew by <a href="https://www.newamericaneconomy.org/press-release/new-data-shows-the-number-of-immigrant-entrepreneurs-in-the-richmond-metro-area-grew-by-more-than-58-percent-in-one-year/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.newamericaneconomy.org/press-release/new-data-shows-the-number-of-immigrant-entrepreneurs-in-the-richmond-metro-area-grew-by-more-than-58-percent-in-one-year/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1581535389337000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFRVJySet4L66YusAPCV2e6TBNCqw" target="_blank">more than 58 percent</a>, according to a recent study by New American Economy. In fact, immigrants in Richmond are <a href="https://www.newamericaneconomy.org/city/richmond/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.newamericaneconomy.org/city/richmond/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1581535389338000&amp;usg=AFQjCNESX38tXqcHxXlkvgkGEDz9u0rp5A" target="_blank">106.8 percent</a> more likely to be entrepreneurs than our U.S.-born neighbors. They are also significant players in our city’s <a href="https://www.cbre.com/research-and-reports/Scoring-Tech-Talent-in-North-America-2018" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cbre.com/research-and-reports/Scoring-Tech-Talent-in-North-America-2018&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1581535389338000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGH5qS2lUD7iPBrw9-0Vwfrvwz3tw" target="_blank">booming tech industry</a>. We’re adding tech jobs at a <a href="https://www.cbre.com/research-and-reports/Scoring-Tech-Talent-in-North-America-2018" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cbre.com/research-and-reports/Scoring-Tech-Talent-in-North-America-2018&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1581535389338000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGH5qS2lUD7iPBrw9-0Vwfrvwz3tw" target="_blank">faster rate</a> than almost any other city in the United States, but we’re also facing a shortage of qualified workers. In 2015, there were <a href="https://research.newamericaneconomy.org/report/sizing-up-the-gap-in-our-supply-of-stem-workers/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://research.newamericaneconomy.org/report/sizing-up-the-gap-in-our-supply-of-stem-workers/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1581535389338000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE2TunF0B-y5qDxxZK6DNypcfvWlw" target="_blank">nearly 22 STEM jobs</a> advertised in Virginia for every available worker.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Richmond’s immigrant population is helping to bridge that gap; <a href="https://www.newamericaneconomy.org/city/richmond/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.newamericaneconomy.org/city/richmond/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1581535389338000&amp;usg=AFQjCNESX38tXqcHxXlkvgkGEDz9u0rp5A" target="_blank">11.4 percent</a> are employed in local professional, scientific and technical services jobs.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I am one of these — both a foreign-born tech worker and an entrepreneur. Originally from India, I spent two decades here building my career in technology. For years, I ran data management projects for the federal government, including the Department of Defense. During that time, I realized that companies needed a better way to securely consolidate, store and collaborate on files in the cloud. In 2002, I built an application for web browsers that encrypts and archives files securely and launched my company, OOAC, around it. We specialize in content management software development and consulting on cybersecurity. Today, our team includes six people who work with clients across two states.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, immigrants benefit Richmond outside the tech sector. We were just 7.6 percent of the local population in 2017, but we paid $1.1 billion in state, local and federal taxes and held $2.9 billion in spending power, <a href="https://www.newamericaneconomy.org/city/richmond/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.newamericaneconomy.org/city/richmond/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1581535389338000&amp;usg=AFQjCNESX38tXqcHxXlkvgkGEDz9u0rp5A" target="_blank">according to New American Economy</a>. And since then, even more immigrants are calling Virginia home; <a href="https://data.newamericaneconomy.org/en/map-the-impact-states-jan2020/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://data.newamericaneconomy.org/en/map-the-impact-states-jan2020/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1581535389338000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEU91Sf1gvlJMMTotU-RxotHfDDuA" target="_blank">between 2017 and 2018</a>, the state’s overall immigrant population grew by 1.3 percent, compared to .5 percent growth of the U.S.-born population.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Candidates should take note of this, especially because that growth means more foreign-born voters. Since Trump took office <a href="https://data.newamericaneconomy.org/en/map-the-impact-states-jan2020/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://data.newamericaneconomy.org/en/map-the-impact-states-jan2020/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1581535389338000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEU91Sf1gvlJMMTotU-RxotHfDDuA" target="_blank">in 2017</a>, the number of foreign-born Virginians who are eligible to vote has grown by 18,000 people, bringing the total to more than 534,000 immigrant voters across the state, according to NAE.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Richmond has given me so much. It’s where I’ve raised my two sons, where my wife and I have built our careers, and where I launched my own business. And I’m proud to be more than a singular anecdote. The data shows that I am representative of a foreign-born community that loves this city and wants to see it succeed. Those are the facts, and the facts are what political candidates should be focusing on this election year.</p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>Legislation extending driver privileges and in-state tuition regardless of immigration status, pushed for years by advocates for Virginia immigrants, cleared both chambers of the General Assembly Tuesday.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a growing cognizance that these are communities who need licenses and in-state tuition,&#8221; said Monica Sarmiento, the executive director of the Virginia Coalition for Immigrant Rights. &#8220;They&#8217;re filled with talented people who already contribute to the Virginia economy and need a path forward to build their own prosperity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Advocates packed the Capitol for the vote on driving privileges, filling an overflow room where an interpreter translated the debate as unfolded on the floor of the Senate.</p>
<p>“It’s very, very important for me – this moment,” said Ingrid Vaca, who immigrated from Bolivia 20 years ago and lives in Alexandria. She teared up as she described deciding between driving without a license illegally, risking arrest and deportation, and spending two-hours traveling by public transit every morning to her job cleaning houses.</p>
<p>“My life was in the hands of all the people who voted today,” she said.</p>
<p>The Senate voted 22-18 to adopt its version of the legislation, which allows undocumented immigrants to obtain a driver privilege card.</p>
<p>To obtain the card, they will have to meet all the requirements necessary for obtaining a standard driver’s license, but must also have filed an income tax return. The cards would have text on the top stating that it is “not valid identification for federal, voting or public benefit purposes.”</p>
<p>Sen. Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, proposed the measure. He argued many undocumented immigrants are currently driving illegally. Making sure they passed driving tests and are insured will make roads safer. He also described it as a critical quality of life issue.</p>
<p>“People need to be able to get to a job, take their kids to soccer, go to the doctor,” he said. “It’s an absolute necessity. This is one of the few bills we’re going to vote on this session that will change over 100,000 lives the moment it becomes law.”</p>
<p>The Commonwealth Institute for Fiscal Analysis, a nonprofit policy group in Richmond, <a href="https://www.thecommonwealthinstitute.org/2020/01/10/accounting-for-cars-expanding-access-to-drivers-licenses-regardless-of-immigration-status-will-help-virginias-fiscal-bottom-line-as-well-as-helping-families-and-communities/" target="_blank">estimated the new law</a> would result in between 124,500 and 160,792 new drivers being licensed, generating a minimum of $10 million in new title fees, sales tax receipts, license plate fees and new car registrations.</p>
<p>The House’s version of the legislation, proposed by Del. Kathy Tran, D-Fairfax, is somewhat more permissive, granting undocumented immigrants the ability to obtain traditional driver&#8217;s licenses with no special restrictions. It passed Tuesday on a 57-42 vote.</p>
<p>Under both bills, the credential would not serve as a<a href="https://www.dhs.gov/real-id" target="_blank"> Real ID</a>, a new standard the federal government is rolling out nationwide, which will be required to board airplanes and enter certain federal facilities.</p>
<p>The House and Senate will now debate the differences between the two versions of the legislation.</p>
<h2><strong>&#8216;We invest millions of dollars in these kids&#8217;</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both chambers passed another bill on Tuesday that makes undocumented immigrants eligible for in-state tuition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Alfonso Lopez, D-Arlington, said he had to hide his tears when his version of the legislation passed the House <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+vot+HV0802+HB1547" target="_blank">56-44</a> to a round of applause from advocates. (The lone Republican yes vote was Del. John Avoli, the former mayor of Staunton who immigrated to the United States from Italy at age 10.) This was the ninth consecutive year that Lopez introduced the bill and the first year it advanced out of committee onto the House floor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bills make all students eligible for in-state college tuition, regardless of immigration or citizenship status, as long as they’ve attended high school in Virginia for at least two years or graduated since July 1, 2008. Students would also be eligible if they&#8217;ve passed a high school equivalency exam since 2008.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Undocumented students are currently ineligible both for in-state tuition rates and federal aid programs such as student loans and work-study programs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In my neck of the woods, I’ve met students who should be going to MIT and Cal Tech who can’t afford Northern Virginia Community College,” Lopez said. “We invest millions of dollars in these kids and then put up a stop sign saying, &#8216;No, you can’t go any further.&#8217;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A 2019 </span><a href="https://www.migrationpolicy.org/research/unauthorized-immigrants-graduate-us-high-schools" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute found that roughly 2,000 undocumented students graduate from Virginia high schools every year, according to the most recently available data from the U.S. Census Bureau. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+oth+HB1547FH1122+PDF" target="_blank">A fiscal impact statement</a> from the state’s Department of Planning and Budget found the bills would have an undetermined impact on revenue. It would depend on how many undocumented students transition from out-of-state to in-state tuition rates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neither the House nor Senate bill would apply to immigrants who temporarily move to the United States for school or temporary work. But the Senate version, which passed Tuesday on a 21-19 party line vote, also allows prospective students or their parents to use Virginia income tax returns to prove they&#8217;ve been residing in the state. </span>Undocumented students — or their legal guardians — would be required to submit at least two years of tax returns prior to their date of college enrollment.</p>
<p>In both versions of the bill, students could also use proof of high school enrollment or graduation in Virginia to show they&#8217;ve been living in the state.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under both bills, immigration and citizenship information would only be used for determining in-state tuition eligibility. Both chambers will debate the differences between the two versions of the legislation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Virginia Wesleyan University is committed to inclusiveness and acceptance of all, especially those seeking academic and life success at our institution and others across the nation,” President Scott Miller said in a statement. Virginia Wesleyan, in Virginia Beach, was one of more than 150 colleges across the country to sign onto the amicus brief filed earlier this week.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The amicus brief demonstrates our support for DACA and immigrant students. We stand with those aspiring citizens and urge the Supreme Court to pass a responsible, humane ruling that will preserve access to our institutions of higher education and other avenues that will ensure that those who are registered for DACA, or defined as &#8216;undocumented,&#8217; may continue to make contributions to America.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">None of Virginia Wesleyan’s currently enrolled students receive DACA benefits, according to spokesperson Stephanie Smaglo. At Marymount in Arlington, about 100 enrolled students are Dreamers (the name for people who are in the United States under the DACA policy).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a Cuban immigrant myself, I am grateful to the U.S. for the opportunities this country gave me to put myself through college and be a university president today,” Marymount President Irma Becerra said in a statement. “These DREAMers, like I did, are living out their daily lives with hope and determination to flourish and contribute to society. They should not have to live in constant fear of deportation.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.governing.com/gov-data/other/daca-approved-participants-by-state.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Governing magazine estimates</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> there were about 12,000 DACA recipients in Virginia as of 2017. The same year, there were</span><a href="https://www.wvtf.org/post/my-purpose-here-get-education-more-1200-daca-recipients-attend-virginia-colleges#stream/0" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">an estimated 1,200 DACA students</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at Virginia colleges.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former President Barack Obama implemented the DACA policy, which allowed people who came to the United States illegally as minors- usually with their families- to apply to be safe from deportation for two years and receive a work permit. Trump cancelled the DACA policy, an action that has been legally challenged and will be heard by the U.S. Supreme Court next month. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the meantime, Congress has struggled to agree on a legislative solution for DACA recipients.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Banishing them once more to immigration limbo—a predicament they had no part in creating—is not merely cruel, but irrational,” the amicus brief states. “If such an unlawful decision is allowed to stand—and these young people take their tremendous talent, enthusiasm, and skills elsewhere—we &#8230; will be the losers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Any college or university could sign on to the Supreme Court brief, said Jose Magaña-Salgado, spokesperson for the </span><a href="https://www.presidentsimmigrationalliance.org/about/statement/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Presidents’ Alliance on Higher Education and Immigration</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a group of higher education leaders that support immigration policies that “create a welcoming environment for immigrant, undocumented and international students.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In September, more than a dozen Virginia colleges and universities signed on to</span><a href="https://www.acenet.edu/Documents/Institutional-DACA-Letter-to-Congress.pdf" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">a letter to Congressional leaders</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> urging them to agree on a bipartisan replacement for DACA. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We believe it is long overdue for Congress to pass bipartisan legislation, in both the House and Senate, to provide permanent protection for Dreamers—young, undocumented, high-achieving individuals brought to our country as children,” the letter reads. “We respectfully urge you to come together on a bipartisan basis to address this challenge by doing the right thing for these outstanding young people and for our country.”</span></p>

<p>A <a href="http://www.scc.virginia.gov/docketsearch/DOCS/4j7s01!.PDF" target="_blank">filing</a> Friday by the state Bureau of Insurance accuses Libre by Nexus, which was founded and operated out of Augusta County until earlier this year, of refusing to obtain a license to sell insurance in Virginia.</p>
<p>“Licensure and oversight by the Bureau are especially important when the agents are dealing with vulnerable customers – such as immigrant detainees – who are navigating difficult situations, likely do not understand the underlying immigration or insurance systems, may not be able to fully comprehend contracts or other legal documents presented and may speak a different language (or dialect) than the agents,” the bureau wrote.</p>
<p>The company, which portrays itself as an advocate for immigrant families, says it helps connect people being held in ICE detention centers with bonds while they await trial. As a condition, the immigrants often agree to pay the company $420 a month and wear a GPS ankle monitor.</p>
<p>Libre contends it’s not acting as an insurance company or agent and will vigorously defend itself, according to <a href="https://valawyersweekly.com/2019/10/07/bond-surety-company-targeted-by-insurance-regulators/" target="_blank">Virginia Lawyers Weekly</a>, which first reported the regulatory action: “Libre by Nexus actually buys insurance products and services as part of our ground breaking program to reunite families to make immigration bonds more accessible and affordable. We do this by contracting with insurance providers and bondsmen that would otherwise not provide an immigration bond without the program provided by Libre by Nexus,” the company told the publication.</p>
<p>A hearing has been scheduled for March 10.</p>
<p>The action is the latest in series of investigations and lawsuits against the company. Last year, The Washington Post <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/investigations-expand-into-company-accused-of-preying-on-detained-immigrants/2018/04/20/e31329d8-44a6-11e8-8569-26fda6b404c7_story.html" target="_blank">reported</a> the company “is the subject of probes by the attorneys general of Virginia, New York and Washington state, according to state and federal court records.” It is also facing an investigation by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the paper reports.</p>
<p>In August, the company <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/libre-by-nexus-enters-settlement-agreement-with-washington-state-ends-investigation-without-charges-300907942.html" target="_blank">said</a> it had reached a settlement with authorities in Washington in which it agreed to issue refund 140 clients and waive $2.7 million in past due fees.</p>
<p>The same month, a <a href="https://www.apnews.com/05f52e78805c464e89ef7032e67bcb4b" target="_blank">lawsuit</a> filed by the Legal Aid Justice Center accused the company of evading “regulations imposed on bail companies that would bar it from engaging in many of its practices,” according to the Associated Press.</p>
<p>“Libre attempts to camouflage its practices by casting itself as a champion of immigrants and a re-uniter of families, when in reality its scheme traps desperate immigrants into paying thousands of dollars,” the lawsuit alleges.</p>

<p dir="ltr">When Eva Solano returned home after spending 28 days in immigration detention, she knew she wasn’t going to go back to her normal life and pretend nothing had happened.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I told my lawyer, ‘I need to do something,’” Solano said. “It’s not about me. I’m the lucky one.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Solano joined the board of the Cville Immigrant Bond Fund, which launched in May, a few months after leaving the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, commonly known as ICE, detention facility in Caroline County. Her boss had put forward $6,000 to bail her out, and coworkers raised an additional $4,000 in support.</p>
<p dir="ltr">At that point, there wasn’t a bond or legal defense fund that could help Solano in Virginia. And while that’s changed with the launch of the Cville Fund and Santos en Virginia — which started in July and eventually hopes to serve the entire state — advocates say many people still are unable to afford bail or legal expenses.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We haven’t begun to meet the need,” said Priscilla Mendenhall, executive director of the Cville Fund, which serves people in Charlottesville and Albemarle and Nelson counties. “But a lot of it is need that doesn’t even emerge because people are too afraid to come forward, too afraid to even fight their cases.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to a Syracuse University <a href="https://trac.syr.edu/phptools/immigration/detention/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://trac.syr.edu/phptools/immigration/detention/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1570582503232000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEDa4ju1OG7k7LrQuaVh6VPZ6J40w">database</a>, 982 people were in ICE detention in Virginia as of December, the most recent month with available data. About a third of those people — the largest individual category — had never been convicted of a crime. Each month that data was collected, the number of detainees increased. In September 2016, the first month when data was collected, there were 672 people in detention, and about 14% had no criminal convictions. About the same proportion were convicted of a DUI.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The same database reports that as of August, the median bond granted in a hearing in Virginia was $7,000. Unlike other bonds, ICE bonds have to be paid all at once, Mendenhall said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“If they can’t get bonded out, they’re stuck in detention,” Mendenhall said. “If they’re stuck in detention, it’s much harder for them to actually work with an attorney.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Mendenhall said Cville’s fundraising has gone well, but there’s an ongoing need to raise more money.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Leonina Arismendi, the co-founder of Santos en Virginia, said 10 people make up the $100,000 in requests that the organization has received thus far.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“So whatever scale of fundraising we thought we were going to be doing,” said Lana Heath de Martínez, the other co-founder, as Arismendi continued, “it just blew our minds, how much was needed so soon.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The group has gone back to the drawing board to figure out a new fundraising plan, Arismendi said. They’re looking into creative ways to raise money, such as launching music and art events and reaching out to restaurants owners about hosting a fundraising event.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We’re just looking at the most creative ways to find the money we need, and not to find it once, but to find it constantly,” Arismendi said, “because these requests keep coming.”</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">The Trump administration’s new <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/28/states-push-courts-to-block-trumps-public-charge-immigrant-rule.html" target="_blank">“public charge” rule</a> threatens that ideal by forcing low-income immigrants to make an impossible choice: choosing between their families’ health or their immigration status.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">A “public charge” is an individual the U.S. considers primarily dependent on the government for subsistence. For the first time in U.S. history, receiving non-cash, federally-funded benefits such as food stamps (SNAP), Medicaid or housing assistance—even for just a short period of time—will become part of the public charge determination.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In other words, the new public charge rule shifts its focus from one that excludes those fully dependent on government programs to anyone who may need to use a public benefit program at any time — even once.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">If immigrants are deemed a public charge under the new rule, they will be prevented from entering the U.S. when seeking legal entry or becoming a lawful permanent resident when they are already in the U.S. legally and trying to attain green card status.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Immigration officials will be able to reject applications from individuals considered “more likely” to receive public benefits in the future. They will also be able to consider more factors, including the individual’s wealth, English proficiency, health status, age and education — criteria obviously designed to target low-income immigrants.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Immigrant communities throughout the country are understandably confused and scared. <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/public-charge-rule-immigrants-are-dropping-essential-benefits-california-counties-say/" target="_blank">Many are unnecessarily withdrawing</a> themselves and their families — even their U.S. citizen children — from necessary programs and services to which they are entitled. These families are withdrawing from programs that are not even subject to the new rule out of fear that participating in any government program will affect their families’ ability to enter or stay in the U.S.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">This chilling effect has broad and dangerous consequences as our neighbors go without essential human services. The fear is creating more homelessness, more hunger and more people in poor health. It is preventing families from reuniting with loved ones.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Experts believe the regulation will affect 26 million people nationwide. That includes a quarter of all children within immigrant families — the vast majority of whom were born in the U.S. The rule will disproportionately impact people of color, affecting more than 10 million Latino and nearly four million Asian-American and Pacific Islander immigrants, widening racial disparities on everything from infant mortality to housing stability.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As immigrant communities are forced into deeper poverty while struggling to feed, house and get health care for their families, the rule’s harsh impacts will ripple outward, causing huge financial costs to state and local governments, faith-based groups and nonprofits that will have to fill gaps and respond to public health needs when people drop out of federal programs.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Grocery stores, medical providers and other businesses will see revenues drop as immigrants forego benefits they previously received. Because of these very real fiscal, social and economic concerns, 16 states, including Virginia, have already filed lawsuits to stop the new rule.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Families who remain in public benefits programs are becoming increasingly reluctant to accept referrals to important health services such as vision screenings and immunization services. When people do not seek basic food, support and health services, it puts them — and all of us — at risk for community instability.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The message the Trump administration’s new public charge rule sends to immigrants is clear: if you’re not wealthy, you’re not welcome. It is cruel and illogical for our government to provide legal immigrants access to vital human services and later consider their use of such services against them. The new rule punishes the poor for being poor, and as a consequence, rolls back progress in addressing hunger, health and poverty for everyone in this country.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">My grandparents came from very little. They labored as a tailor and as a sewing factory worker and built a good life for their family by coming to the U.S. Now, immigrants coming to this country for the same reason are being measured by their wealth. As Americans, we pride ourselves on the ideal of fairness, of opportunity for all. But we are eliminating those opportunities for hardworking, low-income immigrants to build better lives as my grandparents — and many of yours — once did.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cbpp.org/" target="_blank">The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities</a>, a progressive Washington D.C. think tank, recommended four policies to &#8220;welcome immigrants &#8230; into the mainstream economy and foster community well-being&#8221;:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allowing undocumented immigrants to get driver&#8217;s licenses, which could make the roads safer and drive down insurance costs</li>
<li>Giving undocumented immigrants access to in-state college tuition and financial aid would allow them to enter the workforce more easily and create more workers in the state.</li>
<li>Strengthening labor laws, like making sure people are paid minimum wage, would benefit all workers, but undocumented workers are more likely to be the victims of wage violations.</li>
<li>Expanding health care coverage to all children would improve long-term outcomes and ease the economic burden of being uninsured.</li>
</ul>
<p>Virginia is one of 21 states that hasn&#8217;t enacted any of the four policies. The <a href="https://www.dailyprogress.com/news/uva/uva-expands-financial-aid-to-include-daca-students/article_db3394c2-430f-5764-945f-f33150bab570.html" target="_blank">University of Virginia recently decided</a> to allow students in the country with Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals status to receive institutional financial aid from private sources.</p>
<p>The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimated the country&#8217;s 11 million undocumented immigrants pay nearly $12 billion annually in state and local taxes, an amount that could grow to nearly $14 billion if they had a pathway to citizenship.</p>
<p>&#8220;States can strive to treat all people with dignity and maximize the contributions of all of their residents, regardless of origin or legal status,&#8221; the report stated. &#8220;Giving all residents access to economic opportunity would enable them to earn higher wages, spend more in the economy and contribute more to the tax base from which states fund schools and other investments that are critical to a strong economy.&#8221;</p>
<p>The report did not include figures for how much enacting the policies might cost. Estimates on the cost of providing health care to undocumented immigrants nationwide, widely supported by the field of Democratic presidential hopefuls, are tough to come by, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/03/health/undocumented-immigrants-health-care.html" target="_blank">The New York Times reported</a> last month. In California alone, however, the cost of covering all people over the age of 19 who were in the country illegally <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/california-considers-health-care-undocumented-immigrants-n1008201" target="_blank">was pegged at $3.4 billion</a>, the Associated Press reported.</p>
<p>The Virginia General Assembly has<a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/virginia/government-politics/general-assembly/es-cuando-muere-virginia-senate-panel-again-kills-bill-to/article_1eb7d1ad-a2cd-5a02-a26f-28df205c1dd5.html" target="_blank"> historically rejected efforts</a> to grant immigrants driving privileges, despite some bi-partisan support and a past endorsement from the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles.  Four years after Connecticut allowed undocumented immigrants to obtain driver&#8217;s licenses, though, the state saw &#8220;a reduction in hit-and-run crashes and a steep decline in the number of people found guilty of unlicensed driving,&#8221; <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/05/24/719959760/licensed-undocumented-immigrants-may-lead-to-safer-roads-connecticut-finds" target="_blank">NPR reported.</a></p>

(Ned Oliver/ Virginia Mercury) </p><p>Sooner or later, this was bound to happen.</p>
<p>When Virginia&#8217;s own Ken Cuccinelli — the former attorney general famous for attempting to<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/23/science/earth/23virginia.html" target="_blank"> prosecute climate change research</a>, covering up <a href="https://pilotonline.com/news/article_36f89ba4-ca4a-529a-be8f-31e8c1736068.html" target="_blank">Virtus&#8217; bareness</a>, suing to <a href="https://www.dailypress.com/government/dp-nws-cuccinelli-0220-20140219-story.html" target="_blank">overturn Obamacare</a>, defending <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/cuccinelli-loses-his-long-war-against-sodomy" target="_blank">anti-sodomy laws</a> and other conservative windmill-tilting that even rolled the eyes of many a Republican here — joined the Trump administration as a top immigration official, it was only a matter of time before he stepped in it.</p>
<p>This week, the inevitable occurred, when <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/08/13/750727515/rule-would-penalize-immigrants-to-u-s-for-needing-benefits" target="_blank">Cuccinelli observed to NPR</a> that &#8220;The New Colossus,&#8221; the famous poem on the Statue of Liberty about the wretched refuse of teeming shores and huddled masses yearning to breath free, really meant: &#8220;Give me your tired and your poor who can stand on their own two feet and who will not become a public charge.&#8221;</p>
<p>Later, on CNN, he made things worse.</p>
<p>&#8220;That poem was referrring back to people coming from Europe where they had class-based societies, where people were considered wretched if they weren&#8217;t in the right class,&#8221; Cuccinelli told a coiled-and-ready-to-strike Erin Burnett in a wholly uneccessary detour, a product of his penchant for pedantry that blew up in his face.</p>
<p>He attempted to go on to explain that the public charge rule, which had been part of U.S. immigration policy for years prior, was expanded in 1903, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/08/14/ken-cuccinelli-statue-liberty-poor/" target="_blank">the same year the &#8220;Colossus&#8221; poem was inscribed on the Statue of Liberty. </a></p>
<p>But after his comments were sucked into the social media machine, where outrage never sleeps, the takeaway was this:</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/brianschatz/status/1161446212194557952" target="_blank">https://twitter.com/brianschatz/status/1161446212194557952</a></p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/RepDonBeyer/status/1161443128257196035" target="_blank">https://twitter.com/RepDonBeyer/status/1161443128257196035</a></p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/StephenAtHome/status/1161438109915078669" target="_blank">https://twitter.com/StephenAtHome/status/1161438109915078669</a></p>
<p>Ouch.  It&#8217;s an awkward spot for the Cooch to be in for sure, defending policies from a president <a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/virginia/government-politics/virginia-delegation-joins-short-lived-convention-revolt-over-rnc-rules/article_6e9c2aba-6eed-5ce5-9eba-2aca6db25ca8.html" target="_blank">he fought to keep off the ballot</a>. He had also sought recently to refashion himself as something of a bi-partisan reformer, lending his, um, name recognition <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/05/07/coalition-takes-aim-at-virginias-vampire-squid-how-much-will-it-make-it-squirm/" target="_blank">to a push to break</a> Dominion Energy and Appalachian Power&#8217;s chokehold on Virginia electric customers.</p>
<p>But, unfortunately, it&#8217;s also no surprise that Cuccinelli would be out front on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/12/us/politics/trump-immigration-policy.html" target="_blank">a draconian policy</a> that would penalize legal immigrants who avail themselves of public benefits, a needlessly cruel move that, when taken with this administration&#8217;s demonization of the other and persecution of desperate asylum seekers, sure looks like they only want a certain kind of immigrant in this country.</p>
<p>Since his elevation to his new federal post, Cuccinelli&#8217;s past remarks <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2013/10/14/did-cuccinelli-compare-immigration-policy-to-exterminating-rats/" target="_blank">likening rat control</a> to immigration policy have also been thrust back into the spotlight, a callous and cavalier comparison that underscore <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/what-ken-cuccinelli-brings-to-trumps-hardline-push-on-immigration" target="_blank">his true hardline immigration stance</a>.</p>
<p>Which is sad and hypocritical, because, once upon a time, government officials in this country<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/02/opinion/illegal-immigration-italian-americans.html" target="_blank"> officially concluded</a> that “certain kinds of criminality are inherent&#8221; in people with names like Cuccinelli&#8217;s and mine.</p>
<p>And though many Italian-American families like to tell themselves their ancestors came over legally, worked hard and became model citizens right away, that, of course, wasn&#8217;t always the reality. It certainly wasn&#8217;t <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/11/02/the-ugly-face-of-nativism-is-on-full-display-with-a-modern-twist/" target="_blank">in the case of some of my relatives</a>.</p>
<p>I said it last year, as the president outrageously, cynically and shamelessly stoked fears about migrants in the run-up to the midterms, and I&#8217;ll say it again: The descendants of immigrants who came here looking for a better life should be the first to champion a humane, thoughtful and inclusive immigration policy.</p>
<p>Sadly, too many of the children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren of the Irish, Italian, Polish, Slovak, Hungarian and other European immigrants who were subjected to prejudice and abuse when they arrived in droves on these shores <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2019/08/13/danger-vilifying-poor-immigrants/" target="_blank">seem to favor</a> drawing up the ladder behind them.</p>
<p>I would be remiss, though, if I didn&#8217;t point out that Cuccinelli was not the only prominent Italian-American to give a poor accounting of himself this week.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NAwowhwi9c" target="_blank">Witness CNN anchor Chris Cuomo</a> do his best impersonation of a guido auditioning for &#8220;Jersey Shore,&#8221; (only missing the &#8220;<a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=COME%20AT%20ME%20BRO" target="_blank">Come at me bro</a>&#8221; bit) when faced with a heckler who called him &#8220;Fredo,&#8221; a reference to the hapless second son from &#8220;The Godfather&#8221; book and movies.</p>
<p>To be fair, and to quote another genre classic, the guy did <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcwxobtNRFQ" target="_blank">&#8220;insult him a little bit.&#8221;</a></p>
<p>But Cuomo went way overboard (as did CNN in trying to defend him) in trying to claim that calling him &#8220;Fredo&#8221; was an &#8220;ethnic slur&#8221; akin to the N-word.</p>
<p>There are lots of ethnic slurs for Italians, as Cuomo surely knows, most of them packed into a single line in the first &#8220;Godfather,&#8221; delivered by the movie producer who later finds a prized horse&#8217;s head in bed with him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care how many dago, guinea, wop, greaseball, goombas come out of the woodwork,&#8221; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4N_UkHyBvc" target="_blank">Jack Woltz tells Corleone</a> crime family consigliere Tom Hagen.</p>
<p>Fredo? Not so much.</p>
<p>Taken with the re-emergence of Anthony Scaramucci, who claims to have suddenly discovered a conscience and <a href="https://www.wdel.com/news/national/scaramucci-says-spicer-is-right-about-this/video_af877cad-ff8b-5c30-9f56-e262593b5fdf.html" target="_blank">is now speaking out</a> about his former boss, the president, and former White House press secretary Sean Spicer (who, in a cringey moment, the Mooch called &#8220;Liar Spice from the Spice Girls&#8221;) after his blink-and-you-missed-it turn as White House communications director in 2017, we&#8217;re not doing our ancestors proud.</p>
<p>No one&#8217;s chanting to send us back yet.</p>
<p>But I couldn&#8217;t necessarily blame them just now if they did.</p>

<p>Just over a year later, the 32-year-old Honduran woman who came to the U.S. seeking asylum says she hasn’t stepped outside once.</p>
<p>“I will not dare to put a foot outside this church,” she said, sitting at a table in the basement, where she lives with her two children in a Sunday school classroom. “Honestly, I am afraid and as time goes by, the situation is getting worse.”</p>
<p>Arevalo-Herrera is one of two women living in Virginia churches to avoid deportation by ICE, which has a policy of not arresting people in locations it deems “sensitive.”</p>
<p>That has not stopped ICE from threatening both women with huge fines, a tactic they deployed <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/trump-administration-threatens-hefty-fines-on-immigrants-who-elude-deportation/2019/07/02/956e2334-9cc2-11e9-9ed4-c9089972ad5a_story.html?utm_term=.935175532052" target="_blank">nationwide</a> at the end of last month, relying on rarely used civil code that allows the government to assess financial penalties for evading deportation.</p>
<p>They’ve ordered Arevalo-Herrera to pay nearly $300,000 and <a href="https://www.dailyprogress.com/news/local/asylum-seeker-living-in-charlottesville-church-facing-k-ice-fine/article_604a3db0-2204-5c64-a025-410688bc7bec.html" target="_blank">Maria Chavalan Sut</a>, who has been living in Wesley Memorial United Methodist Church in Charlottesville since September, to pay $214,000.</p>
<p>The notices specially cite the decision to seek “sanctuary from removal.”</p>
<p>Advocates call it an intimidation tactic while Alina Kilpatrick, an immigration lawyer who represents both women, worries it could presage further legal efforts by ICE to remove her clients.</p>
<p>“I don’t even have that amount of money,” said Arevalo-Herrera. “To be honest, I don’t know what else to say.”</p>
<p>Arevalo-Herrera fled Honduras in 2013 to escape an abusive husband she says continues to send her threats. Intercepted by the U.S. Border Patrol, she said she never got a chance to apply for asylum and later missed a hearing before an immigration judge, which she says she was never told about.</p>
<p>Her case was still up for appeal last June when ICE ordered her to report for immediate deportation.</p>
<p>Her plan upon moving into the church was to buy time while her case continued to work its way through the system. But since then, her appeal was denied.</p>
<p>Kilpatrick says all Arevalo-Herrera can do at this point is wait in hopes that either a court hands down a favorable ruling on orders to appear that aren’t served or President Donald Trump loses reelection and whoever wins reverses immigration policies his administration put in place that made it more difficult for her to obtain a green card.</p>
<p>Until then, Arevalo-Herrera says she’ll continue living in the church, where congregants provide security at doorways for her and curtains have been installed in the basement area she lives in to provide more privacy.</p>
<p>She spends her days caring for her children, taking English classes, cooking and corresponding with other immigrants living in sanctuary.</p>
<p>“Right now, I don’t feel like I have options,” she says. “Just to wait for something to change.&#8221;</p>

<p>The House vote on Thursday followed a week of tense negotiations over the aid funding, which federal immigration officials say is urgently needed to provide care and shelter to migrants who are being housed in overcrowded detention centers along the border. The aid bill became ensnared by the divisive battle over President Donald Trump’s immigration policies.</p>
<p>Four Virginia Democrats — U.S. Reps. Elaine Luria, 2nd, Bobby Scott, 3rd, Abigail Spanberger, 7th, and Jennifer Wexton, 10th, — voted for the bill, along with the state&#8217;s four Republican congressmen, Ben Cline, 6th, Morgan Griffith, 9th, Denver Riggleman, 5th, and Rob Wittman, 1st.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/RobWittman/status/1144340320529920002" target="_blank">https://twitter.com/RobWittman/status/1144340320529920002</a></p>
<p>U.S. Reps. Don Beyer, D-8th, Gerry Connolly, D-11th, and Don McEachin, D-4th, voted against the bill.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/RepMcEachin/status/1144366939495698433" target="_blank">https://twitter.com/RepMcEachin/status/1144366939495698433</a></p>
<p>The House passed its own package earlier this week with stricter health and safety protections for migrants and more congressional oversight requirements.</p>
<p>But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) made it clear that was a nonstarter in the upper chamber of Congress, and the Senate passed its own <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/06/26/u-s-senate-passes-border-aid-bill-heads-to-battle-with-house/" target="_blank">version of the legislation</a> with broad bipartisan support on Wednesday. He called the Senate version the “only game in town.”</p>
<p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) stressed on the House floor Thursday that it wasn’t the bill she wanted. The Senate’s version passed the House by a vote of 305-102, with 176 Republicans supporting the bill and only 129 Democrats.</p>
<p>“We could have done so much better, so much better than what we are faced with today,” Pelosi said. She said she was “gravely disappointed in the actions taken by the Senate,” where leaders refused to compromise to move that bill closer to the measure passed in the House.</p>
<p>With funding drying up and members of Congress about to head back to their districts for the July 4 recess, Pelosi said she relented to ensure that agencies had resources available. “It will not be the end of this debate,” she said.</p>
<p>The legislation that has now cleared both chambers of Congress includes more than $1 billion to shelter and feed detained migrants and nearly $3 billion to care for unaccompanied migrant children, the Associated Press reported.</p>
<p>The measure also includes funding opposed by some House Democrats that would go toward Department of Defense military expenses, funding for Immigration and Customs Enforcement and overtime payments for Customs and Border Protection employees, according to the Texas Tribune.</p>

(CCO Creative Commons via Pixabay)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WASHINGTON &#8212; The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday issued two of its most-anticipated rulings of this term, delaying the addition of a citizenship to the 2020 census and declaring that the courts can’t settle partisan gerrymandering disputes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a complicated </span><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/18pdf/18-966_bq7c.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">decision</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> regarding the Trump administration’s plans to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census, the high court agreed with a lower court to send the issue back to the Commerce Department, citing problems with Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross’ rationale for adding the question. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The delay marks at least a partial victory for critics of adding the question, who argued that it would deter people &#8212; particularly immigrants &#8212; from responding to the census, which could drastically skew the count. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;Adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census will scare households with undocumented members from participating, thereby harming families living in Virginia by undermining participation and causing an inaccurate count of people living in the commonwealth,&#8221; the Virginia Coalition for Immigrant Rights said in a statement. The coalition said it was already &#8220;hitting the streets&#8221; to educate Asian Americans, who the Census Bureau found least likely to complete the census.</p>
<p>Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring, who joined other states&#8217; attorneys general in a lawsuit against the Commerce Department over the question, said &#8220;the Trump administration was trying to intentionally sabotage the census with a poison pill provision that its own Census Bureau admits would reduce response rates&#8221; and result in an inaccurate count that could skew health care and transportation funding as well as legislative districts.</p>
<p>Evidence unearthed from <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/social-issues/despite-trump-administration-denials-new-evidence-suggests-census-citizenship-question-was-crafted-to-benefit-white-republicans/2019/05/30/ca188dea-82eb-11e9-933d-7501070ee669_story.html?utm_term=.328ec84f6120" target="_blank">the files of a GOP operative</a> suggests the question&#8217;s origins lie in an attempt to create an advantage for Republicans in redistricting.</p>
<p>“Fortunately, the court saw through the administration’s cover story and has, for now, protected the accuracy of the census. I hope the Trump administration will put an end to this misguided effort rather than conjure up another contrived reason for its actions,&#8221; Herring said.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Census numbers are used to determine everything from how congressional districts are divvied up to where the government spends cash for programs like Head Start and Medicare.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is hardly improper for an agency head to come into office with policy preferences and ideas, discuss them with affected parties, sound out other agencies for support and work with staff attorneys to substantiate the legal basis for a preferred policy,” Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for the majority. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, he added, “Altogether, the evidence tells a story that does not match the secretary’s explanation for his decision. … The explanation provided here was more of a distraction.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ross has </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-census-ross/commerces-ross-insists-census-citizenship-question-supports-voting-rights-act-idUSKCN1QV27O" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the plan to revive a citizenship question on the 2020 census was an attempt to bolster the Voting Rights Act. But the Supreme Court majority wrote, “Several points, taken together, reveal a significant mismatch between the secretary’s decision and the rationale he provided. The record shows that he began taking steps to reinstate the question a week into his tenure, but gives no hint that he was considering VRA enforcement.” </span></p>
<h2><b>Court won’t wade into partisan gerrymandering</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In another blockbuster </span><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/18pdf/18-422_9ol1.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">opinion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> issued Thursday &#8212; the last day of the court’s term &#8212; the justices ruled that it’s not their place to settle disputes over partisan gerrymandering. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The court split 5-4 along ideological lines in combined high-profile cases surrounding whether state legislators in Maryland and North Carolina went too far when they used politics to redraw congressional districts in their states. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Partisan gerrymandering claims present political questions beyond the reach of the federal courts,” the conservative majority found in another opinion penned by Roberts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was joined by Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The court’s conservative wing wrote that judicial interference in the process would be an &#8220;unprecedented expansion of judicial power&#8221; and would lead to court intervention &#8220;unlimited in scope and duration — it would recur over and over again around the country with each new round of districting.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The North Carolina plaintiffs in the case complained that the state’s redistricting plan discriminated against Democrats, while the Maryland plaintiffs argued that their state’s map discriminated against Republicans. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The court’s liberal wing issued a scathing dissent penned by Justice Elena Kagan. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For the first time ever, this Court refuses to remedy a constitutional violation because it thinks the task beyond judicial capabilities,” she wrote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And not just any constitutional violation. The partisan gerrymanders in these cases deprived citizens of the most fundamental of their constitutional rights: the rights to participate equally in the political process, to join with others to advance political beliefs and to choose their political representatives.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kagan was joined in the dissent by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor.  The court tossed an appeal of a Virginia redistricting decision<a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/06/17/supreme-court-rejects-republicans-appeal-in-gerrymandering-case/" target="_blank"> last week</a>.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Senate version passed on a </span><a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=116&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00184" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">vote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of 84-8 with broad bipartisan support after the chamber voted to reject the House version. Virginia&#8217;s two Democratic senators, Tim Kaine and Mark Warner, voted for the bill. </span></p>
<p>Lawmakers have been spurred to action by<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/21/us/migrant-children-border-soap.html" target="_blank"> reports</a> of a lack of basic necessities at detention centers on the border and a photo of a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/25/americas/mexico-photo-of-father-and-daughter-dead-in-rio-grande/index.html" target="_blank">father and a child</a> from El Salvador floating dead in the Rio Grande.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The aid package has become the latest battleground over President Donald Trump’s immigration policies. Government officials say the cash influx is urgently needed as agencies run low on funding needed to care for migrants, but Democrats and Republicans are divided over how much leeway to give the administration in using the funds to pursue its policy agenda. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Six Senate Democrats voted against the aid package that ultimately passed the chamber: Mazie Hirono of Hawaii; Ed Markey of Massachusetts; Robert Menendez of New Jersey; Jeff Merkley of Oregon; Chris Van Hollen of Maryland and Ron Wyden of Oregon. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are not going to stop the Trump administration’s inhumane and hateful assault on immigrants by giving more money to ICE and CBP,” Markey wrote on Twitter. “We must take a stand and say no more. That’s why today I voted NO on the border funding packages.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two Republicans voted against the bill: Mike Lee of Utah and Rand Paul of Kentucky. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another eight senators didn’t vote, including seven Democratic presidential candidates. Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) also did not vote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The House version passed Tuesday night, largely along party lines. That $4.5 billion aid bill includes more health and safety protections for migrants and more congressional oversight requirements.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump has pledged to </span><a href="https://time.com/5613702/white-house-veto-aid-bill-migrant-families/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">veto</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the House version, and administration officials have said it would hamper their enforcement activities at the border.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Senate rejected the House version earlier on Wednesday by a </span><a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=116&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00182" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">vote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of 37-55. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Congressional leaders said they wanted to finalize the aid bill before lawmakers head home for the Fourth of July recess, but it’s unclear whether the chambers will be able to reconcile their differences in time. </span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft wp-image-7399 size-medium" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/From-The-Bulletin-300x44.png" alt="" width="300" height="44" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/From-The-Bulletin-300x44.png 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/From-The-Bulletin-768x112.png 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/From-The-Bulletin-696x102.png 696w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/From-The-Bulletin.png 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>The left-leaning Richmond institute says that, as many parts of Virginia struggle to find enough workers, many immigrants are &#8220;relatively young, well educated, fluent in English and more likely to participate in the workforce.&#8221;</p>
<p>The one million immigrants in Virginia make up 12.5 percent of the state population. More than two-thirds live in Northern Virginia, where they make up 27 percent of the population.</p>
<p>And while immigration from Mexico tends to dominate the national debate, Virginia&#8217;s immigrant population comes from a wide variety of countries.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mexican immigrants make up just 5% of all immigrants in Virginia, fourth after people born in El Salvador (11%), India (9%), and Korea (6%),&#8221; the report says. &#8220;Looking at continent of birth, rather than country of birth, there is a similar diversity. Forty-three percent of Virginia’s immigrant population was born in Asia, the largest group from any continent.&#8221;</p>
<p>Most of them are also between the prime working ages of 25 and 54.</p>
<p>&#8220;Legislators often bemoan the fact that workforce participation within the state is lower than a decade ago, leaving the state vulnerable to a shrinking tax base,&#8221; the report states. &#8220;What is less commonly noted is the role Virginia immigrants play in supporting the labor force overall. Immigrants participate in Virginia’s workforce at a much higher rate than U.S.-born residents — 72 percent compared to 65 percent — and at a rate six percentage points higher than the national participation for foreign-born residents.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the report also points to public policies that would help address the challenges immigrants face.</p>
<p>More than one in three noncitizen residents lack access to health insurance in Virginia, &#8220;even worse than in the country as a whole,&#8221; the report states.</p>
<p>&#8220;While the national uninsured rate for noncitizens has dropped 16 percentage points since 2009, Virginia’s rate has dropped just five percentage points,&#8221; it adds.</p>
<p>That means immigrants face all the challenges that come with lack of health insurance, like large medical bills and a lack of preventative care. Virginia is also one of only six states to require legal, noncitizens <a href="https://ideastations.org/radio/news/virginia-immigrants-have-work-10-years-qualify-medicaid" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">to work for at least 10 years</a> before they qualify for Medicaid.</p>
<p>Housing and poverty remain problems for the state&#8217;s immigrants, as does what&#8217;s called &#8220;brain waste&#8221;: when people aren&#8217;t working jobs that match their educational attainment.</p>
<p>&#8220;In Virginia, 21 percent of college-educated immigrants 25 and older are working in low-skill jobs or are unemployed. This is well above the average for U.S.-born Virginians,&#8221; the report states. &#8220;Lawmakers, employers, and workforce development officials all have a role to play in reducing this needless inefficiency and maximizing opportunity for the state.&#8221;</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7399" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/From-The-Bulletin-300x44.png" alt="" width="300" height="44" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/From-The-Bulletin-300x44.png 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/From-The-Bulletin-768x112.png 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/From-The-Bulletin-696x102.png 696w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/From-The-Bulletin.png 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/116/bills/hr3401/BILLS-116hr3401ih.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> passed by a </span><a href="http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2019/roll414.xml" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">vote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of 230-195, largely along party lines. The measure lays out new health and safety conditions for children kept in federal custody and additional mechanisms for Congress to oversee the detention operations. </span></p>
<p>“The Trump administration is directly responsible for the humanitarian crisis at the border,” said U.S. Rep. Donald McEachin, D-4th. “Today I voted in support of this crucial legislation which will protect vulnerable children and families by providing them with the dignity, care and services they deserve. It will also provide important oversight provisions to hold the administration accountable. This country must do better when it comes to protecting immigrant communities, and this is an important step in that direction.”</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Democrats pushed the legislation amid </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/21/us/migrant-children-border-soap.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reports</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of severe overcrowding and a failure to provide immigrants with basic necessities at detention centers along the southern U.S. border, while stressing that the aid would not go toward assisting President Trump’s immigration policies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The President’s failed policies have exacerbated the situation at the border, where vulnerable children endure inhumane conditions that threaten their health, well-being and sometimes, tragically, their lives,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said this week. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This legislation provides urgently-needed humanitarian assistance for families, including funding for food, shelter, clothing, medical care and legal assistance, and will relieve the horrific situation of over-crowding and help prevent additional deaths. And we are providing urgent assistance to local communities to help defray their costs of providing humanitarian assistance to asylum seekers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the White House and many Republicans oppose the Democrats’ measure, setting the stage for tense negotiations in the coming days as Congress prepares to leave town for the Fourth of July recess.  Virginia&#8217;s Republicans opposed the bill.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/RepRiggleman/status/1143697484843274241" target="_blank">https://twitter.com/RepRiggleman/status/1143697484843274241</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Trump administration </span><a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-administration-requests-45-billion-border-funding/story?id=62756128" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">requested</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> $4.5 billion in emergency border funding last month as officials from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services warned that the agency could run out of funds to care for unaccompanied migrant children in June.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Senate is expected to take up its own version of the aid bill this week. A Senate committee </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/senate-committee-overwhelmingly-approves-46-billion-in-emergency-border-spending/2019/06/19/552af800-92a5-11e9-b570-6416efdc0803_story.html?utm_term=.2dbea7525caf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">voted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last week to approve its own bipartisan version of the bill. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Notably, the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Washington Post </span></i><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/house-democrats-press-ahead-on-border-bill-setting-up-tense-negotiation-over-migrants/2019/06/25/1d7e09f2-9754-11e9-916d-9c61607d8190_story.html?utm_term=.f0b6db686400" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the Senate legislation doesn’t contain all of the House Democrats’ stipulations aimed at ensuring the humane treatment of children in U.S. custody. The Senate bill includes $50 million more than the House version for immigration judges to speed up adjudication of asylum claims, and $61 million in back pay for Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Three House Republicans sided with Democrats to back the measure: Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania; Will Hurd of Texas; and Chris Smith of New Jersey. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Four progressive freshman Democrats voted against the House legislation: Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York; Ilhan Omar of Minnesota; Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ocasio-Cortez said earlier this week she was opposed to providing billions of dollars in funding to detain unaccompanied migrant children who had been detained at the border. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Referring to reports about the appalling conditions at the facilities, she </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/house-border-funding-bill-in-doubt-after-liberal-democrats-raise-sharp-concerns/2019/06/24/5e13f99c-96da-11e9-916d-9c61607d8190_story.html?utm_term=.81ac9e436139" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">told</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Washington Post</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, “That’s not due to a lack of resources; that’s due to a desire — an active desire by this administration to hurt kids,” she said. “We need to stop funding the detention of children under any and all circumstances.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.congress.gov/116/bills/hr6/BILLS-116hr6ih.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">H.R. 6</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, called the “American Dream and Promise Act,” passed on largely partisan lines by a </span><a href="http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2019/roll240.xml" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">vote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of 237-187. Seven Republicans broke ranks to side with Democrats to support the bill. Virginia&#8217;s delegation split on party lines.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The vote comes after the Trump administration announced </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/05/us/politics/trump-daca-dreamers-immigration.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">plans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to end an Obama administration program to protect young immigrants &#8212; known as “dreamers” &#8212; from deportation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The House legislation would also offer a pathway to citizenship for immigrants with temporary protections, known as Temporary Protected Status (TPS) and Deferred Enforced Departure (DED). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Protecting Dreamers and TPS and DED Americans is about honoring the respect for family that is at the heart of our faith and who we are as Americans,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said at a press conference ahead of the vote. “There should be nothing partisan or political about this legislation.”</span></p>
<p>According to the Center for American Progress, a liberal public policy and advocacy group, Virginia is home to about 69,400 immigrants who are eligible for protection under the Dream and Promise Act. They live with 138,400 family members, including 32,300 U.S.-born citizen children.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eligible immigrants and their households contribute $647,300,000 in federal taxes and $309,700,000 in state and local taxes each year,&#8221; the center says.</p>
<p>The localities that host the largest numbers of them are Fairfax, Prince William, Loudoun and Chesterfield counties and the cities of Alexandria and Arlington.</p>
<p>U.S. Rep. Jennifer Wexton, D-10th, tweeted her support in English and Spanish.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vanita Gupta, president and CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, accused the Trump administration of putting immigrants’ “lives in limbo” and called the bill’s passage “a historic moment for the nation and for each of the 2.5 million individuals who have built their lives here and deserve a long-term legislative solution.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In previous years, legislative efforts to grant protections to undocumented immigrants who entered the country as minors have been bipartisan.

(Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images)</p><p>Between 2013 and 2017, the number of <a href="http://www.dss.virginia.gov/family/ons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">refugees</a> entering Virginia crept up until it topped 4,200, more than double the number who entered the state just four years earlier.</p>
<p>But in 2018, the number plummeted to its lowest in six years, leaving some resettlement agencies scrambling and causing at least one to close its doors.</p>
<p>In the 2018 fiscal year, only 1,749 refugees were settled in Virginia. The vast majority came from Afghanistan, while the second and third most-represented countries were the Democratic Republic of Congo and El Salvador.</p>
<p>While a large number of refugees entering the country and Virginia would pose its own obvious difficulties for resettlement agencies in terms of finding resources, too few presents its own challenges, said Seyoum Berhe, Virginia&#8217;s state refugee coordinator.</p>
<p>The reduction in Virginia follows a national trend. Even as <a href="https://www.unhcr.org/en-us/figures-at-a-glance.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the number of displaced people</a> worldwide has surged to 68.5 million, including 25.4 million refugees, the U.S. has been <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/number-of-refugees-down-sharply-again-under-restrictions-set-by-trump-administration/2019/04/02/94251ef4-54b7-11e9-814f-e2f46684196e_story.html?utm_term=.04e6baf32a20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">accepting a fraction</a> of the number of refugees it has in years past. In fiscal year 2018, President Donald Trump&#8217;s administration set the national cap on refugees entering the country to 45,000, then <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-slashes-the-number-of-refugees-it-will-allow-into-the-country/2018/09/17/a26f398a-bac1-11e8-bdc0-90f81cc58c5d_story.html?utm_term=.e785bdfd1d0e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">slashed it</a> again to 30,000 this fiscal year. There was a 110,000 refugee cap in place when Trump took office, The Washington Post reported.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s mostly, of course, concerning for the families who need to come, who had been cleared to come, some of whom would be reunited with family members and friends already here, many of whom have been waiting for many, many months, and sometimes many years, and sometimes a decade or two, and now will not be coming at least for the foreseeable future,&#8221; said John Baumann, Virginia director of Church World Services, one of the nine resettlement agencies nationwide.</p>
<p>For the agencies themselves, six of which operate in Virginia, the largest impact is on personnel. Once you let staff go or close an entire location, you lose people with valuable resettlement knowledge, Berhe said.</p>
<p>&#8220;People who are capable linguistically and culturally are now leaving to work with private agencies because there is no security,&#8221; he told the state Board of Social Services during a meeting at the beginning of the month. &#8220;That&#8217;s the biggest challenge.&#8221;</p>
<p>Most agencies, he said, have downsized. <a href="https://ideastations.org/radio/news/after-decades-resettling-refugees-church-world-service-richmond-office-closing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Church World Services</a> is in the process of <a href="https://cwsglobal.org/cws-richmond-office-to-close-in-september-2019/" target="_blank">closing its Richmond location</a> by the end of September, though it will continue its work in Harrisonburg.</p>
<p>&#8220;All nine resettlement agencies, including CWS, have had to shrink their networks through layoffs and office closings,&#8221; Baumann said in a <a href="https://cwsglobal.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Letter_RichmondClosing.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">letter</a> on the agency&#8217;s website. &#8220;And all are struggling to hold the line as we await a return to more historically normal, and more compassionate, policies and funding levels.&#8221;</p>
<p>Not every resettlement agency has instituted layoffs, but they have scaled back in other ways. The International Rescue Committee&#8217;s Charlottesville location has trimmed its staff through attrition, said Harriet Kuhr, executive director of the agency&#8217;s Richmond and Charlottesville locations.</p>
<p>Because they haven&#8217;t been resettling as many refugees, IRC has been focusing its efforts on improving and expanding the services it offers to those who are already here, Kuhr said.</p>
<p>That means helping individuals get back on track with their careers or starting up new youth and health programs. It&#8217;s a goal they&#8217;ve had for a long time, Kuhr said, but they&#8217;re now able to devote the time and energy that would otherwise go to helping new refugees.</p>
<p>Fluctuations in the number of refugees entering the U.S. and Virginia is not necessarily new for these agencies. Kuhr pointed out that often agencies have to deal with huge differences on a month-to-month basis, with 31 refugees arriving in one month and only a handful the next, for example.</p>
<p>But such a drastic reduction particularly fuels concerns over the loss of experienced staff, Baumann and Berhe said, especially if the country ultimately returns to the levels it has supported in the past.</p>
<p>Resettlement agencies are government-regulated operations. They can&#8217;t be opened overnight.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would say you&#8217;re talking many months and maybe even years,&#8221; Baumann said. &#8220;You&#8217;re not talking days and weeks.&#8221;</p>
<p>And the reductions are hard on those refugees who do make it to the U.S. Baumann said that families are sometimes split up into more than one case, and when that happens one case can be chosen for resettlement and then the remainder of the family usually expects to be approved, too. But that&#8217;s not always the case.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you can have folks who are separated from their family members for many years,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and some folks have a legitimate worry that they may not really have an opportunity to see them again for a very long time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lopez said the bill &#8220;ignores the complicated nature of federal immigration law&#8221; and would increase reluctance among undocumented immigrants to report crimes.</p>
<p>The bill, he claimed, is really about &#8220;dog whistle politics&#8221; intended to &#8220;stoke fear of the other.&#8221;</p>
<p>Republicans bristled at that characterization.</p>
<p>&#8220;We allow one million legal immigrants a year,&#8221; said Del. Jason Miyares, R-Virginia Beach, whose mother fled communist Cuba. &#8220;When I hear terms like dog whistle politics &#8230; that to me is astonishing.&#8221;</p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>By Jayla Marie McNeill/ Capital News Service</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia has joined a coalition of 15 other states to challenge President Donald Trump’s declaration of a national emergency and to block the diversion of congressional funding to build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico, according to a lawsuit filed Monday.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Concocting a fake emergency to build a needless wall goes against the Constitution and the values America was built on,” Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring said in a statement.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“President Trump’s ill-advised plan could divert critical funds from actual national security priorities, including military construction projects at bases and facilities throughout Virginia. We must stand up to this administration when it violates the law and attacks our values.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">According to Herring’s statement, the complaint was filed to block Trump’s “fabricated” national emergency declaration and the “unconstitutional” diversion of appropriated federal funding to pay for the construction of the border wall.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">On Friday, Trump said he would declare a national emergency in order to bypass Congress to fund the construction of a wall along the southern border.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The White House released a statement stating that the president has “clear authority” to declare a national emergency and that Trump is taking “necessary steps” to “ensure we stop the national security and humanitarian crisis at our Southern Border.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“We fight wars that are 6,000 miles away, wars that we should have never been in in many cases, but we don’t control our own border,” Trump said in his speech Friday at the White House. “So we are going to confront the national-security crisis on our southern border. And we are going to do it one way or the other.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The administration estimated that the national emergency declaration will make over $8 billion in taxpayer funds available to build the border wall.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Other states participating in the lawsuit includes Hawaii, Colorado, Connecticut, New Jersey, Delaware, Michigan, Minnesota Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Nevada, New Mexico, New York and California.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The states contend that Trump’s emergency declaration is only a means to justify using federal funding to pay for his border wall.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“The states allege that the Trump Administration’s action exceeds the power of the executive office, violates the U.S. Constitution and federal statutes, and would illegally and unconstitutionally divert federal funds appropriated by Congress for other purposes,” Herring’s statement said.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“The suit seeks declaratory and injunctive relief to block the emergency declaration, the construction of the wall, and any illegal diversion of congressionally-appropriated funds.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">According to the attorney general’s statement, Virginia could potentially lose over $130 million in military construction funding — money that is currently allocated for projects at Dam Neck, Fort A.P. Hill, Fort Belvoir, Humphreys Engineer Center, Joint Base Langley-Eustis, and the Pentagon.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Trump said that he expected his contentious national emergency declaration to prompt lawsuits. He remains confident, however, that his decision will be upheld by the Supreme Court, similar to the way his 2017 travel ban was upheld by the court in a 5-4 decision.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“We will have a national emergency and we will then be sued,” Trump said. “Hopefully we will get a fair shake and win in the Supreme Court just like the ban.”</p>

<p>While 44 states require immigrants to legally reside in the country for five years before, in Virginia the individual must have worked 40 quarters in the U.S., or 10 years.</p>
<p>Budget amendments before both the <a href="https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/amendment/2019/1/HB1700/Introduced/MR/303/36h/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">House</a> and <a href="https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/amendment/2019/1/SB1100/Introduced/MR/303/8s/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Senate</a> would eliminate that requirement. They estimate that the change would bring down $16.55 million from the federal government, and cost Virginia $6.55 million.</p>
<p>&#8220;This state cost estimate does not include the savings that would likely occur from the state not having to reimburse expensive emergency room visits by legal immigrants who are ineligible for full Medicaid coverage,&#8221; the report states. &#8220;It is time for Virginia to end the 40-quarters rule for lawful permanent residents and ensure their access to health care on the same basis of other Virginians.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the fall of 2017, there were only 418 students with Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, status at the state&#8217;s four-year public schools, and 995 at Virginia&#8217;s community colleges. Of those, 96 percent qualified for in-state tuition.</p>
<p>There were even fewer students with Temporary Protective Status, or TPS. Only 27 attended four-year schools, and 22 paid in-state tuition. Data on those with TPS status in community colleges was unavailable, according to the report.</p>
<p>&#8220;These enrollment numbers show that any concerns that Virginians with DACA and TPS status would overwhelm Virginia&#8217;s public colleges are unfounded,&#8221; the report states.</p>
<p>There are, however, significant benefits to the state in allowing those students to access higher education, particular in that they become &#8220;more productive future employees and Virginians,&#8221; according to the report.</p>
<p>The new data paves the way for the General Assembly to take action, according to the Commonwealth Institute, as students face the potential end of the DACA program and non-renewal for people with TPS status.</p>
<p>Without those programs, students would be ineligible for in-state tuition unless the legislature expands in-state tuition status to Virginia residents regardless of their immigration status.</p>
<div>&#8220;Creating real opportunity for all Virginians to pursue a college education provides significant returns to the students and the state without being a significant burden on Virginia&#8217;s colleges or taxpayers,&#8221; Laura Goren, research director of the Commonwealth Institute, said in a news release.</div>

Trump waves as he boards Air Force One at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport in Phoenix, Ariz. Saturday, October 20, 2018, en route to Elko Regional Airport in Elko, Nev. (Official White House Photo by Shealah Craighead)</p><p>I have heard it a million times and the story still makes my sides split.</p>
<p>My grandmother, an aspiring Boston nurse of Irish and English ancestry, who grew up in the nearby seaside town of Quincy, had started dating a Harvard medical student with a funny last name and was at last convinced to meet his family in New Jersey.</p>
<p>She was promptly taken to a homecoming party in honor of Uncle Tony.</p>
<p>Where had Tony been and why were they having a party to celebrate?</p>
<p>No one would give her a straight answer, so she went up to the man himself and asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess you could say I&#8217;ve been away at college,&#8221; said Tony, then in his 40s.</p>
<p>My grandmother, impressed, declared how &#8220;wonderful&#8221; it was that a man his age was still trying to better himself through higher education.</p>
<p>The assembled Zullos fell out in laughter.</p>
<p>Tony, of course, had been in an institution, but it wasn&#8217;t one of the Garden State&#8217;s leafy college campuses.</p>
<p>Family lore is that an attempt to bribe a judge had landed him behind bars that particular time.</p>
<p>But Tony&#8217;s criminal history included less risible episodes, chief among them a gunfight between him and an uncle, John, after an argument over money that killed an innocent bystander.</p>
<p>The victim, Rocco Perrino, was among a crowd gathered outside a store in October of 1935 in Port Reading, N.J., a beacon for immigrants because of the railroad work, to hear translations of the news of the day (Italian dictator Benito Mussolini had just invaded Ethiopia).</p>
<figure id="attachment_3432" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:775px;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-3432 size-full" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/tonyzullo.png" alt="" width="775" height="649" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/tonyzullo.png 775w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/tonyzullo-300x251.png 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/tonyzullo-768x643.png 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/tonyzullo-696x583.png 696w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/tonyzullo-502x420.png 502w" sizes="(max-width: 775px) 100vw, 775px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  The Oct. 25, 1935 edition of the Woodbridge (N.J.) Independent, which chronicles the investigation into a shooting involving the author&#8217;s great-great uncle.</p></figure>
<p>&#8220;Perrino died as an indirect result of Mussolini&#8217;s Ethiopian adventure,&#8221; the Woodbridge Independent reported. &#8220;Every since Il Duce called his nation to arms, knots of Italian-Americans have gathered every morning at John Zullo&#8217;s little store to listen to translations of the daily paper&#8217;s war news. Perrino purchased cigars Saturday, lingered to hear the talk and happened to be in the line of fire on the first discharge.&#8221;</p>
<p>Until I was 13, I lived far from New Jersey.</p>
<p>And while I sometimes longed for a more Anglo last name that wasn&#8217;t constantly butchered by teachers, bullies and coaches, I held a degree of fascination for the tales of Tony and other relatives&#8217; less savory exploits as they attempted to navigate a society that didn&#8217;t fully embrace them: bootlegging liquor, hauling Stewart&#8217;s root beer stands off their moorings because of unpaid debts and goodwill deliveries of cases of whiskey to police headquarters, among others.</p>
<p>Now, as a father of two, what strikes me most is a sentence fragment buried deep in another account of the shooting: &#8220;Perrino, a bystander and father of a small child.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tony and his brother, Carmen Zullo, my great-grandfather, were part of a large southern Italian immigrant family that came from Pietrastornina, a small village just north of Avellino, and settled in New Jersey near the end of the 19th century, around the time 11 Italian-Americans were <a href="https://www.history.com/news/the-grisly-story-of-americas-largest-lynching" target="_blank">lynched in New Orleans</a> by a mob furious over the murder of the city police chief.</p>
<figure id="attachment_3435" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:218px;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-3435 size-medium" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Great-Grandpa-Neil-218x300.jpg" alt="" width="218" height="300" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Great-Grandpa-Neil-218x300.jpg 218w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Great-Grandpa-Neil-696x960.jpg 696w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Great-Grandpa-Neil-305x420.jpg 305w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Great-Grandpa-Neil.jpg 712w" sizes="(max-width: 218px) 100vw, 218px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  The author&#8217;s great-great-grandfather, Aniello &#8220;Neil&#8221; Zullo, born in 1864 in Pietrastornina, Italy.</p></figure>
<p>&#8220;These sneaking and cowardly Sicilians, the descendants of bandits and assassins, who have transported to this country the lawless passions, the cut-throat practices and the oath-bound societies of their native country, are to us a pest without mitigation,&#8221; <a href="https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1891/03/16/103299119.pdf" target="_blank">The New York Times opined</a>.</p>
<p>Tony, despite his many good qualities (my grandmother still remembers him fondly) did nothing to dispel the stereotypes about Italian-American criminality that &#8220;The Godfather,&#8221; &#8220;Goodfellas&#8221; and &#8220;The Sopranos&#8221; have cemented in our culture, though the same attitudes go back <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/02/opinion/illegal-immigration-italian-americans.html" target="_blank">much further</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/1911-report-set-america-on-path-screening-out-undesirable-immigrants-180969636/" target="_blank">1911 Dillingham Commission</a>, for example, tasked with a massive study of U.S. immigration, concluded that &#8220;certain kinds of criminality are inherent in the Italian race.”</p>
<p>Carmen helped defy those stereotypes before he died of cancer at 43, setting his three sons, including my grandfather, on paths that led from the military to college to long careers as medical professionals (dentistry, surgery and oncology).</p>
<p>As an Army surgeon, my great-uncle Joseph Zullo operated on Gen. Douglas MacArthur, who wrote him a thank-you note that hung on his office wall for decades.</p>
<p>Nothing involving mass movements of people is all one thing or another. The story of immigration is really just the story of humanity writ smaller, with all of its attendant tragedies, triumphs, mistakes, beauty and ugliness.</p>
<p>We need a fair, functional immigration system. Part of that is secure borders, but that&#8217;s just one aspect of a complex debate replete with thorny issues.</p>
<p>However, it&#8217;s impossible to have that conversation amid the rabid nativist backlash — long ascendant in conservative circles — that is utterly consuming the far right at the moment. And our president, <a href="https://thehill.com/media/413732-shep-smith-rips-trump-rhetoric-on-migrant-caravan-there-is-no-invasion-no-one-is-coming" target="_blank">evidently with his eye</a> on driving the base out in next week&#8217;s midterms, is dumping gasoline on the flames.</p>
<p>American nativism, of course, perhaps best exemplified by the <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/immigrants-conspiracies-and-secret-society-launched-american-nativism-180961915/" target="_blank">Know Nothing party of the 1850s</a>, is as old as the United States.</p>
<p>Their modern day descendants are also keen on conspiracies: Multiple mainstream conservative commentators openly speculated that the bombs mailed to President Donald Trump&#8217;s critics last week were a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/oct/26/pipe-bombs-false-flag-claims-ann-coulter-rush-limbaugh-conspiracy-theories" target="_blank">&#8220;false flag&#8221; operation orchestrated by liberals</a>.</p>
<p>That toxic mix of nativism and conspiracy theory seems to have been at work in last weekend&#8217;s<a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/robert-bowers-synagogue-shooter-hate-crime_us_5bd4892be4b0a8f17ef84019" target="_blank"> massacre at a Pittsburgh synagogue</a>, which the accused shooter appears to have targeted because of his hatred of the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society. The group&#8217;s Pittsburgh affiliate, Jewish Family and Children&#8217;s Services, which helps settle refugees, counted <a href="http://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2018/10/30/Pittsburgh-jewish-refugee-resettlement-HIAS-squirrel-hill-synagogue-shooting/stories/201810300100" target="_blank">a congregation at Tree of Life</a> as a participant.</p>
<p>“HIAS likes to bring invaders in that kill our people,&#8221; the alleged gunman apparently posted just before the shooting. &#8220;I can’t sit by and watch my people get slaughtered. Screw your optics, I’m going in.”</p>
<p>Syndicated columnist Cal Thomas had <a href="https://www.richmond.com/ap/commentary/cal-thomas-column-invasion-of-the-country-snatchers/article_2a69d879-6fe6-5f58-9dfd-afd951779c22.html" target="_blank">this especially loathsome take on people fleeing violence, poverty and oppression</a>, positing that the caravan of thousands of migrants from Central America dominating the news cycle might actually be  &#8220;a ploy by Democrats to win sympathy from Hispanic voters so they’ll reverse their growing approval of Trump administration policies and vote against their interests.&#8221;</p>
<p>A woman at Trump&#8217;s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/29/us/politics/caravan-trump-shooting-elections.html" target="_blank">rally in far southern Illinois</a>, an area that <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-rendleman-farm-agriculture-immigrant-workers-0820-biz-20170818-story.html" target="_blank">depends</a> to a considerable<a href="https://thesouthern.com/news/local/seasonal-labor-visa-program-changes-the-face-of-southern-illinois/article_a306de46-0b82-5229-9c1a-ff46c9dc39a1.html" target="_blank"> degree on immigrant and guest worker labor</a>, called the caravan &#8220;a ploy to destroy America and to bring us to our knees.&#8221;</p>
<p>None, of course, can hold a candle to our<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-wouldnt-be-surprised-if-democratic-megadonor-george-soros-is-funding-the-migrant-caravan/2018/11/01/9ea196a0-ddcf-11e8-85df-7a6b4d25cfbb_story.html?utm_term=.09783ce8600c" target="_blank"> conspiracist-in-chief</a>, the president himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Many Gang Members and some very bad people are mixed into the Caravan heading to our Southern Border,&#8221; Trump<a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1056919064906469376" target="_blank"> tweeted</a>.  &#8220;Please go back, you will not be admitted into the United States unless you go through the legal process. This is an invasion of our Country and our Military is waiting for you!&#8221;</p>
<p>Applying for asylum at the border is, in fact, <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/6/5/17428640/border-families-asylum-illegal" target="_blank">part of the legal process</a>.</p>
<p>Trump, as always though, refuses to be bound by facts or tone it down.</p>
<p>Rather, he&#8217;s claimed he&#8217;ll do away with birthright citizenship by executive order,<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/10/31/fact-checking-trumps-macho-talk-birthright-citizenship-military-border/?utm_term=.e1f8c5e8484e" target="_blank"> which he evidently cannot do</a>, shared <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1057728445386539008" target="_blank">a truly vile ad</a> blaming Democrats for immigrant violence, and, just Thursday, <a href="https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/policy/immigration/article220982805.html" target="_blank">pledged to erect tent cities</a> to hold asylum seekers at the border, among other moves cynically and revoltingly aimed at rousing the GOP base&#8217;s basest instincts before the midterms.</p>
<p>For those of us who are living the dream our ancestors clung to when they took off for foreign shores, this is a crucial time to speak out against mass vilification based on race, ethnicity, religion or national origin and to remember when people like us were demonized as the &#8220;other.&#8221;</p>
<p>And while we might like to think our forebears did things the right way, many of them didn&#8217;t go <a href="https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/research/did-my-family-really-come-legally-todays-immigration-laws-created-a-new-reality" target="_blank">by the book or came before there were immigration laws to break</a>. And not all of them were model citizens once they got here.</p>
<p>You won&#8217;t find too many times that I&#8217;ll hold up Fox News contributor Andrew Napolitano as a lodestar of moderation and sanity.</p>
<p>And yet:</p>
<p>&#8220;Nationalism and its cousin nativism are dangerous attitudes that have come and gone almost cyclically throughout American history,&#8221; Napolitano <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/judge-andrew-napolitano-the-camp-of-the-saints-and-the-migrant-caravan" target="_blank">wrote last week in a critique of Trump.</a>  &#8220;They foster an arrogant aura about Americans who embrace them — we are more deserving than you because our ancestors got here before you or yours did — and they cause fear and hatred of foreign-born people.&#8221;</p>
<p>He took particular aim at Trump&#8217;s move to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/30/us/politics/american-troops-border-migrants.html" target="_blank">dispatch thousands of U.S. troops </a> to the border.</p>
<p>&#8220;The blanket rejection by force of everyone in the caravan violates the spirit and the intentions of the laws the president has sworn to uphold. Those laws mandate a careful examination of all who want to come here — on a neutral case-by-case basis — not a blanket prohibition,&#8221; the judge wrote. &#8220;We who call ourselves Americans are nearly all descended from immigrants. Yet when our forebears arrived here, they were met simply by prejudice and government indifference. The poor folks in the caravan are likely to be met by prejudice and government force.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bravo, paesan.</p>

All except Braford are immigrants.</p><p style="font-weight: 400;">When my wife and I started attending Tabernacle Baptist Church in Richmond, we were impressed by the diverse congregation.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Nearly a third of our members are refugees.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I become friends with a Burmese refugee named Biak Tling, an experienced carpenter in his home country whose first job in Richmond was in a commercial kitchen.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We were both looking for ways to bring in extra cash, so we painted a few houses on the side. I saw an opportunity to build a painting business by combining our past experience and skill, and I asked Biak to join me. In 2013, I founded Global Painting with him as my foreman.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I’m so glad we teamed up. With his years of experience and natural-born leadership, Biak helped me build my business from the ground up. Today, we have seven full-time painters who hail from Burma and Burundi and range in age from 26 to 46. Since they’ve been working for me, several have received promotions, two have become homeowners and at least five welcomed American-born children into their families.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The ability of refugees in our city to seize the American dream is one of the reasons Richmond received high scores in New American Economy’s new <a href="https://www.newamericaneconomy.org/interactive-index/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://www.newamericaneconomy.org/interactive-index/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1539726417020000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF2JffD5vp6KKWXdZ67W2tImNvrrg" target="_blank">Cities Index</a>, an interactive tool that measures how effectively the largest 100 U.S. cities are integrating immigrants.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We ranked especially well in the categories of government leadership, community and economic prosperity. Of course, there is still room for growth in certain areas, like when it comes to job opportunities.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We have <a href="http://www.nbc12.com/story/38493767/richmond-nonprofit-helps-refugees-transition-to-life-in-us/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://www.nbc12.com/story/38493767/richmond-nonprofit-helps-refugees-transition-to-life-in-us/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1539726417020000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFRdBTXC1qrOZ5ue5WB3uU4FE-rWA" target="_blank">more than 2,000 refugees</a> and roughly <a href="https://www.newamericaneconomy.org/city/richmond/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://www.newamericaneconomy.org/city/richmond/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1539726417020000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEVhGS79YfGzt-vsu130knTP_D4Wg" target="_blank">94,500 immigrants</a> in Richmond, and still our unemployment rate is a mere <a href="https://www.bls.gov/eag/eag.va_richmond_msa.htm" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://www.bls.gov/eag/eag.va_richmond_msa.htm&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1539726417021000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEVZ2wKOEytmfCvDEVwkr0vGBLhmw" target="_blank">3.1 percent</a>, .8 percent lower than the <a href="https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS14000000" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS14000000&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1539726417021000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH3Eu6Tu92J3YOjMkgdjZtD9lpG-w" target="_blank">national rate</a>.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Over 90 percent of our foreign-born residents are employed, according to the index. Between high-skilled workers in our STEM sector, and those like my painting team, who work physical jobs, immigrants and refugees here paid more than $883 million in taxes and held $2.1 billion in spending power <a href="https://www.newamericaneconomy.org/city/richmond/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://www.newamericaneconomy.org/city/richmond/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1539726417021000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGByVbA1ueoVXuWOS903DhaIPi4lQ" target="_blank">in 2014</a>.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">They boast a high median income and low poverty rate, according to the index. And they are self-sufficient, with large numbers who do not rely on food stamps and welfare.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">These are all good things, but these newcomers could be doing even more for themselves and our economy if there weren’t roadblocks in place.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">They come here with degrees and experience, but wind up woefully underemployed simply because they don’t have access to resources that ensure their skills translate to the American job market. Taking a doctor, an electrician, a carpenter from another county and asking them to cut chicken parts or push shopping carts is not where the United States gains the most value.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Biak’s previous job was fine, but it wasn’t until he helped me start Global Paining that he was able to truly flourish. Which is what has ensured my own success.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">It’s proof that when we pull together for the collective good of our city anything is possible.</p>

<p>The woman, María Chavalan Sut, is the second immigrant to publicly claim sanctuary in a Virginia house of worship, taking advantage of an ICE policy of not conducting raids or enforcement activity in &#8220;sensitive locations.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sut says she came to the United States seeking asylum as a persecuted minority but was never given a hearing date, according to a statement distributed by activists supporting her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have lived all of my life with violence. My children are the reason I am fighting. I want them to live without all of the suffering I have experienced,&#8221; she said in the statement. &#8220;Living in the church &#8211; this is the first time I can breathe; the first time I can sleep; the first time I have not felt afraid.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Rev. Isaac Collins described the decisions to take Sut in as an act of faith, not politics.</p>
<p>&#8220;In Christ, there is no such thing as citizenship, borders or political parties. Christians have been offering sanctuary for thousands of years,&#8221; he said in the statement. &#8220;As United Methodists, our social principles &#8216;urge the church and society to recognize the gifts, contributions and struggles of those who are immigrants and to advocate for justice for all.'&#8221;</p>
<p>Sut is one of more than 30 immigrants nationwide currently being shielded from deportation by religious institutions, according to <a href="http://www.sanctuarynotdeportation.org/uploads/7/6/9/1/76912017/sanctuary_in_the_age_of_trump_january_2018.pdf" target="_blank">Church World Service</a>.</p>
<p>In Richmond, Abbie Arevalo-Herrera has been living in a classroom in the basement of the First Unitarian Universalist Church Of Richmond since June.</p>
<p>As the Mercury&#8217;s <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/09/04/24-7-vigilance-a-live-in-lawyer-and-embracing-activism-two-months-of-claiming-sanctuary-in-a-richmond-churchs-basement/" target="_blank">in-depth profile published last month</a> showed, the arrangement has offered Arevalo-Herrera a reprieve, but she and church leaders have also struggled with logistical and interpersonal challenges.</p>
