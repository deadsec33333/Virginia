(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>Scott Durvin says he faced aggressive questioning from a Chesterfield County Police detective after his friend died of a drug overdose at the end of 2019. What he didn’t know at the time was that police had also begun secretly tracking his whereabouts by ordering Verizon Wireless to regularly ping his phone’s GPS and report his location back to detectives in real time.</p>
<p>“That’s kind of shocking, really,” Durvin said, reached by phone at the same number police were using to follow him virtually a little more than two years ago. “The detective would call me all the time and try to get me to give them information and he would threaten to lock me up. But I didn’t have anything to do with it and he finally left me alone.”</p>
<p>Police never described Durvin as a suspect in the search warrant application they submitted seeking permission to track him and court records show he has not been charged with any crimes in Virginia since police took out the warrant.</p>
<p>Instead, officers wrote that they had found voicemails from Durvin on the overdose victim’s phone and thought tracking his location might help them figure out who supplied the deadly dose of heroin, noting that Durvin had been with the man during what appeared to be a prior overdose in Richmond.</p>
<p>The case offers a glimpse into a surveillance technique that’s become commonplace for police but is mostly unknown among the general public: cell phone location tracking.</p>
<p>Public records requests submitted to a sampling of 18 police departments around the state found officers used the technique to conduct more than 7,000 days worth of surveillance in 2020. Court records show the tracking efforts spanned cases ranging from high-profile murders to minor larcenies.</p>
<p>A state law passed with little notice in 2015 authorizes the surveillance as long as police first obtain a search warrant from a magistrate or judge, but in practice, the bar for judicial approval isn’t particularly high. Officers simply have to attest in an affidavit that they have probable cause that the tracking data is “relevant to a crime that is being committed or has been committed.”</p>
<p>The warrants are limited by law to 30 days but can be — and often are — renewed monthly by a judge.</p>
<p>“I don’t think people know that their cell phones can be converted to tracking devices by police with no notice,” said Steve Benjamin, a criminal defense lawyer in Richmond who said he’s recently noticed an uptick in cases in which officers employed the technique. “And the reality of modern life is everyone has their phone on them during the day and on their nightstand at night. … It’s as if the police tagged them with a chip under their skin, and people have no idea how easily this is accomplished.”</p>
<p>In Durvin’s case, the justification police gave for tracking him came down to a single paragraph in the search warrant application asserting officers believed it might help their case.</p>
<p>“It is in your affiant’s experience that users of narcotics will associate with other users and suppliers of narcotics in the drug trade,” wrote Det. G. Hopkins. “Your affiant believes the real time location data … will assist in the on-going investigation into the supplier of narcotics.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">&#8216;We will use all lawful tools at our disposal&#8217;</h4>

	
<p>Records reviewed by the Mercury suggest Chesterfield police are among the more prolific users of the technology in Virginia.</p>
<p>The department makes no apologies for its embrace of phone tracking. “We exist to preserve human life and protect the vulnerable, and we will use all lawful tools at our disposal to do so,” Chesterfield County Police Spokeswoman Elizabeth Caroon said in a statement.</p>
<p>To assess how widely police in Virginia employ cellphone tracking, the Mercury submitted Freedom of Information Act requests to police departments around the state seeking billing records from telephone companies, which charge police departments daily or monthly fees to report their customers’ location to officers.</p>
<p>We found:</p>
<p>• At least nine of the 18 police departments sampled track cell phones, but how frequently varied considerably by department. At the high end, Chesterfield accounted for 4,500 days of tracking and 346 warrants, while Norfolk Police, at the low end, reported 63 days of tracking across six warrants.</p>
<p>• Two departments indicated they had relevant invoices but requested hundreds of dollars to provide the records to the Mercury: Loudoun County estimated it would cost $361 to fulfill the request. Alexandria requested $1,360 and ignored emails seeking an explanation for the high price tag.</p>
<p>• The remaining seven departments responded that they did not have any relevant billing records, indicating they don’t use the technique.</p>
<p>• Only one of the departments surveyed, Alexandria, indicated it had an internal policy governing how their officers use cellphone tracking, but a copy of the document provided by the city was entirely redacted.</p>
<p>To understand what kinds of cases police are using the technology to investigate, the Mercury also reviewed all unsealed search warrant applications filed in 2020 in the city of Richmond and Chesterfield County. The documents, which are presented to magistrates or circuit court judges to justify and obtain permission to conduct the surveillance, describe the crimes under investigation and the basic facts of the individual cases.</p>
<p>Drug investigations accounted for more than 60 percent of the search warrants taken out in the two jurisdictions. Larcenies were the second most frequent category. Major crimes like murders, rapes and abductions made up a fraction of the tracking requests, accounting for just under 25 of the nearly 400 warrants filed in the jurisdictions that year.</p>

    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Phone companies charge police to surveille customers</h4>

	
<p>Real-time location warrants in Virginia are addressed to telephone companies, ordering them to regularly ping a customers’ phone for its GPS location and share the results with police. All four major telecoms charge varying rates to surveille their customers on behalf of law enforcement.</p>
<p><strong>T-Mobile</strong> charged $30 per day, which comes to $900 per month of tracking.</p>
<p><strong>AT&amp;T</strong> charged a monthly service fee of $100 and an additional $25 per day the service is utilized, which comes to $850 per 30 days of tracking, according to bills reviewed by the Mercury.</p>
<p><strong>Verizon</strong> calls the service “periodic location updates,” charging $5 per day on top of a monthly service fee of $100, which comes to $200 per 30 days of tracking.</p>
<p><strong>Sprint</strong> offered the cheapest prices to report locations back to law enforcement, charging a flat fee of $100 per month.</p>
</div>
	</div>
	
<p>In Richmond, Maj. Ronnie Armstead said in an interview the department leaves it to individual detectives to determine when and how to use cell phone tracking. And he said officers don’t distinguish between major and minor cases &#8212; they just want to solve crimes: “These detectives do a thorough investigation,” he said. “They don’t care what size fish you are.”</p>
<p>In practice, that means officers used the technique in high-stakes drug investigations as well as more run-of-the-mill investigations.</p>
<p>Court records show police used phone tracking extensively in the investigation that led to the arrest of Nikike Tyler, who authorities <a href="https://www.wtvr.com/news/local-news/nikike-tyler-arrested-henrico-drug-trafficking-money-laundering-bust" target="_blank">allege led a regional drug ring</a> that imported and distributed large quantities of heroin, cocaine and marijuana. Search warrants filed by a regional drug task force in Richmond indicate officers tracked Tyler’s cell phone for more than a year, updating warrants as he regularly changed cell phone numbers, according to affidavits on file.</p>
<p>Records show police also turned to location tracking when a former employee of a Mexican food restaurant in downtown Richmond, Café Ole, was accused by an ex-girlfriend of stealing $200 from the register. According to the warrant on file, a Richmond officer received permission to track the man’s location for 30 days after a visit to his mother’s house in Goochland failed to turn him up.</p>
<p>Sometimes, police sought the warrants even in cases where officers weren’t sure who exactly they were tracking.</p>
<p>In one Chesterfield search warrant application, an officer wrote in their affidavit that an unnamed person he described as “a reliable confidential source” had given him the phone number for an alleged drug dealer named “Weedy” who his source had heard was coming to the Richmond area to sell heroin. A magistrate approved the warrant based on the officer’s justification that “real time location data collected during this investigation will assist in identifying ‘Weedy,’ potential co-conspirators and locations utilized for conducting drug transactions.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">&#8216;I feel like my privacy was violated&#8216;</h4>

	
<p>The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that warrantless cellphone tracking is unconstitutional back in 2012. Since then, there’s been limited public discussion or awareness of the kinds of tracking warrants the judiciary is approving.</p>
<p>When Virginia <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?151+sum+HB2355" target="_blank">passed a law three years later</a> setting out the warrant requirement in state code, it drew almost no notice in the General Assembly, passing unanimously on every vote. The bill’s patron, then-Del. Manoli Loupassi, a Richmond lawyer, said he had little recollection of the legislation and was surprised to hear how often police now use the statute to enable cell phone tracking.</p>
<p>“I think the original intent was to capture and ferret out extremely serious criminality,” Loupassi said. “Not just nothing cases. And this is one of the millions of examples of how the road to hell can be paved with good intentions.”</p>
<p>Police officials, meanwhile, argue it only makes sense to take advantage of technological advances. Dana Schrad, the executive director of the Virginia Association of Chiefs of Police, said departments often don’t have the resources to conduct physical surveillance. And even if they did, she said cell phone tracking is safer.</p>
<p>“It may be considered an intrusive way of gathering data on someone, but it’s certainly less dangerous than physical tracking,” she said.</p>
<p>Back in Chesterfield, police officials described their use of cell phone tracking as part of an effort to proactively investigate drug crimes, suggesting the effort had helped keep the number of fatal overdoses from rising in the county.</p>
<p>“We believe our continued robust enforcement efforts are part of why the numbers haven’t increased further in Chesterfield,” Caroon, the department’s spokeswoman, said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Durvin, who Chesterfield police tracked in the 2020 overdose investigation, counts himself among those who considers the technique intrusive. “It’s kind of f**ked up,” he said. “I feel like my privacy was violated. And who&#8217;s to say they ain’t still doing it?”</p>

    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">By the numbers</h4>

	
<p>Use of real time location tracking varies significantly by police department, according to billing records and search warrants reviewed by the Mercury.</p>
<p><strong>Chesterfield County Police</strong>: Conducted more than 4,500 days of cell phone location surveillance and obtained 346 real-time location search warrants in 2020, according to billing and court records.</p>
<p><strong>Arlington County</strong>: Conducted an unknown number of days of surveillance across an unknown number of warrants, but provided purchase orders for GPS location surveillance totaling $86,000, which is the second highest amount reported of localities surveyed.</p>
<p><strong>Hanover County Sheriff’s Office</strong>: Conducted 1,407 days of surveillance and obtained at least 71 real-time location search warrants.</p>
<p><strong>Virginia Beach Police Department</strong>: 840 days of surveillance across at least 51 real time location warrants.</p>
<p><strong>Fairfax County Police Department</strong>: An unknown number of days of surveillance across 56 real time location warrants.</p>
<p><strong>Richmond City Police</strong>: Conducted an unknown number of days of surveillance across at least 31 real time location warrants.</p>
<p><strong>Spotsylvania County Sheriff’s Office</strong>: 254 days of surveillance across at least 25 warrants.</p>
<p><strong>Prince William Police Department</strong>: 76 days of surveillance across at least 4 warrants.</p>
<p><strong>Norfolk Police Department</strong>: 63 days of surveillance across at least four warrants.</p>
<p>Two additional departments indicated that they utilize real-time location warrants but requested high fees to provide records documenting the surveillance: Alexandria Police Department and Loudoun County Sheriff’s Department. (Fairfax Police requested more than $550 to provide the invoices requested but voluntarily reported that they took out 56 of the warrants in 2020.)</p>
<p>The following departments either indicated through their responses to the Mercury that they do not use real time location warrants or a review of court records turned up no real-time warrants: Chesapeake Police Department, Hampton Police Department, King William County Sheriff’s Office, Portsmouth Police Department, Roanoke County Sheriff’s Department, Roanoke City Police Department, Stafford County Sheriff’s Department.</p>
<p><em>All figures are for invoices received in 2020 except in the case of Hanover, which provided figures for 2021.</em></p>
<p><em>The days of surveillance by Chesterfield County Police are partially estimated because the department was the only one to redact dates of surveillance on its invoices and one wireless carrier, Sprint, charges a flat monthly fee, making it impossible to calculate the number of days tracked based on invoice totals. However, the figure most likely represents an undercount because the department provided no receipts from Verizon despite filing warrants requesting tracking from the company.</em></p>
<p><em>Richmond Police Department was the only department that provided no response to a FOIA request for billing records and figures are based on a review of court records.</em></p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>Attorney General Jason Miyares is the first Republican to hold the office in nearly a decade. So his office says it’s natural to expect the state’s legal position to change after eight years under the control of Democrat Mark Herring.</p>
<p>Asked for a complete accounting of cases in which Miyares directed the state to change sides or withdraw, Miyares’s spokeswoman, Victoria LaCivita, listed five:</p>
<p>• <a href="https://apnews.com/article/voting-rights-lawsuits-virginia-constitutions-congress-7f4ac55ee95eb26ceaeea6d529649b32" target="_blank">Virginia v. Ferriero</a>: A case filed against National Archivist David Ferriero to compel him to recognize the ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment and include it in the U.S. Constitution. Miyares filed to withdraw from the lawsuit, which would leave Nevada and Illinois as plaintiffs.</p>
<p>• <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2021/20-1530" target="_blank">West Virginia v. EPA</a>: Herring had added his name to a brief last year opposing the case aimed at blocking environmental regulations. <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/new-va-ag-pulls-out-of-supreme-court-climate-case/" target="_blank">Miyares says</a> the state will “no longer be a participating party” because “Virginia is no longer anti-coal.”</p>
<p>• <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2021/19-1392" target="_blank">Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization</a>: In this case, Herring had joined 22 attorneys general to argue Mississippi’s 15-week abortion ban was unconstitutional.  In a statement, Miyares said, “Virginia is now of the belief that the Constitution is silent on the question of abortion.”</p>
<p>• <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2021/20-1088" target="_blank">Carson v. Makin</a>: Miyares also withdrew from a brief Herring had signed onto opposing a lawsuit in which families in Maine are seeking to force a local school district to provide tuition assistance for religious schools. “The Commonwealth believes that the First Amendment prohibits states from withholding tuition assistance from families solely on the ground that those families choose to send their children to religious schools,” LaCivita said.</p>
<p>• <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2021/20-843" target="_blank">New York State Rifle &amp; Pistol Association v. Bruen</a>: In this pending case, a New York couple is suing to overturn a state law that limits concealed carry handgun permits to people who can show a special need for protection. Miyares said he withdrew from a brief Herring had signed supporting limits to concealed carry permits because he believes the law “is in direct conflict with the Second Amendment.”</p>
<p>“It is expected for a new attorney general to assess the state’s legal positions and make their own decisions regarding the future of the legal challenges,” LaCivita said of the changes in an email. “These decisions must be made at the very beginning of the administration, out of respect to the court.”</p>
<p>Legal experts say the actions are entirely symbolic and will have no effect on the outcome of any of the lawsuits.</p>
<p>“I don’t think any judges are sitting there counting the number of attorneys general on one side or the other,” said Saikrishna Prakash, a professor at University of Virginia School of Law. “They’re looking at arguments and trying to come to a conclusion. The fact that Jason Miyares has changed the views of the attorney general’s office is not going to matter at all.”</p>

(Scott Elmquist/Style Weekly) </p><p>A House of Delegates subcommittee Monday voted down legislation that would have allowed recreational marijuana sales to begin this September.</p>
<p>The bill, <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/02/15/virginia-senate-votes-to-begin-marijuana-sales-in-september/" target="_blank">which had passed</a> the Democratic-controlled Senate last week, died on a party line vote, with Republicans opposing.</p>
<p>“I think this is a bigger issue than we can correct in two weeks’ time,” said Del. Jeff Campbell, R-Smyth.</p>
<p>Democrats on the panel urged their GOP colleagues to reconsider. “The longer we wait to have a regulated market, the harder it will be to compete with that illicit market,” said Del. Dawn Adams, D-Richmond.</p>
<p>The General Assembly voted last year to allow people to possess and grow marijuana, but lawmakers have so far been unable to agree on legalized recreational sales. Democrats had set an initial goal of opening sales in 2024, but decided over the summer that was too long to wait, citing concerns that people were openly flouting the state’s ban on sales.</p>

<p>Currently the only legal way to obtain marijuana in Virginia is to grow it, get it as a gift or buy it from a medical dispensary with a prescription.</p>
<p>The politics became more complex after Democrats lost their majority in the House of Delegates in the November elections, leaving Republicans who opposed legalization to broker a final deal.</p>
<p>Coming into the legislative session, Republicans said they would address the issue, framing it as a mess Democrats <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/11/11/some-in-newly-empowered-va-gop-open-to-speeding-retail-sales-of-marijuana/" target="_blank">had left them to clean up</a>.  But as the session progressed, it became clear the House GOP caucus was unable to reach an internal consensus on the issue.</p>
<p>The chamber never docketed GOP bills that would have advanced legalization alongside Republican priorities like dedicating new tax revenue to school construction.</p>
<p>With Monday’s vote, Republicans promised to revisit the issue next year, making sometime in mid to late 2023 the earliest retail sales could begin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Virginia Democrats made a great big mess when they legalized marijuana without putting any regulatory or retail structure in place,&#8221; said House Speaker Todd Gilbert, R-Shenandoah, in a tweet. &#8220;We are left having to clean up their mess and we will not make it worse by rushing to fix it.&#8221;</p>
<p>House Republicans did advance legislation proposed by Sen. Emmett Hanger, R-Augusta, which would <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+sum+SB591" target="_blank">regulate sales of delta-8 THC</a> products, which give users a similar high as traditional marijuana but whose producers argue is technically legal under state and federal law.</p>
<p>The products have sprung up in specialty shops, gas stations and health markets.</p>
<p>Hanger’s bill would unambiguously bar sales until the recreational marijuana market opens.</p>

(Photo by Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>Police agencies in Virginia are set to get big budget increases under spending plans advanced by the House and Senate — money law enforcement leaders say they badly need to raise salaries for frontline officers.</p>
<p>But who will benefit from the funding boosts depends on what kind of compromise lawmakers from the two chambers reach as they begin budget negotiations.</p>
<p>Senate Democrats proposed nearly $100 million more than the House for law enforcement salaries, according to <a href="https://thecommonwealthinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Key-Budget-Policy-Choices-2022-committees.pdf" target="_blank">an analysis</a> by The Commonwealth Institute, which analyzes the state budget. The biggest difference is Senate lawmakers included $47 million in new funding for local police departments &#8212; a line item the House GOP cut from former Gov. Ralph Northam’s initial budget proposal.</p>
<p>The fact that Democrats &#8212; who the GOP accused of seeking to defund police in campaign ads last year &#8212; are pushing for more police funding than Republicans is not lost on Senate leaders.</p>
<p>Sen. Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, who chairs the Senate’s subcommittee on public safety spending, said Republicans’ aren’t living up to their campaign rhetoric. “They’re saying one thing but doing another,” Lucas said. “They’re saying we need more police officers, but they don’t put the money in there to make it happen. That’s the disconnect, as far as I’m concerned.”</p>
<p>The increase is also at odds with the activist wing of the Democratic party, from which calls to “defund the police” initially emerged from the nationwide protest movement that emerged in the summer of 2020. In response, Democrats pursued an array of reform measures, but have pointedly avoided cutting budgets.</p>
<p>“If you look at my city, Portsmouth, where there’s a high crime rate and shootings on an almost daily basis, I realize we need to beef up our police departments to kind of get a handle on that gang violence,” Lucas said. “And we can’t do that if we’re cutting police departments.”</p>
<p>Republicans in the House say they’ll continue to negotiate, but said they did what they could for police while balancing a range of other priorities — namely tax cuts and rebates. “I think that might be something we can visit at some point, but this year we were focused in different areas,” said Del. Terry Austin, R-Botetourt.</p>
<p>The Senate also proposed $5 million more than the House for the Capitol Police and $43 million more to increase correctional and probation officer salaries.</p>
<p>In the Department of Corrections, the funding provided by the House would mean a $42,000 starting salary versus $44,000 proposed by the Senate. The department’s current starting salary is $35,000, a figure corrections officials have told lawmakers is insufficient to attract qualified candidates. <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/virginia-department-of-corrections-chief-paints-dire-picture-of-prison-staffing/" target="_blank">At last report</a>, the agency was short 1,500 officers.</p>
<p>The House and Senate ended up on the same page when it came to state police, sheriffs and local jail salaries, sticking with Northam’s initial budget proposal, which included $48.4 million for state police and $89.5 million for sheriffs.</p>
<p>State Police Superintendent Gary Settle had warned lawmakers that the agency has been struggling to attract qualified candidates with its roughly $48,000 starting salary. “This remains a critical need of the agency,” he told a Senate budget committee earlier in the session, citing 345 vacancies and a half-full class of trainees in the pipeline. “It is our utmost, highest priority.”</p>
<p>He also requested additional money from lawmakers so the agency could begin offering a pay bump to troopers with college degrees . He said about half of the agency’s sworn officers currently have an associates degree or higher, a number he said has been steadily dropping as the agency’s pay has stagnated. “We know that highly educated trooper trainees that come into the academy make better decisions. &#8230; less use of force<strong> —</strong> there’s research on this &#8212; we know that,” he said.</p>
<p>Neither chamber funded request, although lawmakers said they agreed it sounded like a good idea. “I think that is something that we need to continue to work on,” Lucas said.</p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>A House of Delegates subcommittee voted Thursday to scrap <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+sum+SB108" target="_blank">legislation</a> passed by the Senate to strictly limit how long state prisons can hold people in solitary confinement.</p>
<p>Instead, the panel agreed to amended language that directs prison officials to study the issue.</p>
<p>Supporters of the legislation, who have been pushing to rein in the state’s use of solitary confinement for years, argued the practice had been studied enough, but called the amendments the best compromise they could hope for in the Republican-controlled House.</p>
<p>“I don’t want a study, but the alternative was that this bill was going to be defeated,” said Del. Patrick Hope, D-Arlington, one of the chamber’s more outspoken advocates for prison reform. But he urged the Department of Corrections to take the study seriously.</p>
<p>“When the General Assembly asks for a work group to study a topic, we mean it,” he said. “We want DOC to know if they’re watching that we want you to take this study seriously.”</p>
<p>The Department of Corrections argued it no longer uses solitary confinement because procedures now call for all inmates to have at least four hours outside of their cells each day. Solitary confinement has traditionally been defined as being held in isolation for 22 hours a day.</p>
<p>Advocates and inmates, however, have argued the difference is semantic. Among other things, they note that out-of-cell recreation time is also isolated and typically consists of a prisoner being moved from their cell to a different caged area.</p>
<p>The Senate bill, proposed by Sen. Joe Morrissey, D-Richmond, would have barred prisons from holding someone in confinement for longer than 15 days in any 60-day period. It would also require medical and mental health evaluations and meaningful programming and interaction during out of cell time.</p>
<p>The Department of Corrections <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+oth+SB108F122+PDF" target="_blank">estimated</a> it would cost $4.8 million to meet the requirements set in the bill.</p>

Amanda Chase, R-Chesterfield. (Photo by Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fifteen months after the 2020 election, Sen. Amanda Chase, R-Chesterfield, is taking her still-unproven claims of election fraud to the office of new Attorney General Jason Miyares, a Republican with the power to pursue alleged violations of election law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/amanda.f.chase/posts/10224817654021505" target="_blank">Facebook post</a> Tuesday afternoon, Chase published photos of what she said was a meeting with the attorney general’s office to discuss “gross election irregularities.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an interview Wednesday night, Chase, who was <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/01/27/a-badge-of-shame-virginia-senate-votes-to-censure-amanda-chase/" target="_blank">censured by the state Senate</a> last year for repeating baseless election conspiracy theories and expressing support for rioters who stormed the U.S. Capitol in January 2021, called the meeting “very productive.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I would say it was very eye-opening to the people that were in the room,” Chase said. “I think they took it very seriously. They&#8217;re very interested.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The attorney general&#8217;s office did not give a direct answer when asked if any action would be taken in response to Chase’s information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Senator Chase requested a meeting with staff in the Office of the Attorney General, which oversees election law,” said Miyares spokeswoman Victoria LaCivita. &#8220;Our team met with her, as they would any sitting state senator who requests a meeting. The OAG does not comment on specifics of internal meetings.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A deputy attorney general hired under Miyares to oversee election issues resigned earlier this month after the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/02/10/facebook-jan-6-virginia-attorney-general-miles/" target="_blank">Washington Post reported</a> she had a history of social media posts praising the Capitol riot and claiming the election was stolen from former President Donald Trump.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to this week&#8217;s meeting, Senate Democrats noted Chase had failed to offer any evidence of fraud during a recent legislative hearing on her bill seeking an extensive audit of the 2020 election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Contrary to what is spewed on far-right cable news, there has never been evidence of significant voter fraud in the commonwealth or the United States,” Sen. Adam Ebbin, D-Alexandria, said in a news release. “Senator Chase refuses to accept that truth, and wastes our time and taxpayer dollars on unfounded, politically-motivated attempts to subvert the will of the electorate.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just before last year’s elections, former Attorney General Mark Herring, a Democrat, called on Chase to submit any purported fraud evidence to his office, saying Chase “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">has an obligation to bring it to the attention of authorities who can do something about it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The attorney general’s office was given new oversight over election issues through a Democratic-backed law creating state-level voting rights protections. That law, approved last year before Democrats’ electoral losses, empowers the attorney general to file civil suits whenever the office has “reasonable cause to believe that a violation of an election law has occurred and that the rights of any voter or group of voters have been affected by such violation.”</span></p>
<p>Though Republicans campaigned against looser voting laws passed under Democratic control, the 2021 election held under those laws produced a stunning GOP comeback, with the party sweeping contests for statewide office and regaining a majority in the House of Delegates. Republicans lawmakers have still <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/01/21/va-republicans-won-big-under-democratic-voting-rules-but-they-still-want-tougher-laws/" target="_blank">tried to roll back</a> new policies like early voting, ballot drop boxes and looser ID rules, but those efforts have failed in the Democratic-controlled Senate.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chase said she filed numerous amendments to the state budget Wednesday seeking to add more money for “election integrity,” including a proposed $70 million for a “full forensic audit” of the 2020 election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/03/31/audit-overwhelmingly-confirms-virginias-election-results/" target="_blank">risk-limiting audit</a> state election officials conducted a year ago overwhelmingly confirmed President Joe Biden’s 2020 10-point victory in Virginia, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">finding only a 0.00000065117 percent chance the state’s voting system could have produced an inaccurate outcome.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When asked to describe the information she presented to the attorney general’s office, Chase said she’s planning to hold a news conference soon with all the details. That event, she said, could involve “data engineers” who can better describe her claims.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s highly technical and I don&#8217;t want to get anything wrong,” she said.</span></p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>Last week, Republicans in the House of Delegates <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+sum+HB1040" target="_blank">passed a bill</a> to exempt any business with 10 or fewer employees from the state’s minimum wage law.</p>
<p>On Monday, Democrats in the Senate voted it down alongside a half dozen other bills aimed at rolling back employee and union-friendly legislation the party passed last year before it lost its House majority.</p>
<p>“So they would be exempt from the current minimum wage? …  Just out of curiosity, where in the state can you live on $14,000 a year?” asked Senate Majority Leader Dick Saslaw, D-Fairfax.</p>
<p>Virginia’s minimum wage currently sits at $11 an hour and will rise to $12 an hour next year <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/03/08/virginia-lawmakers-vote-to-raise-the-minimum-wage-to-12/" target="_blank">under legislation</a> Democrats passed in 2020.</p>
<p>The $14,000 figure cited by Saslaw represents about what someone would earn working full-time for the federally mandated minimum wage of $7.25-an-hour, which is what small businesses could start paying their employees again if the bill were to pass.</p>
<p>The measure’s sponsor, Del. Phillip Scott, R-Spotsylvania, argued the legislation would help children and disabled people get jobs at small businesses that otherwise wouldn’t be able to afford to hire them.</p>
<p>“This would not be aimed at a providing parent,” he said. “This would be geared more toward summer help.”</p>
<p>Scott also floated a scenario in which someone with Down&#8217;s syndrome might “just want to get a job sweeping floors at a local coffee shop” but could lose out on state benefits if they were paid at the state’s minimum wage.</p>
<p>But while Scott framed the legislation as narrow, Democrats on the Senate Committee on Commerce and Labor noted that it would exempt <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/susb/technical-documentation/record-layouts.html" target="_blank">nearly 80 percent of businesses</a> in the state from paying minimum wage. Sen. Adam Ebbin, D-Alexandria, encouraged Scott to consider redrafting his bill if he intended it only apply to summer workers, minors and disabled people.</p>
<p>Other GOP legislation the panel voted down Monday included bills that would:</p>
<ul>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>Attorney General Jason Miyares says his staff can’t keep up with a surge of criminal appeals being heard by the newly expanded Virginia Court of Appeals.</p>
<p>As of 2022, the court now provides by-right appeals in all cases and, in the case of criminal appeals, the attorney general’s office is responsible for representing the state.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Criminal-Appeals-Letter-Final.pdf" target="_blank">a letter to General Assembly leaders</a>, Miyares wrote that under the old system the AG’s office handled approximately 250 criminal cases per year. Under the new system, he said the criminal appeals team was assigned more than 300 cases in January alone.</p>
<p>“In order for our appellate attorneys to give every Virginian with an appellate case the due diligence and attention they deserve, additional funding is critically important,” Miyares wrote. “Without it, the office will run into a significant backlog of criminal appeals in the Commonwealth of Virginia.”</p>

<p>Miyares, who has faced derision from Democrats for his decision to <a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-and-regional/partisan-debate-erupts-in-va-senate-over-miyares-firing-of-30-in-ags-office/article_49f4ffd3-3653-5340-95c4-aa3c76c862b4.html" target="_blank">cull staff</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/01/23/heaphy-uva-miyares-removal/" target="_blank">fire university counsel</a>, called the issue bi-partisan. He noted that his predecessor, Democrat Mark Herring, had made a similar request, which was only partially granted, with lawmakers agreeing to add funding for 19 new positions last year, which would roughly double the staff.</p>
<p>But Miyares says the office needs at least 75 people to keep up with the news caseload</p>
<p>Democratic leaders in the Senate did not sound particularly sympathetic to Miyares this week.</p>
<p>Sen. John Edwards, D-Roanoke, who spearheaded the effort to expand the court, said this week he was unaware of the issue.</p>
<p>Sen. Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, who also worked on the issue, suggested Miyares find the positions internally, noting that had already fired attorneys tasked with <a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-and-regional/miyares-fires-30-in-ags-office-including-lawyer-investigating-dangerous-conditions-at-richmond-apartments/article_280125a7-9dda-58db-a0e0-667758fafd0f.html" target="_blank">investigating human rights abuses</a> and announced plans to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/01/19/miyares-attorney-general-virginia-agenda/" target="_blank">reconfigure a unit</a> that investigates wrongful convictions.</p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>The Virginia Senate voted unanimously this week to make the creation, distribution and possession of pornography involving animals illegal.</p>
<p><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+sum+SB249" target="_blank">The legislation</a> also tightens existing laws against having sex with animals, which had been covered under the state’s crimes against nature statute but which lawmakers said were vague and could be difficult to enforce.</p>
<p>“I can tell you this animal porn is out there and, under our current statute, there’s nothing wrong with that,” said Sen. Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, who sponsored the measure. “Someone who doesn’t do the touching, but makes their pet, their livestock, a part of this &#8212; they suffer zero consequence. It’s only someone who actually does the act.”</p>
<p>Surovell said he filed the legislation at the behest of the Humane Society of the United States, which testified in favor of the bill. Molly Armus, who directs the organization&#8217;s Virginia operations, said at least 13 states had adopted similar laws since 2017 and that similar legislation is currently pending in the District of Columbia.</p>
<p>It was also backed by detectives who investigate child pornography and abuse cases, who said they see frequent overlap between the two.</p>
<p>“When I became an investigator, one of the things I knew I was going to see was child pornography, but the amount of animal crimes and animal sex abuse pictures that I see is astronomical,” said Elizabeth Wright, a detective with the Southern Virginia Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force.</p>
<p>Violations would be punishable as a class 6 felony. A conviction would not require someone to register as a sex offender, but the legislation would allow a judge to issue a lifetime ban on owning or keeping animals.</p>
<p>The legislation includes language specifying it does not apply to “accepted animal husbandry practice, including grooming, raising, breeding, or assisting with the birthing process of animals.”</p>
<p>The bill, which passed the Senate unanimously, now heads to the House of Delegates.</p>

<p>Prison officials complained in their release that the article implied the department “is determined to reject all forms of external oversight or authority.” They also took issue with the fact that it included a recounting of some of the numerous lawsuits the department has settled, calling the issues unrelated.</p>
<p>“That VADOC voluntarily elected to settle a case, conserving taxpayer dollars in the process, should not be construed as an admission of wrongdoing or a sign that VADOC needs additional ‘oversight,’” the release said.</p>
<p>The lawmaker who proposed the oversight legislation, Del. Patrick Hope, D-Arlington, has said in past years that one of the goals of creating a prison ombudsman is to reduce the number of lawsuits faced by the department.</p>
<p>Last year, he accused the department of attempting to subtly tank the proposal by attaching an $11 million price tag to it when he said a similar program had been started in Washington State for less than $2 million.</p>
<p>Hope tweeted a link to the press release Wednesday afternoon alongside the word chutzpah and its dictionary definition.<br />

(Scott Elmquist/Style Weekly)</p><p>The Virginia Senate voted to speed up the timeline for retail marijuana sales Tuesday, approving a plan that would allow existing medical dispensaries to open sales to the general public in September.</p>
<p>And, in what senators framed as a bid to give Virginia farmers a piece of what is expected to be a lucrative recreational market, the legislation also opens early sales to a handful of large industrial hemp processors.</p>
<p>“This ensures consumers can purchase safe, regulated products legally,” said Sen. Adam Ebbin, D-Alexandria, the bill’s patron.</p>
<p>The proposed timeline represents a 16-month head start for the businesses over the <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/04/07/marijuana-will-be-legal-in-virginia-on-july-1-heres-what-is-and-isnt-permitted-under-the-new-law/" target="_blank">2024 start date</a> still contemplated for the broader industry. But while <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+ful+SB391S3" target="_blank">the legislation</a> cleared the Senate on a bipartisan, 23-16 vote, its final passage remains far from assured at the halfway point in Virginia’s legislative session.</p>
<p>It and other marijuana bills still have to make it through the House of Delegates, where the GOP majority remains divided on how to proceed and was unwilling to even docket marijuana bills filed by its own members.</p>
<p>The legislation also faces criticism from legalization advocates who accuse Democratic lawmakers of abandoning racial justice commitments made last year, which the party made <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/11/16/northam-we-are-going-to-move-forward-with-legalizing-marijuana-in-virginia/" target="_blank">central to its legalization push</a>.</p>
<p>At the urging of former Gov. Ralph Northam’s administration, lawmakers had initially planned to delay all sales until 2024 to give the state ample of time to regulate the new industry and develop a social-equity program aimed at making sure Black Virginians, who were more than twice as likely to face prosecution for marijuana possession under prohibition, could compete in the market.</p>
<p>But lawmakers, who formed a work group to study the issue over the summer, concluded that the decision to legalize possession but not sales had so emboldened the black market that lawmakers needed to provide legal avenues to obtain the drug. And they argue the fees the state plans to charge companies that enter the market early &#8212; $6 million each for pharmaceutical processors and $500,000 for hemp processors &#8212; would provide necessary funding for a loan program to seed new social-equity operators.</p>
<p>The legislation also requires early licensees to serve as incubators for at least five qualified social-equity licensees.</p>
<p>Advocates for the social-equity programs say they’re unconvinced, arguing similar programs have been unsuccessful in other states that gave medical marijuana businesses early access to the retail market. They also doubt that allowing limited early sales will deter the illegal market.</p>
<p>“We cannot allow our communities most impacted by the war on drugs to take a backseat to the financial interests of medical operators and hemp processors,” said Chelsea Higgs Wise, who leads the organization Marijuana Justice, which has joined dozens of other social justice groups to urge lawmakers to delay sales.</p>
<p>As the legislation made its way to the floor of the Senate, lawmakers have mostly focused on whether to grant industrial hemp processors early access to the industry alongside medical processors.</p>
<p>The hemp industry and its supporters argued that three out-of-state companies currently control the four medical licenses whereas industrial hemp processors are more likely to be based in Virginia.</p>
<p>Hemp, a non-intoxicating variety of cannabis, became legal to farm and process in 2018 and large hemp processors told lawmakers they have the expertise to transition quickly to intoxicating varieties of the plant.</p>
<p>Sen. Joe Morrissey, D-Richmond, framed them as local farmers who “get their fingers into the dirt.”</p>
<p>It is unclear who precisely would qualify for the 10 licenses set aside for hemp processors. The legislation limits eligibility for early licensure to industrial hemp processors registered with the state before March of last year who have processed at least 40,000 pounds of the plant. The Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, which licenses the companies, said the information is considered proprietary and is exempt from disclosure under state open record laws.</p>
<p>The legislation now heads to the House of Delegates, where the GOP majority has given mixed signals on marijuana legislation. Heading into the legislative session, House Speaker Todd Gilbert, R-Shenandoah, said the caucus viewed the unfinished marijuana legalization as a mess left by Democrats <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/11/11/some-in-newly-empowered-va-gop-open-to-speeding-retail-sales-of-marijuana/" target="_blank">that the GOP would clean up</a>.</p>
<p>But after <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/01/24/house-republicans-begin-retail-marijuana-debate-with-focus-on-lower-taxes-and-school-funding/" target="_blank">GOP lawmakers offered their own proposals</a> for legalization and speeding up sales, the party’s leaders refused to docket them for hearings.</p>
<p>Since then, members of the party have displayed an unusual reluctance to discuss the issue, suggesting it remains a touchy subject within the caucus. Gilbert’s spokesman, Garren Shipley, who early in the session had <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/01/24/house-republicans-begin-retail-marijuana-debate-with-focus-on-lower-taxes-and-school-funding/" target="_blank">assured reporters</a> the House would act on the issue, declined to comment Tuesday when asked why the bills had not been docketed.</p>
<p>Del. Michael Webert, R-Fauquier, who filed a bill advancing legalization that called for lower taxes and a focus on school funding, said members of his caucus are still discussing the issue.</p>
<p>“You’ve got folks who would like to see early sales, folks who would like to see sales postponed so we can make sure we have a solid regulatory process and folks who just don’t want it in the first place,” Webert said.</p>

(Ned Oliver/ Virginia Mercury)</p><p>Two years after the COVID-19 pandemic swamped Virginia’s unemployment insurance program, lawmakers are advancing reforms they hope will address breakdowns that left thousands waiting months for essential aid.</p>
<p>“We saw unprecedented frustration and failure,” said Sen. Jeremy McPike, D-Prince William, as he presented <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+sum+SB219" target="_blank">the legislation</a> late last month. “I know this is something no one wants to repeat.”</p>
<p>The bills, which have now passed both the House and Senate, act on recommendations made last year by legislative auditors, who issued a <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/11/08/scathing-audit-faults-poor-management-for-virginias-unemployment-insurance-failures/" target="_blank">scathing report</a> that faulted management failures and poor oversight by former Gov. Ralph Northam’s administration.</p>
<p>Among other things, auditors found management and administration officials took no serious steps to increase staffing until more than a year into the pandemic. And the report says Northam’s administration blocked some early steps explored by the agency.</p>
<p>To avoid a repeat, lawmakers now plan to create a board to keep closer tabs on how the agency is handling unemployment claims and tack backlogs. Current General Assembly oversight has focused almost entirely on issues affecting businesses, namely the health of the trust fund used to pay benefits and the payroll taxes necessary to fund it.</p>
<p>The legislation also directs the commission to develop a resiliency plan detailing how to quickly increase staffing the next time claims surge.</p>
<p>And it requires officials to further reduce reliance on paper records and correspondence by requiring employers to provide information about claims electronically. A common complaint among employers has been that they’ve received letters asking them to verify claims after the deadline to reply.</p>
<p>Finally, it creates an ombudsman to help people making their way through the employment process.</p>
<p>McPike said he planned to pursue additional reforms through the budget process. The legislation is being <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+sum+HB270" target="_blank">carried in the House</a> by Del. Kathy Byron, R-Bedford.</p>
<p>The reforms represent the first significant movement toward addressing problems with the agency despite more than a year of complaints by people seeking help, <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/10/30/virginia-ranks-worst-in-nation-for-quickly-reviewing-unemployment-claims/" target="_blank">a last-place federal ranking</a> for resolving problems with claims and a <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/judge-declines-to-dismiss-lawsuit-over-slow-processing-of-unemployment-benefits-citing-ongoing-complaints/" target="_blank">class-action lawsuit</a> that led a federal judge to briefly intervene in the state’s handling of claims.</p>
<p>Advocates applauded the steps even as they said more work remains. Pat Levy-Lavelle, an attorney at the Legal Aid Justice Center who works with clients seeking benefits, said he continues to hear from people struggling to access benefits.</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s encouraging that legislators in both parties recognize that there’s a lot of work to do in making the Virginia Employment Commission an agency that’s better able to respond to downturns and deliver essential benefits to Virginia families,” he said.</p>

(Photo by Graham Moomaw)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Democrats&#8217; refusal to confirm Andrew Wheeler, a controversial environmental appointee of Gov. Glenn Youngkin, spiraled into a bigger standoff Friday in Virginia’s divided legislature.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of early afternoon, more than 1,000 of former Gov. Ralph Northam’s outstanding appointments to state boards and executive agencies were in limbo after the Republican-led House of Delegates refused to take up a resolution confirming them. By Friday evening, Republicans had narrowed the list of Democratic appointees they wanted to block, voting down 11 state board members picked by Northam. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The appointees blocked by Republicans served on the State Air Pollution Control Board, the State Water Control Board, the Virginia Marine Resources Commission, the Safety and Health Codes Board and the Board of Education. Most had just been appointed to four-year terms last fall. Youngkin can now make his own picks for those roles, but they will still be subject to General Assembly confirmation in the 2023 session.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The House GOP&#8217;s targeting of Northam&#8217;s picks for environmental boards was a response to the Democratic-led state Senate’s <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/02/08/senate-democrats-block-wheeler-appointment/" target="_blank">vote this week</a> to block Wheeler from taking office as Virginia’s next secretary of natural and historic resources. Democrats have pointed to Wheeler’s record as </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the former head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under President Donald Trump to argue he’s unfit to serve in Virginia’s top environmental post. But Republicans appear adamant about using hardball tactics to push him through.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They want to be the brick wall, let &#8217;em be a brick wall,” House Majority Leader Terry Kilgore, R-Scott, said of Senate Democrats shortly after the conflict broke out Friday. “But they don&#8217;t run the place.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier in the day, Sen. Adam Ebbin, D-Alexandria, who oversees appointment resolutions as chairman of the Senate Privileges and Elections Committee, called the escalation frustrating and out of step with General Assembly protocol.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He and other Democrats in the Senate said that if Republicans follow through, the Senate will block all future appointments put forward by Youngkin as long as it remains under Democratic control. It wasn&#8217;t immediately clear Friday night how Democrats would respond to the more targeted effort to block Northam appointees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ebbin accused Youngkin of throwing a temper tantrum. “He needs to learn that government is about compromise, and it’s not for the thin skinned and the petty,” he said. “This is not like he’s at a private equity firm where (he) can tell everybody what to do.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Speaker Todd Gilbert, R-Shenandoah, declined to discuss the matter in detail but said he was hoping for a “controlled stand-down.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;ve always had conflicts like this arise between the institutions,&#8221; Gilbert said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</span></p>
<p>In a statement Friday night, House Minority Leader Eileen Filler-Corn, D-Fairfax, accused Youngkin of setting a &#8220;dangerous new precedent.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He is slashing qualified public servants with no hearing and no discussion,&#8221; Filler-Corn said. &#8220;This is reckless, plain and simple, and Virginians are the ones losing.&#8221;</p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>Virginia lawmakers appear poised to repeal a blanket ban on local police use of facial recognition technology, which was among the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/technology-legislature-police-law-enforcement-agencies-legislation-033d77787d4e28559f08e5e31a5cb8f7" target="_blank">most stringent restrictions in the country</a> when it passed last year.</p>
<p>The law, which only went into effect on July 1, passed with wide bi-partisan support. But now some lawmakers say they only viewed it as a temporary step.</p>
<p>“From my perspective that was a timeout so we could evaluate that practice and try to get it into a good format, and I believe this bill does exactly that,” said Del. Jay Leftwich, R-Chesapeake, who argued the technology can be an important crime fighting tool with appropriate safeguards.</p>
<p>The legislation would allow police to tap into databases when they have “reasonable suspicion” their target committed a crime or is planning to commit a crime. The legislation would also allow police to use the technology to help identify crime victims or witnesses and dead people, among other circumstances.</p>
<p>While the restrictions would allow the technology in pretty much any investigation, the restrictions would have the effect of barring dragnet-type searches, in which officers indiscriminately query people &#8212; a point Sen. Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, emphasized when he presented similar legislation in the Senate.</p>
<p>“What the bill does not do is allow broad surveillance or monitoring,” he said. “You have to have a specific case you’re working on or someone in a hospital bed you’re trying to identify.”</p>
<p>Both <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+sum+HB1339" target="_blank">House</a> and <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+sum+SB741" target="_blank">Senate</a> versions of the legislation also explicitly bar police from using any facial recognition matches as probable cause to obtain a search or arrest warrant. The legislation requires any software used by police be certified 98 percent accurate by the U.S. Department of Commerce’s National Institute of Standards and Technology, which supporters of the technology say should address criticisms that the technology is less accurate when used to identify people with darker skin pigmentation.</p>
<p>Lawmakers passed the existing ban on the technology last year following reporting by The Virginian-Pilot that found police officers had begun using the technology with little oversight and <a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/government/local/vp-nw-clearview-facial-recognition-norfolk-police-20200909-pcuvhkos5rhmzbhkzthsnlex4m-story.html" target="_blank">no public disclosure</a>.</p>
<p>The newspaper reported that one of the primary purveyors of the technology, Clearview AI, was emailing officers directly offering them free trials. The company relies on images harvested from social media and other public sources.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.vpap.org/lobbying/client/386680-clearview-ai/" target="_blank">company retained six lobbyists</a> in Virginia this session with the goal of “making it legal for law-enforcement agencies and other public safety entities to use” the technology, according to public records compiled by the Virginia Public Access Project.</p>
<p>Just as the ban on police use of the technology passed with widespread support last year, so far the move to repeal it has been similarly popular. No one testified against the legislation in either the House or Senate and it has advanced through the committee process on bi-partisan votes.</p>
<p>The measure has not yet gone before the full House or Senate for a vote.</p>

Nick Freitas, R-Culpeper, speaks on the floor of the House of Delegates in 2020. (Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>Republican leaders in the Virginia House of Delegates say they don’t plan to consider <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+sum+HB1274" target="_blank">legislation</a> filed by a member of their party to ban most abortions after 20 weeks.</p>
<p>House Courts of Justice Chairman Rob Bell, R-Albemarle, said he decided not to give the bill a hearing because he believed it stood no chance of passing in the Senate.</p>
<p>“We don’t currently see a path for that bill to pass both bodies and reach the governor,” Bell said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The decision also protects vulnerable members of the House GOP caucus, many of whom avoided the topic of abortion on the campaign trail, from going on record on the issue.</p>
<p>Currently elective abortions are permitted up to the 25th week of pregnancy, though the vast majority take place in the first trimester. The bill’s patron, Del. Nick Freitas, R-Culpeper, declined to comment.</p>
<p>Pro-life groups said they were not disappointed by the decision, even if they had hoped to see the bill advance.</p>
<p>“One has to be realistic. The Senate is an obstacle course for any legitimate, substantial pro-life legislation,” said Olivia Gans Turner, president of the Virginia Society for Human Life. “We have another year to wait before some changes occur in the Senate. And one hopes we will see a more pro-life Senate.”</p>
<p>While Democrats do hold a one-seat majority in the Senate, one pro-life Democrat in the chamber, Sen. Joe Morrissey, D-Richmond, <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/02/07/could-a-20-week-abortion-ban-pass-the-general-assembly/" target="_blank">had said he would support the 20-week ban</a> and potentially go so far as to help Republicans with the procedural maneuvers necessary to get it to the floor.</p>
<p>Republicans, however, did not appear to take the offer very seriously and Bell declined to discuss Morrissey’s overtures.</p>
<p>“I’m not going to go into all that thinking,” Bell said.</p>
<p>Jamie Lockhart, who directs Planned Parenthood’s political advocacy operations in Virginia, said the decision not to pursue the bill reflects how unpopular the measure would be.</p>
<p>“House Republicans have avoided debate on this abortion ban because they know Virginians overwhelmingly support safe, legal abortion,” she said.</p>
<p>Two other abortion related bills are advancing through the House’s committee system. One would <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+sum+HB304" target="_blank">create felony penalties</a> for doctors who don’t take certain steps in rare cases in which abortions result in live births. A second would have <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+sum+HB212'" target="_blank">reinstituted a 24-hour waiting period</a> for abortions as initially drafted, but was amended and in its current form only requires providers obtain &#8220;informed written consent&#8221; prior to any abortion.</p>
<p>In the Senate, a bill prohibiting abortions after 20 weeks is <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+sum+SB710" target="_blank">still pending</a> but lawmakers on the committee assigned to hear it say it has no chance of advancing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>This story has been updated to reflect amendments to legislation that initially would have reinstated a 24-hour waiting period for abortions.</em></p>

(Parker Michels-Boyce/ For The Virginia Mercury)</p><p>The Supreme Court of Virginia denied a petition Monday filed by parents in Chesapeake seeking to overturn Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s executive order ending mask mandates in public schools.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.oag.state.va.us/files/MIYARES2022/ORD02-07-2022Castillo,M.pdf" target="_blank">ruling</a> fell on procedural grounds, with the justices writing in a footnote that, “by this dismissal, we offer no opinion on the legality of EO 2 or any other issue pertaining to petitioners’ claims.”</p>
<p>Likewise, legal experts said the decision offered no obvious clues as to how the court might rule should one of several other pending lawsuits addressing Youngkin’s executive order make its way to the court.</p>
<p>“This is an extremely technical ruling,” said Carl Tobias, a professor at University of Richmond School of Law. “This is not a merits ruling.”</p>
<p>Instead, the justices wrote that their decision came down to the legal relief the group of parents sought, which is called a writ of mandamus — a mechanism in which a court directs a lower court or public official to perform a statutory duty.</p>
<p>The justices wrote that they could only issue such a writ in situations where a public official’s role is purely ministerial. And in the case of mask mandates in school, they wrote that a state law passed last year requiring school districts to adhere to CDC guidelines “to the maximum extent practicable” leaves school leaders with at least some discretion regarding how to act.</p>
<p>The line of reasoning would seem to poke holes in former Gov. Ralph Northam’s assertion that the law required mask mandates stay in place as long as they are recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It also appears to cut against Youngkin’s assertion that he has the authority to overrule local mandates via executive order.</p>
<p>Steve Emmert, an appellate lawyer in Virginia <a href="https://virginia-appeals.com/" target="_blank">who writes</a> about legal issues in the state, said it would be unwise to read too much into either line of reasoning given the broader context of the order.</p>
<p>The only hint he said he reads in the order about the court’s thinking on the issue has to do with process: that the court would be more likely to issue a ruling on the merits of the case in a lawsuit seeking injunctive relief, such as the lawsuit filed by seven school districts that have chosen to keep their mask mandates in place.</p>
<p>A lower court judge in Arlington <a href="https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-health-education-richmond-lawsuits-0cfd73b7b905006f9d8f6d49a4f1de86?eType=EmailBlastContent&amp;eId=44444444-4444-4444-4444-444444444444" target="_blank">ruled Friday</a> that the districts may keep their mask mandates in place while the case advances. Attorney General Jason Miyares said he will appeal the ruling.</p>
<p>Emmert said that under judicial reforms passed last year, it would next go to the Virginia Court of Appeals. He said it could be as long as a month and a half until the appeal is heard.</p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>Last week Virginia lawmakers began hearing legislation that would impose a range of new abortion restriction in Virginia.</p>
<p>The bills would ban most abortions after 20 weeks, reimpose a 24-hour waiting period, and &#8212; in response to an <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/02/01/does-the-va-gop-really-believe-the-governor-supports-infanticide-you-saw-the-tape/" target="_blank">infamous radio interview</a> given by former Gov. Ralph Northam &#8212; create felony penalties for doctors who don’t take certain steps in rare cases in which abortions result in live births.</p>
<p>Democrats in the Virginia Senate, where the party still holds a 21-19 advantage, have promised to be a “brick wall” against such proposals from Republicans in the House of Delegates and Executive Mansion.</p>
<p>But in the case of abortion legislation, that wall would appear to have a Joe Morrissey-sized hole in it.</p>
<p>The Democratic senator from Richmond, who has long described himself as pro-life, not only says he would support a 20-week abortion ban, but that he is considering working with Republicans in the chamber to side-step the committee process that would otherwise let Democrats block the legislation from ever arriving on the floor of the chamber for an up or down vote.</p>
<p>“I’m telling you how my heart has felt since I was 13,” Morrissey said last week. “It doesn’t take rocket science to figure out where I’m going with this.”</p>
<p>While Morrissey said there was no question he would support legislation that would narrow the window for most abortions from 25 weeks to 20 were it to come for a vote before the full Senate, he made clear he has not decided whether he’d help the GOP with procedural maneuvers necessary to get it there.</p>
<p>Morrissey does not sit on the Education and Health committee that hears abortion legislation, which is stacked with Democrats and almost certain to vote down any new restrictions, blocking them from progressing to a full vote before the chamber.</p>
<figure id="attachment_14228" class="wp-caption alignright" style="max-width:100%;width:300px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2020-general-assembly-week-one-9.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-14228" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2020-general-assembly-week-one-9-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2020-general-assembly-week-one-9-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2020-general-assembly-week-one-9-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2020-general-assembly-week-one-9-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2020-general-assembly-week-one-9-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2020-general-assembly-week-one-9-696x464.jpg 696w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2020-general-assembly-week-one-9-1068x712.jpg 1068w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2020-general-assembly-week-one-9-630x420.jpg 630w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2020-general-assembly-week-one-9.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Sen.

<p>But there are alternative avenues to a floor vote. Provisions could be proposed as budget amendments if a link can be made to the state’s finances. They could also be inserted into other legislation as a floor amendment in limited circumstances. Or a simple majority of lawmakers could vote to skip the committee process, called a motion to discharge.</p>
<p>The latter is a rare step and is typically unsuccessful, because even when lawmakers agree with legislation blocked by their party, caucuses typically hold together on procedural votes.</p>
<p>It’s also not clear that Republicans would be on board.</p>
<p>While Morrissey is flirting with the idea of siding with the GOP, Republican leaders in the Senate said they would be unlikely to support sidestepping the committee process even if it meant they could advance legislation they support.</p>
<p>“Institutionally, I’m against discharging committees,” said Senate Minority Leader Tommy Norment, R-James City. “It’s highly unusual and I could not be persuaded to do it. That does not mean others wouldn’t.”</p>
<p>It also remains to be seen how Republicans in the House will handle the 20-week bill. After they won back control of the House of Delegates and Executive Mansion in November, then-Del. Todd Gilbert, R-Shenandoah, who has since been elected speaker of the house, dismissed questions from news reporters about whether the GOP would pursue changes to the state’s abortion laws.</p>
<p>“You didn’t hear our caucus running on those things,” <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/11/04/gop-agenda-takes-shape-in-richmond/" target="_blank">he said at the time</a>. “We’re going to stay focused on the things we believe the majority of Virginians want us to focus on.”</p>
<p>That has not stopped GOP lawmakers in the chamber from filing at least three bills on the issue. Two were heard and advanced by sub committees Friday: the legislation reinstating a 24-hour waiting period and creating criminal penalties for doctors in certain cases.</p>
<p>Supporters argued the 24-hour waiting period would ensure women were informed of potential risks to abortion and alternatives to the procedure. It does not go as far as the legislation repealed by Democrats in 2021, which mandated an ultrasound. The legislation also allows the information to be provided over the phone rather than in person, meaning it would not necessarily require two trips to a clinic, a barrier that in the past has drawn legal challenges.</p>
<p>Opponents called the legislation unnecessary because providers are already having in-depth conversations about the procedure and its alternatives. “This just causes patient confusion and it really interferes with the relationship that I’m building with these women and their families,” said Anne Logan Bass, a nurse practitioner at Planned Parenthood. “I can assure you informed consent is happening. … This is occurring.”</p>
<p>The House has also advanced legislation proposed by Del. Nick Freitas, R-Culpeper, that would allow authorities to <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+sum+HB304" target="_blank">pursue felony charges</a> against abortion providers who fail “to provide care and treatment to an infant born alive.” Freitas said his legislation was inspired by remarks Northam, a pediatric neurologist, made in 2019 about how providers would respond to the birth of a child with severe fetal abnormalities, which Republicans widely condemned as an endorsement of infanticide. Health care professionals who testified Friday called the legislation unnecessary and warned it would mandate behavior that didn’t meet professional standards of care in some cases.</p>

<p>So far the 20-week abortion ban, titled the “<a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+sum+SB710" target="_blank">Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act</a>,” has not been docketed in the House and a spokesman for Gilbert said he did not know whether it would be given a hearing.</p>
<p>A companion bill will be heard in the Senate this week after emerging from a subcommittee on a 4-4 vote split along party line.</p>
<p>Currently, elective abortions are allowed up to 25 weeks. After that, abortions are only allowed if three doctors certify that the continuation of the pregnancy would result in death or significant harm to the mother. (<a href="https://richmond.com/updated-virginia-has-become-the-epicenter-of-the-third-trimester-abortion-debate-there-have-been/article_c3c93e87-5db3-53a7-a1a5-7bddc0bfbeb7.html" target="_blank">Most</a> abortions take place in the first 13 weeks of pregnancy.)</p>
<p>Under the proposed legislation, abortion would only be permitted after 20 weeks in cases that “the mother has a condition that so complicates her medical condition as to necessitate the abortion to avert her death or to avert serious risk of substantial and irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily function.”</p>

A.C. Cordoza, R-Hampton. (Photo by Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>The only Black Republican in the House of Delegates voiced frustration Thursday that he was denied membership in the Virginia Legislative Black Caucus.</p>
<p>First-term Del. A.C. Cordoza, R-Hampton, said the decision came after he told the caucus he disagreed with most of its platform, which skews largely Democratic and progressive. The caucus was recently a leading voice in recent police reform initiatives, many of which GOP lawmakers are trying to roll back.</p>
<p>“I don’t know what to do,” Cordoza said in a floor speech. “I’m a legislator, I’m Black, and I want to help the Black community. Maybe I need to start my own caucus, the Virginia Non-Leftist Black Caucus.”</p>
<p>The speech drew vigorous applause from the otherwise all-White GOP caucus, which last included a Black member in 2004, when now-Lt. Gov. Winsome Sears served in the chamber.</p>
<p>Cordoza ticked off a list of Black Caucus policy goals he disagreed with, including ending qualified immunity for police, making unionization easier, taking steps to mitigate COVID-19 impacts, preserving abortion rights and transitioning to clean energy and clean car standards.</p>
<p>But he said he was particularly offended by the caucus’ support of gun safety measures. He quoted Ida B. Wells, famous for her investigations into lynching in the South, who <a href="https://awpc.cattcenter.iastate.edu/2020/09/21/southern-horrors-lynch-law-in-all-its-phases-oct-5-1892/" target="_blank">once wrote</a> that “a Winchester rifle should have a place of honor in every Black home, and it should be used for that protection which the law refuses to give.”</p>
<p>The speech drew frustration from members of the Black Caucus, including Del. Luke Torian, D-Prince William, who rose to suggest Cordoza was not telling the whole truth.</p>
<p>“On this day, as you celebrate someone and lift someone up, you have not received all the facts,” Torian said. “So receive all the facts first.”</p>
<p>The caucus’ chairman, Del. Lamont Bagby, D-Henrico, declined to elaborate and Torian was not immediately reachable for comment. But Bagby did confirm that Cordoza has sought to join and was denied by a vote of its current members.</p>
<p>He said he had hoped to welcome Cordoza into the group of lawmakers, but ultimately was left questioning the new lawmaker&#8217;s sincerity in seeking to join.</p>
<p>“If he doesn’t agree with us and he doesn’t believe in our agenda, then what reason does he even have to desire to be a part of the caucus?” Bagby said.</p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Lucky Charms cereal bars for sale at Sen. Louise Lucas’ cannabis shop in Portsmouth feature a stoned cartoon leprechaun and a warning that it “contains cannabis, a Schedule 1 controlled substance.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The label, it turns out, is only partially accurate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lab testing shows the marshmallow treat does contain delta-9 THC — the main intoxicating ingredient in pot — which remains illegal to sell in Virginia even after lawmakers legalized marijuana possession last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the packaging overstated the bar&#8217;s potency, suggesting it contained 600 milligrams of total THC while the lab test showed just under 30 milligrams.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both issues — the mislabeled product and the presence of a controlled substance — are typical of the black and gray market for retail marijuana that has exploded in Virginia since lawmakers legalized possession of the drug but not sales.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The resulting demand for marijuana products has presented an opportunity for entrepreneurs willing to take a risk, but left customers with little assurances as to the quality and contents of the mostly-synthetic THC products that have been popping up in gas stations, health food stores and dedicated retail outlets like the one co-owned by Lucas, who as president pro tempore of the </span>Virginia Senate is the most powerful elected Democrat in state government.</p>

Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, presides over the Virginia Senate as president pro tempore of the chamber. (Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What concerns me is that people don’t know what they’re taking,” said Michelle Peace, a forensic science professor at VCU who has drawn nationwide recognition for her research in the field. “The products are not quality tested but consumers are trusting they are made in a sanitary environment and that the label is accurate.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marijuana sold by Virginia’s four licensed medical marijuana dispensaries, which are only open to people with prescriptions, is subject to stringent testing requirements. But there are no such standards in place for retailers like Lucas, who in a brief interview at the Capitol this week expressed surprise that her shop was selling products advertised as containing a controlled substance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I sell hemp products and CBD,” said Lucas, who co-sponsored the marijuana legalization bill last year and <a href="https://twitter.com/SenLouiseLucas/status/1485820503227080708?s=20&amp;t=6vGb78Ai73Xp-0Km3TWJ_g" target="_blank">has touted her cannabis shop</a> in an effort to boost her Twitter account. At her request, the Mercury emailed her questions but she did not respond.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Rampant mislabeling</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The products for sale in Lucas’ shop, the Cannabis Outlet, are in line with the broader market, according to Peace, who analyzed two samples from the senator’s store on behalf of the Mercury and recently conducted a separate</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">review of 66 products purchased in other stores around the state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nearly all of the products Peace’s lab tested as part of the wider review were marketed as containing delta-8 THC, a compound that is nearly identical to delta-9 THC, but which is synthetically manufactured from industrial hemp. Producers argue delta-8 is technically legal despite the fact that it offers an intoxicating high similar to traditional marijuana.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lab tests showed that all but one of the 66 products were inaccurately labeled:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">25 contained illegal amounts of delta-9 THC, which is capped at .3 percent under federal and state laws governing hemp extracts;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">22 claimed to contain THC but contained almost no cannabinoids — legal or not;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">19 had less total THC than advertised and four had more than the label suggested;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One was a delta-9 THC product apparently manufactured in a state where sales are legal with a delta-8 sticker placed on the packaging.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The products were collected by Virginians for Safe Cannabis from businesses around Northern Virginia, the Richmond region, Hampton Roads and Roanoke. The advocacy group includes medical producers, consumer advocates like Virginia NORML and other industry stakeholders. Peace, who presented the research to the General Assembly on Tuesday, said it represents one of the broadest surveys of unregulated THC products to date.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She told lawmakers that the inaccurate labeling and inconsistency among products make it almost impossible for consumers to safely dose the drugs. Some samples also presented potential health and sanitary concerns.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Peace said many of the edible products from the survey were commercial baked goods sprayed with a cannabis extract, sometimes still containing detectable levels of the industrial solvents used in the manufacturing process. In the case of a package of doctored Chips Ahoy cookies, cannabis contents varied widely between products and a human hair was found stuck to the sticky coating, she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And Peace said she was particularly alarmed by a package of “smokable hemp” cigarettes that contained shredded paper coated with an intoxicating cannabis extract.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘We can’t police every gas station’</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if the products were accurately labeled and contained just delta-8 THC, state officials do not consider them legal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, which is tasked with regulating the hemp industry, considers delta-8 “an adulterant as a food ingredient” and conveys this to hemp manufacturers that &#8220;indicate an interest in producing food products” containing the drug.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But a spokesman said in a statement that the products are being so widely sold that there’s nothing they can do about it.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_30430" class="wp-caption alignright" style="max-width:100%;width:300px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/smokeable-hemp.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-30430" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/smokeable-hemp-300x275.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="275" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/smokeable-hemp-300x275.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/smokeable-hemp.jpg 769w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Lab testing found a product sold in a Virginia shop as hemp cigarettes actually contained shredded paper soaked in a cannabis extract. (Photo courtesy Michelle Peace)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Given the proliferation of delta-8 THC products in the retail marketplace, the agency does not currently have the enforcement resources to effectively remove all products under the agency’s jurisdiction from retail establishments,” said Michael Wallace, an agency spokesman, in an email.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He did not respond to a question about whether the agency has ever pursued an enforcement action related to the drug.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Likewise, law enforcement agencies around the state appear to have collectively decided to tolerate the sales. They cite the complexity of enforcement, which would require testing of every product to prove its contents. They also say lawmakers in the General Assembly have clearly communicated that they don’t think marijuana enforcement should be a priority.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Enforcement of marijuana never was a high priority,” said John Jones, director of the Virginia Sheriff’s Association. “Now given public sentiment, lack of resources and a complicated law, I think law enforcement are focusing on enforcement issues that folks care about.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Police departments shared a similar sentiment. In the small town of Galax, Police Chief DeWitt Cooper said his officers have enough trouble keeping up with potent drugs like fentanyl.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We can’t police every gas station,” he said. “Because they’re selling it as hemp, we can’t say otherwise unless we start buying all this stuff and testing it. For me, it’s gotten out of control.”</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Lawmakers debate market’s future</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State lawmakers are actively debating how to legalize retail sales of marijuana. Currently the only legal avenue to obtain marijuana is to either grow it yourself or get it as a gift.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Front and center in the discussion is the role of the industrial hemp manufacturers in the synthetic cannabis products they are producing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some hemp producers are lobbying to be licensed early alongside medical processors to begin licensed retail sales of marijuana next year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Others are simply urging lawmakers to allow synthetic THC sales to continue in places like gas stations even after licensed marijuana shops open. They argue the products could be sold safely with the addition of testing and labeling requirements.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We would support reasonable regulations and age restrictions,” said Dylan Bishop, a lobbyist for the Cannabis Business Association of Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, some lawmakers are pursuing legislation that would eliminate any legal ambiguity surrounding delta-8 THC sales with new regulations. Among them is Del. Dawn Adams, D-Richmond, who worried that consumers buying the products don’t know what they’re getting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Many people who early this summer thought they were getting a form of CBD were unexpectedly and unhappily high,” Adams said. “We should all care that consumers know what they are putting into their bodies.”</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">A lawmaker’s cannabis shop</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lucas, <a href="https://www.wavy.com/news/local-news/portsmouth/new-cannabis-store-co-owned-by-state-sen-louise-lucas-opens-its-doors-as-recreational-marijuana-is-legalized/" target="_blank">who opened the “Cannabis Outlet” last year</a> with a business partner after possession of marijuana was legalized, is poised to be a deciding vote on the issues when they come before the Senate, where Democrats hold a one-seat majority. Under Virginia’s conflict of interest laws, lawmakers are generally permitted to vote on matters that</span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/government/virginia/vp-nw-anderson-legislature-conflict-of-interest-explainer-20220201-eb7hkrajyfhwdah4vewfyy4qfi-story.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> affect their businesses.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She has used her status as a state lawmaker and co-patron of the state’s marijuana legalization bill to promote the business in television news interviews and, more recently on Twitter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m a 78 year [old]  grandma who legalized pot and now has her own cannibis (sic) store,” she</span><a href="https://twitter.com/SenLouiseLucas/status/1485820503227080708" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">wrote in a tweet last week</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “And I’m the last thing standing between The GOP and total control of Virginia.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a subsequent tweet she added, “Did I mention my store is on High Street in Portsmouth.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of last week, the shop boasted an inventory that ranged from vape pens to infused slushies. Free samples of cannabis-laced Doritos and Cheetos sat in cups on a counter. A handful of the products were labeled as containing delta-8. Others had the same label as the aforementioned Lucky Charms bar, warning that the products contained a controlled substance. Other products had no labels.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_30425" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="max-width:100%;width:1500px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/cannabis-outlet-1.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-30425" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/cannabis-outlet-1.jpg" alt="" width="1500" height="1000" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/cannabis-outlet-1.jpg 1500w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/cannabis-outlet-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/cannabis-outlet-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/cannabis-outlet-1-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  The cannabis dispensary co-owned by Sen. Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, on High Street in Portsmouth. (Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The employee working behind the counter did not provide clear answers when asked what the various products contained.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Mercury had two products analyzed — the cereal bar and a vape cartridge that claimed to be lab tested but offered no indication of what was inside. Peace, the VCU forensic scientist, said both appeared to be synthetic cannabis products and while both contained delta-8 THC, both also contained quantities of delta-9 THC that would make them plainly illegal to sell in Virginia.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_30428" class="wp-caption alignright" style="max-width:100%;width:300px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/cannabis-outlet-4.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-30428" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/cannabis-outlet-4-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/cannabis-outlet-4-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/cannabis-outlet-4-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/cannabis-outlet-4-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/cannabis-outlet-4.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Products in a display counter at the Cannabis Outlet in Portsmouth advertise high THC concentrations. (Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the case of the vape pen, which was branded “Capt’n Kush Farms,” the combined quantity of delta-8 (359 mg) and delta-9 THC (139 mg) put it on par with the strength of products sold in the state’s regulated marijuana dispensaries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cereal bar was labeled, but contained far less total THC than advertised — 19 mg of delta-8 THC and 8 mg of delta-9 THC — which taken together is the equivalent of just under three doses under current state law governing the medical marijuana market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Selling marijuana in Virginia remains a felony, with punishments ranging from one year in prison to life depending on the amount sold.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite her recent tweets, Lucas declined this week to discuss the shop in person.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I will talk to you, because I’ve been waiting for this, and I’ve got a lot to say,” she said, requesting the Mercury email her questions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Lucas’ request, the Mercury emailed a detailed account of its reporting and questions related to the industry. Lucas and her staff did not respond, but she did </span><a href="https://twitter.com/SenLouiseLucas/status/1488566455880884228?s=20&amp;t=74a9hRRBm6iUBdnyQ8ihRg" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">issue a tweet</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> criticizing a Mercury reporter for attempting to interview her in person on Capitol Square, which is a common practice. </span></p>

(Photo by Daniel Berehulak/Getty Images)</p><p>Virginia lawmakers have voted down <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+sum+SB262" target="_blank">legislation</a> that would decriminalize psychedelic mushrooms, but not before the measure picked up some unexpected bi-partisan enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Democrats behind the bill pitched it as a step toward making <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/virginia-lawmakers-propose-decriminalizing-psychedelic-mushrooms/" target="_blank">therapeutic uses of the fungi available to people suffering from depression and PTSD</a>. And groups that testified in support of the measure framed it as especially valuable to veterans.</p>
<p>Republicans in the House said they felt the proposal had merit but needed more work, suggesting Del. Dawn Adams, D-Richmond, bring it back next year. In the Senate, GOP members urged Democratic patrons to put together a framework that more narrowly tailored the measure to medical uses.</p>
<p>“I’ve had a family member that has suffered from depression and it is insidious,” Senate Minority Leader Tommy Norment, R-James City, said at a hearing last week. “Sometimes we have to rely upon intuition and take a change. &#8230;. I’m going to support this because I believe it’s genuinely going to provide some relief and help to individuals.”</p>
<p>Sen. Mark Peake, R-Lynchburg, also said he was open to the idea, but worried that even if it passed the Senate it would reach a dead end in the House. “Without any guidelines by counselors or medical folks or anything along those lines, then it will not get out of the House where any college kids can have this for fun — I bet the House is not ready for that,” he said. “I would be in favor of that as I would be for medical marijuana.”</p>
<p>On Monday, Sens. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Chesterfield, and Jennifer Boysko, D-Fairfax, offered a revised bill that would have limited the reduced penalties to a $100 fine for people who had consulted with health care professionals about use of the drug. Possession of the drug is currently a felony offense.</p>
<p>But the GOP support from the prior week had evaporated as Democratic members of the Judiciary Committee raised concerns about people driving while on psychedelics. Two Democrats, Sens. Dick Saslaw, D-Fairfax and Joe Morrissey, D-Richmond, joined Republicans on the committee to pass the bill by for the year.</p>

<p>The legislation, proposed by Del.

<p>“This bill is necessary to protect the integrity of our convictions,” Glass told the House subcommittee tasked with reviewing the bill.</p>
<p>Republicans, who hold a majority in the chamber, noted that police have long been allowed to lie to suspects during interrogations. They said that should include fake documents.</p>
<p>“How many times has this been used to find out about a murder, find out about a rape?” said Del. Wren Williams, R-Patrick.</p>
<p>Prosecutors who testified were also divided on the bill. “We agree the Constitution allows the police to lie to people and sometimes this is a necessary investigative tool,” said Norfolk Commonwealth’s Attorney Ramin Fatehi. “But forging documents goes too far.”</p>
<p>Madison County Commonwealth’s Attorney Clarissa Berry countered that the issue is already addressed by existing case law. “Whether or not a confession is coerced is a matter for the trial court to take up,” she said.</p>
<p>The legislation failed on a party-line vote, with Democrats supporting and Republicans opposing.</p>

(Style Weekly)</p><p>Attorney General Jason Miyares said Friday state colleges and universities don’t have the authority to require students get vaccinated or boosted against COVID-19, reversing a legal opinion from his predecessor that reached the opposite conclusion.</p>
<p>“Absent specific authority conferred by the General Assembly, public institutions of higher education in Virginia may not require vaccination against COVID-19 as a general condition of students’ enrollment or in-person attendance,” Miyares <a href="https://files.constantcontact.com/d3e83e11901/e247bd43-59d8-4738-9c1f-5862d916c981.pdf" target="_blank">wrote in a legal opinion</a> requested by Gov. Glenn Youngkin.</p>
<p>The immediate impact on state schools, many of which have maintained vaccine mandates for students since the shots became widely available, was unclear.</p>
<p>Miyares’ opinions are advisory and non-binding, but the schools also rely on Miyares’ office for legal advice. (Miyares’ <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/01/23/heaphy-uva-miyares-removal/" target="_blank">made news earlier this week</a> when he fired legal counsels at the University of Virginia and George Mason University.)</p>
<p>Spokespeople for UVA and Virginia Tech said they were reviewing the opinion to determine how to proceed.</p>
<p>The schools had already eliminated vaccine requirements for faculty and staff after Youngkin signed an executive order during his first day in office striking the requirement for state employees, which was put in place by former Gov. Ralph Northam.</p>
<p>Former Attorney General Mark Herring <a href="https://www.oag.state.va.us/media-center/news-releases/2039-april-26-2021-new-opinion-from-attorney-general-herring-says-virginia-colleges-and-universities-have-authority-to-require-vaccinations-for-students" target="_blank">had opined in April</a> that the General Assembly had granted broad discretion to leaders of state colleges to establish policies, which he said would include vaccine requirements.</p>
<p>Miyares’ reaches essentially the opposite determination, writing that the General Assembly specifically sets immunizations required to enroll in public schools and that COVID-19 is not among them.</p>
<p>He notes that the General Assembly had several opportunities to add COVID-19 to the statute and did not.</p>
<p>“Over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, the General Assembly has amended other statues to address pandemic-related issues,” the opinion says. “To date, the General Assembly has not amended the specific immunizations enumerated in (state code) to include immunization for COVID-19, and boards of visitors may not exercise and implied power to require ja certain vaccine when a specific statue governing vaccination excludes it.”</p>

Police currently provide the vast majority of transports to psychiatric hospitals across Virginia. (Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>A budget amendment proposed by Gov. Glenn Youngkin aims to punish local governments that have reduced funding for police — an idea he <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/meet-the-press/blog/meet-press-blog-latest-news-analysis-data-driving-political-discussion-n988541/ncrd1276997#blogHeader" target="_blank">railed against</a> on the campaign trail.</p>
<p>But state reports tracking local government spending suggest his plan would mostly limit state support for struggling small-town police departments, where budgets fluctuate from year to year.</p>
<p>“I don’t know of any localities — nobody has done what I’d call a ‘defunding,’” said Dana Schrad, the executive director of the Virginia Association of Chiefs of Police. “Some may have reduced agency budgets — not in a punitive way, but because they were resource challenged.”</p>
<p>Youngkin introduced the plan in his first address to the General Assembly, asking lawmakers to increase state funding for local departments by $26 million, “but only in localities that are increasing funding for their police departments.”</p>
<p>“We must stand with our law enforcement agencies,” Youngkin said, lamenting the recent death of <a href="https://wcyb.com/news/local/man-charged-with-murder-of-big-stone-gap-police-officer-michael-chandler-appears-in-court" target="_blank">Michael Chandler, a Big Stone Gap police officer</a> recently shot and killed in the line of duty.</p>
<p>Youngkin released the details of the plan last week, presenting a budget amendment that would increase state funding for local police departments by $13.5 million for two consecutive years, with the caveat that “no funds shall be allocated to any locality in which the police department&#8217;s budget has decreased on a per capita basis.”</p>
<p>Youngkin’s spokeswoman, Macaulay Porter, did not offer additional detail about how that would be calculated, but said the proposal &#8220;is forward looking &#8212; you cannot decrease your funding in order to receive more funding.&#8221;</p>
<p>The state’s only comprehensive analysis of per-capita spending by local governments, a comparative report prepared annually by the Virginia Auditor of Public Accounts, shows police funding dropped in at least 48 localities between 2019 and 2020, the most recent years for which data is available.</p>
<p><iframe id="datawrapper-chart-Slu0Z" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" title="Where per-capita police funding dropped" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Slu0Z/1/" height="593" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" aria-label="Table"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
</script></p>
<p>But, as Schrad observed, it’s unlikely that the decreases were ideological. The report shows that of the localities, all but eight are jurisdictions that backed Youngkin in the recent election.</p>
<p>And most of them are tiny --- small towns like West Point at the head of the York River in eastern Virginia.</p>
<p>West Point’s police spending dropped from $887,000 in 2019 to $803,000 in 2020. It’s since risen to more than $900,000, according to Town Manager John Edwards. But he said depending on the year and the needs of the department, the town could easily be left out under Youngkin’s approach.</p>
<p>“It’s not that anyone is trying to take anything away from the police department, but this year they may not need as much as Public Works,” Edwards said. “But I can promise you in a town like West Point, we are extremely proud of our police and there is no effort to defund them.”</p>
<p>Edwards said some years tight budgets can lead to reductions. In other years, he said it could be as simple as changing needs. For instance, fuel prices may have dropped or the department got extra money to purchase new body armor the prior year.</p>
<p>That said, he’s not exactly stressing whether the town would get a cut of the new funding proposed by Northam, which he calculates would amount to about $6,000 a year. “Every little bit helps, but it’s not going to make or break my budget,” he said.</p>
<p>Schrad said that’s why police departments are urging lawmakers to back a different budget amendment put forward by Sen. John Edwards, D-Roanoke, which would provide a much more substantial increase in state funding --- $108 million over two years --- with no strings attached.</p>
<p>“We appreciate the governor’s amendments, but the increase is not enough,” Schrad said. “We have some localities that are actually considering folding their departments because they can’t afford it anymore.”</p>

<p>Democrats, who unanimously backed the measure over opposition from Republicans, framed the change as a limited step that could hopefully deescalate traffic stops.</p>
<p>“When people are stopped, they generally want to know why,” Sen. Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, who proposed the measure, told his colleagues.</p>
<p>Surovell described <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+sum+SB246" target="_blank">the bill</a> as a minor change to state code. He said that if an officer did not follow the new rule, the only legal ramifications would be that the officer would be unable to write a ticket for failure to provide identification, which he said carries a $10 fine and is seldom used.</p>
<p>Republican lawmakers unanimously opposed the measure, arguing that it could make police work more dangerous.</p>
<p>“I don’t think it’s a terrible imposition on motorists or anybody else to have to provide their driver&#8217;s license and registration when a police officer asks for it,” said Sen. John Cosgrove, R-Chesapeake. “To me, this is just a way for lawyers to get somebody off the hook.”</p>
<p>The bill now heads to the House of Delegates, where Republicans hold a majority and are unlikely to advance the measure.</p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>Lawmakers in the Virginia Senate rejected legislation requested by the state’s new Republican attorney general that would have allowed him to overrule local prosecutors when police disagreed with their charging decisions.</p>
<p>Attorney General Jason Miyares, who ran on a law-and-order platform despite the position’s limited criminal law enforcement powers, made the legislation a centerpiece of his campaign.</p>
<p>It was always a longshot given Democrats maintained control of the Senate. But the proposal was also roundly rejected by a bi-partisan association of locally elected commonwealth’s attorneys around the state.</p>
<p>“The Virginia Association of Commonwealths Attorneys opposes this bill basically on the principle that we don’t believe the legislature should be centralizing local criminal justice,” said Derek Davis, the commonwealth’s attorney in Surry County, speaking on behalf of the group before the Senate’s Judiciary Committee.</p>
<p>In a last-ditch effort to save the bill, its Senate patron, Sen. Ryan McDougle, R-Hanover, narrowed the bill to only apply to child sex offenses, arguing that the attorney general’s office already has the power to enforce child pornography laws and internet crimes.</p>
<p>Miyares’ office argued that the change would merely make more resources available to help local prosecutors tackle complex cases that can span multiple jurisdictions. He said it would result in “a class of super prosecutors focused on child sex offense cases.”</p>
<p>Democrats on the committee argued that the attorney general’s office could already provide the assistance on a voluntary basis.</p>
<p>Miyares had pitched the legislation as a way to push back against a new class of criminal-justice-reform minded prosecutors who have been elected in recent years. It was supported by associations that represent police officers around the state.</p>
<p>One Democrat on the committee, Sen. Chap Petersen, D-Fairfax City, supported the bill,<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/judge-zaldivar-sentence-abuse/2021/09/20/85258424-1a40-11ec-8380-5fbadbc43ef8_story.html" target="_blank"> citing a recent case</a> in which a man convicted of sexually abusing a child in Fairfax County was sentenced to 17 years as part of a plea deal, drawing outrage from family members.</p>
<p>In addition to drawing opposition from local commonwealth’s attorneys, a lobbying group representing defense lawyers also opposed the change.</p>
<p>“It’s unusual for prosecutors and defense attorneys to be on the same side,” observed Sen. John Edwards, D-Roanoke, who chairs the Senate’s judiciary committee, which heard the bill.</p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>GOP lawmakers in the Virginia House of Delegates are taking their first stab at legislation to open the retail marijuana market, introducing bills that would lower the tax rate on sales and redirect proposed social equity funding to school infrastructure.</p>
<p>But leadership in the chamber stressed that the effort remains very much a work in progress and that they expect plenty of changes as the legislation makes its way through the committee system.</p>
<p>“We’ll come up with something,” said Garren Shipley, a spokesman for House Speaker Todd Gilbert, said last week. “There will be a bill. There may be multiple bills. But something is going to come out of this chamber.”</p>
<p>Republicans unanimously opposed legalization when Democrats voted last year to allow people to grow and possess small amounts of marijuana. But Democratic lawmakers’ decision to leave it until this year to finalize the particulars of how a legal retail market would work &#8212;combined with the loss of their House majority in November &#8212; has left the once-reluctant GOP with a key role in deciding how to proceed.</p>
<p>Gilbert said that while his caucus opposed legalization, he views it as imperative to come up with a mechanism for legal sales, complaining that the legal framework left in place by Democrats has only empowered the black market.</p>
<p>The party has so-far left the heavy lifting on that front to Del. Michael Webert, R-Fauquier, who was among a handful of GOP lawmakers to support reducing penalties for marijuana possession two years ago and is the only member of the party to introduce a <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+sum+HB950" target="_blank">comprehensive bill governing retail sales</a>.</p>
<figure id="attachment_30126" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="max-width:100%;width:1500px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2022-GA-2-3.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-30126" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2022-GA-2-3.jpg" alt="" width="1500" height="1000" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2022-GA-2-3.jpg 1500w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2022-GA-2-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2022-GA-2-3-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2022-GA-2-3-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  House Speaker Todd Gilbert, R-Shenandoah, looks out over the chamber from the dais. (Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Taxes</h4>

	
<p>While his bill largely tracks with <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+ful+SB391" target="_blank">legislation introduced by Democrats</a> in the House and Senate, it diverges in a few key areas.</p>
<p>First, it halves the proposed tax rate on retail sales from 21 percent to 10 percent, which would be the lowest in the country. Webert called the step important to compete with the black market, citing the experience of California, where the combined tax rate on sales is just over 36 percent.</p>
<p>“They have an ungodly huge black market,” Webert said. “So we don’t want the taxes so high that we drive things to the black market.”</p>
<p>His bill also changes how the money would be spent.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Social equity and schools</h4>

	
<p>Democrats centered their legalization effort around social equity provisions aimed at making amends for disproportionate enforcement of marijuana laws in Black communities. To that end, they proposed that 35 percent of tax revenue from marijuana sales be dedicated to a Cannabis Equity Reinvestment Fund, which the law proposed be dedicated to providing scholarships, community programs and business loans to people and communities “historically and disproportionately targeted and affected by drug enforcement.”</p>
<p>Webert’s bill eliminates that fund, instead proposing the revenue for a new grant program to help local governments pay for the cost of repairing or replacing school roofs.</p>
<p>Finding more state funds to fix decrepit school buildings has been a focus for some Republicans recently and Webert said his approach would benefit both rural and urban areas that have struggled with the issue.</p>
<p>Webert also proposes tweaking &#8212; but not eliminating &#8212; a program devised by Democrats to give people negatively impacted by prohibition priority access to marijuana business licenses.</p>
<p>His legislation strikes criteria that would have extended preference to people convicted of marijuana crimes in the past &#8212; something that GOP lawmakers vocally opposed last year. But it maintains language that would allow priority access for people who live in areas that were subject to higher than average enforcement or are economically disadvantaged. It also maintains eligibility for people who attended a Virginia historically black college or university.</p>
<figure id="attachment_26727" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="max-width:100%;width:1500px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/marijuana-bill-signing-3.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-26727" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/marijuana-bill-signing-3.jpg" alt="" width="1500" height="1000" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/marijuana-bill-signing-3.jpg 1500w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/marijuana-bill-signing-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/marijuana-bill-signing-3-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/marijuana-bill-signing-3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/marijuana-bill-signing-3-696x464.jpg 696w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/marijuana-bill-signing-3-1068x712.jpg 1068w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/marijuana-bill-signing-3-630x420.jpg 630w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Gov. Ralph Northam signed legislation legalizing marijuana in Virginia at a ceremony in April. (Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Referendums, unions and resentencing</h4>

	
<p>The bill also includes subtler departures from the approach proposed by Democrats. For instance both bills allow localities to hold referendums to opt out of marijuana sales, but the GOP bill would bind towns to the decision of their surrounding county while the Democratic bill treats them as independent jurisdictions. (<a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+ful+HB43" target="_blank">Legislation</a> from two GOP delegates goes further, barring any retail marijuana stores unless sales are specifically approved by a local referendum.)</p>
<p>The GOP bill also drops languages that would block local governments from passing new zoning rules that apply only to marijuana businesses.</p>
<p>And it strikes language that was aimed at promoting unionization in the new industry by refusing to license business owners who oppose unionization efforts by employees or rely heavily on independent contractors.</p>
<p>For now, Republicans and Democrats have proposed similar stances on <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/01/12/virginia-lawmakers-still-at-odds-over-resentencing-for-people-in-prison-on-marijuana-charges/" target="_blank">resentencing for people currently imprisoned on marijuana charges</a>, allowing them to petition a judge to reconsider their sentence, though the GOP bill excludes people convicted of distributing the drug to minors.</p>
<p>A bill authored by Del. Carrie Coyner, R-Chesterfield, goes further, proposing <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+sum+HB280" target="_blank">automatic resentencing hearings</a>.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Retail sales</h4>

	
<p>Both chambers have also introduced separate legislation to move the date retail sales can begin from 2024 to 2023 &#8212; a key recommendation from lawmakers tasked with studying the issue over the summer.</p>
<p>The chambers differ, however, on whether to include large hemp processors in the stop-gap program. The <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+ful+HB211" target="_blank">House version</a> limits early sales to existing medical producers. The <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+ful+SB313" target="_blank">Senate version</a> allows large industrial hemp processors to also enter the market early.</p>
<p>So far, none of the bills have been docketed in the House of Delegates and it remains unclear when debate on the measures will begin in earnest.</p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>It’s a tale as old as the free trial subscription. You sign up for an enticing offer online, but when it comes time to cancel, an unsubscribe button is nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>No more, say Dels. Glenn Davis, R-Virginia Beach, and Sally Hudson, D-Charlottesville.</p>
<p>The two lawmakers both introduced <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+sum+HB78" target="_blank">legislation</a> that would require companies that allow customers to subscribe to services online to also unsubscribe from those services online.</p>
<p>The change would mean no more waiting on hold with a call center, Davis told his colleagues when the bill was heard Thursday.</p>
<p>“Maybe sometimes you get someone and sometimes you don’t,” he said. “Unfortunately, there are some business practices out there that make it very difficult to unsubscribe because they know they can get some additional months of revenue.”</p>
<p>The legislation advanced Thursday with unanimous support from Democrats and Republicans on subcommittee tasked with vetting the idea.</p>
<p>No one opposed the idea.</p>

<p>On vaccines, Sen. Siobhan Dunnavant, R-Henrico, a practicing OBGYN, called it “egregious and a complete violation of an individual’s right to privacy” for businesses like restaurants to require proof of a COVID-19 vaccine.</p>

Glenn Youngkin is sworn in to office in front of the Capitol on Jan. 15, 2022. (Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>On the campaign trail, Gov. Glenn Youngkin promised to fire his Democratic predecessor’s Parole Board on the first day he took office.</p>
<p>And a few hours after he was sworn in on Saturday, that’s exactly what he did.</p>
<p>The reconfigured board &#8212; a decidedly more conservative group than the body that approved a series of controversial release decisions that angered Republicans last year &#8212; includes a few familiar faces from the campaign trail.</p>
<p>Among the appointees are <a href="https://montva.com/sheriff-department/meet-the-sheriff" target="_blank">Montgomery County Sheriff Hank Partin</a>, who drew a testy response from Youngkin’s Democratic opponent, Terry McAuliffe, during a campaign event last year.</p>
<p>The exchange was captured on video and <a href="https://twitter.com/MattWolking/status/1438331035847204867?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1438331035847204867%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fthefederalist.com%2F2021%2F09%2F16%2Fterry-mcauliffe-snaps-at-virginia-sheriff-for-asking-about-his-ties-to-defund-the-police-group%2F" target="_blank">promoted by Youngkin’s campaign</a>. In it, Partin asks McAuliffe if he supports defunding the police in light of his endorsement by a group that called for reallocating law enforcement dollars.</p>
<p>McAuliffe, who had said he backed increasing law enforcement budgets, bristled at the question. “Are you out of your mind? I invested in law enforcement.” He went on to ask if Partin was “out of his mind.”</p>
<p>Partin called McAuliffe’s response “unbelievable” and McAuliffe replied, “I don’t care what you believe.”</p>
<p>Youngkin’s new Parole Board also includes Cheryl Nici-O’Connell, who Youngkin’s campaign featured in an ad accusing the current board of being too lenient. In the ad, Nici recounts being shot in the head in 1984 as a young Richmond police officer.</p>
<p>“I’m terrified because McAuliffe puts politics over the safety of Virginians and victims’ rights,” she says in the TV spot. “I’m speaking to you as a victim. Virginia simply won’t be safe with four more years of Terry McAuliffe.”</p>
<p>The advertisement was <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/09/22/youngkin-campaign-targets-mcauliffes-parole-record-through-dubious-links/" target="_blank">criticized as misleading</a> by The Washington Post’s fact checker, Glenn Kessler, who noted that it gave the impression the man convicted of shooting Nici was released when, in fact, the Parole Board under McAuliffe denied his release.</p>

<p>Youngkin also appointed Tracy Banks, a Charlottesville lawyer and Carmen Williams, who works in Chesterfield for the Virginia Sexual and Domestic Violence Action Alliance.</p>
<p>The Parole Board is responsible for making parole determinations for people convicted of crimes prior to 1995, when the state abolished parole. The board also reviews requests for geriatric release.</p>
<p>Youngkin’s executive order also tasks the new board with reviewing its procedures, increasing transparency and providing “recommendations for legislative, administrative and policy changes that will improve the administration of the agency in fulfilling its solemn public safety mission.”</p>
<p>And it authorizes new Attorney General Jason Miyares to open a criminal investigation into the previous board’s alleged failure to follow laws requiring the notification of victims.</p>
<p>“To this day, the family members and victims have no answers as to how or why the Virginia Parole Board failed to abide by the laws governing its operations, and no one has been held accountable,” Youngkin wrote in the order.</p>

(Photo by Daniel Berehulak/Getty Images)</p><p>Three Virginia lawmakers have introduced legislation that would end felony penalties for possession of psychedelic mushrooms, citing the drug’s <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/11/09/largest-psilocybin-trial-finds-psychedelic-effective-treating-serious-depression/" target="_blank">growing acceptance</a> in medicinal contexts.</p>
<p>“It is increasingly a recognized treatment for refractory depression and PTSD,” said Del. Dawn Adams, D-Richmond, a nurse practitioner whose legislation would also decriminalize peyote, a cactus that contains the psychedelic compound mescalin. “It’s changed people’s lives.”</p>
<p>The <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+sum+HB898" target="_blank">legislation</a> would reduce the penalty for possession &#8212; currently a Class 5 felony punishable by up to 10 years in prison &#8212; to a $100 civil fine.</p>
<p>Sens. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Chesterfield, and Jennifer Boysko, D-Fairfax, introduced <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+sum+SB262" target="_blank">similar legislation</a> in the Senate.</p>
<p>The bill would put Virginia at the forefront of a nascent decriminalization movement that has primarily been limited to cities, including Washington, D.C. So far, Oregon is the only state to legalize medicinal use of psilocybin, an active ingredient in psychedelic mushrooms.</p>
<p>The bill likely faces long odds, especially in the House of Delegates, where the newly reinstated Republican majority has historically resisted efforts to loosen drug laws. That said, Del. Rob Bell, R-Albemarle, who leads the chamber’s Courts of Justice Committee, said he is open to hearing arguments in favor of the legislation.</p>
<p>“That is not something we’ve taken up before,” he said. “I’d be interested in hearing what (Adams) has to say.”</p>
<p>Even if the legislation were to pass, the drug would remain illegal, albeit with reduced penalties. That makes it unlikely medical providers in Virginia would embrace psychedelics as a treatment option, but Adams said it would nonetheless be a step in the right direction.</p>
<p>“If we decriminalize it, it allows people to learn,” she said. “It doesn’t egg people on (to use the drug). It tries to open the door for us to continue to study the positive effects on people’s mental health going forward.”</p>

<p>In a news release, Herring’s office said the forgeries were discovered in April after a local prosecutor attempted to obtain a certified copy of a forged DNA analysis from the state’s Department of Forensic Science. The office said that in at least one instance, a forgery was presented in court as evidence during a bond hearing.</p>
<p>“This was an extremely troubling and potentially unconstitutional tactic that abused the name of the Commonwealth to try to coerce confessions,” Herring said in a statement. “While I appreciate that Virginia Beach Police put an end to this practice and cooperated with our investigation, this is clearly a tactic that should never have been used.”</p>
<p>Herring said his office is alerting defendants in the five cases in which the tactic was used and that the police department had agreed to “immediately discontinue the use of any inauthentic certificates of analysis, DFS letterhead, or templates used to make inauthentic documents, and prohibiting personnel from making or using any inauthentic or altered certificates, letterhead, or formats of any department outside the agency.”</p>
<p>Observers said it’s legal and not uncommon for police to lie to suspects during interrogations, but that they’d not heard of cases in which officers forged official documents in an effort to trick a suspect.</p>
<p>“One thing to bear in mind that most people don’t know is that police are absolutely permitted to lie to suspects,” said Steve Benjamin, a criminal defense lawyer in Richmond. “The question is, whether actually manufacturing false evidence to present crosses a line.”</p>
<p>In a statement, the Virginia Beach Police Department referred to the fake DNA reports as &#8220;inauthentic replica documents&#8221; and said that the practice &#8220;has consistently been found to be constitutional by both the Virginia Supreme Court and the United States Supreme Court.&#8221;</p>
<p>The statement also stressed that Police Chief Paul Neudigate had ordered an end to the practice before the attorney general&#8217;s investigation after it was brought to his attention by other state officials, including Gov. Ralph Northam&#8217;s secretary of public safety.</p>
<p>&#8220;The VBPD took immediate and proactive steps to address this very limited interrogation technique which they felt, though legal, was not in the spirit of what the community expects of their Police Department,&#8221; the statement said.</p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>Nearly a year after Virginia lawmakers voted to legalize possession of marijuana, they remain divided on what &#8212; if anything &#8212; to do about people currently imprisoned on marijuana charges.</p>
<p>The committee of House and Senate lawmakers tasked with making recommendations for the legislative session that begins Wednesday concluded its work this week with a proposal to <a href="https://www.nbc12.com/2022/01/11/cannabis-commission-makes-recommendations-general-assembly/" target="_blank">begin recreational sales in 2023</a> &#8212; a year earlier than initially planned.</p>
<p>But like last year &#8212; when resentencing provisions <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/04/23/virginia-legalized-it-but-people-in-prison-on-marijuana-charges-will-stay-there-under-new-law/" target="_blank">were left out of the original bill</a> &#8212; lawmakers said they ran out of time to reach an agreement on how to handle the issue, leaving the debate for the legislative session.</p>
<p>The Virginia Department of Corrections says 10 people are currently serving sentences in which the most serious offense was marijuana. In all of the cases, the people were convicted of transporting five or more pounds of marijuana into the state.</p>
<p>All 10 are expected to be released in the next six years, according to the department, which presented the data Monday to the assembly’s Cannabis Oversight Commission.</p>
<p>Another 560 people are serving sentences partially related to a marijuana offense but have also been found guilty of more serious offenses.</p>
<p>Democrats on the committee said they supported allowing the 560 people in the latter category to petition for a resentencing hearing to allow a judge to decide whether they were giving a longer sentence than they might have otherwise faced as a result of the marijuana charge.</p>
<p>But they disagreed on how to handle the 10 people serving time solely for marijuana convictions.</p>
<p>Del. Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, called for legislation that would provide for their immediate release.</p>
<p>Sen. Adam Ebbin, D-Alexandria, said he planned to propose legislation that would also require those 10 people to petition for a resentencing hearing and for a judge to decide whether and how their sentences should be altered. Ebbin reasoned that it remains a felony to transport five or more pounds of marijuana into the state under the revised law.</p>
<p>Scott responded that, “I just visited a medical provider last week and there were thousands of pounds in there, so yeah I think those 10 people deserve a chance to come home.”</p>
<p>The three Republicans on the committee, meanwhile, have not taken a stance. Unlike last year, when Democrats began the process of legalizing the drug on a series of party-line votes, the GOP now occupies the Executive Mansion and holds a narrow majority in the House of Delegates.</p>
<p>And so far, Republicans have said little about how they plan to approach the issue beyond offering broad assurances that they won’t seek to repeal the legislation.</p>
<p>“I think whether or not you support marijuana or don’t’ support marijuana, the reality is we already have laws on the books,” said Del. Will Morefield, R-Tazewell. “So I think it’s only responsible Virginia fall under a very well regulated market.”</p>
<p>After the meeting Morefield said the House GOP caucus has not arrived at a consensus on how to deal with people in prison for marijuana-related convictions. Likewise, Sen. Ryan McDougle, R-Hanover, said Senate Republicans are also still discussing the issue.</p>
<p>Legislation introduced by individual Republican lawmakers so far would <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+sum+SB107" target="_blank">gut social equity provisions</a> championed by Democrats and give cities and counties more discretion <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+sum+HB43" target="_blank">to block marijuana sales at the local level</a>.</p>
<p>Incoming Gov. Glenn Youngkin has made limited remarks on the subject, telling Virginia Business <a href="https://www.virginiabusiness.com/article/the-outsider/" target="_blank">in an interview last month that</a> “When it comes to commercialization, I think there is a lot of work to be done. I’m not against it, but there’s a lot of work to be done.”</p>

She’s now 52. Her release date won’t come until she’s 70.</p>
<p>She doubts she’ll make it.</p>
<p>“Not with this medical care,” she says, describing a range of serious conditions she says have gone untreated despite leaving her incontinent and in danger of permanent kidney failure.</p>
<p>Scott is the titular plaintiff in a long running lawsuit against the Virginia Department of Corrections over shoddy health care at Fluvanna Correctional Center for Women, where a federal judge has acknowledged substandard treatment <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/07/12/five-years-later-virginia-prison-still-not-meeting-terms-of-court-ordered-settlement-over-shoddy-medical-care/" target="_blank">contributed to a string of deaths</a> at the facility.</p>
<p>And she is hoping that before Gov. Ralph Northam leaves office, he will act on her petition for a conditional pardon, which argues that in addition to the danger caused by limited health care and the risk posed by COVID-19, her 40-year sentence was unusually harsh in the first place &#8212; far in excess of the 10-to-25 year sentencing guidelines and longer than many murderers receive.</p>
<p>Scott says she has no faith that the incoming Republican administration of Gov.-elect Glenn Youngkin will consider her application, citing his tough-on-crime rhetoric on the campaign trail. “He already said that he is totally against violent offenders and he was going to change the Parole Board because they were being too lenient,” she said. “Regardless of what their crime is, everybody deserves a second chance.”</p>
<p>With medical problems piling up and the prison <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/07/12/five-years-later-virginia-prison-still-not-meeting-terms-of-court-ordered-settlement-over-shoddy-medical-care/" target="_blank">still not meeting the terms of a settlement</a> aimed at improving care, she says Northam is her best chance at getting out alive.</p>
<p>Scott is far from alone in her hope that Northam will act on a backlog of pardon applications before Youngkin takes office.</p>
<p>Northam, however, says he has no plans to speed through a stack of pardon applications on his way out.</p>
<p>“We’ve had a backlog over the years and we’re not rushing things now,” he said before the Thanksgiving holiday. “We do it safely and go through all the procedures. I think we’ve pardoned more people than all the other administrations put together and we’ll continue to work through it until our last day here.”</p>

<p>Secretary of the Commonwealth Kelly Thomasson, whose office investigates pardon applications, said Northam has issued 695 pardons to date, which the administration has calculated is more than at least the past nine governors combined.</p>
<p>Northam’s predecessor, Terry McAuliffe, issued closer to 30 pardons a year during his term. Bob McDonnell, the last Republican to hold the office, issued about five a year.</p>
<p>Northam started off slower, issuing between 50 and 60 a year until last year when COVID-19 hit and he made pardons part of a broader effort to reduce the number of people in state prisons, where <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/09/17/collapsing-inmates-cold-hot-dogs-and-one-nurse-quarantine-in-a-virginia-prison/" target="_blank">the virus spread widely</a>, infecting thousands and killing 57.</p>
<p>Thomasson says the administration is still processing applications, but they can’t be expedited because they all require individual investigation.</p>
<p>“A lot of folks are calling and expect us to have this approach of, ‘Oh, now that he’s a lame duck, outgoing governor, you’re going to pardon all the people now,” Thomasson said. “That&#8217;s not the approach at all that we&#8217;ve taken through this administration.”</p>
<p>Scott is still hoping the administration makes it to her application, submitted as COVID began spreading last year with the support of the robbery victim’s family.</p>
<p>In a phone call from Fluvanna, she says her message to Northam is simple: “I don’t want to die in here.”</p>
<p>And to people who might think her punishment fits the crime, she says she hopes they can understand she is a different person now.</p>
<p>“I was on drugs &#8212; crack cocaine,” she said. “My addiction took my whole life away from me. My kids were nine and 13 when I got locked up. They are now 30 and getting ready to turn 34.</p>
<p>“I know that I have changed.”</p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>For 343 years, representatives of the Mattaponi and Pamunkey Indian Tribes have been delivering fresh game in lieu of taxes to Virginia governors under the terms of a 1677 peace treaty.</p>
<p>This year, some members of the Mattaponi tribe are hoping the pre-Thanksgiving ceremony will deliver something for them: attention to their push for democratic tribal elections and women’s suffrage.</p>
<p>“It’s five unelected men who make decisions for everyone,” said Gloria Custalow, a 62-year-old member of the tribe who began petitioning for the right to participate in tribal politics in 2016. “It’s backwards and we just need to get things straight.”</p>
<p>She spoke last week in the waiting area of the King William County Courthouse, where she and 12 other members of the tribe and their supporters were being booked on misdemeanor charges of trespassing and assault by mob.</p>
<p>Mattaponi Chief Mark Custalow filed the charges late last month after a group of tribal members and their supporters walked to his home on the reservation to deliver a petition announcing they would no longer recognize the tribal government and planned to hold the first open election since the mid-1970s.</p>
<p>Lawyers for the demonstrators called the criminal charges, which the chief swore out before a magistrate, absurd.</p>
<figure id="attachment_29548" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="max-width:100%;width:1500px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/mattaponi-members.png" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-29548" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/mattaponi-members.png" alt="" width="1500" height="1000" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/mattaponi-members.png 1500w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/mattaponi-members-300x200.png 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/mattaponi-members-1024x683.png 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/mattaponi-members-768x512.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Four of the 13 members of the Mattaponi Tribe who face criminal charges after protesting to hold the tribe&#8217;s first election in decades.

<p>“They knocked on the door and left a copy of the petition; then they went home and had a cookout,” said Tony Troy, a former attorney general who is representing the tribal members pro-bono with his law partner, Sen. Bill Stanley, R-Franklin.</p>
<p>Video of the march showed a peaceful demonstration that lasted less than 10 minutes. Troy said the youngest participants were children and the oldest was 93.</p>
<p>At a hearing Thursday, a judge set a trial for Dec. 16, and agreed to modify a restraining order the chief also took out against participants in the march to allow them to attend a protest Wednesday on Capitol Square, which is timed to coincide with the annual tax-tribute, during which Chief Custalow and his predecessors traditionally present the governor deer and other game harvested from the reservation.</p>

<p>Chief Custalow has declined to comment. “I think it will all come out in court,” he said as he left the courthouse on Thursday.</p>
<p>Members of the tribe say that for years the chief has refused to acknowledge or discuss members’ concerns.</p>
<p>They describe a tribal government that has grown increasingly insular and opaque. The last tribal elections anyone can remember took place in the 1970s. At the time, women were not allowed to vote, making the tribe an outlier among indigenous communities, members say. Since then, members of the tribal council, which includes a chief, assistant chief and three councilors, have appointed their own successors.</p>
<p>Until recently, their meetings were generally open to male members of the tribe, but about two years ago they began meeting only in secret, members say.</p>
<p>The tribal government is responsible for overseeing tribal membership and managing the 250-acre reservation and its budget. Situated on the steep banks of the Mattaponi River, the reservation is home to about 75 residents, a church, a museum and an education center.</p>
<p>Both membership and reservation housing are major points of concern for the members.</p>
<figure id="attachment_29549" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="max-width:100%;width:1500px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/mattaponi-chief-mark-custalow-1.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-29549" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/mattaponi-chief-mark-custalow-1.jpg" alt="" width="1500" height="1000" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/mattaponi-chief-mark-custalow-1.jpg 1500w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/mattaponi-chief-mark-custalow-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/mattaponi-chief-mark-custalow-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/mattaponi-chief-mark-custalow-1-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Mattaponi Chief Mark Custalow attends the 2018 tax tribute ceremony at the Executive Mansion. (Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p>They say they have no access to the tribal rolls, leaving them uncertain about basic facts like how many people are members. And they complain of arbitrary decisions about who can join. Jody Custalow (it’s a very common surname among the tribe) said both his sons were denied membership because the chief said their “skin was too light.”</p>
<p>Decisions about who gets to live on the reservation are also made in secret and members complain that their requests for lots and housing have gone unanswered for years.</p>
<p>Lonnie Custalow, who operates a cabinet shop on the reservation, said tribal leadership targeted him and tried to shut down his business after he began to question their legitimacy. “I became an outcast in the tribe,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Members say they&#8217;re also upset that more people aren&#8217;t being allowed to build homes on the reservation. They say most requests for lots go unanswered despite having plenty of space after the reservation added 100 acres in a <a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/all-releases/2019/august/headline-845769-en.html" target="_blank">2019 deal with the state</a>, which holds the reservation in a perpetual trust on behalf of the tribe.</p>
<p>Secretary of the Commonwealth Kelly Thomasson said in an email that Northam&#8217;s administration is &#8220;aware tangentially of some of the issues that have arisen recently between members of the Mattaponi&#8221; but that none of the members with concerns have directly contacted the administration.</p>
<p>&#8220;Governor Northam respects the sovereignty of all our Tribal Nations and has always kept an open line of communication between himself and Tribal leaders,&#8221; Thomasson said.</p>
<p>Tribal members say that under the 1677 treaty, the state does have a stewardship role and could intervene, but that for now, they’re not asking state officials to take action. But they say they do hope that outside attention will help force change within.</p>
<p>“We’ve got a whole new generation of children being born right now,” Gloria Custalow said. “We need to have something for them to be proud of, and right now, we don’t.”</p>

The prison, which houses some of the state's most medically fragile inmates, has seen a major COVID-19 outbreak. (Virginia Department of Corrections)</p><p>When the head of Virginia’s prison system announced to staff members this summer that he planned to end the practice of outsourcing medical care to a private contractor, <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/07/26/virginia-department-of-corrections-announces-plans-to-de-privatize-prison-healthcare/" target="_blank">his memo</a> to employees suggested the decision was final.</p>
<p>Armor Health, the Florida-based company that suddenly faced the prospect of losing its $90-million contract to staff prisons with doctors and nurses, had other ideas.</p>
<p>Records show the company embarked on a monthslong campaign to override Department of Corrections Director Harold Clarke, at times flaunting the sway the company believes it holds with lawmakers.</p>
<p>“(Armor CEO Otto Campo) does not believe this battle is over by any stretch!” wrote Matthew Berg, an executive with the company, in an email last month to a DOC official. The email informed the department that Armor had “been assured by both governor candidates that they also do not support the actions of VADOC and will proceed to intervene after the election.”</p>
<p>The dispute, which has raised eyebrows in Richmond, offers an unusually candid window into the intersection between politics and high-dollar government contracts.</p>
<p>Armor provides medical care to prisoners in about half of the state’s 40 prisons, with state-employed staff providing care in the other half. The state has traditionally turned to outsourcing to provide medical care in harder-to-staff rural institutions and those with more intensive medical needs, such as infirmaries, but as health care costs have continued to rise, <a href="http://jlarc.virginia.gov/2018-inmate_health_care.asp" target="_blank">audits have suggested</a> state officials reconsider the arrangement.</p>
<p>Publicly, the Department of Corrections had spoken favorably of Armor, calling the relationship a “long and productive partnership” even in the memo announcing plans to end the contract. But internal DOC documents suggest the decision to de-privatize followed frustration with understaffing, escalating contract costs and years of litigation over the quality of medical care provided at Fluvanna Correctional Center for Women, which was the site of dozens of inmate deaths.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="e2w88JYdt1"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2019/08/14/as-prisoners-continue-to-die-virginia-appeals-court-order-mandating-better-healthcare/">As prisoners continue to die, Virginia appeals federal court order mandating better health care</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;As prisoners continue to die, Virginia appeals federal court order mandating better health care&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2019/08/14/as-prisoners-continue-to-die-virginia-appeals-court-order-mandating-better-healthcare/embed/#?secret=NQqyztwopM#?secret=e2w88JYdt1" data-secret="e2w88JYdt1" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p>The department also assessed nearly $4 million in fines against Armor last fiscal year for failing to adequately staff facilities.</p>
<p>“(Fluvanna) and the COVID pandemic have shown us that ultimately the state will be held responsible for the quality of inmate medical care,” a DOC committee wrote in a report recommending de-privatization. “As a result of cost-saving pressures from the private company, the state has had to step in and either take over or provide additional services at the state’s expense.”</p>
<p>As an example, the report cites the state’s decision to take over health care at Fluvanna and, more recently, provide COVID-19 testing at Armor-managed facilities. “In fact, we believe it would have been more efficient if we had run the facilities ourselves to start with as we faced these challenges.”</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the Department of Corrections, Lisa Kinney, says the department does not anticipate the change would cost the state any additional money.</p>
<p>Armor, meanwhile, has argued that DOC lacks the expertise to take over inmate health care, suggesting the plans would significantly increase costs. Over the summer, the company refused to meet with DOC officials to discuss what was intended to be a gradual transition away from Armor over one to two years. Instead, the company embarked on a lobbying campaign directed at the General Assembly, Gov. Ralph Northam’s administration and the campaigns of Democrat Terry McAuliffe and Republican Glenn Youngkin.</p>
<p>In an August letter, Campo said the earliest he was willing to meet was in December. “As you are no doubt aware there appears to be a great deal of concern and uncertainty about the financial viability of DOC’s decision to bring in-house Virginia’s correctional health care,” he wrote.</p>
<p>In September, a DOC director, Dean Ricks, wrote the company urging Campo to reconsider his refusal to meet.</p>
<p>“Your refusal to cooperate is making it more difficult for us to ensure that inmates are being appropriately treated,” Ricks wrote. “Our goal has always been to provide constitutionally mandated health care to the inmates in our custody, but your actions are making this increasingly difficult.”</p>
<p>The next month, DOC officials informed Armor that it was <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/virginia-moves-to-immediately-sever-ties-with-prison-health-care-contractor-the-relationship-has-degraded-significantly/" target="_blank">terminating the company’s contract</a>, telling House and Senate budget leaders that “the relationship and correspondence with the vendor has degraded significantly.” Campo fired back calling the decision reckless and “consistent with a well-documented pattern of mismanagement.”</p>
<p>The state has already replaced Armor with another prison health care vendor, VitalCore Health Strategies, and corrections officials say the terms of the contract are nearly identical to Armor’s, though they concede they agreed to pay $500,000 in startup costs and forgo penalties for understaffing during the transition.</p>
<p>Armor calls it “a sweetheart deal” in a protest the company’s lawyers filed with the state. The filing seeks to overturn the emergency contract, contending that it was not a proper emergency procurement because DOC created the emergency circumstances itself when it fired Armor. It also argues that there can’t be an emergency because Armor is ready and available to continue working in DOC facilities.</p>
<p>As for the fines for understaffing, which the company announced earlier this year it would cease paying, Armor has said the pandemic made staffing more difficult, noting DOC has faced <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/virginia-department-of-corrections-chief-paints-dire-picture-of-prison-staffing/" target="_blank">its own staffing shortages</a>.</p>
<p>In a statement through the company’s lobbying firm, McGuireWoods, Campo argued a review comparing Armor’s performance to state-managed prison infirmaries would show Armor is “the best provider.”</p>
<p>“Armor believes this decision should not be made by an outgoing administration and has requested multiple times it be made by the incoming administration,” Campo wrote. “We believe that a fair and independent analysis and review should be performed and any recommendation be reviewed accordingly.”</p>
<p>The company has found at least one high-profile ally in Del. Luke Torian, D-Prince William, who will lose his position as House Appropriations chairman under the new GOP majority. Torian has questioned DOC’s plans in two letters to Northam’s administration. The most recent, sent last week, echoes Armor’s calls for delay.</p>
<p>“I respectfully request that DOC suspend its current activities regarding correctional health care until a comprehensive review is undertaken and provided to the General Assembly and the incoming administration,” wrote Torian, who declined multiple requests for comment.</p>
<p>The letter came after Armor donated $25,000 to the Virginia Legislative Black Caucus, to which Torian is the largest single donor.</p>
<p>Campo said in a statement there is nothing unusual about its donations to the Black Caucus or its decision to approach the gubernatorial campaigns of McAuliffe and Youngkin.</p>
<p>Of the donation, he said, “Armor has a long history of supporting political groups and individuals that seek efficiency and effectiveness in government.”</p>
<p>And on the gubernatorial candidates, he reiterated that “both expressed concern about the decision DOC was attempting to make” and believes either administration “would intervene to assess this decision further.”</p>
<p>Gov.-elect Youngkin’s press office did not respond to an email seeking comment, but a spokesman for McAuliffe, Jake Rubenstein, called the company’s description of the meeting in its email to DOC false. He said that the campaign was made aware of Armor’s email during the campaign and approached the company’s lobbyist to make clear that there was no agreement to overrule Clarke, who has served under three governors, including McAuliffe.</p>
<p>Rubenstein said any promise by a candidate to intervene in the issue would have been completely inappropriate.</p>
<p>Gov. Ralph Northam’s administration has also expressed concern about the company’s tactics. Secretary of Public Safety Brian Moran called the company’s decision to involve the two gubernatorial campaigns distressing.</p>
<p>“The provision of adequate health care for our inmates should not be politicized,” he said. “From our point of view, this is about inmate health care &#8212; quality and affordable health care.”</p>

<p>State officials floated the idea, which calls for cyclists to dismount upon entering the area, as part of plans to convert the street into a permanent “promenade/bus way.”</p>
<p>“This is a critical connection in the city’s bike network,” said Planning Commissioner Max Hepp-Buchanan, who called Bank Street the only safe east-west route for bikes through downtown Richmond and noted city bike lanes feed into the street on either side of the Capitol.</p>
<p>The road also offers connections to the Capitol Trail, a bike and pedestrian path between Richmond and Williamsburg, and is designated as <a href="https://www.virginiadot.org/programs/bikeped/us_bike_routes.asp" target="_blank">an official U.S. bike route</a>.</p>
<p>The Virginia Department of General Services <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Presentation_Bank-Street-Enhancements.pdf" target="_blank">presented the plan</a> earlier this week to the commission, which is reviewing a local ordinance that would permanently transfer city ownership of the street to the state.</p>
<p>Multiple members wondered why the city hadn’t negotiated an easement guaranteeing pedestrian and bicycle access. City administrators said it was not a condition they pursued but that they trusted the state to maintain access to the area.</p>
<p>A representative of the Virginia Attorney General&#8217;s Office, meanwhile, gently reminded the commission that they had no say in the matter because the General Assembly passed legislation requiring the city to give the street to the state.</p>
<p>Department of General Services Director Joe Damico defended the proposed dismount area as a sensible safety measure, noting that he had occasionally seen near collisions between bicycles and pedestrians in the area.</p>
<p>Currently the state, which closed the street to car traffic at the end of 2017, provides no bicycle route, forcing riders passing through the area onto a narrow sidewalk shared with a small hotel and the staff entrance to the temporary General Assembly Building.</p>
<p>The new plan would create a five-foot wide “dismount bike path” alongside the sidewalk on which cyclists would be expected to walk their bikes through the area.</p>
<p>“I believe it is a responsible decision by DGS to identify the space as a dismount and walk area,” he said. “It’s a very short distance.”</p>
<p>Planning Commission Member Vik Murthy worried few riders would dismount, leading to unnecessary confrontations with Capitol Police. “They’re not going to do it, then you’re going to have police tackling them,” he said.</p>
<p>Hepp-Buchanan suggested the state consider a 10-foot-wide path with no requirement to dismount &#8212; an approach he said would be in keeping with accepted design standards for bike lanes.</p>
<p>Daminco said he’d keep working with the city. “We have a ways to go on this particular vision,” he said. “There’s time to continue discussion on this space.”</p>

<p>A <a href="http://jlarc.virginia.gov/pdfs/reports/Rpt555.pdf" target="_blank">report</a> <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/11/08/scathing-audit-faults-poor-management-for-virginias-unemployment-insurance-failures/" target="_blank">released last week</a> notes that Virginia’s recipiency rate, a metric used by the federal government to track uptake of benefits, has dropped to the third lowest in the country at just 16 percent.</p>
<p>That might be because the benefits the program offers are so low they don’t cover basic food, housing and transportation costs, the review, conducted by the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission, suggested.</p>
<p>The state’s maximum weekly benefit is capped at $378 and can be as low as $60, depending on how much money a person was earning before they lost their jobs.</p>
<p>The upper limit was last increased in 2008 and the lower limit was last increased in 2014, when lawmakers increased it from $54.</p>

<p>“Virginia does not regularly increase UI benefit amounts, which is a primary reason its UI benefits are lower than other states,” the report states.</p>
<p>The legislative analysts suggested that if the General Assembly wanted to do something about that, they could follow lead of the 35 states that have indexed their benefits to economic metrics.</p>
<p>They calculated that indexing maximum benefits to 50 percent of average weekly wages &#8212; the level of support the program has historically aimed to provide &#8212; the maximum weekly benefit would rise from $378 to $682 and keep rising each year as wages change.</p>
<p>For a more gradual increase, they suggested the state could tie benefits to the annual percentage increase in average weekly wages, which sits at about 3 percent.</p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>Newly empowered Republicans in Virginia say plans to allow retail sales of recreational marijuana won’t necessarily be doomed under their control of the House of Delegates and Executive Mansion.</p>
<p>And some say they’re open <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/08/17/virginia-lawmakers-already-discussing-speeding-up-retail-marijuana-sales/" target="_blank">to speeding up the timeline</a> for allowing retail sales, which is currently <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/04/07/marijuana-will-be-legal-in-virginia-on-july-1-heres-what-is-and-isnt-permitted-under-the-new-law/" target="_blank">delayed until 2024</a>.</p>
<p>“You almost kind of have to,” said Del. Glenn Davis, R-Virginia Beach, calling the current state of the law, in which possession and cultivation of small amounts of marijuana is legal but buying and selling the products is not, has created a quagmire that the party can’t ignore. “I guess we’re kind of half pregnant.”</p>
<p>Davis’ comments echoed House Leader Todd Gilbert’s statements on the subject last week, when he told reporters that GOP members in the House would have no choice but to work with Democrats in the Senate to address the half-finished legislation, which he likened to a “live grenade rolling around.”</p>
<p>“We need to fix it or all we have is a black market,” he said.</p>
<p>Republicans have made it clear, though, that one thing that&#8217;s unlikely to find favor among their members are social equity provisions, which Democrats who championed the legislation earlier this year called a driving force behind their bill but failed to finalize before the end of the legislative session.</p>
<p>The proposals under discussion generally aimed to set aside a class of marijuana business licenses for Black Virginians, who during prohibition were three times more likely to face arrest for simple possession than their White counterparts despite studies showing both groups used the drug at roughly the same rate. Because a law that divvied up licenses explicitly by race would likely face a challenge on constitutional grounds, Democrats were considering a criteria that opened them to people with past marijuana convictions, their family members, or graduates of a Virginia historically Black college or university.</p>
<p>The legislation also proposed an incubator program to help finance startups and a reinvestment fund that would send a portion of tax revenues back to neighborhoods subject to disproportionate enforcement.</p>
<p>During debate on the legislation last year, several Republicans said they would have been inclined to vote for legalization, but could not support a bill that prioritized people with marijuana convictions on their records for business licenses.</p>
<p>“I don’t know if I’d call it an equity program. I’d call it a give-a-criminal-a-company program,” said Davis, who a year earlier had voted to reduce the penalty for simple possession from a misdemeanor punishable by jail time to a $25 civil infraction. He said it would send the wrong message to kids to reward people who broke the law.</p>
<p>Democrats also planned to include pro-union language aimed at making it easier for marijuana industry employees to organize that drew GOP criticism.</p>
<p>Gilbert did not address specifics last week and his spokesman, Garren Shipley, did not return phone calls and messages seeking additional comment. But he has made clear he expects the legislation to look different next year. “I imagine the roadmap that they laid out as to how that would occur … is going to change dramatically,” Gilbert said.</p>
<p>It’s less certain how Republicans would handle criminal justice elements of the law. For instance, Democrats said they ran out of time to include language that would allow <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/04/23/virginia-legalized-it-but-people-in-prison-on-marijuana-charges-will-stay-there-under-new-law/" target="_blank">resentencing hearings</a> for people currently serving jail and prison time on serious marijuana offenses.</p>
<p>Legalization advocates like Chelsea Higgs Wise, who founded the group Marijuana Justice, urged Democrats to shift their focus on equity from focusing on business licenses to criminal justice reforms, which she said could present an area of bi-partisan agreement. “No one should be in prison just for marijuana and I think some of our Republican lawmakers might be able to have that conversation,” she said.</p>
<p>Gov.-elect Glenn Youngkin, meanwhile, said in a tweet during the campaign that he would not seek to repeal marijuana legalization. In a statement at the time, campaign spokesman Matt Wolking added that Youngkin “suspects that revenue projections from legalization are way overstated, as they have shown to be in other states. With legalization, real emphasis must be placed on ensuring minors do not use this drug or have access to it.”</p>
<p>His incoming administration has so far declined to say anything else on the subject, responding with a verbatim copy of the July tweet and statement when asked Wednesday if Youngkin has any additional thoughts on the issue.</p>
<p>Democrats have already been debating whether to speed up the timeline for retail sales, worrying that the decision to end criminal penalties for possession without creating a legal way to buy the drug is empowering the black market.</p>
<p>Lawmakers set a 2024 date for retail sales because they said they wanted to give ample time to establish the new Cannabis Control Authority and write regulations that will govern the industry.</p>
<p>An interim option &#8212; allowing the currently existing medical dispensaries to begin retail sales as a stop-gap measure &#8212; was rejected by lawmakers who worried it would undermine the planned social equity programs by giving the medical companies an unfair head start.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unlikely GOP lawmakers would share that concern given their general opposition to equity programs. And on the Democratic side, some lawmakers are holding out hope they can do both.</p>
<p>At a meeting of the General Assembly’s Cannabis Oversight Commission on Wednesday afternoon, a representative of Jushi, a multi-state cannabis business holds the medical license to sell the drug in Northern Virginia, told lawmakers the industry has the capacity to sell to medical and recreational customers. Discussions have included proposals that would require medical producers to serve as incubators for future social-equity licensees.</p>
<p>“Our view is essentially that you could start the adult use market on July 1 if it was the will of the General Assembly,” said Alexander Macaulay, a lobbyist for the company.</p>
<p>Virginia NORML, which has been advocating for legalization for decades, also supports allowing medical dispensaries to sell to recreational customers. The organization’s director, Jenn Michelle Pedini, said most other states that have legalized marijuana have taken a similar approach. “The question is how long do we want to maintain this in-between phase, which disadvantages consumers and encourages the illicit market,” Pedini said, saying NORML’s members are “frustrated we have operational dispensaries in the state but unless they have a medical certificate, they cannot shop there.”</p>
<p>Democrats, who still control the commission, are weighing the issue. But the chair of the subcommittee tasked with exploring options, Del. Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, acknowledged he’s ultimately unlikely to have much say in the decision and began referring to the sole Republican assigned, Del. Will Morefield, R-Tazewell, as the future chair.</p>
<p>Morefield said that while House Republicans have yet to establish a policy on the issue, but said he is personally open to allowing the dispensaries to sell to recreational customers.</p>
<p>“Absolutely,” he said. “I think this is something we are venturing into that we’ve never ventured into before. … We’ve got to fix it and we’ve got to get it right. For us just to say no, we’re not willing to work with one another to make this right would be irresponsible. It’s not the Virginia way.”</p>

(Ned Oliver/ Virginia Mercury)</p><p>Virginia’s <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/10/30/virginia-ranks-worst-in-nation-for-quickly-reviewing-unemployment-claims/" target="_blank">failure to deliver unemployment benefits</a> in a timely manner left thousands of jobless Virginians waiting months for aid during the pandemic.</p>
<p>Now, <a href="http://jlarc.virginia.gov/pdfs/reports/Rpt555.pdf" target="_blank">a scathing audit</a> says much of the blame lies with poor management coupled with limited oversight by Gov. Ralph Northam’s administration.</p>
<p>“It’s clear that additional oversight and assistance is needed,” Lauren Axselle, a legislative analyst with the General Assembly’s Joint Legislative Audit Review Commission, told lawmakers Monday, recommending the legislature expand its role rather than rely on the executive branch and the U.S. Department of Labor.</p>
<p>Throughout the pandemic, the Virginia Employment Commission, which administers the program, and Northam’s administration, which oversees the agency and appoints its leadership, downplayed widespread problems or blamed external factors outside their control.</p>
<p>Instead, the report —  based on extensive interviews with experts, agency staff and employees — describes a perfect storm of more than a decade of poor management colliding with an unprecedented pandemic.</p>
<p>A massive IT upgrade was eight years behind schedule. The agency was understaffed to meet even pre-pandemic workloads. The staff the agency did have was less effective because many were dedicated to tasks that modern computers long ago made obsolete, like mailing forms and letters and manual data entry.</p>
<p>“We are so heavily reliant on paper … We have paper in every nook and cranny,” the report quotes one unnamed employee saying.</p>
<p>That led state officials overseeing the program to conclude that they were being underfunded by the federal government at the same time as they were receiving more per-claim than most other states.</p>
<p>And in either case, the report says, management and administration officials took no serious steps to increase staffing until more than a year into the pandemic. And the report says Northam’s administration blocked some early steps explored by the agency.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="dd6vKeLBUb"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2021/09/20/in-numbers-virginias-struggle-to-distribute-unemployment-benefits/">In numbers: Virginia’s struggle to distribute unemployment benefits</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Among other things, the report says Northam’s cabinet did not grant an early request to set aside state hiring requirements to fill positions faster. That meant, for example, that part-time employees the agency wanted to move quickly into full-time roles had to first reapply for the position. An effort to bring in state employees from other agencies to help was limited to a voluntary request that drew no takers, the report says.</p>
<p>The agency didn’t undertake serious steps to bring in outside help until more than a year into the pandemic, when hundreds of contract-adjudication staffers were finally hired. Meanwhile, the backlog of claims had grown to nearly 100,000.</p>
<p>“Given VEC’s critical role during severe increases in unemployment — and the operational challenges that arise from them — future secretaries of labor must effectively fulfill their role to ensure the agency is performing adequately,” the report states.</p>
<p>In some instances, it wasn’t clear that VEC leadership was aware of the extent of the problem, noting that monthly performance reports delivered to Commissioner Ellen Marie Hess did not &#8220;include information about UI claim quality or timeliness or call center responsiveness.”</p>
<p>The report also observes that a hands-off management style meant many departments, including the call centers where fewer than 3 percent of calls were actually being answered, were not subject to performance expectations or goals. The report notes the agency also has no internal performance goals for fraud investigations.</p>
<p>The auditors suggested future governors should take a more decisive, hands-on role. And they suggested the legislature create its own subcommittee dedicated to overseeing the program and making sure reforms are implemented.</p>
<p>Neither Hess nor Northam’s secretary of labor, Megan Healy, attended Monday’s presentation. Auditors told lawmakers that they had been advised not to participate due to pending litigation surrounding the long delays for benefits.</p>
<p>In statements and letters, Hess continued to defend the agency and did not address any potential management failings.</p>
<p>“I appreciate your recognition of the extremely dedicated public servants of the Virginia Employment Commission and the enormous volume of work that they produced in response to the COVID-19 pandemic,” Hess wrote.</p>
<p>Healy wrote in a two-paragraph letter that she looks forward to “collaborating on the implementation of your recommendations, the protection of Virginia’s workers, and the reform of this long-neglected but incredibly important system.”</p>
<p>In a statement, she thanked the legislature for the report and emphasized signs of improvement in recent months. “Call times are down to less than two minutes and adjudications are now back to pre-pandemic wait times. VEC’s new IT system will be live next week, and we will continue to work on the backlog of appeals.&#8221;</p>

Ralph Northam last month  at the Executive Mansion. (Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>A friendly meeting between the governor and the governor elect. A preview of the new House majority’s agenda. Promises to refocus the attorney general’s office on law enforcement.</p>
<p>The transition of power from Democrats to Republicans in Richmond began in earnest Thursday after the GOP’s electoral sweep earlier this week, which handed the party control of all three statewide offices and the House of Delegates after two years of unified Democratic control.</p>
<p>At the Executive Mansion, Gov.-elect Glenn Youngkin and Gov. Ralph Northam dined on beef tenderloin together before emerging to address the press, promising a smooth transition between administrations.</p>
<p>“I just want to thank you for the incredibly cooperative way that you’ve expressed you’re going to help us,” Youngkin said, calling the meeting the beginning of a friendship. “It’s important. We have a lot of work to do.”</p>
<p>Youngkin also promised to be “incredibly open and accessible,” though neither he nor Northam took questions at the event.</p>
<p>Republicans say that behind the scenes, GOP leaders in the House are beginning to work with Youngkin to develop an agenda that might have a chance in the Senate, where Democrats still hold a one-seat majority.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Education</h4>

	
<p>During a morning news conference, top House Republican Todd Gilbert, R-Shenandoah, promised a laser focus on education &#8212; an issue that became a focus for the GOP in the final days of the race amid a nationwide debate over equity initiatives and how race is discussed and taught in schools.</p>
<p>“We have seen the education issue resonate so thoroughly and completely with Virginians this year because of what their children have been through,” Gilbert said. “And it started with the pandemic and it progressed through our realization that there was really a movement afoot … to put excellence to the side in favor of so-called equity.”</p>
<p>Gilbert also promised to revisit legislation passed by Democrats that ended requirements that certain crimes on school property be reported to police &#8212; a change aimed at reducing the number of students who graduate with criminal records but which drew a backlash after <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/in-case-at-center-of-political-firestorm-judge-finds-teen-committed-sexual-assault-in-virginia-school-bathroom/2021/10/25/42c037da-35cc-11ec-8be3-e14aaacfa8ac_story.html" target="_blank">a sexual assault in a Loudoun County bathroom</a> (though by all accounts, school officials did report that case to police and criminal charges were lodged against the teenager).</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Climate change</h4>

	
<p>Gilbert said another top focus for the House would be rolling back climate change legislation passed by Democrats, which mandates the closure of all coal-fired power plants by 2024 and requires the state’s electric utilities go entirely carbon free by 2050.</p>
<p>He called the legislation, which state regulators at one point estimated would eventually add $800 a year to the average family’s electric bill, too expensive.</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s a so-called green measure that really made life a lot more expensive for everybody by taking away access to fossil fuels and incentivizing things that aren&#8217;t proven to be a complete picture of our energy sector,” he said. “Things like solar and wind that may complement that but shouldn&#8217;t form the core of generating the energy we need to run a large economy like Virginia&#8217;s economy.”</p>

    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Voting</h4>

	
<p>Gilbert was silent on most of the new voting laws Democrats passed, which opened a month-long early voting window, created no excuse absentee balloting and mandated drop boxes for them in every county.</p>
<p>But he said the party is intent on reinstating a requirement that all voters show identification at the polls.</p>
<p>“That&#8217;s something that I think universally people think is a good idea &#8212; that you should be able to prove who you are before you do something as important as voting. But other than that, those matters &#8230; have not been on our lips,” he said.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Abortion</h4>

	
<p>Gilbert pushed back in response to questions about whether the party would pursue legislation limiting abortion. When Democrats were in power, they struck GOP laws that created a mandatory 24-hour waiting period and required a woman undergo an ultrasound.</p>
<p>“You didn’t hear our caucus running on those things,” he said. “We’re going to stay focused on the things we believe the majority of Virginians want us to focus on.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Law enforcement</h4>

	
<p>Finally, Attorney General-elect Jason Miyares, who currently serves as a GOP delegate, said he intends to make law enforcement a focus of his four years in office &#8212; a major shift for a department that is primarily tasked with advising and representing state agencies and boards and defending state officials and laws in civil court.</p>
<p>Flanked by sheriffs from Loudoun, Prince William and Chesterfield counties during a press conference to announce his transition team, he said one of his top priorities will be passing legislation that would allow his office to intervene in local cases if police disagree with how prosecutors are handling them &#8212; a proposal he said is inspired by dissatisfaction with plea deals he considers too lenient.</p>
<p>“It would essentially say that if a chief law enforcement officer in a jurisdiction, either chief of police or the sheriff, makes a request because a commonwealth attorney is not doing their job, I’m going to do their job for them,” Miyares said. “And I’m thinking specifically of some of the so-called social justice commonwealth’s attorneys <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/07/20/11-commonwealths-attorneys-form-group-to-back-criminal-justice-reform/" target="_blank">elected in Northern Virginia</a>.”</p>

<p>And on Wednesday morning, the two men, Sen. Chap Petersen, D-Fairfax City, and Sen. Joe Morrissey, D-Richmond, appeared to be delighting in a sudden surge of interest in their policy ideas and positions.</p>
<p>“It’s a new day,” said Morrissey, a pro-life Democrat who said Texas-style abortion legislation goes too far but declined to say what changes to Virginia law he might be inclined to support. “I am a very strong proponent of the right to life. That’s as far as I’m going to go. Folks can read into it what they want; I will carefully consider any and all legislation.”</p>
<p>Petersen, who joined with Morrissey and Republicans earlier this year to make school reopening a focus of the legislative session, meanwhile, continued to criticize restrictions on after school activities and mask mandates that Democrats have generally supported — a subject of many passionate floor speeches he delivered over the past year.</p>
<p>“Once we go back into session it will have been two years since the pandemic began,” Petersen said. “I think we’re getting to the point where we need to move on and get on with our lives.”</p>
<p>The comparisons to moderate Democratic holdouts in Washington, Arizona’s Sen. Kristen Sinema and West Virginia’s Joe Manchin, were instantaneous.</p>
<p>“If you want to know what the Virginia Senate is going to look like next year, imagine the U.S. Senate with more than one Joe Manchin,” said Stephen Farnsworth, a political scientist at the University of Mary Washington.</p>

<p>Democrats were still holding out hope Wednesday that Republicans might not win an outright majority in the House, noting that absentee ballots were still being counted in several races where the GOP was leading by a few hundred votes. But Republicans, who appear to have flipped seven Democratic seats for a 52-48 majority, said they were confident the results would hold and busied themselves with discussion about who would serve as the next House speaker.</p>
<p>With Republican Glenn Youngkin in the governor’s office and former GOP Del. Winsome Sears presiding over the Senate as lieutenant governor and casting tie-breaking votes, Democrats will not be able to spare a single vote in the chamber  — where they hold a 21-19 advantage — if they hope to block GOP-sponsored bills.</p>
<p>Democratic leaders in the Senate will be aided by the fact that they will continue to retain control of key levers of power in the chamber &#8212; namely the authority to set the agenda through control of committees and daily floor calendars.</p>
<p>That means no Democrats will have free rein to cross caucus priorities. But there’s also no guarantee leadership will be able to bottle up GOP bills if one or more Democrats breaks ranks, said Bob Holsworth, a longtime political observer in Richmond. “There are ways of getting things out of committee,” he said. “My guess is that this isn’t going to be the easiest thing in the world.”</p>
<p>He called the comparisons to Sinema and Manchin “absolutely real.”</p>
<p>Petersen and Morrissey aren’t the only Democrats in the Senate with contrarian streaks, but they do stand out for the frequency with which they break with their party and the impassioned speeches that typically accompany their dissent. Both have also demonstrated a willingness to withhold their votes for key Democratic priorities in exchange for legislative concessions in other areas.</p>
<p>An <a href="https://www.vpap.org/legislators/25231-chap-petersen/list-votes/caucus_party/?session=30&amp;with=false" target="_blank">analysis</a> by the Virginia Public Access Project found that during the 2021 legislative session, Petersen sided with his caucus in just 67 percent of votes &#8212; less than any other member. His more notable dissents included opposition to legislation legalizing marijuana and budget language that have limited evictions during the pandemic.</p>
<figure id="attachment_15773" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:1920px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/chap-petersen-1.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-15773" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/chap-petersen-1.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1280" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/chap-petersen-1.jpg 1920w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/chap-petersen-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/chap-petersen-1-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/chap-petersen-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/chap-petersen-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/chap-petersen-1-696x464.jpg 696w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/chap-petersen-1-1068x712.jpg 1068w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/chap-petersen-1-630x420.jpg 630w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Sen. Chap Petersen, D-Fairfax City, speaks on the Senate floor last year. (Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p>Morrissey, who is moderate on some social issues but displayed a progressive streak in legislative areas like criminal justice reform, sided with his caucus 79 percent of the time in 2021, according to VPAP. Some of the more prominent bills he sided with Republicans on included legislation that aimed to bar the state health department from operating a sex-ed hotline for children and legislation that repealed a prohibition on certain health insurance plans covering abortion.</p>
<p>Every other Democrat in the chamber except for Sen. Creigh Deeds, D-Bath, whose splits with his caucus have generally come in lower-profile votes, voted with fellow Democrats 84 percent of the time or more.</p>
<p>Other Democrats in the chamber pushed back on the idea that the Senate wouldn’t be able to withstand GOP pressure. Sen. Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, noted that Democrats&#8217; biggest internal debates were over policies that pushed the state to the left. He predicted it would be easier to unify Democrats in the chamber against GOP proposals that would move the state to the right.</p>
<p>“I think in an environment where we’re the last bulwark against Virginia returning to inequitable policies, I think that’s a very different vote than some of these votes that are getting criticized,” said Surovell, who says he’s envisioning an “Alamo strategy” for the chamber.</p>
<p>At the same time, Petersen and Morrissey were already thinking Wednesday about areas in which they might be able to collaborate with Republicans.</p>
<p>On schools, Petersen said he’d heard from parents upset about mask requirements. “I talked to parents who have kids in drama programs — they still have to wear masks on stage,” he said. “I guess if I was to summarize things I want to see in the next couple years — maybe we focus on a little more joy, having fun, being outside and letting kids enjoy themselves.”</p>
<p>Petersen also voiced support for offering a bigger standard deduction on the state income tax, which he framed as a good Democratic issue because it cuts taxes for working people that also potentially aligns with Youngkin’s campaign promise to <a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/youngkin-bets-race-on-tax-policy-but-do-the-numbers-add-up/article_efc63f04-8421-5b38-b23a-2779c5ea0b6f.html" target="_blank">double the standard deduction</a> for individuals.</p>
<p>And he suggested Dominion Energy’s decision to back Democrats over Republicans in the governor’s race might open the door to his longtime goal of banning political donations from publicly regulated electric utilities — which in the past has been a nonstarter for a majority of members in both parties.</p>
<figure id="attachment_14228" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:1920px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2020-general-assembly-week-one-9.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-14228" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2020-general-assembly-week-one-9.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1280" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2020-general-assembly-week-one-9.jpg 1920w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2020-general-assembly-week-one-9-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2020-general-assembly-week-one-9-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2020-general-assembly-week-one-9-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2020-general-assembly-week-one-9-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2020-general-assembly-week-one-9-696x464.jpg 696w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2020-general-assembly-week-one-9-1068x712.jpg 1068w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2020-general-assembly-week-one-9-630x420.jpg 630w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Sen. Joe Morrissey, D-Richmond. (Photo by Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p>Morrissey said he sees himself as aligning with the GOP primarily on education and abortion. On the latter, he said he would walk a line between his belief that the government shouldn’t tell women what to do with their bodies and his Catholic faith. (On the subject of telling women what to do with their bodies, he volunteered that he was dismayed that Democratic women had backed a bill to ban <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/how-beachfront-salsa-dancers-almost-derailed-an-anti-prostitution-bill/" target="_blank">so-called happy ending massages</a>, which he said he opposed in solidarity with sex workers. “Do you see the inconsistency?”)</p>
<p>But he said he didn’t want to say too much about his abortion stance yet.</p>
<p>“I’m not going to give anymore away other than saying what I’ve already said,” Morrissey said. “I’m very, very much pro-life. I have always been. From the beginning of life to the end of life. You may have noticed I was author of legislation to ban the death penalty.”</p>

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican Glenn Youngkin narrowly defeated Democrat Terry McAuliffe in Tuesday’s election for governor, a major upset on a night that saw the Virginia GOP make sweeping gains after a nearly decade-long losing streak in statewide elections. Several news outlets <a href="https://www.nbc12.com/2021/11/03/republican-glenn-youngkin-wins-virginia-governor-race-nbc-news-projects/" target="_blank">called the race</a> for <a href="https://twitter.com/AP_Politics/status/1455756348302442499?s=20" target="_blank">Youngkin</a> shortly after 12:30 a.m.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans Winsome Sears and Jason Miyares also held leads over their opponents in the races for lieutenant governor and attorney general and the GOP appeared on pace to take the House of Delegates, where they lost their majority just two years ago, according to preliminary results.  T</span>he GOP <a href="https://www.vpap.org/electionresults/20211102/house/" target="_blank">appears to have captured 52 seats</a>, obliterating Democrats&#8217; 55-45 majority.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin, a Northern Virginia businessman few had heard of a year ago, seized on parents’ various frustrations over K-12 schools, including hyping the incursion of &#8220;critical race theory&#8221; to overtake McAuliffe, a well-connected former governor who sought to win a second term largely by stoking fears about the lingering presence of former President Donald Trump. </span></p>
<p>Speaking to a crowd of supporters at a hotel in Chantilly, Youngkin said his victory is a defining moment in Virginia politics.</p>
<p>&#8220;Together we will change the trajectory of this commonwealth, and friends, we are going to start that transformation on day one,” he said. “Our kids can’t wait. We work in real-people time, not government time.”</p>
<p>Youngkin pledged to invest in education, including promting school choice, and “reestablish excellence in our schools.”</p>
<p>He hit on campaign promises to eliminate the grocery tax, cut taxes on retirement income of Virginia’s veterans and raise salaries for police as well protecting qualified immunity, which critics contend protects law enforcement from consequences of misconduct and abuse.</p>
<p>“This is our Virginia to build together, and we are going to work on day one,” he said. “Together we can build a new day, a new day for Virginia for yes, we soar, and we never settle.”</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The loss for McAuliffe, with gubernatorial-year turnout near record highs in a state President Joe Biden won by 10 percentage points, puts a Republican back in Virginia’s Executive Mansion for the first time since former Gov. Bob McDonnell left office in 2014 and is sure to send shockwaves through national politics, signaling a bleak outlook for Democrats in next year’s congressional midterms.</span></p>
<p>Virginia&#8217;s off-year gubernatorial elections have a long history of going against the party that just won the White House, one exception being McAuliffe&#8217;s 2013 win over Republican Ken Cuccinelli. In some ways, Tuesday&#8217;s result was a return to that pattern, reflecting Biden&#8217;s slipping approval ratings and general voter frustration that allowed Youngkin to pitch himself as a change-minded outsider.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McAuliffe entered the contest with numerous advantages as an experienced state leader known for his prodigious fundraising prowess and a relatively smooth first term as a centrist, pro-business Democrat. <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/06/09/mcauliffes-sweep-beat-expectations-that-were-already-sky-high/" target="_blank">He cruised</a> to a primary victory this summer over several more progressive opponents, including Sen. Jennifer McClellan and former delegate Jennifer Carroll Foy, both of whom stood to make history as the first Black woman elected governor of any state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead, it will be the <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/08/18/who-knew-nixon-was-a-homeboy-a-qa-with-lieutenant-governor-hopeful-winsome-sears/" target="_blank">Jamaican-born Sears</a> making history as the first woman of color to serve in statewide office, defeating Democrat Hala Ayala to become lieutenant governor, a job that mostly involves presiding over the state Senate.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McAuliffe made a brief speech around 10:15 p.m. thanking supporters gathered in a hotel ballroom in Tyson’s Corner. But he did not concede, saying all Virginians’ votes should be counted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve still got a lot of votes to count,” he said.</span></p>
<p>https://twitter.com/TerryMcAuliffe/status/1455725527390621700?s=20</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of McAuliffe’s efforts to portray Youngkin as a Trumpian threat to Virginia didn’t seem to have the desired impact, with many Republican voters shrugging it off and noting Youngkin never campaigned with Trump, despite Democrats’ best efforts to bait the ex-president into make a full-fledged appearance in Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond the question of Trump’s presence, Youngkin was able to parry some of Democrats’ most common attack lines. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When McAuliffe accused Youngkin of being complicit in Trump’s election lies, the Youngkin campaign pointed out McAuliffe has a long history of casting doubt on the 2000 presidential election, which came down to the U.S. Supreme Court and Florida’s infamous hanging chads. As McAuliffe tried to characterize Youngkin as a predatory capitalist over his private equity career with the Carlyle Group, the Democrat had to answer for why invested his own money with Youngkin’s company. When McAuliffe warned Youngkin would bring a Texas-style abortion ban to Virginia, Youngkin said he would not, in fact, support such a sweeping law, but would favor other abortion restrictions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When McAuliffe announced his comeback bid at a Richmond elementary school late last year, he made education the centerpiece of his campaign, promising to invest billions in the state’s K-12 schools, boost teacher pay and tackle racial inequities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it was McAuliffe’s infamous debate-stage remark declaring “I don’t think parents should be telling schools what to teach” that gave Youngkin an opening to go on offense on educational issues, portraying Democrats as out-of-touch with parents upset over shuttered schools, mask and vaccine mandates, sexually explicit reading material and how issues of race and gender should be handled in public schools.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_27286" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:1500px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/mcauliffe-campaign-stop-richmond-3.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-27286" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/mcauliffe-campaign-stop-richmond-3.jpg" alt="" width="1500" height="1000" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/mcauliffe-campaign-stop-richmond-3.jpg 1500w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/mcauliffe-campaign-stop-richmond-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/mcauliffe-campaign-stop-richmond-3-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/mcauliffe-campaign-stop-richmond-3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/mcauliffe-campaign-stop-richmond-3-696x464.jpg 696w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/mcauliffe-campaign-stop-richmond-3-1068x712.jpg 1068w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/mcauliffe-campaign-stop-richmond-3-630x420.jpg 630w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Terry McAuliffe campaigns for governor in Richmond. (Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McAuliffe and his allies were mostly dismissive of those topics, portraying pushback at local school board meetings as manufactured, right-wing outrage not worthy of engagement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But a story of a mishandled sexual assault case in the Loudoun County Public Schools, which came during consideration of a transgender-inclusive bathroom policy but appeared to have no direct connection to that policy, was on the minds of many Republican voters after getting widespread coverage in conservative media outlets. Youngkin battled McAuliffe to a surprisingly split result in Loudoun, a once swingy county in the D.C. exurbs Biden won by 25 points last year but shifted sharply in Republicans’ favor.</span></p>
<p>At the McAuliffe watch party, House Speaker Eileen Filler-Corn, D-Fairfax, struck an upbeat tone as her majority hung in the balance, saying she was confident her members ran issues-based campaigns highlighting the impact Democratic majorities have had on Virginians&#8217; lives.</p>
<p>&#8220;Virginians care about the issues that we ran on,&#8221; Filler-Corn said. &#8220;Viginians care about the accomplishments that we&#8217;ve made.&#8221;</p>
<p>Asked whether she feels Democrats were outflanked on education, she said she saw &#8220;deception and misinformation&#8221; from Republicans on school issues.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve seen that play out before,&#8221; she said. &#8220;And I&#8217;m afraid we&#8217;ll see that in the future.&#8221;</p>
<p>At a polling place in Richmond steps from the pedestal where a statue of Confederate President Jefferson Davis once stood on Monument Avenue, voter Randy Lynch keenly recalled the 2020 summer protests centered around Monument Avenue’s statues to Confederate figures, including Davis and Robert E. Lee, all of which have since been removed.</p>
<p>He said he was disturbed that Youngkin campaigned against the supposed teaching of critical race theory, a doctrine that systemic racism has always pervaded U.S. institutions. Though public school districts across the state insist they do not teach it, the term has become a conservative catch-all for controversial equity and anti-racism initiatives.</p>
<p>“It’s a dog whistle, an issue in disguise, where people say things without actually saying them,” Lynch said. “They’re preying on people’s fear and their resistance to change.”</p>
<p>Lauren Burke, a former aide to Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax who attended the Democratic watch party, said she felt the party failed to come up with an effective Black voter strategy beyond bringing in high-profile Black politicians into the state.</p>
<p>If the House were to flip to GOP control, she said, the state Senate, where Democrats are set to have a 21-19 advantage with Sears breaking ties, will become key to state policymaking. A few moderate Democrats, Burke said, will wield enormous power over the legislative agenda.</p>
<p>&#8220;Senator Joe Morrissey and Senator Lynwood Lewis and Senator Chap Petersen will become the Joe Manchins of the Virginia state Senate,&#8221; Burke said. &#8220;There&#8217;s absolutely no doubt about that.&#8221;</p>

    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">GOP takes the House </h4>

	
<p>The House of Delegates<a href="https://www.vpap.org/electionresults/20211102/house/" target="_blank"> appeared to be headed</a> back into the hands of Republicans, who exceeded their expectations for an election in which they had privately said they would consider any flipped seats a victory. Likewise, the Democrats’ losses were far worse than the two- to three- seat hit many in the party had anticipated “on a bad night.”</p>
<p>Most of Republican’s gains came in seats they lost amid successive blue waves in 2017 and 2019 during Trump’s presidency.</p>
<p>Jason Ballard, a lawyer making his first run for office, beat Del. Chris Hurst, D-Christiansburg, a former television news anchor who for four years was the only Democrat in the House south of Roanoke. Tara Durant, an elementary school teacher, won the Fredericksburg-anchored seat represented by Democratic Del. Josh Cole, who was among the more progressive members of the House. And in Virginia Beach, Tim Anderson, an activist GOP lawyer, beat freshman Democrat Nancy Guy, herself a retired lawyer.</p>
<figure id="attachment_29327" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:1200px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1102_elections_05.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-29327" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1102_elections_05.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="800" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1102_elections_05.jpg 1200w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1102_elections_05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1102_elections_05-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1102_elections_05-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Victoria Chang-Holt casts her ballot in Chesterfield County, Va., November 2, 2021. (Parker Michels-Boyce for the Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p>One of the more surprising upsets of the night came in Hampton Roads, where Del. Martha Mugler, D-Hampton, lost to Republican A.C. Cordoza in a district where Republicans spent just $50,000 to the $600,000 raised by Democrats.</p>
<p>In addition to reclaiming lost ground, Republicans also picked up a seat long held by Democrats in Southside Virginia, where Del. Roslyn Tyler, D-Sussex, lost to pharmacist Otto Wachsmann. Del. Lashrecse Aird, D-Petersburg, <a href="https://www.vpap.org/electionresults/20211102/house-district-63/" target="_blank">also appears to have lost</a> to Republican Kim Taylor and Del. Alex Askew, D-Virginia Beach, appears <a href="https://www.wavy.com/news/your-local-election-hq/askew-and-greenhalgh-go-head-to-head-for-virginia-beach-house-of-delegates-seat/" target="_blank">to have narrowly lost</a> to Republican Karen Greenhalgh.</p>
<p>Turnout was strong around the state, but Republicans professed far more enthusiasm than Democrats as they made their way into the polls.<br />
In Waverly, Tim Johnson, a machinist, and Heather Powell, a waitress, said they were thankful for the GOP’s focus on education and barring “inappropriate materials” from schools, which they said had inspired them to review the library books their high-school aged daughter had checked out. They said they were dismayed to find profanity and graphic material.</p>
<p>“I had no idea to look,” Powell said.</p>
<p>Johnson called the issue their “biggest concern.”</p>
<p>Some Democrats, meanwhile, said they struggled to muster the enthusiasm to vote. Veronica Cochran, who works from home as a customer support agent, said she was disappointed Biden hadn’t accomplished more and was mostly unfamiliar with the party’s legislative achievements at the state level over the past two years.</p>
<p>“Us Democrats got to tighten up,” she said. “I don’t know what we’re fighting for.”</p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><em>As the race for governor comes to a close, here’s a look back at the stances Democrat Terry McAuliffe and Republican Glenn Youngkin have staked out on major policy issues.</em></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Education</h4>

	
<p>Public education has become the dominant issue of Virginia’s gubernatorial race. But in the last weeks of the campaign, both candidates have focused less on <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/10/12/virginia-lags-many-states-in-state-education-funding-analysis-says/" target="_blank">funding formulas</a> and <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/06/04/federal-funding-restrictions-could-force-schools-to-spend-millions-improving-buildings-that-should-be-replaced/" target="_blank">school construction</a> — some of the most pressing needs facing schools across the commonwealth — and more on <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/beloved-book-virginia-youngkin-mcauliffe/2021/10/25/e6157830-35d3-11ec-91dc-551d44733e2d_story.html" target="_blank">controversial literature</a> and other cultural flashpoints.</p>
<p>First, the basics. At the start of his campaign, McAuliffe released a <a href="https://terrymcauliffe.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1.29.21-FINAL-Education-Plan-1.pdf" target="_blank">six-page plan</a> pledging “the largest increase in education investment in the history of Virginia.” He’s promised more funding to raise teacher salaries above the national average, expand access to preschool and fully adopt the Standards of Quality recommended by the Virginia Board of Education — guidance for staffing ratios, class size and other school resources.</p>
<p>Youngkin’s <a href="https://www.youngkinforgovernor.com/game-plan" target="_blank">“Day One” plan</a> offers less detail, but he’s committed to building at least 20 charter schools across Virginia to “provide choice” to parents. He’s also called for every school in the state to place a <a href="https://www.youngkinforgovernor.com/post/remarks-by-glenn-youngkin-at-burke-volunteer-fire-rescue-department?utm_medium=email&amp;_hsmi=172801742&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_ml6lIQ4-pvt3YjxAn8B1GaUOFXBQfEIIofvWR_fWHjm-TwO-F3DNHG9tWshu7l1Lc-5ifG28MXA4AXcqCH55Pj_BLREFI49AEiFm6HOKhapz2IZU&amp;utm_content=172801742&amp;utm_source=hs_email" target="_blank">law enforcement officer on campus </a>or lose out on state funding.</p>

<p>It’s Youngkin’s pledge to ban critical race theory, though, that’s become the centerpiece of his campaign. The <a href="https://www.edweek.org/leadership/what-is-critical-race-theory-and-why-is-it-under-attack/2021/05" target="_blank">largely academic</a> concept isn’t part of Virginia’s statewide learning standards, but the term is often used to encompass <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/loudoun-schools-critical-race-theory/2021/06/01/641fbda8-c2ed-11eb-9a8d-f95d7724967c_story.html" target="_blank">broader equity efforts</a> or lessons that focus on historical instances of racism. In Loudoun County, for example, <a href="https://www.loudountimes.com/news/rally-opposing-critical-race-theory-held-in-leesburg/article_9cd04bbe-cbac-11eb-be7a-7b34ad16e9d8.html" target="_blank">one parent complained</a> that his second-grade daughter learned Christopher Columbus enslaved and killed indigenous people. Another example conservatives point to is an “Antiracism 101” seminar hosted on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JELQn3zKklM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Virginia Department of Education’s YouTube page</a> as part of a state equity summit for educators and school administrators, which included a slide titled “interrogating whiteness.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Critical race theory has moved into our school system and we have to remove it,&#8221; Youngkin <a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/aug/10/glenn-youngkin/youngkin-offers-little-proof-critical-race-theory-/" target="_blank">said in August</a>, promising to ban the concept “on day one.” His campaign has promised to “stand up for teachers and parents,” and he’s supported a Loudoun County educator who was suspended after <a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/virginia-supreme-court-upholds-reinstatement-teacher-who-opposes-transgender-policy/2787780/" target="_blank">speaking against</a> the district’s policy requiring that transgender students be addressed by the pronouns they identify with. He has also <a href="https://twitter.com/GlennYoungkin/status/1450880180004732928" target="_blank">pledged</a> to include funding in his budgets for all five of Virginia&#8217;s historically black colleges and universities.</p>
<p>Youngkin has also <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/beloved-book-virginia-youngkin-mcauliffe/2021/10/25/e6157830-35d3-11ec-91dc-551d44733e2d_story.html" target="_blank">criticized McAuliffe</a> for <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/education/wp/2017/03/24/va-governor-vetoes-charter-school-and-beloved-bills/" target="_blank">vetoing a bill in 2017</a> that would have required school districts to notify parents when students are assigned reading materials deemed “sexually explicit.” The legislation originated with opposition to Toni Morrison’s “Beloved” in Fairfax County. McAuliffe responded, “I don’t think parents should be telling schools what they should teach kids.”</p>
<p>McAuliffe has largely dismissed Youngkin’s attacks on critical race theory as racist, describing them as “<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/10/22/virginia-governor-youngkin-education-gop-516625" target="_blank">a dog whistle</a>” in one recent roundtable. And his closing ads have accused Youngkin of “wanting to ban books by prominent Black authors.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Economy, jobs and taxes</h4>

	
<p>Both candidates are pitching themselves as job creators, with McAuliffe touting his record of landing big economic development deals during his first term and Youngkin saying he’ll bring new perspective as someone who just left the business world for politics.</p>
<p>Building on Democrats’ push to make Virginia friendlier to workers as well as executives, McAuliffe says he’ll require employers to offer paid sick days and family medical leave, ideas that have been discussed in the Democratic-led General Assembly but have yet to be broadly implemented. He has also called for speeding up planned increases in the state’s minimum wage, getting it to $15 per hour by 2024. With respect to labor organizing, McAuliffe wants to extend collective bargaining rights to state employees, but he has signaled Virginia’s right-to-work law won’t be repealed if he wins a second term.</p>
<p>Youngkin contends that’s not a sure bet, noting McAuliffe once indicated he would sign right-to-work repeal if it got to his desk.</p>
<figure id="attachment_28560" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="max-width:100%;width:1500px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/texas-inn-5.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-28560" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/texas-inn-5.jpg" alt="" width="1500" height="1000" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/texas-inn-5.jpg 1500w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/texas-inn-5-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/texas-inn-5-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/texas-inn-5-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Tammy Bragg works the grill at the Texas Inn in Lynchburg. (Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p>With little room to attack Virginia’s business climate given the state’s top ranking from CNBC, Youngkin has zeroed in on cost-of-living issues and promises to cut tax bills. He has proposed doubling the standard deduction for state income taxes, one-time tax rebates, restrictions on “runaway property taxes” and eliminating the state’s grocery tax. Youngkin has also campaigned against business shutdowns tied to COVID-19.</p>
<p>Both campaigns have pushed out studies from their political allies claiming their opponents’ fiscal plans are mathematically untenable.</p>
<p>McAuliffe has said Youngkin’s tax policies, including the GOP nominee’s aspirations of eliminating the state income tax altogether, would inevitably blow up the state budget and bring major service cuts. Youngkin has claimed McAuliffe’s ambitious spending plans couldn’t be covered by existing revenues and could lead to tax hikes.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Criminal justice</h4>

	
<p>Youngkin’s campaign has made crime and police central to his general election campaign, arguing Democrats have made the state less safe with a <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/11/11/every-criminal-justice-reform-that-passed-in-virginia-after-george-floyds-death/" target="_blank">slew of criminal justice reforms</a> passed last year.</p>
<p>His campaign cites crime data that shows <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/homicides-in-virginia-hit-highest-levels-in-two-decades/" target="_blank">murders hit a 20-year high</a> last year, though the same data shows the overall crime rate actually decreased and, in either case, the laws in question had largely not gone into effect yet.</p>
<p>Youngkin <a href="https://www.youngkinforgovernor.com/game-plan" target="_blank">has said less</a> about what he intends to do on the issue as governor. In addition to his promise to require a police officer in every school, he’s said he will fire the parole board, which was at the center of a contentious state Inspector General&#8217;s Office investigation <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/02/26/the-laws-did-not-matter-leaked-reports-show-pattern-of-parole-board-violations/" target="_blank">into violations of rules and procedures in its release of a string of violent offenders</a>. He also says he would “fully fund law enforcement,” though he has not elaborated on what that might entail.</p>
<figure id="attachment_1273" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="max-width:100%;width:1920px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/charlottesville-student-rally-8.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-1273" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/charlottesville-student-rally-8.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1280" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/charlottesville-student-rally-8.jpg 1920w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/charlottesville-student-rally-8-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/charlottesville-student-rally-8-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/charlottesville-student-rally-8-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/charlottesville-student-rally-8-696x464.jpg 696w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/charlottesville-student-rally-8-1068x712.jpg 1068w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/charlottesville-student-rally-8-630x420.jpg 630w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Police guarded the Rotunda at UVA on Aug. 11, 2018, in Charlottesville, the anniversary weekend of the deadly white supremacist rally that left one dead and dozens injured. (Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p>McAuliffe, meanwhile, has laid out <a href="https://terrymcauliffe.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/TRM-Criminal-Justice-Reform-FINAL.pdf" target="_blank">detailed plans</a> to continue the criminal justice reform initiatives set in motion last year. That includes promises to <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/01/05/virginia-crime-commission-recommends-eliminating-all-mandatory-minimum-sentences/" target="_blank">eliminate mandatory minimum sentences</a>, hire more public defenders, fund police accreditation efforts and bring new rehabilitation programs to state prisons, including a <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/10/03/virginia-department-of-corrections-weighs-prison-nursery-for-new-mothers/" target="_blank">nursery program</a> for prisoners with newborn children.</p>
<p>And rather than fire the parole board, he says he hopes to expand access to parole, which the state abolished in 1995.</p>
<p>McAuliffe also backs banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines &#8212; a measure that has <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/02/17/va-senate-committee-blocks-assault-weapon-bill-4-democrats-vote-to-push-it-to-2021/" target="_blank">failed</a> to muster enough Democratic support to pass the legislature. Youngkin has promised to roll back restrictions on firearms.</p>
<p>Both men say they support increased funding for community violence prevention programs. And both now say <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/09/16/at-first-debate-mcauliffe-walks-back-support-for-ending-qualified-immunity-for-police/" target="_blank">they oppose rolling back qualified immunity for police officers</a> accused of misconduct &#8212; something McAuliffe said he supported during the primary but walked back during his first debate with Youngkin.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Health</h4>

	
<p>Any focus on health in Virginia’s governor’s race has largely boiled down to two issues: COVID-19 and abortion.</p>
<p>Publicly, McAuliffe and Youngkin have sparred over measures like masking and vaccinations, still key in efforts to bring an end to the pandemic. McAuliffe has <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/virginia-governor-mask-vaccine-mandates/2021/08/12/05eb7d70-fad4-11eb-9c0e-97e29906a970_story.html" target="_blank">supported a mandate</a> to require masks in school buildings and released <a href="https://terrymcauliffe.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Terry-McAuliffe-COVID19-Plan-1-1.pdf" target="_blank">a plan to boost vaccination rates</a>, including using federal rescue money to incentivize vaccine requirements by private employers.</p>
<p>Youngkin, on the other hand, has <a href="https://www.youngkinforgovernor.com/post/glenn-releases-statement-on-northam-mcauliffe-mask-mandate-for-kids" target="_blank">explicitly said</a> “there should not be a statewide school mask mandate” in Virginia. He’s also <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/28/politics/virginia-governor-debate-covid-vaccine-mandate/index.html" target="_blank">opposed vaccine mandates</a>, though he’s encouraged Virginians to get the shots voluntarily.</p>
<p>Abortion, too, has become a prominent campaign topic for McAuliffe since Texas <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/10/01/texas-abortion-law-blocked/" target="_blank">effectively banned the procedure</a>. Around the same time, the Supreme Court agreed to hear a case that could present a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Y2WPPhdE903YFmCyGTWAKg79q-BU9I0Wc8PZU_76fLA/edit" target="_blank">serious challenge</a> to Roe V. Wade, its landmark 1973 abortion rights decision. With access potentially under threat, Democrats have seized on the opportunity to emphasize the importance of individual state protections.</p>

<p>“I’ll say this again to every woman watching tonight — I will protect your rights,” McAuliffe said at one debate in September. He’s cited his own record in vetoing legislation that would have <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/mcauliffe-vetoes-bill-blocking-planned-parenthood-funding/2016/03/29/a80e2040-f5d4-11e5-8b23-538270a1ca31_story.html" target="_blank">blocked funding</a> to Planned Parenthood, and he’s supported recently passed measures that <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/01/29/virginia-lawmakers-vote-to-repeal-mandatory-ultrasound-waiting-period-for-abortion/" target="_blank">rolled back</a> many of the state’s abortion restrictions. In one radio interview, he also said he wouldn’t have vetoed a <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/01/30/failed-legislation-loosening-restrictions-on-late-term-abortions-which-are-already-legal-in-some-cases-in-virginia-ignites-furor/" target="_blank">controversial proposed bill</a> from Del. Kathy Tran, D-Fairfax, that would have eased certain restrictions on late-term abortions (though Politifact described it as a <a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2019/apr/09/terry-mcauliffe/mcauliffe-does-full-flop-late-term-abortion-bill/" target="_blank">flip-flop</a> on previous statements).</p>
<p>Youngkin, for his part, has described himself as “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/glenn-youngkin-virginia-abortion-video/2021/07/07/1b551bee-df81-11eb-9f54-7eee10b5fcd2_story.html" target="_blank">unabashedly pro-life</a>.” <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/09/30/fact-checking-second-mcauliffe-youngkin-gubernatorial-debate/" target="_blank">In debates</a>, he’s said he would support the reinstatement of some abortion restrictions and a bill that would ban the procedure after 20 weeks of pregnancy with exceptions for rape and incest.</p>
<p>Other health issues haven’t gotten much airtime from either campaign, though McAuliffe has <a href="https://terrymcauliffe.com/issues/health-care/" target="_blank">released plans</a> to strengthen Medicaid, expand health care access and <a href="https://terrymcauliffe.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/TRM-Prescription-for-a-Healthier-Virginia-FINAL-1.pdf" target="_blank">lower drug costs</a>. Youngkin has <a href="https://www.whsv.com/2021/08/30/glenn-youngkin-unveils-day-one-plan/" target="_blank">supported investments</a> in the state’s <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/07/09/more-than-half-of-virginias-state-run-mental-hospitals-are-closing-to-new-admissions/" target="_blank">struggling mental health hospitals</a>.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Climate change and sea level rise</h4>

	
<p>McAuliffe has outlined <a href="https://terrymcauliffe.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Terry-McAuliffe-Climate-Change-and-Clean-Energy-Plan-1.pdf" target="_blank">a detailed plan</a> for responding to climate change, quoting President Joe Biden’s statement that “climate change is the existential threat to humanity” and calling a transition to clean energy essential “to protect Virginians from the long-term threats of climate change.”</p>
<p>Youngkin meanwhile has walked a careful line on the subject, despite a broad scientific consensus that carbon emissions are a primary driver of climate change. During an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LN-ucRM9QUg" target="_blank">October roundtable</a> at Norfolk State University, Youngkin said that while he knew climate change is a challenge, particularly in Hampton Roads, he didn’t know what&#8217;s causing it. Asked if “humans play any role at all in the warming of the earth,” he skirted the question and called it “one of these topics that, candidly, people are trying to use to divide people.”</p>
<p>Both candidates have emphasized the need for funding to help combat sea level rise in Hampton Roads, which is experiencing the fastest rate of any city on the East Coast. Both have also touted the possibilities of <a href="https://www.epa.gov/wifia/virginia-beach-sustainable-water-initiative-tomorrow" target="_blank">a project</a> that is pumping treated wastewater back into the Potomac aquifer to offset sinking land.</p>
<figure id="attachment_28527" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="max-width:100%;width:1500px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Ned-flooded-RVA-car.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-28527" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Ned-flooded-RVA-car.jpg" alt="" width="1500" height="1000" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Ned-flooded-RVA-car.jpg 1500w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Ned-flooded-RVA-car-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Ned-flooded-RVA-car-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Ned-flooded-RVA-car-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  A flooded road outside Richmond. (Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p>Youngkin has accused state government of not doing enough to help coastal regions address rising sea levels and pledged to put together an independent committee to raise funds and contract for projects in the region. He also praised a referendum Virginia Beach voters will face on Tuesday that would raise real estate taxes to pay for flood protection projects.</p>
<p>McAuliffe has said he’ll seek federal grant funding to help with the issue, prioritize restoration of wetlands that can serve as natural coastal protections and pursue a full coastal study of the state with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers that has been stalled at the federal level. He has also noted that in his prior term he was responsible for Virginia’s first steps toward joining the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a multistate carbon market that puts a price on carbon emissions and then redistributes proceeds back to the states.</p>
<p>Since Virginia began participating in carbon auctions this year, it has generated $64 million earmarked by law for <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/10/14/resilience-planning-and-a-few-innovative-ideas-top-states-first-flood-fund-grants/" target="_blank">flood protection efforts</a>.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Energy</h4>

	
<p>Youngkin and McAuliffe flatly disagree on Virginia’s current course toward transitioning the electric grid away from fossil fuels and toward renewable energy.</p>
<p>Youngkin said in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LN-ucRM9QUg" target="_blank">Sept. 28 debate</a> that the 2020 <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/02/20/ten-things-to-know-about-the-clean-economy-act/" target="_blank">Virginia Clean Economy Act</a> is “unworkable” and that he wouldn’t have signed it. The law set a 2050 deadline for the grid to go carbon-free, mandated that Appalachian Power and Dominion Energy propose large amounts of solar and wind facilities, and imposed binding energy efficiency and renewable portfolio standards on both utilities, among other provisions.</p>
<p>During an <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?514638-1/terry-mcauliffe-glenn-youngkin-debate-time-virginia-governors-race" target="_blank">earlier debate on September 16</a>, he said Virginia should “embrace all aspects of power generation &#8212; wind, solar, nuclear and our clean-burning natural gas” and warned that accelerating the transition to renewables would result in “blackouts and brownouts and an unreliable energy grid.” He also criticized the cost of shifting away from fossil fuels, saying it will increase customers’ electric bills by up to $1,000 annually. (State regulators agree that it will raise rates, but estimated <a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/virginia-regulatory-staff-question-dominion-potential-800-bill-hike/586184/" target="_blank">a slightly lower rise of $800 a year</a>.)</p>

<p>McAuliffe meanwhile has thrown his support behind the Clean Economy Act and said he would like to see the 2050 carbon-free deadline moved up to 2035.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://terrymcauliffe.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Terry-McAuliffe-Climate-Change-and-Clean-Energy-Plan-1.pdf" target="_blank">issue brief on clean energy and climate change</a>, he pledged to improve energy efficiency by raising the standards the state’s two largest electric utilities are mandated to meet, expand commercial and residential solar and accelerate transportation electrification. He also expressed support for redesigning parts of Virginia’s system of electric utility regulation to be more outcomes-based, calling for Virginia “to rebuild the incentive structures that drive” Appalachian Power and Dominion.</p>
<p>McAuliffe has repeatedly framed clean energy as a net positive for Virginia, saying that “when I think of clean energy, I think of jobs” and emphasizing the possibility of Hampton Roads becoming a hub for the offshore wind industry.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Civil Rights</h4>

	
<p>Throughout the campaign, McAuliffe has emphasized his role in restoring the voting rights of more than 173,000 people convicted of felonies, which he says is more than any other governor in the nation.</p>
<p>If reelected, he says he would go further and pursue a constitutional amendment that would automatically restore voting rights, which would bring Virginia in line with much of the rest of the nation.</p>

<p>Youngkin’s campaign has attacked McAuliffe’s efforts on voting rights, noting that the action also made it easier for ex-offenders to also have their firearms rights restored.</p>
<p>McAuliffe also says he would pursue additional protections for LGBTQ Virginians, including anti-bully legislation for students and repealing a so-called “conscience clause” that permits state-funded adoption agencies to refuse to serve LGBTQ people.</p>
<p>Youngkin has largely avoided weighing in on the issue, but told the Associated Press that he feels “called to love everyone.” However, pressed as to whether he intended to convey support for same-sex marriage, he said no. Youngkin’s staff then abruptly ended the interview.</p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>Virginia’s prison population dropped by more than 5,000 people during the pandemic, and officials tasked with projecting future trends are wondering if it’s going to stay that way.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://rga.lis.virginia.gov/Published/2021/RD536/PDF" target="_blank">report</a> released this month, Secretary of Public Safety and Homeland Security Brian Moran&#8217;s office said said it’s too soon to know what impact legislation passed by the General Assembly since Democrats took control would have, but that a variety of bills could help keep numbers low.</p>
<p>Among the policy changes cited were bills that <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/10/26/thousands-of-virginia-prisoners-could-be-released-early-under-new-earned-sentence-credit-program/" target="_blank">increased credits</a> some prisoners could earn with good behavior, <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/04/07/marijuana-will-be-legal-in-virginia-on-july-1-heres-what-is-and-isnt-permitted-under-the-new-law/" target="_blank">ended the state’s prohibition on marijuana</a> and enacted far-reaching <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/10/21/probation-reforms-face-pushback-confusion-in-the-court-system/" target="_blank">probation reform</a>.</p>
<p>Because of uncertainty, the state committee tasked with the annual forecasts settled on a flat rate for the next six years, which would mean a prison population of about 31,000 people.</p>
<p>That’s far lower than the 38,000 prisoners the state expected to keep behind bars in 2019, when Republicans still controlled the General Assembly and criminal justice reform measures rarely passed.</p>
<p>The actual pre-pandemic population was 36,500, falling to 33,000 in 2020 and 31,170 last fiscal year, which ended in July. Officials attribute the drop primarily to reduced arrests by law enforcement during the pandemic and delayed trials and sentencing in the court system for those who were facing charges. The state also created an early release program for prisoners with less than 12 months left to serve.</p>
<p>In conversations with Department of Corrections leaders, Democrats in the legislature have made clear that lowering the prison population is a longterm goal. Harold Clarke, the state’s prison chief, has pushed back on the idea that the state can bank on the idea that numbers will stay low.</p>
<p>The committee of public safety officials and lawmakers who set forecasts agreed. “The collective impact of the legislation is difficult to quantify precisely, particularly if criminal justice decision makers begin to adjust their practices in response to the legislation,” they wrote.</p>

(Parker Michels-Boyce/ For the Virginia Mercury)</p><p>Dominion Energy’s political giving in Virginia has surged into the millions this year, and Democrats are the biggest beneficiaries, with donations totaling more than $1.8 million so far this cycle, according to campaign finance records compiled by the Virginia Public Access Project.</p>
<p>Republicans, meanwhile, have received just over $1 million from the influential electric utility, the records show.</p>
<p>The figures represent a substantial increase over past donations — which for two decades have typically hovered in the $300,000-per-year range — and a break from the company’s old approach of generally giving similar amounts of money to Republicans and Democrats, especially in gubernatorial election years.</p>
<p>The shift comes even as the vast majority of Democrats running for office this year have pledged to reject Dominion’s donations, prompting the company to go to lengths to direct money to candidates who have publicly said they would not solicit or accept the energy utility’s contributions.</p>
<p><iframe id="datawrapper-chart-kNe3S" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" title="Dominion Energy's political donations surge" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/kNe3S/2/" height="600" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" aria-label="Interactive line chart"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
</script></p>
<p>The most high-profile example came last week, when campaign finance disclosures showed Dominion contributed at least $250,000 to a PAC supporting Democratic gubernatorial nominee Terry McAuliffe, who said earlier this year that he wouldn’t take the company’s contributions. The donation triggered a vocal backlash from Republicans upon learning it was used in an effort to suppress GOP turnout in rural areas by running ads questioning Republican nominee Glenn Youngkin’s support of gun rights.</p>
<p>Unless the company changes course in the final days of the race, this will be the first gubernatorial election since at least 1997 that the utility won’t have made substantial contributions to both major party candidates for governor, according to records compiled by VPAP.</p>
<p>Youngkin does not appear to have taken a stance on Dominion donations and his campaign did not answer questions about whether he had solicited or been offered any support from the company. Dominion also declined to comment.</p>
<p>But after the contributions to the pro-McAuliffe PAC were revealed, Youngkin offered harsh words for the utility, which has for years enjoyed support from leaders in both political parties.</p>
<p>“They want to keep Terry McAuliffe because they know they have somebody that they can they can manipulate and Terry is bought and sold by them,” Youngkin said during a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLJ7AJ3Cw-M&amp;ab_channel=GlennYoungkin" target="_blank">recent radio interview,</a> criticizing the company for overcharging its captive customer base. “I'm going to stand up to Dominion Energy and say, ‘This is Virginians’ money.’”</p>
<figure id="attachment_28737" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="max-width:100%;width:1475px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/guys-1-2.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-28737" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/guys-1-2.jpg" alt="" width="1475" height="800" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/guys-1-2.jpg 1475w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/guys-1-2-300x163.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/guys-1-2-1024x555.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/guys-1-2-768x417.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1475px) 100vw, 1475px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Democratic gubernatorial candidate Terry McAuliffe, left, and his Republican rival, Glenn Youngkin, are hitting on national political themes in their race. (Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p>It was not the first time this year Dominion took a back-door approach to supporting a Democratic candidate who has publicly eschewed their donations. Attorney General Mark Herring <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/herring-tells-blue-virginia-he-wont-take-dominion-money/" target="_blank">announced in 2018</a> he wouldn’t accept donations from publicly regulated monopolies like Dominion. But during a hard-fought primary in which Herring faced a challenger who pledged a more aggressive stance on the company, Dominion made $200,000 in donations to the Democratic Attorneys General Association, which in turn was backing Herring.</p>
<p>The donations, which remained secret during the primary because of disclosure deadlines, were first <a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/when-herring-was-in-midst-of-primary-dominion-energy-gave-200k-to-association-helping-his/article_2747bf37-9b0d-5977-819f-9fc3664f1454.html" target="_blank">publicly reported</a> by the Richmond Times-Dispatch in August — a month after the election.</p>
<p>The company has also stroked bigger and bigger checks to Democratic leaders in the House of Delegates and the political action committees they control — contributions that in past years topped out in the $30,000 range but now regularly exceed $100,000.</p>
<p>Much of that money also eventually makes its way to helping candidates who have pledged to refuse donations from the utility.</p>
<p>According to Clean Virginia, a rival PAC founded by multi-millionaire Michael Bills to counter Dominion’s influence in Virginia, 75 percent of the House’s 55 Democratic members have said they won’t accept Dominion’s money.</p>
<p>The House Democratic Caucus’s PAC, however, counts Dominion as one of its largest donors, receiving $350,000 so far this year, according to VPAP. And more of the company’s money gets funneled into the account through caucus leadership, who collected more than $400,000 this year from Dominion.</p>
<p>Those leaders, few of whom face competitive races of their own, in turn make their own donations to the caucus PAC.</p>
<p>Sometimes the money only takes a few days to move from one account to the next. For instance, the party’s House Appropriation’s chair, Del. Luke Torian, D-Prince William, reported a $100,000 check from Dominion on Sept. 6. Three days later, the caucus PAC reported receiving a $100,000 donation from Torian. The pattern repeated itself later in the month, when Torian reported a $50,000 check from Dominion on Sept. 22 and a day later the caucus received a $50,000 check from Torian, according to VPAP.</p>
<p>Political observers said they weren’t particularly surprised to see Dominion directing more money to Democrats in the legislature after the party won full control of the General Assembly in 2019 for the first time in more than two decades.</p>
<p>As for the substantial increase in the size of the company’s donations, veteran Virginia political commentator Bob Holsworth views it as the company’s response to Bills’ Clean Virginia, founded with the explicit goal of countering Dominion’s in the legislature by guaranteeing donations to candidates who don’t take the company’s money.</p>
<figure id="attachment_29218" class="wp-caption alignright" style="max-width:100%;width:446px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/youngkin-pac-ad.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-29218" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/youngkin-pac-ad.jpg" alt="" width="446" height="387" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/youngkin-pac-ad.jpg 446w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/youngkin-pac-ad-300x260.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 446px) 100vw, 446px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  A campaign ad run by a Dominion Energy-backed PAC on Facebook, which attempted to boost Democrat Terry McAuliffe by targeting rural GOP voters with questions about Glenn Youngkin's support for gun rights.</p></figure>
<p>Bills, already a prolific donor, became the largest individual campaign contributor in the state until this year, when he was eclipsed by Youngkin, a fellow multimillionaire who is partially self-funding his gubernatorial campaign.</p>
<p>“Dominion looked like a gorilla, and then all of a sudden, you had an individual who could look at his own balance sheet and say, ‘A couple of million is a drop in the bucket. I can match that,” Holsworth said. “That’s a new environment for them.”</p>
<p>More surprising, Holsworth said, was Dominion’s decision to go all-in on McAuliffe after years of supporting both sides in gubernatorial races. He said he found the decision especially unusual in such a close race.</p>
<p>“Maybe that’s, in part, because McAuliffe is running for his second term and is seen as essentially an incumbent,” Holsworth said. “They know who they’re getting.”</p>
<p>Dominion spokesman Rayhan Daudani said the company would not comment on why it was supporting McAuliffe over Youngkin. (He also declined to answer questions about why the size of the company’s donations have increased, whether the company received the refund it requested from the PAC that backed McAuliffe with anti-Youngkin ads, why the company’s CEO suggested he was unaware of the PAC’s tactics when they had been in the news before the company’s final reported donation and whether the company made additional donations to the PAC that have not yet been reported.)</p>
<p>Theories, however, abound.</p>
<p>Republicans note that many Dominion executives are veterans of Democratic politics. That includes new CEO Bob Blue, who previously served as a director of policy for Sen. Mark Warner when he was governor.</p>
<p>Sen. David Suetterlein, R-Roanoke, one of a growing handful of Republicans who has been openly critical of the company, posited that Democratic control presents the possibility of greater profits. “The Democratic agenda that raises the cost of electricity generation through programs like the Virginia Clean Economy Act hurt the bottom line for working families,” he argued.</p>
<p>Environmental groups doubt that argument, noting that under Republican control Dominion was able to lock in extremely profitable rate freezes and infrastructure investment bills at the expense of ratepayers. They posited that Democrats’ willingness to challenge the company is exactly why the company feels compelled to flood the party’s leaders with cash.</p>
<figure id="attachment_29220" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:300px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_7246-2-scaled.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-29220 size-medium" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_7246-2-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_7246-2-300x199.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_7246-2-1024x680.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_7246-2-768x510.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_7246-2-1536x1021.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_7246-2-2048x1361.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Dominion Energy CEO Bob Blue speaks at an event on Monday, Oct. 25, 2021, in Portsmouth.

<p>“Dominion has been held more accountable in the two years that Democrats were in charge of the legislature than the last two decades when Republican-led legislatures allowed Dominion to strangle and fleece their customers,” said Mike Town, who directs the Virginia League of Conservation Voters. Town thinks Dominion has simply looked at the state’s politics and made a bet that Democrats are more likely to be in charge for the foreseeable future than Republicans.</p>
<p>Finally, people who work in the renewable energy industry, which Dominion has committed to since Democrats took power and passed the Clean Economy Act, say that as a monopoly the company stands to make money regardless of what kinds of facilities it builds, but that any change in course at this point simply represents an unnecessary business risk.</p>
<p>Harry Godfrey, the director of the industry group Virginia Advanced Energy Economy, said big businesses like Dominion want market certainty, and pivoting back to Republican control and any effort to unwind the state’s transition to renewables would undermine that at this point.</p>
<p>“The energy industry, of which Dominion is a significant part, is a large warship,” he said. “It does not turn quickly. There are gains both for the companies, the citizens and Virginia’s economy overall for staying on that course. Which is why I think you see a preference toward staying the course here.”</p>

(Photo by Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>When lawmakers voted to reform probation in Virginia earlier this year, they said their motive was simple: Stop people from getting sent back to prison for minor violations like missing an appointment or failing a drug test.</p>
<p>But three months after the new law went into effect, officials across the criminal justice system say the rules have led to confusion, inconsistent enforcement and, in some cases, deliberate pushback from judges and prosecutors.</p>
<p>“We spent two decades trying to reduce disparity in sentencing,” said Jody Fridley, deputy director of the Virginia Sentencing Commission, during a recent meeting. “This has just opened up the possibility for more disparity.”</p>
<p>The legislation lawmakers passed prohibits judges from incarcerating probationers for their first technical offense and limits punishment for a second technical offense to a maximum of 14 days in jail. Only after a third offense is a judge allowed to impose a longer sentence.</p>
<p>The legislation also caps probation at a maximum of five years for a felony and one year for a misdemeanor. The measure was championed by Democrats, who celebrated the new law with a <a href="https://www.wric.com/news/politics/capitol-connection/rapper-meek-mill-joins-northam-for-probation-reform-bill-signing/" target="_blank">bill signing that featured</a> rapper Meek Mill, whose own experience with probation helped make the case for the new law.</p>
<p>But in practice, confusion remains about what exactly counts as a technical violation. To illustrate the issue, Fidley described two recent cases in which a sex offender was issued a probation violation for attempting to contact a minor online. In one jurisdiction, the probation officer wrote it up as a major violation because the terms of the probation included special provisions barring use of social media and contacting minors. The approach led to a sentence recommendation of between three months and one year.</p>
<p>In another jurisdiction, a probation officer cited it as a technical violation because it was interpreted more generally as failing to follow instructions, which is not considered a major violation. Because it was a first offense, no term of incarceration was recommended.</p>
<p>Members of the sentencing commission, which sets sentencing guidelines and tracks how often judges follow them, said they believed the issue could be resolved with further guidance. “We can’t allow this kind of disparity to continue,” said Sen. John Edwards, D-Roanoke, who chairs the Senate’s judiciary committee. “It’s too confusing for too many people.”</p>
<p>Other questions about the law, however, will likely be more difficult to untangle.</p>
<p>The strongest rebuke of the new law has come from a circuit court judge in Loudoun County, James Fisher, who <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Fisher-Opinion.pdf" target="_blank">issued an opinion</a> calling the law an unconstitutional infringement on judicial discretion. As a circuit court judge, Fisher’s ruling does not set precedent and has no bearing outside of his courtroom, but he has directed the local probation department to continue reporting violations to him using the old guidelines.</p>
<p>“Exactly what to do with a given probationer when he or she violates the court’s order of supervised probation is squarely within the realm of judicial discretion,” he wrote. “These considerations may not be justly micromanaged by legislation because they necessarily require individualized analysis of considerations and circumstances too numerous to detail.”</p>
<p>Fisher, who recently <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/09/17/virginia-judge-jails-alleged-domestic-violence-victim-for-smoking-pot-on-day-of-court-testimony/" target="_blank">made news</a> for ordering the alleged victim in a domestic violence trial jailed on a contempt charge, has a reputation for harsh sentences. But some of the issues he raised with the new law are shared by other judges, prosecutors and probation officers.</p>
<p>He noted it is a common practice in Loudoun and other jurisdictions to wait for multiple technical probation violations to accrue before bringing a defendant back to court. In those cases, he noted that multiple offenses could all be considered a first offense, meaning the judge could issue no punishment.</p>
<p>“An offender … who absconds from supervision after repeated probation failures and who remains at large for a lengthy period of time may be treated as a first offender for violation purposes, while a different offender who is brought to court immediately after each and every separate violation will after a third adjudication be subject to an enforcement penalty,” he wrote.</p>
<p>The sentencing commission reported that some judges are reportedly sidestepping that potential dilemma by simply treating each technical violation as a separate hearing, meaning that a defendant could rack up three or more offenses in a single day.</p>
<p>In addition to concerns about sentencing disparities caused by the disparate approaches, commission staff worried that a move by probation officers to begin sending every technical violation to court could end up hurting the criminal defendants the law was supposed to help by leaving them with an even longer criminal history than they might have faced otherwise.</p>
<p>They also worried that the law might be leading some judges and prosecutors toward harsher sentences in the first place. “Some prosecutors have said they would be adjusting their plea agreements … because of the limited possibilities for returning defendants to court for public safety reason,” Fridley said. “The analogy that they use is they get one bite at the apple now. Do they take the risk?”</p>
<p>Supporters of the law voiced frustration with what they view as efforts to circumvent its intent.</p>
<p>Del. Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, who proposed the legislation, called the practice of treating multiple simultaneous violations as separate offenses an unintended loophole. “That would not be my intent,” he said. “Hopefully next year we’ll be able to clean the language up.”</p>
<p>Brad Haywood, the chief public defender in Arlington and the executive director of Justice Forward, which helped author the legislation, said the fight illustrates how deeply ingrained the ‘90s-style, tough-on-crime attitude is in the criminal justice system &#8212; even as policy makers take steps toward reform.</p>
<p>“We’re finding a lot of people really believe in it, really committed to it,” Haywood said. “We’re developing new reform opponents in different parts of the justice system we never really anticipated.<br />
That’s really disappointing.”</p>

<p>The companies, named in 13 lawsuits filed by Attorney General Mark Herring on Monday, own and operate some of the city’s more recognizable apartment complexes.</p>
<p>“Every single Virginian has the right to a safe, comfortable home, regardless of whether they have some assistance paying their rent,” Herring said in a statement. “Blocking Virginians who would use a Housing Choice Voucher to pay their rent is outright housing discrimination and will not be tolerated in Virginia.”</p>

<p>Virginia lawmakers <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/virginia-lawmakers-vote-to-prohibit-landlords-from-refusing-section-8-vouchers/" target="_blank">voted last year</a> to bar landlords from discriminating against potential tenants based on their source of income &#8212; language intended to end many property owners’ practice of refusing tenants who rely on Section 8 vouchers to pay rent.</p>
<p>Tenant advocates called it an important reform because despite having funds to pay rent, tenants relying on vouchers were often forced into less desirable rental units.</p>
<p>Under the program, tenants typically pay a third of their income toward rent and the government pays the difference. (For an apartment or house to be eligible for subsidy, total rent can’t exceed a federally-established fair market value for the specific metro area or county. In Virginia, that rate ranges from $676 for a one-bedroom apartment in Lynchburg to $1,500 in Northern Virginia.)</p>
<p>The Virginia Apartment Management Association opposed the legislation, arguing it was unfair to force landlords to accept the vouchers because the programs require contractual agreements with the government. They also criticized the local housing authorities that often administer the program as sometimes dysfunctional and hard to work with.</p>
<p>Herring announced the lawsuits in a news release, but as of Monday afternoon, none of the landlords named in the lawsuits who were reached by the Mercury were aware of the legal action.</p>
<p>At one of the properties named in the lawsuit, the Stables at Hancock, a representative asked for details about the lawsuit. “Oh,” said the representative, who did not provide a name, upon hearing of the allegations.</p>
<p>At Fulton Hill Properties, whose developments <a href="https://richmondbizsense.com/2017/10/18/freunds-fulton-hill-breaks-ground-40m-project/" target="_blank">have been financed by the Virginia Housing Development Authority</a> as mixed-income communities, a representative said they would comment after they had researched the allegations.</p>
<p>Efforts to reach the other named defendants were unsuccessful. They include the owners of River Lofts on Tobacco Row, Metro Sound Apartments and the Miller &amp; Rhoads building.</p>
<p>The lawsuits each seek $70,000 in damages and penalties and request a “reasonable period of monitoring” to ensure compliance going forward.</p>
<p>Patrick McCloud, the director of the Virginia Apartment Management Association, said the organization has included information about the new law in its training materials for more than a year. &#8220;Unfortunately training takes time and I worry these examples highlight the challenges associated with changing laws to mandate private property owners participate in a government program that’s been voluntary 46 years,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Herring’s office worked with the New York-based Housing Rights Initiative, which uncovered the alleged violations by posing as potential renters hoping to pay with housing vouchers.</p>
<p>&#8220;A fair housing ally informed us to the possibility of housing voucher discrimination in Virginia,” said Housing Rights Initiative CEO Aaron Carr in a statement. “In response, we proactively and systematically conducted undercover investigations and found that dozens of real estate companies in the Richmond-area were not complying with the Virginia Fair Housing Law.&#8221;</p>
<p>Carr said that while the organization’s survey uncovered dozens of violations, “fortunately, it appears that the majority of real estate companies are complying in the Richmond-area, which speaks to the importance of having such laws on the books.”</p>

<p>The figure came out Thursday during a meeting of the legislature’s Cannabis Oversight Commission.</p>
<p>Officials said the records were scrubbed from the state’s criminal record database, which is used by employers like school boards, state agencies and local governments to screen employees.</p>
<p>The state had already sealed 333,000 records detailing charges of simple possession last year after the state reduced the offense to a civil infraction on par with a traffic offense, said Shawn G. Talmadge, the Deputy Secretary of Public Safety and Homeland Security.</p>
<p>Lawmakers directed the state to expand that effort when they voted to broadly legalize recreational use of marijuana earlier this year.</p>
<p>The legislature also agreed to <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/02/17/long-deadlocked-virginia-lawmakers-reach-compromise-to-seal-past-criminal-convictions/" target="_blank">a broader expungement reform</a> that will automatically seal other misdemeanor charges, including underage possession of alcohol, use of a fake ID, petit larceny, trespassing and disorderly conduct. Talmadge said those charges will remain in the system until the state finishes updating the software it uses to track criminal records.</p>
<p>“As of right now, the process is proceeding,” he said.</p>
<p>Members of the oversight commission also heard from two advocates who urged them to move fast to address people currently imprisoned for marijuana offenses &#8212; a category of people the legalization legislation passed this year <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/04/23/virginia-legalized-it-but-people-in-prison-on-marijuana-charges-will-stay-there-under-new-law/" target="_blank">did not address</a>.</p>
<p>Chelsea Higgs Wise, the leader of the advocacy group Marijuana Justice, and Gracie Burger, with the Last Prisoner Project, said Department of Corrections data suggests there are currently 10 people being held solely on serious marijuana charges.</p>
<p>They said it remains unknown how many more are being held because of marijuana related probation violations.</p>
<p>“These aren’t just numbers and there are families attached,” Burger said.</p>

<p>DOC director Harold Clarke announced in July he intended to <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/07/26/virginia-department-of-corrections-announces-plans-to-de-privatize-prison-healthcare/" target="_blank">bring all health care services in-house</a>, ending its $90-million annual contract with Miami-based Armor Correctional Health.</p>
<p>But rather than let the current contract run its course for the next year as initially planned, prison officials now say they’re taking immediate steps to end the state’s relationship with Armor, accusing the company of stonewalling corrections officials since the announcement.</p>
<p>“The relationship and correspondence with the vendor has degraded significantly,” Clarke wrote in a letter to House and Senate budget leaders. “The lack of communication and the activities of the vendor significantly jeopardize the ability of the department to ensure constitutionally adequate medical care is being provided as contractually required by the vendor and is unsustainable for any amount of time.”</p>
<p>Armor’s CEO, Otto Campo, fired back in a statement, calling DOC’s decision reckless.</p>
<p>“This decision is consistent with a well-documented pattern of mismanagement at the Virginia Department of Corrections,” he said. “It is a reckless move by VADOC that does not have legislative support and will have serious negative financial consequences for the taxpayers of the commonwealth.”</p>
<p>Clarke said the department had “no choice but to terminate the current agreement with Armor Correctional Healthcare.” He wrote that DOC is exercising its right to terminate its contract with Armor with 60-days’ notice. He wrote that an unnamed provider had agreed to take over Armor’s contract under the existing terms until DOC is prepared to fully de-privatize prison medical care.</p>
<p>The letter represents a significant change in tenor from July, when Clarke complimented Armor in a memo to staff members announcing the decision, calling it a “long and productive partnership.”</p>
<p>Health care in a state prisons have been a persistent point of concern in recent years, prompting <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/07/12/five-years-later-virginia-prison-still-not-meeting-terms-of-court-ordered-settlement-over-shoddy-medical-care/" target="_blank">long-running federal lawsuits</a> and legislative handwringing over <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/12/02/virginia-looks-to-uva-and-vcu-for-help-as-prison-healthcare-costs-soar/" target="_blank">ballooning costs</a>.</p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>A federal judge is urging Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring to issue a formal opinion on the state’s election calendar after U.S. census delays forced members of the General Assembly to run in outdated districts this year.</p>
<p>Herring has steadfastly declined to weigh in despite receiving a formal request for an opinion five months ago from Del. Lee Carter, D-Manassas. The issue, which has been the subject of open speculation among lawmakers for more than a year, is now at the center of a lawsuit that aims to force a new round of House of Delegates elections next year once redrawn districts are finalized.</p>
<p>“Maybe the attorney general wants to opine &#8212; he may want to,” said U.S. District Judge David Novak during a hearing Tuesday, suggesting that some clear legal direction from Herring might resolve the need for the lawsuit. “I want him to do his job, but I’m not ordering it.”</p>
<p>The two lawyers from Herring’s office in the hearing, who were representing Gov. Ralph Northam and the Board of Elections in the lawsuit, bristled at Novak’s request, repeatedly calling it “neither here nor there.”</p>
<p>They also defended Herring’s right not to respond in a filing ahead of the hearing, writing that the office “has a longstanding practice of exercising discretion to decline, when appropriate, to respond to requests for official advisory opinions, including requests from legislators.”</p>
<p>Because census data came in late, all 100 members of the House of Delegates are running in districts that were drawn based on 2010 population figures. But a decade of growth in urban areas and shrinking in rural ones has left some districts looking lopsided despite being initially drawn to all contain about 86,000 residents.</p>
<p>In some cases, the differences are extreme. An analysis by the Virginia Public Access Project found District 87 in Loudoun County now contains an extra 40,000 people. On the other side of the coin, eight predominantly rural districts are short at least 10,000 people.</p>

<p>Paul Goldman, a Democratic lawyer and onetime aide to former Gov. Doug Wilder, says the state of affairs has the effect of diluting the power of his vote, which is what prompted him to file the lawsuit in May.</p>
<p>Goldman renewed those arguments in Tuesday’s hearing, but Novak questioned whether Goldman was actually harmed by leaving the current districts in place for full, two-year terms, noting that Goldman’s district lost 900 residents, meaning he would actually be overrepresented in the General Assembly.</p>
<p>But Novak voiced frustration that the attorney general’s office hadn’t raised the issue of Goldman’s standing in their motion to dismiss, which instead focused on the state&#8217;s immunity from such lawsuits and whether a federal court had jurisdiction in the case &#8212; an argument Novak swiftly dismissed.</p>
<p>Novak did side with the government on one count, dismissing part of Goldman&#8217;s claim and excusing Northam and individual members of the board of elections from the suit.</p>
<p>But to decide whether the remainder of the case should go forward, he requested additional arguments on elements dealing with the court&#8217;s jurisdiction.</p>
<p>After Novak proposed a three-day deadline for additional filings, the attorney general’s office protested, calling the timing unreasonable.</p>
<p>Novak snapped back: “I wouldn’t be in this position if you had done your job the first time.”</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for Herring, Charlotte Gomer, said in an email that &#8220;just because an opinion has not yet been issued doesn’t mean one won’t be issued, and the timeline for processing and responding to an opinion request can vary widely from a few weeks to a few months or longer, depending on the complexity of the subject matter and other factors.&#8221;</p>
<p>She also downplayed the significance of attorney general&#8217;s opinions, noting that they are only advisory and do not make create new law or change existing law.</p>
<p>Novak&#8217;s frustration was not limited to Herring&#8217;s office. During the hearing, he urged Goldman, who is representing himself in the lawsuit, to follow court rules. He expressed particular frustration that Goldman had sent a press release about the case to his office. He also took issue with Goldman’s filings, which veered into allusions and allegory involving elephants and the magician Harry Houdini.</p>
<p>“You can’t be sending press releases to my law clerk,” Novak said, and “you can’t be talking about Russians, elephants and Houdini. … You’ve got to take it seriously.”</p>
<p>Novak set another hearing on the case for Nov. 8 &#8212; six days after the election.</p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>Members of the Virginia Redistricting Commission said Monday they’ll move on to redrawing the state’s 11 congressional districts after efforts to reach a compromise on General Assembly maps ended in a stalemate last week.</p>
<p>Monday’s meeting was nonetheless dominated by grousing from both Democrats and Republicans about the commission’s <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/10/08/va-redistricting-commission-implodes-as-republicans-reject-compromise-and-democrats-walk-out/" target="_blank">implosion Friday</a>, where three Democratic members walked out after Republicans rejected a compromise offer put forward by Democrats.</p>
<p>“So yes, we have had the airing of the grievances,” said the commission’s Republican co-chair, Mackenzie K. Babichenko, as she moved to wrap up the meeting.</p>
<p>Republican members of the committee accused Democrats of “sandbagging” them at the last meeting and questioned whether the Democratic co-chair, Greta Harris, had technically resigned during the last meeting when she stood up and said she was “removing herself” from the commission.</p>
<p>“I’m not aware of any reason that a verbal resignation is not effective in Virginia and I think that’s going to be important before we come back and start taking votes &#8212; that we have some clarification about what exactly we have here,” said Del. Les Adams, R-Pittsylvania.</p>
<p>Harris, who helped preside over Monday’s meeting, never said explicitly she was resigning and told commission members Monday that that was not her intention.</p>
<p>Sen. Mamie Locke, D-Hampton, accused Adams of attempting to “stir the pot and disrupt the commission’s work … pointing a finger at a commissioner who clarifies what her position was.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Sen. Ryan McDougle, R-Hanover, cast Friday’s meeting as “a total set up” by Democrats, who had proposed adopting a GOP-drawn House of Delegates map in exchange for a Democrat-drawn Senate map.</p>
<p>McDougle argued that Senate map, which had never before been presented, “looked to me to be a very clear partisan gerrymander.” He accused Democrats of posturing in an effort to “lock in a record for the Supreme Court to look at” when it ultimately takes up the maps.</p>
<p>Commissioner James Abrenio, a citizen member from Fairfax, responded that the Senate map the party presented was based on public comment the commission had received last week. “The goal was not to sandbag, the goal was to offer a 50-50 compromise,” he said.</p>
<p>The commission resolved to meet again Thursday to begin work on the congressional maps. Members of both parties sounded hopeful that it would be easier to find a compromise at the federal level.</p>
<p>For one, Sen. George Barker, D-Fairfax, noted that the commission won’t have to decide whether to consider incumbent residency &#8212; an ongoing sticking point in discussions about statehouse maps &#8212; because federal rules don’t require members of Congress to live in their districts.</p>
<p>“When we come together on Thursday, I hope that we will be talking to each other to build consensus,” said Babichenko. “If we can’t work it out, we can’t work it out. But it shouldn’t be because we were unwilling to try.”</p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>As Virginia’s medical marijuana industry closes out its first year of sales, some patients are complaining about long waits to register with the state and high prices once they get into dispensaries.</p>
<p>“A month’s supply costs me between $600 and $700 &#8212; and that’s not covered by insurance,” says Tamara Netzel, a former schoolteacher from Virginia Beach who suffers from multiple sclerosis and has found cannabis far more effective than any other available pain treatment.</p>
<p>The state’s <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/03/07/virginia-looks-more-and-more-like-it-has-a-full-blown-medical-marijuana-program/" target="_blank">medical marijuana program</a> is currently the only legal avenue to purchase marijuana in Virginia. The four medical processors currently licensed by the state began opening to patients last October.</p>
<p>But to shop at the medical dispensaries, patients must first get a doctor to write them a recommendation and then apply to the state for a medical marijuana card.</p>
<p>Finding a doctor is easy &#8212; dozens of practices have popped up offering to set up online visits with doctors willing to recommend the drug for all manner of ailments. Some even <a href="https://www.vanorml.org/doctors" target="_blank">offer deals</a>, promising to reimburse the $100 cost of an appointment if their practitioner declines to sign off on a marijuana card.</p>
<p>But Netzel, who runs a Facebook group for medical marijuana patients, lamented that the next step &#8212; getting the state to review an application and issue a medical marijuana card &#8212; can take more than a month.</p>
<p>“If a doctor can turn around a letter right away within 30 minutes, why does it take six weeks for the Virginia Board of Pharmacy to send a paper card?” she said.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the Board of Pharmacy, Diane Powers, said the board tries to process all applications within 30 business days and is in the process of adding staff to help with an influx of applications, which she said arrive at a rate of more than 1,000 a week.</p>
<p>And by early 2022, she said the board hopes to have a new online application portal in place it says will expedite the process. The board charges patients $50 a year in registration fees.</p>
<p>Patients aren’t the only ones frustrated by the delays. Processors have expressed disappointment at the still-narrow pool of patients who can purchase their products, a figure that as of Oct. 4 sits at just under 33,000.</p>

<p>“You can go to a doctor and get a prescription for an opioid and get it filled the same day, but we have patients waiting six, eight, 12 weeks to get a medical cannabis card,” said Ngiste Abebe, vice president of public policy at Columbia Care, a multi-state operator that sells medical cannabis under its own name in Hampton Roads and recently purchased Richmond-based Green Leaf Medical, which holds the license to sell medical products in central Virginia.</p>
<p>As for the cost of products, Abebe said the small number of patients is one of the reasons costs are still high. With more patients, she said the companies “will have more efficient economies of scale.”</p>
<p>She said the state’s regulations have also contributed to higher costs. She specifically cited Virginia’s status as one of the only states that requires a pharmacist to oversee every aspect of production and sales. The state also requires a pharmacist be available to consult with patients on site.</p>
<p>Jenn Michelle Pedini, executive director of Virginia NORML, the state chapter of the National Organization for the Reform Marijuana Laws, noted the state’s decision to limit the program to five producers, who are only allowed to operate in the specific region of the state in which they are licensed.</p>
<p>“Even though it’s completely normal to see higher prices in the early days of retail sales, it&#8217;s these two factors &#8212; limited points of access coupled with a small patient population &#8212; that are leaving Virginians with a serious case of sticker shock,” Pedini said.</p>
<p>Netzel said that before her local dispensary opened for business last year, she made regular trips to the District of Columbia, where gray-market sales have been tolerated for years.</p>
<p>“I would say I was probably paying about half as much as I am now,” she said.</p>
<p>And she said it’s not lost on her that Columbia Care’s D.C.-based dispensary sells 3.5 grams of marijuana for $35, compared to the $65 price for the same amount the company charges patients in Virginia.</p>
<p>But she said that despite the cost, she has remained loyal to the state’s medical market because she wants to see it succeed so more patients will have access to a treatment she said has helped her in a way no traditional pharmaceuticals could.</p>
<p>At the same time, she is pursuing a new avenue to help lower her expenses: She decided to start growing her own now that it is <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/04/07/marijuana-will-be-legal-in-virginia-on-july-1-heres-what-is-and-isnt-permitted-under-the-new-law/" target="_blank">legal</a>.</p>
<p>“So that is, hopefully, going to help with the cost,” she said.</p>

(Parker Michels-Boyce/ For The Virginia Mercury)</p><p>Two drywalling subcontractors working on the new General Assembly office building rising over Capitol Square are facing 10 counts each of felony embezzlement for allegedly misclassifying their employees as independent contractors to avoid paying payroll taxes.</p>
<p>Attorney General Mark Herring announced the indictments Wednesday. He said they are the first brought by a new Worker Protection Unit created by his office earlier this year.</p>
<p>For more than a year, labor unions have been attempting to draw attention to employment practices of companies working on an array of state construction sites around the capital city, staging giant signs that read “wage theft” on nearby sidewalks most mornings.</p>
<p>The issue has also caught the attention of lawmakers and state watchdog agencies. Herring said Thursday’s indictment was brought after an investigation in conjunction of the Office of the State Inspector General.</p>
<p>Herring’s office called worker misclassification one of the most common forms of worker exploitation. By falsely identifying employees as independent contractors, the office says employers “avoid paying unemployment and other taxes on workers and to avoid the costs of covering the employees with workers’ compensation and unemployment insurances, and it has been consistently shown to drive down the wages of other workers.”</p>
<p>The two companies charged in the case, GTO Drywall LLC and Richmond Drywall Installers Constructors, were unreachable for comment.</p>

Robert E. Lee in Richmond. (Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>It’s been a month since crews removed a massive statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee in Richmond, but the grassy traffic circle that had become a rallying point for protesters last year and a magnet for tourists remains off limits to the public.</p>
<p>State officials say they haven’t yet decided when or if they will take down the tall, chain-link fence that surrounds the graffiti-covered stone pedestal.</p>
<p>“There hasn&#8217;t been a decision on the future of the site at this time,” said Virginia Department of General Services spokeswoman Dena Potter in an email.</p>
<p>When the state initially put up the fencing in January, they said it was to make sure crews could act swiftly to remove the statue should the Supreme Court of Virginia issue a favorable ruling in a case that had temporarily blocked Gov. Ralph Northam from moving forward.</p>
<p>That ruling came on Sept. 2 and the statue was removed the following week. But the fence remained up, with officials saying the barrier would remain in place for safety reasons while crews worked to repair ground damaged by the heavy machinery used to lift the statue off the pedestal.</p>
<p>That work has been completed, but now  officials say they’re still talking about it.</p>
<p>“Discussions and coordination between the commonwealth and the City of Richmond continue on this issue,” said a spokeswoman for Northam, Alena Yarmosky.</p>
<p>The state has charged the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts with developing a long-term vision for Monument Avenue, the site of five Confederate monuments, all of which have now been removed.</p>

(Scott Elmquist/ Style Weekly)</p></figure>
<p>While the city plans to remove the remaining four pedestals under its ownership, the state is holding open the possibility that the Lee pedestal could figure into a redevelopment of the space.</p>
<p>The granite base was blanketed in graffiti last year during protests that followed the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis and images of the reclaimed Confederate memorial drew national attention, with The New York Times naming it one of the “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/15/t-magazine/most-influential-protest-art.html" target="_blank">25 most influential works of protest art since World War II</a>” and National Geographic featuring it on its cover.</p>
<p>The space, which previously saw little in the way of pedestrian activity, regularly drew hundreds for impromptu concerts, barbecues and pick-up basketball games. Families from around the region and country drove in to get their pictures taken. Activists, who renamed the space Marcus-David Peters Circle after a teacher killed by police in Richmond during a mental health break, planted a community garden and erected memorials to victims of police violence.</p>
<p>But the sudden surge of activity wore on neighbors along the upscale street, where houses regularly sell for more than $1 million and residents complained of noise, occasional violent confrontations and a sudden influx of human feces in alleyways and gardens. (A nearby church eventually set up portable toilets a block away.)</p>

Robert E. Lee in Richmond. (Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p>Activists who frequented the site have called the complaints overblown and pressed for the state to reopen the circle. They doubt that the fencing was ever about ensuring speedy removal of the statue so much as ending community gatherings.</p>
<p>“The fence should have never gone up,” said Princess Blanding, who is the sister of the Peters, the circle’s new namesake, and is making a third-party run for governor as a member of the Liberation Party. “They stated that they put it up for safety reasons. But the statue is already down, why is the fence still up? The reality is the fence is up to prevent us from continuing to use this as a rallying location.”</p>
<p>Nearby residents are split on the statue, though a majority of those in the immediate area supported its removal and think the pedestal should also be taken down, according to Alice Massie, who helped organize an amicus brief relaying that sentiment to the Supreme Court of Virginia.</p>
<p>Massie, however, said she and others would like to see some kind of organized programming at the site if the state chooses to reopen it. She said she hopes the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts will take the lead as part of its broader work on the street. &#8220;The neighbors would love to have the circle programmed in a thoughtful way,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Could the museum open the gates like it opens a gallery and have it curated?&#8221;</p>
<p>That’s not to say anyone has asked for the neighborhood&#8217;s input, she said. “We would like to know what they’re thinking of,” she said. “Nobody has given us any information.”</p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>Virginia Democrats are playing defense in nearly a dozen competitive House of Delegates districts this year as they defend their new majority against GOP challengers hoping to win back ground lost during Donald Trump’s presidency.</p>
<p>Commentators, observers and strategists across the political spectrum say they would not be shocked if Democrats lost between two and three seats to Republicans, an outcome that would still leave the party with a narrow majority in a chamber where they currently hold a five-seat advantage.</p>
<p>And some members of both parties say it’s not outside the realm of possibility that Democrats lose the majority entirely, ending the party’s unified control of state government after only two years &#8212; even if Democratic gubernatorial nominee Terry McAuliffe is victorious in his own tight race against Republican Glenn Youngkin.</p>
<p>“I think there are serious challenges to holding onto this trifecta,” said Gaby Goldstein, co-founder of Sister District Action Network, a Democratic-allied group that has been fundraising and phone banking for candidates in 12 competitive House districts. “I think Democrats need to be awake and aware of that possibility &#8212; any possibility that we might lose.”</p>
<p>She cited state-wide polls showing low enthusiasm among Democratic voters, who during Trump’s presidency turned out in droves for Virginia’s typically sleepy off-year elections.</p>
<p>With Trump out of office and President Joe Biden facing his own popularity problems, Democrats worry it will be tougher to get their supporters to the polls. “We know right now that Republicans have their base fired up, and we need the same,” said Heather Williams, the executive director of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Republicans working on House campaigns are voicing cautious optimism for many of the same reasons. “We feel like we have a very good chance to pick up some seats,” said Garren Shipley, a spokesman for House Minority Leader Todd Gilbert, R-Shenandoah. “We think the structural factors are favorable for our campaigns.”</p>
<p>Republicans are focusing their efforts on 10 seats, most of which are in suburban Hampton Roads and Northern Virginia. Among the most competitive, according to campaign operatives in both parties, are two races in Virginia Beach that Democrats narrowly won in 2019.</p>
<p>In one of the races, freshman Democrat Nancy Guy faces GOP lawyer Tim Anderson in a district she won two years ago by just over a tenth of a percentage point &#8212; Democrats’ narrowest margin of victory that year.</p>
<p>Guy, a retired lawyer who served a stint on the Virginia Beach School Board in the 1990s, like most Democrats, she has run ads emphasizing her party’s efforts to lower health care costs, increase funding for public schools and pass new gun restrictions.</p>
<p>And Anderson, like many of his fellow GOP challengers, is emphasizing support his campaign has received from police groups and reminding voters that Guy is endorsed by organizations that endorsed the defund the police-slogan last summer amid widespread protests following the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.</p>
<p>Republicans offered a similar message in the Virginia Beach district represented by Del. Alex Askew, who worked as a staffer in the General Assembly before winning election in 2019 by three points. He is challenged by Republican Karen Greenhalgh, who founded a custom cabinet manufacturing company and manages crisis pregnancy centers. Her campaign has zeroed in on Askew’s membership in the Virginia Legislative Black Caucus, which in 2020 released a policy platform that called for “DIVESTING from Large Law Enforcement Budgets &amp; INVESTING More in Communities.”</p>
<p>Ultimately, Democrats eschewed calls to defund, divest or otherwise reduce law enforcement budgets, instead offering successive rounds of bonuses and funding increases to police and sheriffs departments during their two years in office. But Republicans still see the issue as vulnerability given the bi-partisan unpopularity of the defund concept. “What we saw from them initially was a push that would have reallocated resources and that concerned a lot of people,” said the GOP’s Shipley.</p>
<p>In Southside, longtime Del. Roslyn Tyler faces a well-funded challenge from pharmacist Otto Wachsmann. It’s a predominantly rural district that, unlike in other parts of the state, has seen Democrats hurt by shifting demographics. Both candidates are running on support for gun rights, with Tyler reminding voters in ads that she broke with her party to oppose gun control legislation.</p>

<p><strong>66th</strong>: Mike Cherry (R) vs. Katie Sponsler (D) &#8212; R+4.6</p>

<p>Republicans also see opportunity on the outskirts of Northern Virginia, where Nick Clemente, a 32-year-old who works as membership director of the Virginia chapter of Associated Builders and Contractors has tapped professional and political connections to raise $713,000 &#8212; more than double any other GOP challenger this cycle, according to campaign finance data compiled by the Virginia Public Access Project.</p>
<p>Clemente is challenging Del. Wendy Gooditis, D-Clarke, who won election in 2017 in a district that stretches from outside Winchester into Loudoun County.</p>
<p>In Northern Virginia, the GOP is also targeting Democrats Dan Helmer, who represents parts of Fairfax and Prince William counties, and Joshua Cole, who represents Stafford County and Fredericksburg. And in the Richmond area, a Henrico County seat represented by Democrat Rodney Willett has seen more spending on television ads than any other House race in the state, with VPAP reporting more than $878,000 in ad buys.</p>
<p>Outside of the state’s populous suburbs, the Montgomery County-anchored seat represented by former television news anchor Chris Hurst is getting the most attention, drawing nearly $1 million in campaign contributions between the two candidates and more than a half million in spending on television ads, according to VPAP. Hurst won the district in 2019 by a seven-point margin.</p>
<p>Republicans are also holding out hope they might be able to take seats that have looked increasingly safe for Democrats in recent years, including the Petersburg-anchored district represented by Del. Lashrecse Aird and the Virginia Beach seat held by Kelly Convirs-Fowler.</p>
<p>Democrats see their own opportunities to pick up seats, leading some in the party to hold out hope that on a good night, they could come through with an even bigger majority. The party sees the biggest opportunity in the Colonial Heights seat vacated by former GOP House Speaker Kirk Cox, who is not seeking reelection. Cox, well known in his district, won comfortably despite the fact that its borders were redrawn by court order before the election, transforming it into a seat that leaned Democratic.</p>
<p>With Cox off the ballot, Democrats think they have a chance to nab it this time around.</p>
<p>The party is also devoting cash to an effort to knock out GOP incumbent Roxann Robinson of Chesterfield, who won in 2019 by less than point.</p>
<p>While some Democrats are publicly fretting, others are more optimistic, noting that it’s become a tradition of sorts in Virginia to underestimate the party’s chances. Del. Marcus Simon, D-Fairfax, who serves as the caucus secretary, recalled the day of the 2017 election when MSNBC’s morning hosts infamously presumed a blow-out loss for Gov. Ralph Northam, who went on to win by nine points. He said the polling this year, which, outside of a few outliers, has consistently put McAuliffe about three points ahead of Youngkin, is reminiscent of the 2017 cycle.</p>
<p>“You look at the polling for McAuliffe and, yes, he’s in the margin of error, which is surprising for a lot of folks, but on almost every poll I see, he’s in the high side of the margin,” Simon said. “I’m not terribly nervous.”</p>
<p>While Democrats face a less favorable electoral environment than during the Trump years, the party has other things going for it, Simon said. For one, this time around the party is running incumbents with whom voters are already familiar. And he said Democrats now have a track record of action on broadly popular policy issues, like raising the minimum wage.</p>
<p>Republicans, meanwhile, are focusing on less popular votes Democrats took that, for instance, raised the state’s gas tax. They say the party’s record overreaches their electoral mandate.</p>
<p>Political observers say all the pre-election prognosticating is fairly predictable &#8212; a reflection of the GOP’s need to communicate to its voters that all hope is not lost despite a string of successive statewide losses that stretches back to 2009 and Democrats’ need to remind their supporters to turn out in an off-year election.</p>
<p>But what is not up for debate is that, with Trump out of the White House, Republicans are looking at better odds than they have over any of the past four years in Virginia, said Stephen Farnsworth, director of the University of Mary Washington’s Center for Leadership and Media Studies.</p>
<p>“Whether that will be enough to win a majority in the House of Delegates, well we’ll have to see,” he said.</p>

(Ned Oliver/ Virginia Mercury)</p><p>The Virginia Employment Commission says it’s delaying the launch of a new unemployment insurance system. The announcement comes a week after legislative <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/09/20/in-numbers-virginias-struggle-to-distribute-unemployment-benefits/" target="_blank">auditors warned of “major project risks”</a> associated with the upgrade.</p>
<p>Among potential problems, the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission noted that the agency was struggling with incomplete and inaccurate conversions of existing unemployment insurance data and that the agency had no built-in redundancy in case of a system failure.</p>
<p>Auditors also noted that staff training on the new system had only started in mid-September.</p>
<p>The employment commission had planned to go live with the new system at the beginning of October. They have pushed that back a month to November.</p>
<p>Spokeswoman Joyce Fogg said the exact date is still to be determined.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are still assessing potential options, but our primary focus is to take a few more weeks to allow for more time on testing and training to ensure the best possible outcome,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The new system replaces one from 1985 that has strained under the unprecedented demand for help amid the pandemic. Among other things, officials say the new system will make it easier to submit applications, upload documents and get help with problems &#8212; all common complaints from people seeking help.</p>
<p>In the works for more than a decade, the project has faced years of delays.</p>
<p>It was initially scheduled to go live in 2013. A report by the state auditor of public accounts that year warned that staff turnover at the contractor hired to implement the new system and the possibility of budget shortfalls threatened the project’s success.</p>
<p>According to the update presented by legislative auditors last month, staff turnover remains an issue almost a decade later.</p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>Protesters outside the Loudoun County courthouse Thursday denounced a local judge who <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/09/17/virginia-judge-jails-alleged-domestic-violence-victim-for-smoking-pot-on-day-of-court-testimony/" target="_blank">sent the alleged victim in a domestic violence case to jail</a> on a contempt charge.</p>
<p>“This judge shouldn’t be on the bench,” said Lisa Sales, a women’s rights activist and domestic violence survivor who organized the gathering of about 30 people.</p>
<p>Sales called for an investigation into Judge James P. Fisher and more transparency from the state’s Judicial Inquiry and Review Commission, which is tasked with fielding complaints about judges and operates largely in secret.</p>
<p>Loudoun County Supervisor Juli Briskman described the turn of events that led 33-year-old Katie Orndoff to be held in jail for two days as misogynistic and patriarchal.</p>
<p>“This will not stand in Loudoun County,” she said.</p>
<p>Fisher ordered Orndoff jailed as she was testifying against her boyfriend in a felony domestic violence case. More than an hour into her testimony, Fisher stopped the proceedings to question whether she was intoxicated &#8212; a subject that had come up during what prosecutors described as a difficult cross examination. She said she had smoked marijuana the morning of the trial, which occurred in the afternoon.</p>
<p>He immediately ordered her jailed for 10 days and she was removed from the courtroom by deputies. She served two days before he released her on bail while she appealed the charge. Meanwhile, he declared a mistrial in the domestic violence case.</p>
<p>Prosecutors and lawyers for Orndoff both say she did not appear intoxicated and that Fisher’s inquiry violated Orndoff’s rights. They also note that marijuana is legal and it was never established that Orndoff was actively under the influence.</p>
<p>A hearing had been scheduled for Thursday to reconsider the contempt charge, but in a filing Fisher called the motion to vacate “wholly without merit.”</p>
<p>Among other things, he noted that Orndoff’s attorneys had already appealed the case to the Virginia Court of Appeals.</p>
<p>A hearing was also canceled in the domestic violence case against Orndoff’s partner, James Page Phillips, who is accused of punching her in the face twice. If found guilty, it would be his third offense.</p>
<p>But Loudoun Commonwealth’s Attorney Buta Biberaj said she doubts the case will advance given Fisher’s actions.</p>
<p>“It has made the prosecution of this nearly impossible,” said Biberaj at Thursday’s courthouse rally.</p>
<p>That said, Biberaj said her office would not give up on the case if Orndoff remains willing to testify &#8212; something she said remains to be seen.</p>
<p>“I don’t know if Mrs. Orndoff, as any victim in this case, would subject themselves to that travesty.”</p>

Ralph Northam speaks at a press conference Thursday, Aug. 5, 2021, where he announced COVID-19 vaccines would be mandatory for state employees. (Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>Last month, Gov. Ralph Northam gave state employees a choice: get vaccinated or submit to weekly testing for COVID-19.</p>
<p>Many, it appears, have chosen testing.</p>
<p>While comprehensive figures aren’t available yet, a survey of some of the largest state agencies reveals employee vaccination rates range from just over 50 percent at the Department of Corrections to 87 percent at the Virginia Department of Health.</p>
<p>Other agencies, including the Virginia Department of Transportation and the Virginia State Police, reported vaccination rates that roughly mirror the state’s overall vaccination rate of about 60 percent.</p>
<p>Northam wrote in his Aug. 5 <a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/executive-actions/ED-18-Ensuring-a-Safe-Work-Place.pdf" target="_blank">executive directive</a> that “vaccination is the only method to protect fully against the virus.” But unlike a similar order issued by President Joe Biden for the federal workforce, Northam’s directive did not actually require state employees to be vaccinated. Instead, it asked them to disclose their vaccination status and, if they are unvaccinated, submit to weekly testing at the state’s expense.</p>
<p>The directive does not require unvaccinated employees to request a formal exemption, but it does allow employees to opt out of the weekly testing if they lodge a religious rejection or have a medical reason &#8212; a step few state employees appear to have taken.</p>
<p>The testing required under the mandate has come at a cost to taxpayers.</p>
<p>The Department of Corrections, which is the largest state agency with about 11,000 employees and has implemented more stringent testing requirements of once-every-three-days for frontline employees, reported testing about 900 employees over a recent 24-hour period at a cost of about $14 per test. That works out to about $12,600 in one day.</p>
<p>State agencies have also been instructed that employee testing, which takes between 15 and 30 minutes, should be conducted on the clock, meaning unvaccinated employees are paid to take the tests. And in some cases, that means unvaccinated employees can earn overtime to take tests, though the state’s human resources guidance encourages supervisors to find time in employees’ regular schedules.</p>
<p>Procedures vary by department, but at the DOC, spokesman Benjamin Jarvela said some of the over-the-counter antigen tests the department administers are taken on site with the results verified by an observer. In other cases, employees are allowed to take the tests at home and report results on an honor system.</p>
<p>So far, the Department of Corrections appears to have one of the lowest vaccination rates among state agencies surveyed. The number of staff members vaccinated also compares poorly to the vaccination rate among prisoners, which sits at just under 70 percent.</p>
<p>DOC statistics show that even before the testing requirements were implemented on Sept. 1, COVID-19 infections among staff have outpaced those among prisoners for weeks, a reversal from the height of the pandemic. At last report, 120 staff members had “active cases” compared to 84 among prisoners.</p>
<p>The DOC’s numbers suggest its overall vaccination rate could improve in the coming weeks: The department reported 1,333 staff members are partially vaccinated.</p>
<p>While individual state agencies are tracking vaccination rates and testing results of employees, the state’s Department of Human Resource Management is still in the process of aggregating and compiling the data, said a spokeswoman for the department, Anne Waring.</p>
<p>The Mercury asked for vaccination statistics from the six largest state agencies: the Alcoholic Beverage Control Authority, Department of Corrections, Virginia State Police, Department of Motor Vehicles, Department of Health, and Virginia Department of Transportation. Together they employ nearly 30,000 of the roughly 120,000 state employees who are covered by the directive. Their combined vaccination rate is 63 percent, slightly above the state’s overall vaccination rate but below the 70 percent vaccination rate for people aged 18 and up.</p>
<p>Only one of the agencies, the Department of Motor Vehicles, has reported pursuing disciplinary action against an employee for refusing to disclose their vaccination status. “DMV is adhering to the Commonwealth&#8217;s Standards of Conduct and pursuing appropriate disciplinary action,” spokeswoman Jessica Cowardin said in an email.</p>
<p>Other agencies, like the liquor authority where 40 employees fall into the &#8220;refuse to disclose&#8221; category, say they haven&#8217;t gotten to that stage yet. &#8220;To comply with the Executive Order, we have first focused on gathering information as it relates to an employee’s vaccination status,&#8221; said a spokeswoman for ABC, Valerie Hubbard. &#8220;In the next stage of the process, the authority will engage in the interactive process for those who refused to disclose or are unvaccinated to determine if an accommodation is needed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Public health experts said testing requirements can be a useful tool to reduce the spread of COVD-19, but that it shouldn’t be used as an alternative to vaccinations.</p>
<p>“That would be a mistake,” said Dr. Taison Bell, an infectious disease specialist at UVA. “You should definitely push as hard as you can to vaccinate. I would require vaccinations in congregate settings, in addition to doing testing. We know we have this variant that’s way more infectious than prior.”</p>
<p>Bell also questioned policies that allow employees to take tests off-site and self-report results. “I think the benefit of having the rapid test is you actually can do it on-site — you don’t have to rely on the honor system,” he said.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for Northam, Alena Yarmosky, said in an email that Northam continues &#8220;to consider a range of options to boost vaccination.&#8221; But otherwise she framed the state&#8217;s approach a model the private sector should follow.</p>
<p>&#8220;This program is helping to encourage vaccination and keep our valuable workforce safe,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Again, we urge all Virginia localities and private businesses to follow our lead.&#8221;</p>

(Ned Oliver/ Virginia Mercury)</p><p>Lawmakers on Monday got their second report from legislative auditors on the Virginia Employment Commission’s struggle to meet the massive demand for unemployment benefits amid the pandemic.</p>
<p>Here’s a look at some of the statistics and figures presented in the <a href="http://jlarc.virginia.gov/pdfs/presentations/VEC_Interim_Presentation_09_2021-1.pdf" target="_blank">interim update</a> by the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission, which plans to wrap up its audit of the agency in November.</p>
<p><strong>$930 million: The estimated value of incorrect payments made to claimants in 2020</strong></p>
<p>Incorrect payments, nearly all of which were overpayments to claimants, are the result of errors made by the state and claimants filling out applications.</p>
<p>They also include fraudulent claims, of which the state estimates it has paid out a total of $70 million &#8212; a figure state auditors suspect will grow as they continue to review a backlog of another approximately 136,000 claims flagged for potential fraud.</p>
<p>The state is required to try to recover overpayments except in cases where a waiver is granted, which is an option in certain cases where the applicant isn’t at fault.</p>
<p>Secretary of Labor Megan Healy challenged the number, suggesting it is likely an overestimate and noting it includes claimants who were likely eligible for benefits but received payments through the wrong program.</p>
<p><strong>100,000: the number of pending applications for benefits awaiting review</strong></p>
<p>A class action lawsuit filed by claimants left waiting months for benefits led the state to expedite processing of 92,000 claims pending at the time of a May settlement.</p>
<p>The state met its Labor Day deadline, but in the meantime, another 100,000 claims requiring adjudication have piled up, auditors reported.</p>
<p>Auditors say the figure is current as of last month, but suggested the number will likely grow. They report an additional one million claims issues have yet to be reviewed and could ultimately require adjudication.</p>
<p><strong>85: the number of call center staffers the employment commission had at the beginning of the pandemic</strong></p>
<p>Auditors say that while the tenfold increase in applications received during the pandemic was unprecedented, the VEC entered the pandemic at a distinct staffing disadvantage.</p>
<p>The agency didn’t have enough staff to keep up with its pre-pandemic workload, said Lauren Axselle, a legislative auditor with JLARC.</p>
<p>She said the agency was also short adjudicators, with just 55 on staff, and had a limited IT staff.</p>
<p><strong>14: the number of months into the pandemic it took the state to take significant steps to increase adjudication staffing</strong></p>
<p>Auditors also say that in addition to entering the pandemic short staffed, it took more than a year for the agency to make significant headway in addressing the problem.</p>
<p>They noted that a majority of the 200 full time adjudication positions added during the pandemic were not created until 2021.</p>
<p>And outside contractors, who now represent most of the agency’s adjudication manpower, weren’t brought in until April, 14 months into the pandemic and after they were facing a lawsuit from claimants stuck in the queue.</p>
<p><strong>12: the number of years the state has been working to modernize the software it uses to administer benefits</strong></p>
<p>“And it remains incomplete,” noted Axselle.</p>
<p>She said the limited staff VEC did have was hampered by the 1985 computer system that runs the state’s unemployment insurance program and heavy reliance on paper documents.</p>
<p>The state has been working to update the system for 12 years &#8212; an unusually long timeframe for a technology project, auditors said, noting other states completed similar upgrades in between three and four years.</p>
<p>Axselle voiced concern about risks the agency faces when it tries to push the new system online next month. Among other things, she said the agency has not yet demonstrated it can accurately and completely convert UI data to the new system, there is no redundancy in case of a failure and that there is planned downtime of five to seven days, during which she said the public will be unable to file new or continuing claims.</p>
<p><strong>4: the percentage of calls seeking help that were answered</strong></p>
<p>The inability to get state staff on the phone to answer basic questions about the complex array of unemployment programs available has been a persistent complaint throughout the pandemic.</p>
<p>On that front, the state’s performance has actually gotten worse over the past year, according to auditors, who found the agency answered just 4 percent of the two million calls it received in June of this year, down from 6 percent of the 3 million calls received in June 2020.</p>
<p>Auditors noted that getting someone on the phone isn&#8217;t always that helpful, and that in some cases call center employees couldn’t answer common questions, such as when a case might be reviewed. And contract call center employees processing initial claims don’t have access to details about any existing claims.</p>
<p><strong>2: the percentage of adjudications that meet state standards for timeliness </strong></p>
<p>Under federal guidelines, issues with applications should be adjudicated within 21 days. On that front, Virginia has some of the worst performance in the country, meeting the standard in just 2 percent of cases.</p>
<p>And auditors observed that 82 percent of adjudications took longer than 70 days.</p>
<p><strong>Zero: The number of state employees at outside agencies who responded to VEC’s request for temporary help.</strong></p>
<p>This figure comes via Healy, the secretary of labor, who noted Thursday that the employment commission was initially limited in its efforts to bring on additional staff.</p>
<p>Under state personnel rules, the agency couldn’t unilaterally reassign employees from other agencies. But they did ask for volunteers.</p>
<p>Healy said there were no takers.</p>

Fisher. (Photo by Don Del Rosso/Fauquier Now)</p><p>A judge in Loudoun County interrupted the testimony of the alleged victim in a felony domestic violence trial last week to question her drug use, sentencing her to 10 days in jail for contempt of court after she said she had smoked marijuana earlier in the day.</p>
<p>She was then “physically removed from the witness stand by multiple deputies,” according to a brief filed by the commonwealth’s attorney’s office, which supports the woman’s motion to vacate the contempt charge lodged by <a href="https://www.fauquiernow.com/fauquier_news/article/fauquier-prosecutor-james-p.-fisher-appointed-to-judgeship-2019" target="_blank">Circuit Court Judge James P. Fisher</a>.</p>
<p>The woman, who prosecutors say did not appear intoxicated, served two days in jail before she was released on $1,000 bond, according to court records. Meanwhile, the case against her alleged abuser, who was facing his third domestic violence charge, ended with Fisher declaring a mistrial.</p>
<p>“In the middle of a difficult (cross examination), she was detained, interrogated, arrested and removed from the courtroom,” wrote Assistant Commonwealth’s Attorney Elena Ventura, who argued the woman was “not treated with the respect, sensitivity or dignity required by law.”</p>
<p>Marijuana is now legal in Virginia and prosecutors wrote in their brief that their witness was just anxious and nervous during the approximately hour and a half of testimony she provided. They said Fisher&#8217;s inquiry followed &#8220;intense and assertive (defense) questioning focused on drug-addiction and infidelity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Prosecutors also wrote that Fisher refused to hear from detectives who had interacted with her before the trial, who they said would have testified her “behaviors were consistent with all prior interactions and that she exhibited no signs of intoxication prior to her testimony.”</p>
<p>But the biggest issue, the commonwealth’s attorneys office said, was that Fisher’s actions “may create a chilling effect surrounding victim willingness to testify in cases of domestic violence, an area of law already replete with victims recanting and/or refusing to cooperate, due to the extensive trauma domestic violence victims experience through the cycle of power and control, especially in cases where victims have mental health concerns, as … in the case at bar.”</p>
<p>In a statement issued by her lawyers, the woman said that&#8217;s exactly the message she received in court. &#8220;I have learned that it does no good to report domestic abuse because the system and the courts appear to have no real interest in protecting victims and punishing abusers,&#8221; she said. &#8220;The judge has sent me a clear message.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fisher, the former commonwealth’s attorney of Fauquier County and onetime chair of the county’s Republican committee, was appointed by the General Assembly to an eight-year term in 2019. Efforts to reach his office were unsuccessful and judges in Virginia rarely comment on proceedings.</p>
<p>It is not the first time Fisher has jailed someone in his courtroom for contempt &#8212; a step that legal observers say is unusual in Virginia.</p>
<p>Fisher had divorce lawyer Rachel Virk jailed overnight in January 2020 after finding her in contempt of court during a hearing in which she pressed him to clarify a ruling. The Virginia Court of Appeals dismissed her appeal of the charge on a technicality, finding that because the order jailing her was signed by the clerk of court rather than the judge, there was no jurisdiction to contest it. Virk has since filed a lawsuit against the clerk of court and sheriff, which is still pending.</p>
<p>Under Virginia’s summary contempt statute, a judge can immediately fine someone up to $250 and jail them for a maximum of 10 days for misbehavior, violence, threats of violence or “vile, contemptuous, or insulting language” in court.</p>
<p>In last week’s domestic abuse trial, the witness’ lawyers say her actions did not meet that standard. The Mercury is not identifying her because she is an alleged domestic violence victim and has not given permission to use her name.</p>
<p>“She did not admit to doing any illegal activity nor did she admit to being under the influence in the courtroom,” said Thomas K. Plofchan, Jr., an attorney with Westlake Legal Group, which is representing the woman with Ryan Campbell at King Campbell Poretz Mitchell. “There was no slurring of her words, nothing that indicated that she had taken some sort of intoxicant that affected her speech or muscular movement.”</p>
<p>Plofchan also questioned the timeline, noting it was an afternoon trial and there was no inquiry as to when in the morning she had used marijuana and how much she had taken.</p>
<p>Both parties also took issue with the way Fisher questioned the witness, noting she was never advised of her constitutional and Miranda rights and that the “independent investigation” he conducted by asking her about her drug use is barred by judicial canon.</p>
<p>A hearing on the motion to vacate the contempt charge is scheduled for next week.</p>
<p>The case has not gone unnoticed by lawmakers from the region, who called Fisher’s decision to jail a domestic abuse victim troubling.</p>
<p>“Just in general when dealing with domestic violence victims, there’s a history of not treating the victim with respect and dignity and we’re supposed to be protecting them first,” said Sen. Jennifer Boysko, a Democrat who represents parts of Loudoun.</p>
<p>Sen. Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, an attorney, questioned whether the witness would have been treated the same way if she had said she had a beer that morning instead.</p>
<p>“When we passed the marijuana legalization statute, one of the things we tried to do was ensure marijuana would be treated the same as alcohol,” he said. “I think it’s important going forward that everybody remember that marijuana possession and consumption is now legal.”</p>
<p>The case has also garnered attention from marijuana reform advocates, who called the case emblematic of the stigmatization cannabis users continue to face.</p>
<p>“In 2020, Virginia ended the practice of jailing individuals for using cannabis, and in 2021 made such use explicitly legal for those age 21 and older,” said Jenn Michelle Pedini, executive director of Virginia NORML, the state chapter of the National Organization to Reform Marijuana Laws. “Yet, these changes in code do not facilitate an immediate end to the stigmatization faced by those who choose to consume cannabis, many of whom will continue to be singled out for discrimination by those still wedded to longstanding stereotypes.”</p>
<p><em>This story has been updated to include a statement issued the woman jailed on contempt charges.</em></p>

(Rappahannock Electric Cooperative)</p><p>Supporters call it a commonsense way to get broadband internet into more homes in rural Virginia. A Culpeper County couple calls it an unconstitutional infringement on their property rights.</p>
<p>The fight, which has already halted an $600 million broadband expansion project, does not appear to be going away anytime soon.</p>
<p>At issue is a <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=201&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=sb794" target="_blank">2020 law</a> allowing electric and communications utilities to string fiber along their existing poles, lines and conduit &#8212; an extensive network of infrastructure that already cuts through the far-flung mountains, fields and woodlands where the state is hoping to get residents and businesses hooked up to <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=201&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=sb794" target="_blank">high speed internet by 2024</a>.</p>
<p>The legislation allows the utility companies to sidestep the trouble and expense of negotiating with property owners along the routes, who otherwise would be entitled to compensation for the additional use of their property, even if it’s just a new strand of wire on a pole that’s been there for decades.</p>
<p>The law passed with near unanimous, bipartisan support, but when the Rappahannock Electric Cooperative attempted to invoke the provisions, it got hit with a lawsuit by the owners of a farm in Culpeper County, John and Cynthia Grano.</p>
<p>The land, where the couple raises horses and cattle, is bisected by two electric transmission lines and one local distribution line. It is also home to one electric substation.</p>
<p>“This is a corporate greed issue,” said John Grano in a phone interview, arguing utilities are taking advantage of widespread support for broadband expansion to eliminate a business cost at the expense of landowners. “We can’t get so caught up with progress that we allow the government to start to trample over property owners.”</p>
<p>Grano said he was open to negotiating a fair price with the cooperative when they approached him last year offering $5,000. But he said the talks ended when the company noted that under the new law, they would not have to offer him any compensation when it went into effect in July.</p>
<p>The cooperative, which unsuccessfully sought to have the case dismissed in federal court, did not respond to an email seeking comment. But in a news release earlier this year, they said the lawsuit had prompted them to drop plans for what they described as an $600 million residential broadband initiative.</p>
<p>“The inability for REC to use its existing rights-of-way (easements) would dramatically impact the planned broadband project’s financial feasibility,” the member-owned cooperative wrote. “This federal lawsuit illustrates the need for policymakers and courts to provide clarification of the laws and policies needed in order for cooperatives and others to be able to facilitate solutions that will bridge the digital divide.”</p>
<p>Attorney General Mark Herring announced late last year he was intervening in the case to defend the state law, describing internet access as a basic need that’s only grown more important amid the pandemic. “Transitioning to an almost exclusively online lifestyle has really highlighted just how critical rural broadband access is,” he said in a statement. “This is why I’m fighting to defend this important policy in court, because we need to make rural broadband access a top priority throughout the Commonwealth.”</p>
<p>But the efforts of the state and the electrical cooperative to bat down the lawsuit have so far been unsuccessful.</p>
<p>The cooperative had argued that because it never actually installed the fiber, exercising its rights under the law, that the Granos had suffered no harm and the case should be dismissed.</p>
<p>Federal District Judge Norman Moon disagreed in a ruling last month, writing that “When the law became effective, the Granos suffered an impairment to their contractual rights under their 1989 easement agreement with REC.”</p>
<p>“Whether REC exercised the right conferred upon it under the statute is beside the point. Significant in this case, is that, as alleged in the complaint, the law stripped the Granos of a paramount property right, altered their contractual agreement with REC, and failed to provide adequate post-deprivation remedies.”</p>
<p>The case is advancing and Granos’ lawyers at the Norfolk firm Waldo &amp; Lyle, which described the new state law as an “unconstitutional broadband boondoggle,” say they hope it will be heard by the end of the year.</p>
<p>“The Fifth Amendment says the government can’t take property without just compensation,” said Joshua Baker, a lawyer with the firm. “To them it’s a constitutional principle to the right to private property.”</p>
<p>Rappahannock Electric Cooperative, meanwhile, has framed its plans as a benefit to the entire community.</p>
<p>How much of a setback the legal challenge presents to the state’s goal of achieving universal broadband coverage by 2024 remains to be seen. Gov. Ralph Northam’s broadband czar, Evan Feinman, declined to comment on the lawsuit, called utilities “incredibly important partners” in the state’s plans.</p>
<p>“We certainly can’t get the job done without the electric coops, so anything that makes their job harder is just going to slow down and make more expensive the goal of universal broadband connectivity,” he said.</p>
<p>For his part, Grano, a newspaper editor who has long telecommuted, said he too recognizes the importance of broadband expansion. He says he just doesn’t want to lose any of his property rights in the process.</p>
<p>The problem of slow internet speeds, however, became less urgent for him recently. He says he signed up for high-speed satellite internet through Elon Musk’s Starlink.</p>
<p>“I need broadband, but I think I got it now,” he said. “I think Elon Musk solved my problem. And he didn’t take anything from me.”</p>

<p>Officials say they plan to move what had been the country’s largest remaining Confederate statue into temporary storage. From there, its fate is TBD, as are plans for Monument Avenue as a whole — a boulevard <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/06/its-not-just-the-monuments/612940/" target="_blank">built to showcase Confederate statuary</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think there&#8217;s a lot of opportunities, not just here at the circle but the whole treelined street,” Richmond Mayor Levar Stoney said as crews worked behind him.</p>
<p>Last summer Stoney oversaw the removal of four city-owned Confederate statues along the street. Gov. Ralph Northam announced plans to take down Lee around the same time, but was delayed by legal challenges only resolved last week.</p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Va. Supreme Court clears way for removal of Lee monument in Richmond&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2021/09/02/va-supreme-court-clears-way-for-removal-of-lee-monument-in-richmond/embed/#?secret=Kbbw26Nqtb#?secret=YTN9koqgpY" data-secret="YTN9koqgpY" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p>Neither Richmond nor the state have made any decisions about what to do next, instead charging the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts with leading “a community-driven effort to reimagine Monument Avenue.”</p>
<p>Northam had initially proposed dedicating $25 million for the effort, but lawmakers reduced the amount to $1 million over two years, saying they’ll revisit the issue once the VMFA comes forward with a concrete plan, which is due in September 2022.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman, Amy Peck, said the museum is still hiring staff to run the program. &#8220;Inclusivity will be central to this initiative, which will kick off within the year, and it will involve community leaders, stakeholders, artists, urban planners, archivists and historians in its planning and implementation.&#8221;</p>
<p>While the statues obviously won’t figure into a reimagined landscape, there’s been debate over the pedestals on which they once sat.</p>
<p>Northam has ordered the granite base of the Lee monument stay in place for now. The structure, transformed by a thick layer of graffiti, and the traffic circle on which it sits, became a rallying point for protesters following the death of George Floyd last year.</p>
<p>Northam’s administration unsuccessfully urged the city to follow suit.</p>
<p>“Governor Northam and our administration plan to keep the pedestal on which General Lee and his horse, Traveller, sit in place until a planning process can be completed that considers this pedestal, and all of the others along the avenue, as part of a bigger discussion,” Northam’s chief of Staff, Clark Mercer, wrote in a June letter. “Very strong arguments have been made as to why the pedestals should remain; they have artistic value in and of themselves, though also are important symbols that help us tell the story of what has happened in these spaces.”</p>
<p>Museum and arts groups also urged the city to pause before removing the pedestals. “Over the summer of 2020, Richmond citizens rapidly recontextualized several of the monument’s bases, transforming them into powerful platforms for shared voice and civic demonstration,” wrote Ashley Hawkins, the director of Studio Two Three. “We want a process that honors these efforts and envisions these platforms as sites for healing, historical recontextualization, and/or spaces for new works of art.”</p>
<p>City officials declined, <a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/richmond-design-committee-endorses-removal-of-remaining-confederate-monument-bases-fencing/article_cc08ddf9-4da2-5e01-8ad8-ee1cab7358ab.html" target="_blank">voting in June</a> to remove them, either paving over them entirely or replacing the stone work with landscaping.</p>
<p>“We’re starting the process of sort of rebuilding this part of the city, and it has to start with taking them down,” said Max Hepp-Buchanan, a member of the city&#8217;s planning commission, according to the Richmond Times-Dispatch. “I understand the heartache and pain with losing such a prominent landmark, but this is not, in my opinion, the kind of landmark we want in Richmond anymore.”</p>
<p>The Southern Poverty Law Center also backed the pedestal’s removal, writing in a statement in June that “removing the statue is not enough and that these pedestals represent the unfinished business of reckoning with our country’s Confederate past.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the four city-owned statues remain in storage under tarps outside the city’s <a href="https://apnews.com/article/us-news-richmond-racial-injustice-virginia-wastewater-07095de6084c0d73b2421d527e56d397" target="_blank">sewage treatment plant</a>. The state has not said where Lee would be taken, describing it only as “secure storage,” but Richmond television station WRIC, citing unnamed officials, reported Tuesday that it’s headed to the <a href="https://www.wric.com/news/local-news/richmond/robert-e-lee-statue-to-be-cut-in-half-sent-to-goochland-womens-correctional-center/" target="_blank">grounds of a prison outside of Richmond</a>.</p>
<p>As for what’s next, the governor’s office said only that it intends to find “a permanent, appropriate location … for its display.”</p>
<p>Likewise, the city of Richmond has not yet made any decisions about what to do with its deposed Confederates, but has solicited requests from groups interested in the statues. An <a href="https://rvagov.prod.acquia-sites.com/sites/default/files/2021-07/RCC%20Monuments%20Requests%20Research%20and%20Review%20Matrix%206.3.2021.pdf" target="_blank">array of proposals</a> have come in.</p>
<p>The Navy has formally asked for a statue of Matthey Fontaine Maury, a Confederate Naval commander who is considered the “father of modern oceanography,” &#8212; though they say they don’t intend to display it. The Valentine, a city history museum, has requested the statue of former Confederate President Jefferson Davis, who was sculpted by the institution’s namesake benefactor. A group of Civil War reenactors requested two cannons removed from the street. And the foundation that operates the Historic Ellenbrook Museum, dedicated to the family of Gen. J.E.B. Stuart in Russell County, asked for as many of the statues as the city is willing to give, describing plans to create a driving tour “called the Southwest Virginia Historical Monuments Trail.”</p>
<p>Several pro-Confederate groups have also asked for the statues, including the Sons of Confederate Veterans and a small Tennessee-based company that calls itself the “New Confederate States of America” and promised to locate the memorials on private property and guard them 24 hours a day.</p>
<p>Finally, an artist requested the city’s Stonewall Jackson statue, which he said he planned to cut into small pieces and sell.</p>
<p>The City Council has not acted on any of the requests and has not yet set out a timeline for doing so.</p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p>Among the crowd that assembled to watch workers lift Lee off his pedestal, opinions on Lee’s ultimate fate were mixed.</p>
<p>“I think they should destroy it,” said Olu Johnson, a junior at Virginia Commonwealth University. “It just doesn’t mean anything anymore.”</p>
<p>Others said they saw a home for it. Catherine Smith, a retired Richmond Public School teacher who broke into jubilant song after the statue came down, said she thought it would be appropriate to display it in a museum. “I’m not going to say blow it up,” she said.</p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>Virginia has distributed more of its share of federal rent relief money to families struggling in the pandemic than any other state in the country, according to U.S. Treasury data.</p>
<p>“This is a great thing,” said Christie Marra, the director of housing advocacy at the Virginia Poverty Law Center. “The whole goal here is to prevent massive homelessness and displacement during a pandemic. People should stay housed.”</p>
<p>In the first half of this year, Virginia provided assistance to between 6,000 and 9,000 families a month, the treasury report shows. The aid adds up to nearly a quarter billion dollars, or about 42 percent of the funding allocated.</p>
<p>The next nearest state, Texas, had distributed just under 35 percent of its federal rent relief allocation. And 40 states had distributed less than 10 percent of their allocation.<br />
<iframe id="datawrapper-chart-zosTL" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" title="Virginia leads nation in rent relief distributions" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/zosTL/1/" height="510" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" aria-label="Map"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
</script></p>
<p>State officials and advocates attribute Virginia’s success to the fact that it was one of the few states in the country to stand up a rent relief program using CARES Act funding early in the pandemic and, when that ran out, state funds. Advocates also credit the passage of emergency eviction rules that bar landlords from evicting renters without first applying for aid.</p>
<p>Marra said both actions were possible because policymakers were already well aware of the state’s high eviction rates following a 2018 report by Princeton University, which led to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/04/07/upshot/millions-of-eviction-records-a-sweeping-new-look-at-housing-in-america.html" target="_blank">a front-page story in The New York Times</a> highlighting Richmond’s status as the eviction capital of the country.</p>
<p>“We had a heightened awareness of the number of evictions in the state and just how easy it is to evict somebody here,” she said.</p>
<p>Virginia arrived at its status as a leader on pandemic housing aid in fits and starts. The state initially relied on a judicial order from the Supreme Court of Virginia to limit evictions. But by July, the courts said they could no longer justify unilaterally halting the cases and, in the absence of action by lawmakers, evictions temporarily resumed.</p>
<p>The state stood up its first rent relief program that same month and, in August, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a federal moratorium. But many tenants didn’t know about either, and, in many localities, evictions proceeded.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/with-northams-signature-new-eviction-and-utility-cut-off-protections-take-effect/" target="_blank">late November</a> that the General Assembly acted to bar landlords from pursuing eviction without first letting tenants know aid was available and applying on their behalf — an approach that has since drawn national recognition. The mandate that landlords apply for the aid then <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/06/24/virginia-has-more-than-a-billion-dollars-in-aid-for-people-behind-on-rent-heres-how-to-get-it/" target="_blank">expired this summer</a>, only to be reinstated again by lawmakers last month.</p>
<p>Despite the halting nature of the protections, aid has steadily flowed since it first became available last year.</p>
<p>“Virginia is really unique in that we have had a continuous program supporting rent relief since June of 2020,” said Amanda Love, a spokeswoman for the Department of Housing and Community Development, which is administering the program. “Many states may have just set up a program."</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" id="datawrapper-chart-Xu1Mo" style="border: none;" title="Rent relief's flow in Virginia" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Xu1Mo/1/" width="600" height="400" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" aria-label="Interactive line chart"></iframe></p>
<p>Love said the state has so far made more than 57,000 rent relief payments. Of the households that received payments, 60 percent included children under 8 years old, according to the department.</p>
<p>Under current federal rules, the state can cover past-due rent, the current month's rent and up to three months of future rent payments. The aid is capped at a total of 18 months of assistance.</p>
<p>Applicants must meet three primary financial criteria: The monthly rent must be at or below 150 percent of the federally designated fair-market rent for their locality, which ranges from $1,051 for a two-bedroom apartment in rural Lee County to $2,647 in Fairfax County. The household’s income at the time of the application must fall below 80 percent of the area median income, which, again, ranges from $43,000 for a family of three in Lee County to $74,100 in Fairfax.</p>
<p>Finally, the applicant must have experienced financial hardship that’s in some way related to the pandemic. Examples cited by the state in application materials include being laid off, having hours reduced, being unable to find work and being unwilling or unable to return to work because of child care or high risk of severe illness from COVID-19.</p>
<p>Love said that with a second tranche of $450 million coming to the state through the American Rescue Plan, Virginia has enough money to continue running the program for at least another 18 months.</p>
<p>“We’re still in the midst of a pandemic,” she said. “And we do know people still need that help.”</p>

Robert E. Lee in Richmond, which was covered in graffiti during demonstrations against police brutality and racial inequality in 2020. (Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>The Supreme Court of Virginia cleared the way Thursday for Gov. Ralph Northam to remove the Lee Monument in Richmond, one of the largest Confederate memorials in the state.</p>
<p>In two opinions issued Thursday, the Court denied challenges by a small group of neighbors and an heir to the family that initially granted the land for the monument, both of which hinged on language written into an 1890s deed requiring the state to &#8220;affectionately guard&#8221; the statue and hold it &#8220;perpetually sacred.&#8221;</p>
<p>The court called those provisions <a href="http://www.courts.state.va.us/opinions/opnscvwp/1210113.pdf" target="_blank">unenforceable</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Commonwealth has the power to cease from engaging in a form of government speech when the message conveyed by the expression changes into a message that the Commonwealth does not support, even if some members of the citizenry disagree because, ultimately, the check on the Commonwealth’s government speech must be the electoral process, not the contrary beliefs of a portion of the citizenry, or of a nineteenth-century governor and legislature,&#8221; the justices wrote.</p>
<p>Northam announced he planned to take down the state-owned memorial in June 2020 amid widespread protests for racial justice, but the lawsuits prevented work from beginning.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today’s ruling is a tremendous win for the people of Virginia,&#8221; Northam said in a news release. &#8220;Our public memorials are symbols of who we are and what we value. When we honor leaders who fought to preserve a system that enslaved human beings, we are honoring a lost cause that has burdened Virginia for too many years.&#8221;</p>
<p>Attorney General Mark Herring, whose office defended the state&#8217;s position in court, celebrated the ruling. “Today, we turn the page to a new chapter in our Commonwealth’s history – one of growth, openness, healing, and hope,&#8221; he said in a statement.</p>
<p>The statue won&#8217;t be taken down Thursday, and the exact timeline for its removal remains unclear.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is an extremely complex removal that requires coordination with multiple entities to ensure the safety of everyone involved,&#8221; said the state&#8217;s Department of General Services, which is handling removal logistics. &#8220;A date for the removal, as well as ways in which the public can view it, will be announced at a later date.&#8221;</p>
<p>The state fenced off the monument in January in preparation for the statue’s removal. Four other Confederate memorials on Monument Avenue in Richmond that are owned by the city were removed in July 2020.</p>
<p>Lee&#8217;s removal will leave just one statue standing on the street, a monument to tennis legend and city native Arthur Ashe installed in 1996.</p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>For years, Virginia has been ranked as one of the “<a href="https://apnews.com/article/business-health-coronavirus-pandemic-virginia-c64996c09bbd638db7d0e3d5923ddcb2" target="_blank">best states for business</a>.” And for years, Virginia has also been ranked one of the <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/virginia-may-be-great-for-businesses-but-a-new-report-says-its-terrible-for-workers/" target="_blank">worst states for workers</a>.</p>
<p>This year, however, the state managed to hold onto the best-for-business claim while shedding the unflattering assessment of its labor policies, rising from dead last to <a href="https://www.oxfamamerica.org/explore/research-publications/best-and-worst-states-to-work-in-america-2021/" target="_blank">number 23 in Oxfam’s annual ranking</a> of the best states for workers.</p>
<p>“Virginia has jumped pretty impressively, and the reason for that is a whole host of new policies that have been passed last year,” said Kaitlyn Henderson, a researcher at Oxfam, a left-leaning charity focused on fighting poverty around the world.</p>
<p>Oxfam, whose rankings were frequently cited by progressive groups as a counterpoint to lawmakers&#8217; focus on the state&#8217;s business friendly reputation, credited an array of policies passed by Democrats since they won control of the General Assembly in 2019, including legislation that created <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/lawmakers-vote-to-repeal-minimum-wage-exemption-for-nannies-and-maids/" target="_blank">protections for domestic workers</a>, expanded <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/08/27/breastfeeding-in-virginia-new-measures-guarantee-protections-for-nursing-mothers-but-disparities-remain/" target="_blank">accommodations for pregnant workers</a>, added protections against <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/virginia-becomes-first-southern-state-to-pass-sweeping-lgbtq-nondiscrimination-bill/" target="_blank">sexual harassment</a> and <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/04/30/virginias-minimum-wage-rises-to-9-50-an-hour-on-saturday-the-first-increase-in-over-a-decade/" target="_blank">increased the minimum wage</a>.</p>
<p>Henderson also noted legislation that opens the door to <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/virginia-lawmakers-open-door-to-collective-bargaining-with-public-employees-but-only-at-local-level/" target="_blank">collective bargaining by local public employees</a>.</p>
<p>She said one of the major gaps preventing Virginia from rising higher in the rankings is a lack of laws guaranteeing paid leave for employees. Lawmakers debated but ultimately <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/03/10/va-lawmakers-block-paid-sick-time-bill-as-coronavirus-sparks-national-conversation/" target="_blank">did not pass the legislation</a>, which was strongly opposed by business groups.</p>

(Ned Oliver/ Virginia Mercury)</p><p>A federal judge says he’s not ready to dismiss a lawsuit over Virginia’s slow processing of unemployment claims, citing among other things ongoing complaints that have been arriving in his own office.</p>
<p>“The Court continues to frequently receive telephone calls from individuals reporting difficulties processing their claims and communicating with the VEC,” wrote U.S. District Judge Henry Hudson in <a href="https://ecf.vaed.uscourts.gov/doc1/189111472623" target="_blank">an ordered filed last week</a>.</p>
<p>The Virginia Employment Commission, which throughout the pandemic has ranked <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/04/26/virginia-still-ranks-last-in-nation-for-quickly-resolving-issues-with-unemployment-insurance-claims/" target="_blank">among the slowest in the country</a> at processing claims that required human review, <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.vaed.506993/gov.uscourts.vaed.506993.39.0.pdf" target="_blank">had asked Hudson to dismiss a lawsuit</a> filed by legal aid groups around the state.</p>
<p>The commission wrote that they had met the terms of a <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/virginia-announces-progress-on-unemployment-claims-backlog-but-applications-keep-piling-up/" target="_blank">settlement</a> reached in late May, beating a deadline that required the state to adjudicate at least 95 percent of the 92,000 backlogged claims by Labor Day.</p>
<p>The legal aid groups, led by the Legal Aid Justice Center in Charlottesville, <a href="https://ecf.vaed.uscourts.gov/doc1/189011443678?caseid=506993" target="_blank">objected</a>, arguing that while the commission had addressed most of the backlog that existed as of May, thousands more claims have piled up since then.</p>
<p>“The VEC’s progress in adjudicating the pre-May 10 backlog of cases is to be commended,” the plaintiffs wrote. “There are good people at the agency, and Plaintiffs’ Counsel is aware of that. Still, many Virginians are without answers and without benefits, and several essential issues raised in this case remain unresolved.”</p>
<p>VEC responded by reiterating that the commission had met the initial terms of the settlement and that it would be inappropriate to expand and continue judicial oversight of the issue.</p>
<p>“This case has caused considerable disruption at the VEC and emotional stress for its employees, who have collectively worked tirelessly since the Settlement Order’s entry to meet these adjudication targets,” the VEC’s lawyers wrote.</p>
<p>Hudson responded by directing VEC to “devise a path to resolve remaining issues and provide the Court with a status report detailing the benchmarks for resolution within thirty days.”</p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>The state board that oversees workplace pandemic safety rules agreed to a slate of revisions Thursday, approving new language that will allow businesses to follow Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance in lieu of state regulations.</p>
<p>The change was recommended by Gov. Ralph Northam at the urging of the business community and opposed by many worker advocates.</p>
<p>“The science has outpaced Virginia’s permanent standard throughout the pandemic,” said Nicole Riley, director of the Virginia chapter of the National Federation for Independent Business. She said she was speaking on behalf of Virginia Business Coalition, which represents 34 business associations throughout the state. “We do continue to believe that a static, one-size-fits-all recommendation doesn’t fit.”</p>
<p>Virginia was the first state in the country to institute workplace safety rules last summer, which give state inspectors the authority to investigate and discipline businesses that fail to take steps to protect their employees from COVID-19. The move came after national labor groups unsuccessfully pushed the Trump administration to adopt a federal standard.</p>
<p>https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/virginia-makes-its-covid-19-workplace-safety-regulations-permanent/</p>
<p>Business groups in Virginia have opposed the measure from the beginning and they continued to urge its complete repeal Thursday. But failing that, they said the state should at least allow businesses to follow CDC guidance for their industries, which have been updated throughout the pandemic to reflect the changing situation.</p>
<p>They pointed to the fact that the current standard is silent on rules for vaccinated employees, in contrast to CDC guidance earlier this summer that vaccinated people could stop wearing masks in most places.</p>
<p>The CDC walked those guidelines back in late July as the Delta variant spread, urging the vaccinated to start wearing masks again indoors in areas where community spread is high.</p>
<p>Throughout, Virginia’s rules requiring employees to wear masks when not spaced six feet apart stayed the same.</p>
<p>While business groups saw that as evidence of the rule’s failings, worker groups framed it as an example of why the state’s stricter standard remained important, blaming the CDC’s initial relaxation of mask guidance for the delta variant’s surge.</p>
<p>“CDC standards have been shown to not be keeping people safe,” said Rachel McFarland, a lawyer with the Legal Aid Justice Center, which helped initiate the state standard with a petition for rules protecting farm workers.</p>
<p>The state’s rules have always allowed businesses to follow CDC guidelines instead of state guidelines, but only if they provided “equal or greater protection” than Virginia’s rules. The revisions strike that language.</p>
<p>Gov. Ralph Northam’s communications director, Grant Neely, did not respond to an email seeking comment on the administration’s proposal, but a lawyer with the Department of Labor and Industry, Jay Withrow, said that as things stand, many CDC guidelines go beyond the mandates in Virginia’s standard.</p>
<p>If a business opts to follow CDC guidance, it must treat all recommendations as mandates. “I’d say there’s a lot of provisions that are actually going to be more stringent,” he said.</p>
<p>The language now goes to Northam for final approval.</p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>The head of Virginia’s prison system, Harold Clarke, told lawmakers Wednesday his department is short 1,500 correctional officers, leaving essential posts unmanned and forcing remaining workers to work double shifts and come in on days off.</p>
<p>“We’re doing our best to manage a dire situation,” Clarke said.</p>
<p>His comments came during the inaugural meeting of a legislative committee tasked with studying staffing and employment conditions within the Department of Corrections, which, with more than 10,000 workers, employs more people than any other state agency.</p>
<p>Clarke blamed the low pay offered by the department for the hiring difficulties, a problem he said is largely concentrated in facilities in urban areas where there is more competition for employees.</p>
<p>The 1,500 vacancies among guards represents a quarter of all correctional officer positions &#8212; an increase of 43 percent since last summer, according to the department. Meanwhile, the turnover rate has steadily increased to 25 percent every year, while turnover rates at other state agencies have remained relatively consistent at 15 percent.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="pJNBWaIlg4"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2021/07/26/virginia-department-of-corrections-announces-plans-to-de-privatize-prison-healthcare/">Virginia Department of Corrections announces plans to de-privatize prison health care</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Virginia Department of Corrections announces plans to de-privatize prison health care&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2021/07/26/virginia-department-of-corrections-announces-plans-to-de-privatize-prison-healthcare/embed/#?secret=lZOKNpiMHC#?secret=pJNBWaIlg4" data-secret="pJNBWaIlg4" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p>Clarke said the staffing shortfalls have not risen to the level of needing to shut down facilities or stop accepting inmates, but said the situation has made facilities less safe because remaining staff work longer hours, impairing performance and lowering attention rates.</p>
<p>Even with drafting, in which corrections officers are mandated to stay and work a second shift and come in on days off, 404 posts the department considers essential remain unfilled every day, Clarke said. He said that amounts to 17 percent of positions.</p>
<p>Clarke said he’s made repeated requests for increased funding to both Gov. Ralph Northam and General Assembly leaders. His latest proposal would raise starting salaries for correctional officers from $35,000 a year to $44,000 a year, with commensurate increases for those already working for the department.</p>
<p>He put the total cost of the plan at $70 million, which would be a more than five percent increase to the department’s $1.3 billion annual operating budget.</p>
<p>“We know where our staff are going, and those places are paying more than we are paying,” Clarke said, noting Virginia State Police now start troopers at $47,000 a year and most regional jails and sheriff’s offices start officers at more than $40,000 a year.</p>
<p>Members of the committee, which is helmed by Del. Patrick Hope, D-Arlington, and Sen. Jennifer Boysko, D-Fairfax, said they would continue meeting and set out rough plans to survey Department of Corrections employees directly.</p>
<p>Some members of the committee worried that morale issues went beyond simply low pay &#8212; a point Clarke acknowledged in his hour-long remarks, saying the department is working on addressing complaints about poor management internally.</p>
<p>“We can throw money at this problem, but if it doesn’t help, what have we solved?” Hope said.</p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>LYNCHBURG — The Texas Inn sits at the end of Main Street in Lynchburg, an 86-year-old beacon for late-night drunk food with a menu centered around a Depression-era chili recipe and a grease-laden sandwich known as the Cheesy Western.</p>
<p>And for more than a decade, you could find Jacob Johns happily working the flat-top grill behind the 15-seat counter &#8212; a job he loved, until, amid a historic pandemic, he realized he didn’t.</p>
<p>“Nighttime would be fun as hell,” said the 27-year-old, who started working at the restaurant alongside his mom as a teenager. “I remember singing Queen songs on the damn bar with drunk people. And I love stuff like that. There’s no other natural endorphins than being able to make somebody smile.”</p>
<p>Like hundreds of other restaurants around the state, the Texas Inn closed when the pandemic hit. And like hundreds of other restaurants around the state, when it finally set about reopening, it found many of its former employees weren’t exactly keen on returning.</p>
<p>The impasse has led to headlines about worker shortages, promises of big bonuses for new hires and bitter, partisan debates over enhanced unemployment benefits, which many low-wage employers blame for their ongoing staffing problems.</p>
<p>Among those reluctant former employees is Johns, who has refused repeated job offers from the Texas Inn. At first, he wasn’t sure it was safe and worried working over a hot grill in a mask would lead to unsanitary levels of sweat. And in either case, they were only offering him part-time work, which he says would have cut his income by more than half.</p>
<figure id="attachment_28559" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="max-width:100%;width:1500px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/texas-inn-6.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-28559" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/texas-inn-6.jpg" alt="" width="1500" height="1000" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/texas-inn-6.jpg 1500w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/texas-inn-6-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/texas-inn-6-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/texas-inn-6-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  The grill at the Texas Inn, where a cook assembles the restaurant&#8217;s signature sandwich, the Cheesy Western. (Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p>Now he says he realized the job just wasn’t for him. He’s found a new counter to work behind at a busy vape and pipe shop where he had long been a customer as an unabashed marijuana enthusiast.</p>
<p>For a man whose only serious friction at the Texas Inn came from his penchant for smoking pot in the parking lot, it is a dream job and, he hopes, a springboard into the burgeoning legal marijuana industry.</p>
<p>“They asked me, ‘Do you want to sell bowls and bongs?’ I said, ‘Hell yeah!’,” Johns said.</p>
<p>He says he has no plans to return to the Texas Inn, even after its manager recently offered him $4-an-hour more than he’s making at the vape shop.</p>
<p>“I’m 10 times happier and 100 times more stress free.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘They can sit home and get paid and not bust a grape’</h4>

	
<p>Lynchburg is a city of 79,000 people nestled in the foothills of the Blue Ridge. And the Cheesy Western is a scrambled egg cooked with a generous ladle of oil served over a beef patty, slice of American and relish.</p>
<p>A former advance man for the Ringling Brothers Circus brought the city and the sandwich together in 1935 when he opened the business as the Texas Tavern.</p>
<p>The restaurant is now owned by another kind of promoter, Dave Saunders, an advertising executive from Richmond who bought the business in 2018 with ambitions to franchise the concept. Saunders says his foray into the restaurant world was both fun and profitable until the pandemic hit.</p>
<p>Crammed into what was once a gas station, the tiny restaurant is poorly suited to social distancing. And the clientele hasn’t been entirely receptive to precautions like mask mandates, which Saunders said led to a lifetime ban for one regular who let loose a stream of abusive language at a server who attempted to enforce emergency health regulations.</p>
<p>But as restrictions were lifted this summer and customers once again began filling the counter, Saunders said a new problem emerged: He couldn’t find enough employees to fully reopen. The restaurant started trying to ramp back up in earnest in July, but Saunders said staff shortages made it impossible to stay open seven days a week, let alone keep the late-night hours that cemented the Texas Inn’s status as a local institution.</p>
<figure id="attachment_28557" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="max-width:100%;width:1500px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/texas-inn-2.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-28557" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/texas-inn-2.jpg" alt="" width="1500" height="1000" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/texas-inn-2.jpg 1500w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/texas-inn-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/texas-inn-2-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/texas-inn-2-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Dave Saunders, an advertising executive in Richmond, bought the Texas Inn in 2018. (Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p>In addition to employees like Johns refusing to return, Saunders and longtime Texas Inn manager Rhonda Rankin said they struggled to attract new hires, even after raising wages for line cooks from $9.50 to $13.50.</p>
<p>Jobs they say were once easy to fill barely attracted applicants. People who did apply wouldn’t come in for interviews. People who did interview ignored the job offers that later came.</p>
<p>Both Saunders and Rankin place the blame squarely on enhanced and extended federal unemployment benefits, which currently provide an extra $300 a week on top of the standard state benefits. For a restaurant worker who was making $9.50 an hour before the pandemic, a job would need to offer more than $11.30 an hour at 40 hours a week to match the benefit.</p>
<p>“They can sit home and get paid and not bust a grape,” said Rankin.</p>
<p>“You’ve taken away any incentive to work,” Saunders said.</p>
<p>The sentiment is not unique to the management of the Texas Inn. Business groups nationwide have been railing against the expanded benefits for months. <a href="https://www.wvtf.org/news/2021-08-02/expanded-unemployment-benefit-targeted-by-republican-senator" target="_blank">So have Republican lawmakers</a>, who earlier this month in Virginia put forward state budget amendments that would have ended the enhanced benefits &#8212; a proposal that was roundly rejected by Democratic majorities.</p>
<p>Saunders says he doesn’t blame any of his would-be employees for deciding to stay on unemployment over a job that would pay less.</p>
<p>“I would do the exact same thing,” he says. “Why wouldn’t you?”</p>
<p>But he does fault the state and federal government for giving employees what he views as the choice not to work.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">1.4 million job openings</h4>

	
<p>The current hiring crunch is affecting a range of industries, but none more than hospitality and leisure businesses, which took the biggest hit during last year’s economic shutdowns.</p>
<p>Before the pandemic, restaurant employers nationwide reported 807,000 unfilled job openings. As of June this year, that number had shot up to 1.4 million, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor statistics.</p>
<p>As businesses try to fill those jobs, competition between employers is fierce. In Virginia, the leisure and hospitality industry has added 46,000 new employees to payrolls since last summer, according to the Virginia Employment Commission. No category of employer has reported adding more jobs.</p>
<p>Economists say it’s unsurprising low-wage employers like diners are struggling to attract workers in the current climate. But unlike business owners, they doubt that enhanced unemployment benefits deserve much of the blame.</p>
<p>They point to studies in GOP-led states that cut off extra unemployment benefits early. While business groups expected a surge in job seekers, multiple studies have shown that any boost in employments were marginal. One <a href="https://files.michaelstepner.com/pandemicUIexpiration-summary.pdf" target="_blank">recent paper</a> found that for every eight workers who lost their benefits, one found a job.</p>
<figure id="attachment_28555" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="max-width:100%;width:1500px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/texas-inn-4.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-28555" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/texas-inn-4.jpg" alt="" width="1500" height="1000" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/texas-inn-4.jpg 1500w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/texas-inn-4-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/texas-inn-4-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/texas-inn-4-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  The Cheesy Western, the Texas Inn&#8217;s signature sandwich, is a hamburger served with a scrambled egg, American cheese, a house-made relish and lots of oil. (Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p>Instead, they found overall spending dropped, suggesting the cuts could have actually <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/20/business/economy/unemployment-benefits-economy-states.html" target="_blank">hurt the economy</a>.</p>
<p>Ardavan Mobasheri, an economics professor at University of Richmond who spent years in the private sector and still manages a wealth management company, said business owners forget how much federal aid programs have helped them by injecting so much cash into the economy.</p>
<p>“Retail sales are much higher than where they were before the pandemic,” Mobasheri said. “So if you’re not able to grab some of this spending on clothes, dinners and other stuff people are buying, then you’re doing something wrong.”</p>
<p>He says there is increased competition for labor, but it’s not coming from public benefits. Instead, he points to companies like Walmart, CVS and Target that have raised wages and offered better benefits, including covering college tuition for employees.</p>
<p>“Why would you go work at a hot dog shop when McDonald’s is offering $14 an hour and Target is offering to pay your college tuition?”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Where have all the line cooks gone?</h4>

	
<p>So if economists don’t think unemployment benefits are the primary factor in restaurant owners’ struggle to staff up, what is?</p>
<p>Suqin Ge, a labor economist at Virginia Tech, says the pandemic has fundamentally changed the decision making that goes into job hunting.</p>
<p>First, the threat of illness and death made working objectively worse. A study out of California found <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/02/jobs-where-workers-have-the-highest-risk-of-dying-from-covid-study.html" target="_blank">line cooks had the highest risk of dying</a> during the pandemic. And then there’s new responsibilities that come with public-facing jobs. “The hardest thing is, we had to be the mask police,” Rankin said. “Do you know how many times we got cussed out? Quite a few.”</p>
<p>On the other side of the equation, the pandemic made the value of staying home a lot higher for some people.</p>
<p>Some workers near or at the retirement age opted to go ahead and leave the labor market, Ge said. Some have decided to stay home and care for kids who aren’t in school or daycare &#8212; a category that has disproportionately impacted women, who still tend to shoulder childcare duties. Some stayed home to care for sick relatives.</p>
<p>And then there’s people like Johns, the Texas Inn’s longtime line cook, who followed his dreams to a local headshop.</p>
<figure id="attachment_28556" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="max-width:100%;width:1500px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/texas-inn-3.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-28556" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/texas-inn-3.jpg" alt="" width="1500" height="1000" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/texas-inn-3.jpg 1500w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/texas-inn-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/texas-inn-3-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/texas-inn-3-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Jacob Johns worked as a line cook at the Texas Inn for more than a decade, but decided not to come back after being laid off amid last year&#8217;s shutdowns.

<p>“Maybe some people, they just say, ‘I see how uncertain this world is,’ and decided to pursue a new occupation or go back to school,” Ge said.</p>
<p>When he was first offered his job back, Johns said he just wasn’t ready to return given the safety concerns. And, yeah, he says, the unemployment benefits he was getting made the decision easier — but only for a few weeks.</p>
<p>That’s because not long after he declined the Texas Inn’s offer of part-time employment, his benefits were abruptly cut off because the business reported that he’d refused an offer to return. The Virginia Employment Commission maintains a tip line that allows business owners to report former or prospective employees who decline employment offers, triggering an end to any jobless benefits.</p>
<p>He says the same thing happened to other employees and it irked him, because he didn’t consider the offer of part-time employment and the salary it would provide equivalent to the job he used to hold.</p>
<p>He said his negative feelings for the business intensified later in the pandemic after he saw Saunders, the Texas Inn’s owner, posting on Facebook about his purchase of a luxury boat. Johns also happened to know that around the same time, the Texas Inn had been approved for a low-interest government loan aimed at helping distressed businesses.</p>
<p>So a few months ago when the restaurant later tried to lure him back with an offer of $14 an hour &#8212; more than he’s ever made &#8212; he said he declined.</p>
<p>“It just didn’t sit right, but bygones be bygones,” Johns said. “It opened a door.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Of boats and bailouts</h4>

	
<p>Saunders said his purchase of a boat had nothing to do with the Texas Inn or the $250,000 in government aid the restaurant received through federal loan programs, <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/coronavirus/bailouts/search?q=texas+holdings+incorporated+va" target="_blank">according to public databases</a>.</p>
<p>He says the business took a $120,000 loss last year, forcing him to inject $75,000 of his own cash. As for the boat, he says his advertising business in Richmond did great during the pandemic and, anyway, he was in need of housing after a recent divorce and decided to buy a boat instead of a condo.</p>
<p>“People are like, ‘Dave’s rich. He’s got a boat,’” Saunders said. “Well, that’s where I live on the weekends.”</p>
<p>Saunders said that while he opposes continued enhanced unemployment benefits, he thinks giving aid to restaurants hurt during the pandemic makes sense because it was the government that limited their operations in the first place. “I’m happy they did it, and without that, we would not have a business,” he said.</p>
<figure id="attachment_28560" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="max-width:100%;width:1500px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/texas-inn-5.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-28560" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/texas-inn-5.jpg" alt="" width="1500" height="1000" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/texas-inn-5.jpg 1500w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/texas-inn-5-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/texas-inn-5-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/texas-inn-5-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Tammy Bragg works the grill at the Texas Inn in Lynchburg. Before taking the job two months earlier, she had been out of the labor market for two years to take care of her grandchildren. (Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p>As for benefits for workers, Saunders is aware studies have shown that ending unemployment benefits early hasn’t had the anticipated impact in the red states that have tried it. But he and Rankin say they’ve also heard directly from people they want to hire that the benefits associated with staying home are just too good to pass up.</p>
<p>With enhanced benefits scheduled to end in two weeks and President Joe Biden’s administration signaling it has no plans to extend them, the debate could soon be moot.</p>
<p>Saunders said last week he’s already seen an increase in job applications and hopes he’ll be able to bring enough people on to get back to the business’ 24-hour-a-day weekend hours.</p>
<p>For his part, Johns said restaurants looking for workers should think more about the way they operate their businesses. “It’s not the pay, it’s just the craziness,” he said. “It’s not the best work environment, I’ll put it to you like that.”</p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>Virginia lawmakers are already discussing speeding up the three-year delay between marijuana legalization last month and the beginning of retail sales.</p>
<p>“We have legalized the use of marijuana, but we have not legalized the actual purchase of marijuana,” said Del. Paul Krizek, D-Alexandria, during the inaugural meeting Tuesday of the legislature’s Joint Commission on Cannabis Oversight.</p>
<p>“What we need to do is get the safe sales of marijuana out there as soon as possible.”</p>
<p>Members of the commission outlined a proposal from the state’s four licensed medical marijuana producers to begin selling to recreational customers while the broader marketplace ramps up.</p>
<p>The medical industry, which currently can only sell to patients registered with the state board of pharmacy, had unsuccessfully pushed for the measure as lawmakers debated legalization last year. But the proposal didn’t make it into the final bill because lawmakers said they were worried it would give the companies an unfair head start and make it harder for small and minority owned businesses to compete later.</p>
<p>“Every other state that has legalized cannabis has leveraged their existing medical market to not just increase access but generate the tax revenue and funds for social equity priorities,” said Ngiste Abebe, the vice president of public policy at Columbia Care, which controls two of the state’s medical marijuana licenses.</p>
<p>But some lawmakers are sounding less comfortable with their decision to legalize marijuana without providing a way to buy it. Currently, the only legal way to obtain the drug is to grow it yourself or receive it as a gift from someone who has, and even that arrangement is complicated by the fact that it is not legal to purchase seeds or plants.</p>
<p>Krizek worried that waiting until 2024 to open the recreational marketplace &#8212; time lawmakers said they needed to write regulations and begin issuing licenses &#8212;would only boost illegal market.</p>
<p>“People know it’s legal and they probably think they can buy it legally. And it’s going to become more and more difficult to explain that to the general public,” he said. “We don’t want to facilitate an illegal market out there.”</p>
<p>David Mays, a General Assembly legislative analyst, said medical industry is suggesting that lawmakers give them temporary licenses to sell to recreational customers on the condition that they each serve as an incubator for five new licensees who qualify for a planned social equity program, which is aimed at directing a portion of new marijuana business licenses to Black Virginians, who faced disproportionate enforcement of marijuana laws under prohibition.</p>
<p>While several members voiced support for the approach, House Majority Leader Charniele Herring, D-Alexandria, said she was skeptical, worrying the plan would actually end up hurting the state’s social equity program. She cited past efforts by the state to help minority and woman-owned businesses, which she said haven’t always been particularly successful.</p>
<p>“A minority or woman is brought in and a company says, ‘We’ll incubate you. You’re a partner. Wink,’” Herring said. “Then they get access to a social equity license. It does harm to the whole spirit of what we were trying to do.”</p>
<p>Sen. Adam Ebbin, D-Alexandria, who chairs the oversight commission, called it “an important issue to flag.” Asked after the meeting whether he expected legislation would be forthcoming that moved up the date of retail sales, he said it was still too early to say. The General Assembly reconvenes for its next regular session in January.</p>
<p>“It’s worthy of this subcommittee to consider if it can be done while still ensuring robust participation by social equity applicants,” he said.</p>

(Photo by Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>Virginia lawmakers agreed to devote $700 million in federal pandemic aid to broadband expansion, a sum of money they say will allow them to connect every household in the state to high-speed internet.</p>
<p>The money is a victory for rural localities that view high-speed internet access as critical to their survival but have struggled to convince companies to build out the infrastructure. It’s also a boon for telecommunications companies, who will receive the lion&#8217;s share of the funding to build out private, for-profit networks.</p>
<p>Here’s what we know about how the state plans to spend the money and what consumers can expect.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">How many Virginians is this going to help and how soon will they be able to log-in?</h4>

	
<p>Virginia estimates that there are currently 233,500 households and businesses without high-speed internet access. But the state can’t say for sure exactly how many people lack access because internet providers have refused to provide <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/04/09/virginia-is-pursuing-universal-broadband-coverage-but-comcast-and-verizon-wont-say-where-the-gaps-are/" target="_blank">detailed coverage maps</a>.</p>
<p>Evan Feinman, who serves as Gov. Ralph Northam’s chief broadband adviser, nonetheless says he’s confident in the estimate. And he says the lack of maps, while annoying, shouldn’t stop the state from building out networks because the state has set up a system that requires internet service providers to prove they’re already covering an area if a competitor requests funding in territory they serve.</p>
<figure id="attachment_28487" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="max-width:100%;width:828px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Broadband-Map-ITBX-2021-8-13.png" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-28487" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Broadband-Map-ITBX-2021-8-13.png" alt="" width="828" height="450" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Broadband-Map-ITBX-2021-8-13.png 828w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Broadband-Map-ITBX-2021-8-13-300x163.png 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Broadband-Map-ITBX-2021-8-13-768x417.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 828px) 100vw, 828px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  A state map shows parts of Virginia (in purple) where no residential broadband is reported. The state defines broadband as delivering download speeds of at least 25 Mbps. (<a href="https://broadband.cgit.vt.edu/IntegratedToolbox/" target="_blank">Virginia Broadband Availability Map</a>)</p></figure>
<p>As for timing, Northam and General Assembly Democrats have trumpeted the program as delivering universal coverage by 2024. But it could take a little longer than that, Feinman says. Instead, he says the state expects to have lined up all the fully funded projects by then and underway, but “can’t promise construction will be complete.”</p>
<p>Regardless, he says the massive funding boost sets the state up to be one of the first large states to achieve universal coverage.</p>
<p>“It is a tremendous jump start,” he said.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Is $700 million enough money to make all those connections?</h4>

	
<p>If anything, Northam’s administration thinks it could end up being more than enough, with some of the funds ultimately returned to the General Assembly to be reallocated.</p>
<p>But the size of the allocation became a matter of debate during the special legislative session that ended last week, with Republicans in the Senate pushing to increase the allocation to a full $1 billion.</p>
<p>Sen. Ryan McDougle, R-Hanover, argued the additional funding would mean connections get made faster &#8212; something he called critical as the pandemic continues. “Time is of the essence because of the things that are changing with our economy,” he said. “Particularly in the times when you have to work from home or do education from home or do telemedicine.”</p>
<p>Feinman responded that he appreciates McDougle’s perspective, but he’s confident in the state’s projections. “This year we’re going to fund every good project we have in front of us,” he said.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Who is going to get all this cash?</h4>

	
<p>The money will be distributed through the Virginia Telecommunication Initiative, which distributes grants to internet service providers who team up with government entities to apply for funds.</p>
<p>While publicly-owned ISPs, of which there are few in Virginia, will be eligible for the funds, Northam’s administration expects most of the grants will go to private providers, who will then fully own the infrastructure that the state helped pay for.</p>
<p>“It will be a mixture of medium-sized internet service providers, electric cooperatives and municipal providers,” Feinman said.</p>
<p>He said major ISPs like Cox and Comcast have traditionally not been significant recipients of grant funding because of their focus on metropolitan areas. Instead, he said midsized providers like Point Broadband in Southwest Virginia, All Points Broadband and the Central Virginia Electrical Cooperative have been some of the biggest funding recipients to-date.</p>
<p>The role of municipal providers has been the subject of intense lobbying, and recent legislation that for the first time allowed government-run internet companies to compete for state funding drew <a href="https://roanoke.com/news/local/measure-to-expand-broadband-in-rural-virginia-faces-uncertain-future-in-budget-negotiations/article_085e47f1-3727-5155-92e9-90ee7edc1bc3.html" target="_blank">strong pushback</a> from major telecoms.</p>
<p>Feinman said that while the state is allowing municipal providers to compete for the funds, Northam’s administration hasn’t emphasized publicly-owned networks because it views them as risky endeavors that duplicate resources like fleets and infrastructure that private providers already have in place. “The reason we have the model that we have is we don’t want localities or the commonwealth to bear the risk of a network not being profitable or to have to replicate services that already exist at scale in private or nonprofit sector,” he said.</p>
<p>“Existing ISPs already exist, so we don’t have to reinvent the wheel.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What kind of internet speeds are we talking about here?</h4>

	
<p>The state isn’t setting hard benchmarks for what speed internet projects will qualify for funding, but as grants are doled out, projects that deliver faster speeds are prioritized in the scoring process.</p>
<p>For a project to be eligible, it must deliver broadband to areas where current speeds are below<a href="https://www.usnews.com/360-reviews/internet-providers/what-is-a-good-internet-speed" target="_blank"> 25 Megabits per second</a> download and 3 Megabits per second upload.</p>
<p>In practice, however, Feinman says nearly all of the projects the state is funding deliver fiber connections directly to homes, which is the fastest internet infrastructure currently available.</p>
<p>“Our strong preference is for an all-fiber network,” he said.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Will subscription fees be affordable?</h4>

	
<p>That remains to be seen. The state doesn’t set pricing requirements in conjunction with the grants, though, again, the grant scoring process favors providers who offer low-cost options and equity programs.</p>
<p>“What we’ve seen is that the ISPs going out into rural areas &#8212; they want people to take service,” Feinman said. “They’re usually matching their costs to what the market can bear. They’re usually not just offering high-end service. For example, Prince George Electric Cooperative has $50 package. They charge enough to operate and that’s it.”</p>
<p>For people who can’t afford base packages, Feinman says he hopes the federal government will continue to offer an emergency broadband benefit to low-income people that it began during the pandemic and covers $50 a month for internet access.</p>
<p>Congress has already taken a <a href="https://www.rollcall.com/2021/08/13/something-for-everyone-in-infrastructure-deals-broadband-section/" target="_blank">step in that direction</a>, with the Senate passing an infrastructure bill that would make the aid permanent, though it reduces the monthly benefit to $30.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What about Elon Musk’s Starlink and other emergent satellite providers?</h4>

	
<p>Finally, the plan has some in rural areas wondering why emergent satellite internet providers like Starlink aren’t included in the program.</p>
<p>The company, founded by Elon Musk, floats constellations of low-orbit satellites that are capable of high speeds that earlier generations of satellite providers are unable to provide. Its currently in beta testing, but has partnered with Wise County to provide free internet service to <a href="https://www.wdbj7.com/2021/02/01/wise-county-students-connect-with-new-starlink-internet-service/" target="_blank">45 families</a> who otherwise wouldn’t have access. School officials say they hope to have 3,000 children connected <a href="https://www.wjhl.com/news/local/spacex-internet-partnership-to-extend-to-more-counties-after-wise-co-schools-families-see-success/" target="_blank">by the end of the year</a>.</p>
<p>Jack Kennedy, the clerk of courts in Wise and an avowed space enthusiast, hopes the state will allow the funds to help purchase the expensive routers and antennas required to provide immediate connection for unserved residents.</p>
<p>“When they can get broadband in months as opposed to years, it makes a difference,” Kennedy said. “Particularly if we are talking about an economic development initiative, then this region &#8212; central Appalachia &#8212; needs it now instead of later.”</p>
<p>Feinman counters that it’s too early to consider dedicating public funds to the technology. For one, he said, the program is still in testing, so it’s unclear if equipment purchased now will still work in the future. He also questions the long-term economic viability of the project and whether space companies would even be able to provide enough connections and bandwidths to make a meaningful dent in the state’s rural broadband problem.</p>
<p>Kennedy is bullish on the new tech, which he believes could ultimately prove faster than fiber. But he says ultimately, the state can benefit from both.</p>
<p>“This is not a war between space forces and ground forces,” he says. “It’s mutual acceptance of both. And right now my largest concern with policy at the state and federal levels has been a definition of infrastructure that excludes space-based constellations.”</p>

They are: (Top row) Dominique A. Callins of Front Royal, Doris Henderson Causey of Henrico, Vernida R. Chaney of Alexandria, and Frank K. Friedman of Roanoke. (Bottom row) Junius P. Fulton of Norfolk, Lisa M. Lorish of Charlottesville, 
Daniel E. Ortiz of Fairfax, and Stuart A. Raphael of Arlington.</p><p>Virginia Democrats quadrupled the number of Black judges and doubled the number of women on the state’s Court of Appeals with the election of eight new judges Tuesday.</p>
<p>Members of the party said the selections would make the court the most diverse in the state’s history.</p>
<p>“I think it’s important that when individuals look at the court, that they see they too can be on one of the highest courts in the state,” said House Majority Leader Charniele Herring, D-Alexandria, who chairs the chamber’s courts committee. “And I think when we have a diversity of perspectives, it makes the decisions better.”</p>
<p>The unusually large block of appointments was made possible by legislation passed earlier this year that expanded the number of seats on the court from 11 to 17, part of <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/03/08/virginia-court-of-appeals-set-to-get-six-new-judges-after-lawmakers-agree-to-expansion/" target="_blank">a legal reform that will broaden the court’s jurisdiction</a> to guarantee appellate review of all civil and criminal circuit court decisions. Virginia has been the only state in the country that doesn’t grant such a by-right appeal.</p>
<p>The expansion drew accusations of court packing from Republicans, who also criticized the <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/08/04/virginia-democrats-meet-in-private-to-choose-finalists-for-eight-court-of-appeals-appointments/" target="_blank">secretive approach</a> Democrats took last week as they met with nominees in private to make their selections.</p>
<p>Supporters frame the court’s expansion as an important reform that has drawn bi-partisan support from within the legal community. But Democrats also weren’t shy about the fact that it would also give them an opportunity to make a decisive mark on a court whose make up has been shaped by years of Republican control.</p>
<p>“It’s truly historic and I think we’re going to make a huge difference in the court and I hope we can bend the court to a more balanced court,” said Sen. John Edwards, D-Roanoke, who leads the Senate’s court committee.</p>
<p>To GOP accusations of court packing, Edwards responded, “Well, they picked the courts the last 20 years.”</p>
<p>From the start, Democrats said they would make diversity a priority in the appointment process.</p>
<p>The court is currently made up of mostly White men, with one Black judge and three female judges sitting on the panel. In addition to the six new seats created as part of the court’s expansion, Democrats also filled two vacancies, one of which has remained empty for two years after Democratic caucuses in the House and Senate were unable to agree on a candidate.</p>
<p>In addition to gender and racial diversity, Democrats said they also prioritized electing judges with varied professional experience. Most of the judges currently on the court either previously served as prosecutors or worked in the Attorney General’s office, lawmakers said.</p>
<p>The new class of judges includes two current and former public defenders and a longtime legal aid attorney &#8212; professional backgrounds that have never before been represented on one of the state’s high courts.</p>
<p>Sen. Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, a defense lawyer who was among the group of lawmakers who led the selection process, said the tendency toward elevating prosecutors to the bench has had real world consequences for criminal defendants. As an example, he cited precedent set over the past several decades limiting judges’ discretion to dismiss criminal cases &#8212; case law Democratic lawmakers have worked to reverse with legislation since they took majorities in the House and Senate in 2020.</p>
<p>“I don’t think there’s any question that the court would benefit from having more members with experience in criminal defense,” Surovell said.</p>
<p>During public interviews lawmakers conducted Tuesday, several candidates said they expected to draw on those backgrounds when they took the bench.</p>
<p>“I’ve seen how cases are brought when you have all the resources in the world and I’ve seen how cases are prepared when you have very little,” said Lisa Lorish, an assistant federal public defender from Charlottesville. “And I think I would bring that experience with me.”</p>
<p>Doris H. Henderson Causey, who is the managing attorney at the Central Virginia Legal Aid Society, told lawmakers her work providing civil representation for low-income Virginians has helped her appreciate the plight of the disenfranchised and marginalized.</p>
<p>“There’s a constituency that has never been represented on that court and those are the people that I serve,” she said.</p>
<p>Democrats also elected:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dominique A. Callins, a family law lawyer from Front Royal;</li>
<li>Vernida R. Chaney, the former senior assistant public defender in Fairfax and assistant capital defender;</li>
<li>Frank K. Friedman, a well-known appellate lawyer who practices in Roanoke.</li>
<li>Norfolk Circuit Court Judge Junius P. Fulton III, who oversaw the development of the city’s drug court, an alternative sentencing program, and presided over it for two decades &#8212; longer, he says, than any other judge in the state;</li>
<li>Fairfax County Circuit Court Judge Daniel Ortiz; and</li>
<li>Stuart Raphael, a former solicitor general of Virginia who works in appellate law and lives in Arlington.</li>
</ul>
<p>Republicans opposed the selections at nearly every step of the process, accusing Democrats of being unusually secretive as they winnowed down the list of applicants in private.</p>
<p>Judicial selections, which are the sole purview of the General Assembly, are typically partisan exercises prone to accusations of cronyism. (Republicans made headlines in 2019 when they <a href="https://roanoke.com/news/politics/judge-teresa-chafin-sister-of-sen-ben-chafin-elected-to-virginia-supreme-court/article_b46c4a65-6fb0-51b3-b06b-9b93eba4b54c.html" target="_blank">elected a sitting senator’s sister to the Supreme Court of Virginia</a>.)</p>
<p>But members of the GOP said Democrats broke with tradition by interviewing candidates as a group in private last week and only making their selections public on Monday afternoon &#8212; less than 24 hours before lawmakers would be called to vote on them.</p>

<p>Sen. Mark Obenshain, R-Rockingham, walked out of the Senate committee meeting Tuesday morning as candidates were being interviewed after voicing frustration that GOP members had only been provided with background and application materials about the candidates that morning.</p>
<p>Republicans also voiced frustration that no alternative candidates would be considered or interviewed by Democrats, though Democrats in the Senate did offer to interview anyone put forward by the GOP. At the same time, however, they made clear those candidates had no chance of ultimately being selected because Democrats in the House were unwilling to make a similar concession.</p>
<p>On the Senate floor, Obenshain said he appreciated the gesture, but wondered whether it would be “a fool’s errand.”</p>
<p>Edwards responded that, “the characterization of a fool’s errand is the senator’s characterization, but I think the senator gets the point.”</p>

(Scott Elmquist/ Style Weekly)</p><p>Thousands of school bus drivers around Virginia who turned to unemployment benefits to weather the pandemic are being asked to pay the state back &#8212; a financial demand drivers say has filled them with anxiety, stress and dread.</p>
<p>“How the hell am I ever going to come up with over $7,000 for the state of Virginia?” said Christina Riblett, a 41-year-old Fairfax County resident who has been transporting children for the local school district for almost a decade.</p>
<p>The dispute stems from a quirk in federal law that limits when school employees qualify for unemployment benefits, a rule that in normal times is aimed at preventing people whose work schedules include summers off from receiving benefits between terms.</p>
<p>But drivers and their advocates say the collection effort ignores the realities of both the pandemic and bus driving as a profession, in which many drivers work through the summer transporting children to summer school and other programs &#8212; nearly all of which were canceled last year.</p>
<p>The Virginia Education Association, which is representing the drivers in the dispute, had hoped that the General Assembly would take a step to address the problem during the ongoing special legislative session. But as of Monday, lawmakers had concluded the bulk of their work and no solution was forthcoming.</p>
<p>Instead, Virginia Secretary of Labor Megan Healy and a spokeswoman for the Virginia Employment Commission says the state will review each claim on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p>“We are taking every bus driver case seriously and hopefully we’ll have it resolved soon,” Healy said.</p>
<p>She said some of the claims were clear cut: Drivers had been scheduled to work summer terms that were subsequently canceled and have documentation to that effect. In those cases, she expects the state to waive repayment. But she said other cases are more complicated.</p>
<p>Riblett falls into the clear-cut camp. She said she was signed up to drive special education students to summer school last year, but the semester was ultimately canceled. She says at her supervisor’s recommendation, she and other drivers applied for and began receiving unemployment benefits — money she described as a lifeline at an uncertain time.</p>
<p>“My husband was also furloughed and if it would not have been for the unemployment benefits, we would not have been able to pay our mortgage, buy ourselves groceries — just the basic essentials like keeping the lights on,” she said.</p>
<p>She says she stopped claiming benefits when the regular school year began again and she started receiving her salary. She assumed that was the end of it until late this winter when she received a letter from the employment commission demanding she pay back all the benefits she had received.</p>
<p>The Virginia Education Association estimates several thousand bus drivers are in a similar situation. “Hardworking school employees who legitimately lost income for cancelation of summer work are being required to pay VEC thousands of dollars,” said a spokesman for the group, Tom Allen, in a statement.</p>
<p>The state disputes that all of the school bus drivers who are being asked to repay the benefits were entitled to the aid in the first place.</p>
<p>Healy said some drivers who don’t typically work summers also applied for and received benefits. And she said some drivers applied and began receiving checks even as they continued to be paid by their local school district.</p>
<p>“They said they were making zero and they were still getting a paycheck,” Healy said. “I don’t like to use the word fraud, but that’s the term.”</p>
<p>Like Healy, a spokeswoman for the Virginia Employment Commission, Joyce Fogg, said the cases must be reviewed individually. “It will depend on the term of their contract, work history for number of summers worked,” Fogg said.</p>
<p>While the state works through the cases, bus drivers like Riblett say they feel like they’re living in financial limbo, uncertain how they’ll come up with the money the state has demanded from them.</p>
<p>Healy said her office has tried to communicate to drivers who are likely to receive repayment waivers via the school district that employ them. She said her message is not to stress because so far the state has “not collected a dime in overpayment.”</p>
<p>And she said even if an overpayment is determined to be the fault of the driver and must be repaid, she said the state does not garnish refunds or take other collections efforts as long as people who owe stick to a payment plan that can be as low as $10 a month.</p>
<p>Riblett, however, says it’s hard to relax about the situation when her first two appeals were denied.</p>
<p>“My only problem with this whole thing is that VEC has not on one occasion, not on two occasions, but on three separate occasions said, ‘No , we don’t care about your circumstances, we want our money back.’</p>
<p>“My faith in this waiver process being fair and impartial is nonexistent because they haven’t been fair and impartial this entire time.”</p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>A year and a half into the pandemic, the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles is still operating on an appointment-only basis.</p>
<p>Some state lawmakers, angered by wait times that can last months, say it’s time for that to change.</p>
<p>“I get complaints all the time about DMV and people not being able to get in,” said Sen. Chap Petersen, D-Fairfax City, during a floor debate in the Senate this week. “My license has been expired for three months, just to give you one example.”</p>
<p>Petersen successfully persuaded his colleagues in the Senate to insert language into the budget lawmakers are debating in a special session that started this week which would require the DMV to immediately resume walk-in service.</p>
<p>The measure still has to get past the House of Delegates and Gov. Ralph Northam, who ultimately oversees the DMV as head of the executive branch. And the DMV has made clear it’s not ready to go back to the packed waiting rooms that were a hallmark of its pre-pandemic operations.</p>
<p>In response to the Senate’s push for a full reopening, DMV leaders counter that they’re actually operating more efficiently and serving more customers than before the pandemic thanks to a shift to more online and over-the-phone services while keeping employees safe by limiting in-person services to people with timed appointments.</p>
<figure id="attachment_3884" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:300px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/senate-retreat-11.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-3884" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/senate-retreat-11-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/senate-retreat-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/senate-retreat-11-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/senate-retreat-11-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/senate-retreat-11-696x464.jpg 696w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/senate-retreat-11-1068x712.jpg 1068w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/senate-retreat-11-630x420.jpg 630w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/senate-retreat-11.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  State Sen. Chap Petersen, D-Fairfax City.</p></figure>
<p>A DMV spokeswoman, Jessica Cowardin, said the agency processed 388,000 transactions last week, up from 309,000 per-week before the pandemic began.</p>
<p>Cowardin also said feedback from customers suggests most people actually like the appointment-only model, citing an internal survey that found 77 percent of customers wanted the agency to continue offering appointments.</p>
<p>“By installing an appointment system we have become more efficient, transactions are conducted quickly and customer wait times have been minimized,” she wrote in an email. “And appointment availability will continue to increase as we are able to hire and train employees and emerge more fully from the pandemic, which is still ongoing.”</p>
<p>Lawmakers in the Senate say that if other public-facing government services can fully reopen, so should the DMV. “I remind you that in two weeks, we are going to send 1.2 million school children back into school buildings,” Petersen said.</p>
<p>Petersen, a Democrat with a contrarian streak, drew pushback largely from members of his own party, who argued that with more contagious variants of COVID-19 spreading, now might not be the time to fill up DMV waiting rooms.</p>
<p>“I think it would be very unwise with all of the uncertainties to require DMV employees to come into work,” said Sen. Janet Howell, D-Fairfax, who chairs the Senate’s budget committee. “And I would predict that the upshot would be that we might lose a lot of very good employees as a result.”</p>
<p>But in the narrowly divided chamber, the measure drew enthusiastic support from Republicans.</p>
<p>Sen. Richard Stewart, R-Stafford, called it “the most practical and best idea I’ve seen since I’ve been in Richmond this week.”</p>
<p>Sen. Jill Vogel, R-Fauquier, meanwhile, lamented the inconvenience the new appointment system has caused. “We are making people’s lives miserable.”</p>
<p>Several people entering the DMV’s headquarters in Richmond for appointments on Thursday seemed to agree with the sentiment.</p>
<p>As she dropped her mom off for an appointment, Pashyn Perry said she had tried to help renew her license online but was ultimately instructed to make an in-person appointment. She said the wait was three months and her mom was unwilling to drive during the time because her license was expired.</p>
<p>“If you have to get something done, I’d rather go in there and sit and wait an hour rather than two or three months,” Perry said.</p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>Democrats in the Virginia House and Senate met privately Wednesday to choose finalists for eight open positions on the Virginia Court of Appeals, prompting GOP lawmakers to accuse the party of breaking tradition by holding secret group interviews.</p>
<p>“I can’t think of a single instance in which we’ve had a judicial candidate come and appear before our caucus to be interviewed and make a pitch,” said Sen. Mark Obenshain, R-Rockingham, who chaired the Senate Courts committee before Democrats won the majority in 2019.</p>
<p>“I think we want judges who are going to be independent, who are going to adhere to the law, who are going to be good judges &#8212; not beholden to one caucus or the other.”</p>
<p>Democrats insisted they were taking the same basic approach to judicial appointments as the GOP did when they controlled the General Assembly, noting that the GOP also met with candidates before publicly narrowing down a list of finalists for public interviews.</p>
<p>“I have been personally interviewing people for months as have other senators,” said Sen. Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, in a text message. “The public certification interviews will be of the eight finalists for eight spots.”</p>
<p>The GOP responded that, when they were in charge, discussions with potential candidate took place on a one-on-one basis and with members of both parties. They said they never held group interviews to narrow down a list of finalists. “Never happened in the history of the General Assembly,” said Senate Minority Leader Tommy Norment, R-James City.</p>
<p>Democrats called it a distinction without a difference, but not all Democrats were on board with the approach. As he left the Senate chamber to attend the meeting, Sen. Joe Morrissey, D-Richmond, said that while he was participating, he disagreed with the decision to conduct the interviews in private. The meeting included Democratic members of the House and Senate judicial committees, according to attendees.</p>
<p>Regardless of the party in charge, judicial selections for the state’s higher courts are <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/03/04/lingering-grudges-obscure-protocol-and-a-classic-general-assembly-judge-fight/" target="_blank">intensely partisan</a>. And while interviews are held in public, the ruling party’s ultimate picks are typically hammered out behind closed doors in caucus meetings with little in the way of public comment or discussion.</p>
<p>This year’s appointments to the Court of Appeals have drawn more attention than usual because earlier this year Democrats voted to <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/03/08/virginia-court-of-appeals-set-to-get-six-new-judges-after-lawmakers-agree-to-expansion/" target="_blank">add six new seats</a> to the 11-judge court as part of a plan to expand its jurisdiction to provide a by-right appeal in all civil and criminal actions. The legislation will end Virginia’s status as the only state in the country where there is no guaranteed right to appellate review from the trial court level.</p>
<p>Republicans accused Democrats of attempting to “pack the court,” a criticism Democrats brushed off, noting that proposals to expand the court have drawn bi-partisan support within the state’s legal community.</p>
<p>In addition to the six new seats, Democrats in the General Assembly have two vacancies to fill. One comes after a recent retirement. A second has been open for two years after Democrats in the House and Senate were <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/03/13/general-assembly-divide-means-court-of-appeals-scc-judge-picks-will-fall-to-northam/" target="_blank">unable to agree on a candidate</a>.</p>

(Ned Oliver /Virginia Mercury)</p><p>Republicans in the Virginia House of Delegates offered their own proposal Tuesday for how to spend billions in federal rescue funds, floating a plan they said would ban door-to-door vaccination campaigns, give $5,000 bonuses to every police officer in the state and limit how students are taught about race and discrimination.</p>
<p>After a two-minute floor speech by House Minority Leader Todd Gilbert, R-Shenandoah, the measure was promptly voted down by the Democratic majority.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would have hoped that in this process we would have at least been afforded the opportunity to explain our bill,” Gilbert said before his time expired.</p>
<p>The General Assembly gaveled into a special legislative session Monday to direct spending of American Rescue Plan Act funding.</p>
<p>Democratic leaders <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/08/02/virginia-legislators-are-divvying-up-4-3b-in-federal-aid-heres-whats-in-the-plan/" target="_blank">had announced in advance</a> that they had already agreed on an array of spending priorities and would not entertain proposed amendments. Their spending plan devotes $700 million to achieve universal broadband coverage, $250 million to improve school HVAC systems and nearly $1 billion to bail out the state’s unemployment trust fund, among other priorities.</p>
<p>The GOP proposal left some of those ideas intact, including funding for the broadband plan, which a caucus spokesman credited as a good idea.</p>
<p>In other areas, they pursued tweaks. Instead of limiting school improvement funding to HVAC, the GOP proposed making it available for any renovation project &#8212; something Democratic leaders have said is restricted by federal rules.</p>
<p>The GOP also proposed devoting more money to public safety, including by expanding Democrats’ plans to give $5,000 bonuses to all Virginia State Police troopers to include all law enforcement officers in the state. They also proposed dramatically increasing the $2.5 million Democrats plan to devote to gun violence prevention programs.</p>
<p>The plan also included language touching on hot-button conservative issues that have dominated right-leaning news outlets.</p>
<p>Garren Shipley, a caucus spokesman, said the legislation would have barred door-to-door vaccination campaigns, limiting $20 million in outreach funding to other marketing and outreach efforts. However the actual text of the GOP proposal does not include the restriction, an oversight Shipley attributed to the rushed approach Democrats have taken to the legislative session.</p>
<p>And it would have adopted language recently passed by Idaho’s legislature that takes aim at critical race theory without specifically blocking it from being taught.</p>
<p><a href="https://apnews.com/article/idaho-business-religion-bills-health-515b6ea1eadcfafa1c05d248d04118c5" target="_blank">According to the Associated Press</a>, Idaho’s legislation “prohibits forcing belief systems onto students that claim a group of people as defined by sex, race, ethnicity or religion are inferior or superior to others.”</p>
<p>Democrats have dismissed complaints they shut the GOP out of the legislative process by refusing to consider their proposals.</p>
<p>In a speech on the House floor Monday, Appropriations Chairman Luke Torian, D-Prince William, said he &#8220;never shut the door&#8221; on his colleagues. If Republicans wanted to be more involved, he said, they should&#8217;ve taken it upon themselves to engage ahead of time.</p>
<p>&#8220;The letdown is not from the majority party,&#8221; Torian said. &#8220;The letdown is from their own leadership.&#8221;</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Gilbert said GOP lawmakers &#8220;didn&#8217;t want to have to knock on the door to the smoke-filled room. &#8230;  We wanted to participate in this process.&#8221;</p>

The tenants had already departed and the deputies, after checking the unit to make sure it's empty, watch as the owner changes the unit's locks.</p><p>Virginia Democrats are moving to restart state-level eviction protections one month after allowing them to lapse.</p>
<p>The step comes as a federal eviction moratorium ends and President Joe Biden’s administration chastised states for not implementing their own moratoriums.</p>
<p>“There is no excuse for any state or locality not to promptly deploy the resources that Congress appropriated to meet the critical need of so many Americans,” Biden’s press secretary, Jen Psaki, said in a statement, noting that only a third of states had moratoriums in place.</p>
<p>Virginia was one of the first states to stand up a rent relief program, dedicating millions in federal aid to people unable to pay their bills. The program has been cited as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/25/opinion/eviction-moratorium-covid-philadelphia.html" target="_blank">a national model</a>, but corresponding <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/with-northams-signature-new-eviction-and-utility-cut-off-protections-take-effect/" target="_blank">eviction protections</a> that required landlords to notify tenants financial help was available and apply on their behalf <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/06/24/virginia-has-more-than-a-billion-dollars-in-aid-for-people-behind-on-rent-heres-how-to-get-it/" target="_blank">ended in June</a>, when Gov. Ralph Northam allowed the pandemic state of emergency to expire.</p>
<p>At the time, Northam’s administration stressed that the rent relief program still had millions of dollars available, money they believed landlords would tap into even in the absence of a mandate.</p>
<p>But as they gaveled into a special legislative session Monday, Virginia lawmakers said they believe a mandate is still necessary.</p>
<p>“What I think we are finding is that there are still quite a few landlords and tenants that do not know that the money is available,” said Del. Cia Price, D-Newport News. “So what we’re trying to do is make sure that if it’s mandated as part of the process, they’ll have to find out about it.”</p>
<p>Sen. George Barker, D-Fairfax, said that in practice, judges in his district have continued to require landlords to apply for rent relief funds before granting evictions. He said the legislation would simply formalize and standardize that approach. “This makes sure that the landlords are paid and it protects the tenants in their situation,” he said.</p>
<p>The new protections, included in a <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?213+sum+HB7001" target="_blank">budget proposal</a> put forward by Northam with support from Democratic leaders in the House and Senate, are largely identical to the ones that expired last month. Under the law, an eviction for non-payment of rent could only move forward if a tenant refused to cooperate with the rent-relief application, is denied or if it takes longer than 45 days for the state to process the request.</p>
<p>Tenant advocates praised the step, even as they continue to push for a full moratorium that would extend to evictions for reasons other than the non-payment of rent. “Rent relief is there—we need to ensure it’s being used!” wrote the Charlottesville-based Legal Aid Justice Center <a href="https://twitter.com/LegalAidJustice/status/1421472301288153090" target="_blank">in a tweet</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, landlord groups called the proposal workable, calling only for changes to make clear evictions can proceed in cases in which tenants ignore requests for information necessary to submit an application for rental assistance.</p>
<p>Patrick McCloud, the director of the Virginia Apartment Management Association, said in some jurisdictions judges have refused to act in such cases. “The question that gets asked is, does a tenant’s failure to respond mean they failed to cooperate?” he said. “I would say yes, but there are judges in Virginia that would tell you no.”</p>
<p>If lawmakers approve the budget proposal hammered out in private by Democrat leaders, the new protections would take effect in the coming weeks with Gov. Ralph Northam’s signature.</p>
<p>That would leave at least a month-and-a-half gap since the expiration of Virginia’s eviction protections and likely at least a two week gap since the expiration of the federal moratorium issued by the Centers for Disease Control.</p>
<p>It is hardly the first gap in eviction protections for state residents, which have come in starts and stops since the pandemic began.</p>
<p>When the coronavirus pandemic began, struggling renters were protected from eviction by the simple fact that courts were closed. Later, the Supreme Court of Virginia <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/at-northams-request-virginia-supreme-court-grants-state-wide-eviction-moratorium/" target="_blank">specifically prohibited</a> evictions from proceeding to give the state time to stand up its rent relief program.</p>
<p>Evictions <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/06/25/more-than-12000-eviction-cases-could-head-to-trial-as-virginia-rushes-to-provide-rent-relief/" target="_blank">resumed last summer</a> and continued through November, when the federal moratorium and state protections went into effect.</p>
<p>Both were set to expire at the end of June, but Biden’s administration continued the federal moratorium an additional month.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The expiration of the CDC moratorium set of a flurry of activity and protest at the federal level.</p>
<p>Biden on Monday called on state and local governments to put their own pause on evictions for at least two months, and urged them to use $46.5 billion provided by the coronavirus relief package for tenants and landlords.</p>
<p>But the White House said that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been unable to find the legal authority to reinstate a federal eviction moratorium that expired on Saturday.</p>
<p>The ban was put in place by the CDC to prevent renters losing their homes during the coronavirus pandemic, in which thousands have lost their jobs and millions of people have <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5743308460b5e922a25a6dc7/t/5f87c59e4cd0011fabd38973/1602733471158/COVID-Projecting-Poverty-Monthly-CPSP-2020.pdf" target="_blank">slipped into poverty</a>. Millions of Americans are at risk of being evicted with<a href="https://lailluminator.com/2021/07/30/house-dems-struggle-to-extend-federal-eviction-ban-through-mid-october/" target="_blank"> the end of the moratorium.</a></p>
<p>“Given the rising urgency of the spread of the delta variant, the president has asked all of us, including the CDC, to do everything in our power to look for every potential legal authority we can have to prevent evictions,” said Gene Sperling, an adviser who is overseeing the president’s pandemic relief efforts, at an afternoon briefing.</p>
<p>Biden is also directing state and local courts to follow the Justice Department’s advice and “pause eviction proceedings until tenants and landlords can first seek to access Emergency Rental Assistance—making evictions a last, not first—resort.”</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0284" target="_blank">Treasury Department</a>, more than $1.5 billion in rental assistance was delivered to eligible households in June.</p>
<p>Biden also directed the Department of Agriculture, Department of Housing and Urban Development, Department of Veterans Affairs and the Federal Housing Finance Agency to extend their foreclosure-related eviction moratoriums until Sept. 30.</p>
<p>Congressional Democrats are pushing the White House to extend the pause on evictions, including top leaders, but the White House has argued its hands are tied, pointing to a Supreme Court decision in June.</p>
<p>A 5-4 ruling found that the CDC could not extend the moratorium past July 31. The Biden administration last week then called for congressional action to extend the ban on evictions.</p>
<p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, (D-Calif.), said in a statement Monday that she agreed with the administration&#8217;s steps and that the House would work on extending the moratorium.</p>
<p>“In addition, I am pleased that the President is urging the states and municipalities to distribute the $46.5 billion that Congress allocated in the December Omnibus and American Rescue Plan,” she said in a statement. “House Members are hard at work in their districts to ensure that these funds are immediately disbursed to the landlords and the families to avoid eviction.”</p>
<p>The chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, Rep. Joyce Beatty, (D-Ohio), urged the Biden administration to extend the CDC’s eviction moratorium to mid-October.</p>
<p>“[T]housands of Black families and children could lose the roof over their heads at a time when the deadly pandemic is surging once again, and their lives are in disorder due to the pandemic,” Beatty said in a statement.</p>
<p>Democrats scrambled last week to get federal legal protections extended until December, but were unsuccessful, and the House now is out for recess until Sept. 20.</p>
<p>Beatty said that the Congressional Black Caucus has lobbied House leadership and the White House to “figure out a way to extend the moratorium on evictions.” She added that Congress provided billions of emergency rental assistance that still has not been distributed to renters and landlords, which “would have given support and reprieve to families struggling to make ends meet and teetering on the brink of homelessness.”</p>
<p>“The CBC believes that ensuring families have the relief they need is a national emergency and moral imperative to prevent people from being put out on the street,” she said.</p>
<p>Beatty added that the caucus was in support of Rep. Cori Bush, (D-Mo.), who has slept outside on the steps of the Capitol since the moratorium expired in protest of Congress not extending protections for vulnerable tenants.</p>
<p>“Since Friday—when some colleagues chose early vacation over voting to prevent evictions—we’ve been at the Capitol,” Bush <a href="https://twitter.com/CoriBush/status/1422131510304550913" target="_blank">wrote on Twitter</a>. “It’s an eviction emergency. Our people need an eviction moratorium. Now.”</p>
<p>She <a href="https://twitter.com/RepCori/status/1421203349379108871" target="_blank">penned a letter </a>on Friday, begging Democratic leadership to stay in session and extend the moratorium.</p>

The prison, which houses some of the state's most medically fragile inmates, has seen a major COVID-19 outbreak. (Virginia Department of Corrections)</p><p>After struggling for decades with rising health care costs and complaints about shoddy medical care, the Virginia Department of Corrections plans to end its contract with the private medical provider that serves about half of the state’s prisons.</p>
<p>In a letter earlier this month to department staff, Director Harold Clarke wrote that he planned to bring all health care services in-house.</p>
<p>“I believe working together, we can ensure we provide appropriate care to our inmate population in a manner that is both effective and fiscally responsible,” Clarke wrote.</p>
<p>The state hired Miami-based Armor Correctional Health to provide health care services in 2014 after a prior contractor <a href="https://richmondbizsense.com/2014/08/10/prison-health-firm-breaks-out-of-state-contract/" target="_blank">backed out</a> of its agreement with the state when it realized it had severely underestimated the cost of providing services.</p>
<p>The contract began at $84 million a year, rising to about $90 million in the last fiscal year, according to department spokeswoman Lisa Kinney.</p>
<p>The state already directly manages health care in facilities where it doesn’t rely on Armor. Officials took their first step away from the company in 2018 after settling a lawsuit that alleged poor medical care at Fluvanna Correctional Center for Women, where care had been overseen by the company.</p>
<p>The state has since installed a doctor from University of Virginia as health director and, while the department is <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/07/12/five-years-later-virginia-prison-still-not-meeting-terms-of-court-ordered-settlement-over-shoddy-medical-care/" target="_blank">far from meeting the terms of the settlement</a>, court-appointed monitors reported the state has made progress toward improving care.</p>
<p>The same year, Armor faced penalties for failing to meet its contractual obligations at three facilities, Sussex I and II and Greensville, prompting the state to fine the company a quarter million dollars.</p>
<p>The Department of Corrections is the state’s largest agency and controlling rising health care costs has been <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/12/02/virginia-looks-to-uva-and-vcu-for-help-as-prison-healthcare-costs-soar/" target="_blank">a focus for lawmakers</a>.</p>
<p>Clarke did not fault Armor in his letter announcing the decision to de-privatize, writing that DOC “enjoyed a long and productive partnership.”</p>
<p>Instead, he wrote that his decision was based on studies, consultations with corrections officials in other states and a cost analysis. Among the reviews he cited was one conducted in 2018 by legislative auditors, which found <a href="http://jlarc.virginia.gov/2018-inmate_health_care.asp" target="_blank">no evidence</a> the state’s use of private contractors was saving taxpayer money.</p>
<p>Instead, the report warned that staffing problems were especially bad at facilities run by Armor, potentially exposing the state to more lawsuits for not providing adequate health care. The report cited high turnover among both administrators and key front-line staff like nurses, who left jobs at contract facilities twice as often as department-run facilities.</p>
<p>Clarke said the state’s relationship with the company would continue for at least one more year while the department begins the transition. To current Armor employees, he wrote that there was “no need to panic.”</p>
<p>“No employment decisions are being made at this time. … Please understand the conversion will happen over time and there will be ample employment opportunities.”</p>
<p>Armor, which is represented by a team of lobbyists from McGuireWoods, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>Kinney, the DOC’s spokeswoman, said she did not have any additional information to add. “The director’s memo will speak for itself,” she wrote in an email.</p>

The games popped up in gas stations, convenience stores and bars around the state before they were outlawed. (Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>A coalition of gambling companies hoping to get slot machines back into Virginia convenience stores and bars kicked off its legislative push this week with a private flight for four lawmakers to Chicago.</p>
<p>While the plush jet raised some eyebrows &#8212; Virginia politicians have <a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/government/local/article_daa916b2-2c45-5d35-a58c-6a6f6a3244a4.html" target="_blank">generally eschewed gifts</a> of private air travel after scandal consumed former Gov. Bob McDonnell &#8212; organizers said it was strictly an opportunity to learn from Illinois, which <a href="https://features.propublica.org/the-bad-bet/how-illinois-bet-on-video-gambling-and-lost/" target="_blank">broadly legalized video gambling terminals in 2009</a>.</p>
<p>“It was a fact-finding mission,” said Dylan Bishop, the lobbyist who organized the trip on behalf of the new Va. Video Gaming Terminal Coalition, which represents five gambling operators that have collectively given nearly a quarter million dollars to Virginia politicians in recent years, according to the Virginia Public Access Project.</p>
<p>In a letter to other gaming lobbyists last week, Bishop framed video slots and poker as the industry’s best shot at restoring gambling terminals to businesses that were recently forced to shut down so-called skill games after they were banned by the General Assembly.</p>
<p>“Video Gaming Terminals or ‘VGTs’ are Class III slot machines, just like the ones on a casino floor, but they can be installed in the same locations skill games have operated,” Bishop wrote. “VGTs offer better games, more robust regulation and, most importantly, more revenue.”</p>
<p>Skill games function almost exactly like traditional slot machines, but to <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/12/20/as-virginia-gears-up-for-gambling-debate-thousands-of-slot-like-games-have-already-slipped-in-the-back-door/" target="_blank">side-step state gambling laws</a>, they generally incorporated a memory game or some other non-chance-based element, which players often skipped entirely but in theory would allow someone to win their money back on every hand based on skill alone.</p>
<p>The gambit worked for a time. After initially pursuing a ban, the General Assembly and Gov. Ralph Northam allowed them to operate for one year to raise money for COVID-19 relief. But this year lawmakers rebuffed a push to allow the machines to remain indefinitely, citing concerns the terminals were siphoning away profit from the Virginia Lottery.</p>
<p>The fight played out as the state legalized slots parlors operated by Colonial Downs, online sports betting and casino gaming in five cities.</p>
<p>Some lawmakers say they still see a role for slot machines in corner stores and restaurants, citing the $130 million in tax revenue the skill-games raised and the additional profits they brought in for the small businesses that hosted them.</p>
<p>Among them is Sen. Joe Morrissey, D-Richmond, who attended the trip to Illinois with Sens. Jeremy McPike, D-Prince William, John Bell, D-Loudoun, and Del. Will Morefield, R-Tazewell.</p>
<p>“I have a very favorable impression of the VGT industry,” Morrissey said. And while he said he didn’t necessarily approve of the way the skill-game industry slipped through the regulatory back door, he said he did want to support the businesses that saw increased profits as a result of the machines.</p>
<p>“My constituents, my convenience store owners &#8212; they really don’t care whether it’s VGT or it’s skill games,” he said. “They want them in there because that’s a source of revenue for them. So I’m going to support it.”</p>

<p>Like Bishop, who organized the trip, Morrissey framed the roughly 36-hour excursion as all-business, beginning with a stop in Effingham, Ill., where J&amp;J Ventures Gaming is headquartered. The company is the state’s <a href="https://www.gamblingnews.com/news/vgt-gaming-in-illinois-has-taken-control/" target="_blank">most profitable video gambling operator</a>, according to industry press.</p>
<p>Morrissey said 20 minutes after landing in a cornfield, he was in a company conference room talking to company leaders. They then spent two hours touring convenience stores that host the games.

<p>The group then flew into Chicago, where they met with state lawmakers who work on gambling legislation. The lawmakers stayed overnight at the Hyatt Regency Chicago.</p>
<p>“If people were to think they went out there and visited casinos or engaged in gaming &#8212; nothing like that happened at all,” Morrissey said. “If people think that it’s a pleasure trip then my response is why don’t you go on it and see it.”</p>

<p>“I’m hiring a dedicated attorney to help guide the commonwealth’s efforts because I am committed to getting this right, and to making sure that we keep Virginia at the forefront of national efforts to craft a more just, fair and sensible system for dealing with cannabis,” Herring said in a statement.</p>
<p>The announcement comes as Herring, a Democrat who was among the party’s earliest and loudest supporters of marijuana legalization, seeks reelection to his third term in office. He faces Republican Del. Jason Miyares, who voted against legislation that legalized marijuana possession. (A spokeswoman for Miyares said in a statement that &#8220;regardless of his vote in the House of Delegates, as Attorney General Jason Miyares will not seek to overturn the marijuana legalization law and would defend it in court.”)</p>
<p>Herring’s office said the new hire will provide advice on the new law to state agencies that deal with everything from taxation to healthcare.

<p>Advocates, who have occasionally voiced frustration with the state’s Board of Pharmacy as it developed rules for the state’s medical marijuana program, said they hoped the additional legal expertise will make things smoother for the recreational marijuana market.</p>
<p>“It’s critical that the commonwealth have counsel available to state agencies who is well-versed in both state and federal cannabis policies,” said Jenn Michelle Pedini, executive director of Virginia NORML, the state chapter of the National Organization to Reform Marijuana Laws.</p>
<p>Herring’s office says they’re looking for a lawyer with experience in business law, state and federal litigation, and “a strong knowledge of state and federal regulation of controlled substances.”</p>
<p>Under the legalization bill lawmakers passed earlier this year, employers can still refuse to hire or fire employees who use marijuana. A spokeswoman said the Office of the Attorney General does not conduct drug testing as a condition of employment.</p>

(Parker Michels-Boyce / For The Virginia Mercury)</p><p>Doctors and hospitals are up 2-1 over insurance companies as the first three disputes resolved under the state’s ban on balance billing emerge from arbitration, according to a <a href="https://rga.lis.virginia.gov/Published/2021/RD261/PDF" target="_blank">report released this month</a> by state regulators.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/03/06/a-momentous-moment-for-virginians-after-general-assembly-unanimously-passes-legislation-to-end-surprise-medical-bills/" target="_blank">new approach</a>, which went into effect Jan. 1, removes patients from fights between providers and insurers over unexpected medical bills.</p>
<p>In a typical case, someone might find themselves seeking treatment at an in-network hospital only to later learn that the facility contracted with an out-of-network doctor, who billed them for thousands of dollars that their insurance company wouldn’t cover.</p>
<p>Under legislation the General Assembly passed last year, patients will no longer receive those bills as long as they’re covered by a state-regulated health plan. Instead, when providers and insurance companies can’t agree on a fair payment, the case heads to arbitration and the two parties work it out amongst themselves.</p>
<p>In the first five months of the year, the State Corporation Commission’s Bureau of Insurance says it received 120 arbitration requests, accepted 102 and resolved three.</p>
<p>In the case won by an unnamed insurance company, a patient was billed $3,262 for anesthesia at an outpatient surgery center. The plan ultimately offered to pay $549 of the tab, while the anesthesiologist offered to lower the bill to $1,310.</p>
<p>The arbiter reviewing the case sided with the insurance company and the case was resolved. In either case, the amount owed by the patient would not have changed.</p>
<p>The two cases won by providers revolved around emergency treatment in a community hospital. The insurance company offered to pay $291. The provider requested $1,310.</p>
<figure id="attachment_4667" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:1920px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/state-corporation-commission-1.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-4667" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/state-corporation-commission-1.jpg" alt="The State Corporation Commission" width="1920" height="1280" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/state-corporation-commission-1.jpg 1920w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/state-corporation-commission-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/state-corporation-commission-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/state-corporation-commission-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/state-corporation-commission-1-696x464.jpg 696w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/state-corporation-commission-1-1068x712.jpg 1068w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/state-corporation-commission-1-630x420.jpg 630w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  The State Corporation Commission regulates Virginia electric utilities. (Ned Oliver/ Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p>Both sides stuck to their initial offer throughout the arbitration process.</p>
<p>All three cases were reviewed by different private arbiters, the costs of which were paid by the companies involved in the disputes.</p>
<p>Neither hospitals nor insurance industry representatives, both of which have been swamped with COVID-19, have much to say about how the new process is working.</p>
<p>“We haven’t heard any significant feedback at this point,” said Julian Walker, a spokesman for the Virginia Hospital and Healthcare Association.</p>
<p>The legislation lawmakers ended up passing after years of debate and work on the subject ended up hewing more closely to the approach favored by hospitals and doctors groups. Insurance companies had advocated for setting regional rates at which out-of-network providers would be compensated.</p>
<p>But Doug Gray, the director of the Virginia Association of Health Plans, said everyone is still feeling out the process.</p>
<p>“It’s early,” he said. “We really didn’t know what to expect.”</p>
<p>He said the big question facing state lawmakers is whether it will make sense to continue to keep the state-level system in place now that Congress has begun addressing the issue on the national level.</p>
<p>The new protections are scheduled to <a href="https://www.kff.org/private-insurance/fact-sheet/surprise-medical-bills-new-protections-for-consumers-take-effect-in-2022/" target="_blank">take effect in 2022</a> and, while the regulations are still being hammered out, the law lays out a system that removes patients from disputes at the outset and relies on arbitration when providers and insurer can’t agree.</p>
<p>The federal approach, however, will cover nearly all insurance plans, whereas Virginia is limited to state licensed plans, which excludes insurance provided by many large employers.</p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After Democrats took control of the General Assembly in 2020, a common refrain emerged among Republicans who opposed legislation that raised the minimum wage and added new anti-discrimination protections for employees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Democrat majority has done much to diminish Virginia’s reputation for being America’s ‘best state for business,’” said Senate Minority Leader Tommy Norment, R-James City, as Democrats&#8217; first legislative session in power in more than two decades came to a close, invoking a ranking bestowed annually by the cable news network CNBC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two years later, it looks like at least some of those Democratic priorities actually helped the state’s business reputation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the second time in a row, Virginia was named the “best state for business” <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/13/virginia-is-back-as-americas-top-state-for-business.html" target="_blank">by CNBC</a>, which this year began factoring things like anti-discrimination laws and voting rights protections into its rankings under the heading of inclusivity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our economy in the Commonwealth of Virginia is roaring,” Gov. Ralph Northam said during a victory-lap news conference in Norfolk on Tuesday. “It’s why companies of all sizes are choosing to call our commonwealth home. Virginia is proving that when you treat people right, it’s good for everyone and it’s also good for business.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the context of the gubernatorial campaign, Northam’s verbiage could be read as a riposte to GOP gubernatorial nominee Glenn Youngkin, a retired private-equity CEO who has complained Democrats ran the state’s economy “into a ditch” and has repeatedly promised to make it “rip roaring.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s campaign downplayed the CNBC ranking Tuesday, arguing the state is underperforming in key metrics like cost of living and cost of doing business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the overall ranking, which Democrats have already begun trumpeting as validation of their leadership, cuts against Youngkin’s messaging, which has hinged on the idea that Virginia’s economy needs righting. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At a campaign rally in Richmond Tuesday afternoon after the new CNBC rankings were announced, Youngkin told the crowd Virginia has “fallen further behind our competitors in business.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m all for Virginia getting accolades,” Youngkin said when questioned by reporters after the event. “An unfortunate reality is that Virginia hasn&#8217;t performed like the No. 1 state for business over the last eight years.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said “peer states” like Maryland, North Carolina and Tennessee are seeing faster growth and noted Virginia has higher costs of living than the national average and ranks in the “bottom half” in the business costs category.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And those are the factors that I think overwhelm almost everything else when it comes to drawing businesses into Virginia and getting our economy running,” Youngkin said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How and why a cable news network emerged as the leading arbiter of which jurisdictions are and aren’t “good for business” remains unclear, but until this year, the network’s authority on the subject was a point of bipartisan agreement in Virginia, which has scored highly on the lists under both Democratic and Republican governors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans and Democrats alike celebrated when CNBC gave Virginia the No. 1 spot in 2019, though GOP lawmakers were quick to take credit for protecting Virginia’s spot on the list by blocking Democratic bills. “The ranking comes despite policy proposals from Democrats that would have set Virginia back,” said the GOP House speaker at the time, Del. Kirk Cox.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And had Virginia&#8217;s ranking dipped, Youngkin could&#8217;ve used the slippage to argue Virginia was on the wrong track, just as Republican Ed Gillespie did four years ago when he routinely <a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/opinion/columns/article_57960dec-f669-5eb4-add9-62f50a3fe3f4.html" target="_blank">brought up</a> Virginia&#8217;s fall to 13th on CNBC&#8217;s list in his unsuccessful campaign for governor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead, it was Democratic nominee Terry McAuliffe celebrating Tuesday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “Virginia is once again the top state in the nation for business and the reasons why are clear: for the past eight years we have fought to create a stronger economy that lifts up everyone and to keep our state open and welcoming to all,” McAuliffe said in a statement.</span></p>
<p>The Youngkin campaign noted McAuliffe has said <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/06/03/he-opposed-right-to-work-repeal-before-but-mcauliffe-wont-say-take-a-clear-stance-now/" target="_blank">he&#8217;d sign a bill to repeal right-to-work</a>, the anti-union law advertised as a pillar of the state&#8217;s business-friendly climate. But repeal efforts have failed in the Democratic-led legislature, and McAuliffe has said he doesn&#8217;t think they&#8217;ll fare any better in the future.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the Port of Virginia, where Northam staged his news conference, Senate Majority Leader Dick Saslaw said he had a message for “all those naysayers out there” who warned Democrats that efforts to improve conditions for workers would jeopardize the state’s business environment:  “We’ve proven them wrong,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state’s ranking for cost of doing business improved since 2019, according to CNBC, rising from 35th in the country to 26th. Meanwhile, the state’s “business friendliness” rank, which CNBC says measures the “legal and regulatory climates of each state,” dropped, from third to 11th.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the newly recalculated quality of life category, Virginia ranked 11. The category measures factors such as crime rates, health care, local attractions and statewide anti-discrimination measures. On that front, CNBC cited legislation that expanded voting rights, repealed voter ID laws and made the state the first in the South to extend comprehensive anti-discrimination protections to LGBTQ residents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the category represented accounted for about a tenth of the state’s overall score, Youngkin’s campaign seized on the measure as it dismissed the network’s rankings. “Virginia may be No. 1 for political correctness, pushing critical race theory in schools and not requiring a photo ID to vote under Terry McAuliffe and Ralph Northam, but Virginia ranks among the worst states when it comes to things that actually determine the success of small businesses and opportunities for workers,” said campaign spokeswoman Macaulay Porter in an email.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Political observers called the response predictable, arguing it won’t do much to counter the overall message that the state is not only on the right track, but thriving. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You can’t argue Virginia is a failure when it’s No. 1,” said Stephen Farnsworth, director of the University of Mary Washington’s Center for Leadership and Media Studies. “You can’t argue that red states are better for business when Virginia is No. 1. This is not helpful to the Youngkin campaign. Not in the least.”</span></p>

(Photo by Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>A new court appointed monitor’s first review of operations at Fluvanna Correctional Center for Women suggests the state isn’t close to meeting the terms of a five-year-old legal settlement over poor health care and a spate of inmate deaths .</p>
<p>The report, filed earlier this year in a federal court case that’s closing in on <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/4408182/scott-v-clarke/" target="_blank">a decade of litigation</a>, says medical care remains spotty and questions the state’s practice of isolating mentally ill inmates for 23 hours or more a day.</p>
<p>But the monitor, Dr. Homer Venters, writes that one of his biggest concerns is that the Department of Corrections still relies on paper medical records to provide and track health care for prisoners.</p>
<p>He writes that it is likely impossible for the state to meet its court-ordered benchmarks for improving medical care without upgrading to the now-industry-standard technology, citing records that show nurses don’t always provide inmates medication they’re prescribed and inmates arrive at medical appointments to learn staff don’t have their charts.</p>
<p>Venters quotes a woman the department logged as refusing care: “They did not have my medical chart and do not know why I’m here. It may be an ongoing problem, they can’t treat me without my chart.”</p>
<p>The Department of Corrections has been in discussions about upgrading from paper to electronic medical records for years, but the effort has been bogged down by failed procurement efforts that in once case saw a vendor back out at the last minute over a dispute over the state’s security standards. A second procurement attempt advanced in 2018 but was apparently aborted. The department issued what is at least its third request for proposals earlier this year.</p>
<p>“We’re in the RFP process,” said corrections spokeswoman Lisa Kinney in an email. “Vendors are presenting demos.” The statement was the only comment the department provided for this article.</p>

<p>Venters is not the first person to note that the department’s reliance on paper records poses a growing problems. Legislative auditors who reviewed <a href="http://jlarc.virginia.gov/pdfs/reports/Rpt511.pdf" target="_blank">rising prison health care costs</a> flagged the issue back in 2018. Corrections officials also acknowledge the potential of upgrading, writing in their request for proposals from technology companies that they’re seeking software that will provide “improved clinical effectiveness and improved health care for inmates.”</p>
<p>But the report, which followed a three-day inspection of Fluvanna in March, made clear that problems go beyond technology.</p>
<p>Venters writes that one patient he spoke to was denied treatment for a medical problem when she was transferred to Fluvanna’s mental health wing. “Review of her records appeared to confirm this, with staff attributing her physical illness to a mental health problem for an extended period of time until she was transferred to the hospital and ultimately received corrective surgery,” Venters wrote.</p>
<p>He highlighted another case in which staff documented that a patient was not receiving medication because of a disability. Venters noted that there was no evidence staff tried to accommodate or respond to the issue. “She was subsequently hospitalized with life threatening complications of her chronic health problems,” according to the report.</p>
<p>Venters also wrote that the prison’s mental health wing subjects patients to solitary confinement and parses out access to basic hygiene items like soap as “privileges to be earned.” He called the approach ineffective and humiliating for patients.</p>
<p>The report says another patient’s chart documented staff members were aware that the use of solitary conferment would worsen a woman’s mental health, citing a note he found that read, “given that her level of functioning is declining and she is going to seg and putting herself at risk with head banging, I think it’s worth starting an antipsychotic.”</p>
<p>Kinney did not respond to questions about the department’s use of isolation and solitary confinement in its mental health wards, but the state recently agreed to pay $150,000 to settle a lawsuit filed by a mentally ill inmate who alleged he was <a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-and-regional/second-recent-settlement-in-solitary-confinement-suits-against-virginia-department-of-corrections/article_8d420217-a4b4-57d5-8428-e0b8584af661.html" target="_blank">held in solitary confinement for 600 days</a>.</p>
<p>Venters’ report was not entirely negative. He credited the work of a new medical director at the prison brought on from University of Virginia’s health system, praised teamwork by medical and security staff and called the prison’s COVID-19 response “quite strong.”</p>
<p>But while Venters’ report included a note of optimism, the federal judge overseeing the case warned during a hearing earlier this year that the fact that a second monitor had to be installed after the first resigned “should serve as a stark reminder about the length of time there has not been complete compliance.”</p>
<p>“The settlement agreement was approved in 2016,” said U.S. District Judge Norman Moon. “We are now over five years after settlement, and all the parties should take the opportunity and redouble their efforts to quickly and sustainably hit the benchmarks.”</p>

(Sarah Vogelsong/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>The Supreme Court of Virginia says a jury should decide whether a Kroger manager engaged in malicious prosecution when she had shoplifting charges brought against a 70-year-old Staunton woman falsely identified as an attempted strawberry thief.</p>
<p>Kroger had argued that it was a simple case of mistaken identity and during a trial last year, the local judge agreed, dismissing the charges.</p>
<p>But the state’s highest court disagreed, <a href="http://www.courts.state.va.us/opinions/opnscvwp/1200823.pdf" target="_blank">ruling Thursday</a> that the case should have proceeded and ordering a new trial.</p>
<p>The dispute dates back to 2017, when a Kroger manager spotted someone in the self-checkout aisle placing unscanned strawberries into a shopping bag.</p>
<p>The manager, Sarah Lynch, believed she recognized the woman as Shirley Dill and, after an investigation revealed additional thefts by the shopper, she referred the case to police who took out a warrant.</p>
<p>But Dill, 70, was not the thief — a fact that only became clear to authorities after she was charged, arrested and had hired a defense attorney, who pointed out that the person in the surveillance video looked nothing like his client.</p>

(Robert Zullo/ Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p>Dill sued, and at trial, testimony revealed that the actual thief had scanned her shoppers card, which would have indicated the other woman was the true criminal had the store’s manager not disregarded the information as potentially erroneous.</p>
<p>Witnesses also testified that Lynch had interacted with Dill in at least two prior instances, including when Dill injured herself in the parking lot, which the court said could suggest “a history of animosity between the parties.”</p>
<p>“In the instant case, there is evidence which supports a finding of malice because Kroger and Lynch reported Dill, by name, to the police as the perpetrator of two crimes, despite video evidence that the crime was perpetrated by someone else who bore no physical resemblance to Dill, and who used her own Kroger Plus Card while perpetrating the crimes,” the justices wrote.</p>

																						<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="1024" height="683" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/capitol_Sunrise-1024x683.jpg" class="attachment-large size-large wp-post-image" alt="" style="margin-bottom: 10px;" decoding="async" loading="lazy" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/capitol_Sunrise.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/capitol_Sunrise-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/capitol_Sunrise-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/capitol_Sunrise-696x464.jpg 696w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/capitol_Sunrise-630x420.jpg 630w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p style="font-size:12px;">The Virginia Capitol at sunrise. (Ned Oliver/ Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia has $4.3 billion in federal aid to spend and no shortage of ideas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State agencies hoping to tap into American Rescue Plan funds have submitted <a href="https://dpb.virginia.gov/forms/forms.cfm?search=American%20Rescue%20Plan%20Act%20Budget%20Request%20Submissions" target="_blank">wish lists</a> that top more than $18 billion, floating proposals ranging from new helicopters for Virginia State Police to $1,000 cash payments for essential workers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Ralph Northam’s administration hasn’t committed to specific line items, but lawmakers are scheduled to convene next month for a special legislative session to decide how to spend the money. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Discussions are ongoing over whether some of the requests are or aren’t eligible for the federal dollars, which are supposed to have a direct link to the negative effects of the pandemic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, the federal government has earmarked certain funds for specific purposes, such as combating student learning loss due to schools going virtual during the pandemic. And because the state can spend the funds over several years, policymakers may choose to set some money aside to adapt to future needs. Federal dollars put toward some initiatives may also free up state dollars for others not eligible for relief funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of the spending proposals put forward, from vaccine outreach and utility assistance to fixing the unemployment system and broadband investment, won’t come as a surprise. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other spending suggestions are a little less intuitive — or show agencies trying to use the sudden influx of funds to advance efforts that may have been back-burnered in tighter budget years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s a sampling of the proposals that caught Mercury reporters’ eyes.  </span></p>
<h3><b>Compensation for essential workers</b><b><br />
</b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price tag: $800 million</span></i></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Labor proposals include a suggestion to give $1,000 “hero grants” to low-wage essential workers who stayed on the job during the pandemic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The funding request for $700 million doesn’t specify exactly which types of workers might qualify, but notes that “premium pay” for essential workers is an explicitly authorized use of the funds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Higher education officials have also requested up to $100 million for “hero scholarships” to help essential workers who want to further their education. The proposal suggests giving up to $5,000 per year to assist essential workers with getting a GED or college degree.</span></p>

<h3><b>COVID resources for non-native English speakers</b><b><br />
</b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price tag: $21 million</span></i></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A persistent complaint throughout the pandemic has been the state’s dependence on automatic (and often shoddy) translations to provide information about the spread of COVID-19 and roll out of vaccines to non-English speakers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The approach at one point led the Virginia Department of Health to inform Spanish speakers that</span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/virginia-uses-google-translate-for-covid-vaccine-information-heres-how-that-magnifies-language-barriers-misinformation/article_715cb81a-d880-5c98-aac5-6b30b378bbd3.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">“the vaccine is not necessary”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> where English speakers were informed that it is not required.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Northam’s Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion proposes setting aside $5 million a year to pay for translation services, as well as hiring a coordinator to create a statewide language access plan for translation needs for state agencies. The office also proposes hiring two full time American Sign Language interpreters and a coordinator dedicated to “incorporating people with disabilities and other access and functional needs” into the state’s emergency and recovery plans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rescue fund money would cover four years of work.</span></p>
<h3><b>A bailout for the state’s unemployment trust fund</b><b><br />
</b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price tag: $1.3 billion</span></i></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the biggest single requests comes by way of the Virginia Employment Commission, which wants $1.3 billion to restore the state’s unemployment trust fund to pre-pandemic levels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state relies on the fund to pay for unemployment benefits, which saw an unprecedented 1.3 million initial claims last year and another 300,000 already this year &#8212; more than double the applications for assistance the state saw in all of 2019.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fund would otherwise be rebuilt through a series of hefty payroll tax increases on businesses. And state leaders and the business community have already called heading that off</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/unemployment-insurance-complaints-continue-businesses-push-for-tax-bailout/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">a top priority</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury &#8211; Aug. 8, 2018)</p></figure>
<h3><b>Body cameras and helicopters for state police</b><b><br />
</b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price tag: $40 million</span></i></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In one of the more tangentially pandemic-related requests, Virginia State Police asked for $19 million to roll out body cameras to their officers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The department argued that “vulnerable social populations” have seen some of the biggest impacts from COVID and have some of the lowest rates of vaccine acceptance “due to fears and skepticism towards government resulting from systemic marginalization.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The agency proposes that body cameras will help because they foster transparency that in turn “will establish trust in government and mitigate future spread of COVID-19.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their justification for requesting two new helicopters at a cost of $21 million was more clear cut. The agency says they will replace two older units currently used for medical evacuation flights that were “experiencing unacceptable downtime” and “impacting the department’s ability to provide air ambulance services during the COVID-19 public health emergency.”</span></p>
<h3><b>Highway improvements between Richmond and Williamsburg</b><b><br />
</b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price tag: $100 million</span></i></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The only major road project included in the funding requests is the continued widening of Interstate 64 between Richmond and Williamsburg.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Specifically, transportation planners are suggesting $100 million to help with the costs of widening the interstate in a 29-mile stretch between New Kent County and Williamsburg.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mitigating congestion on I-64 has been a top priority for Hampton Roads-area leaders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The request specifies that the new improvements would begin around Exit 205 in New Kent, where a previous widening project between Richmond and New Kent ended in 2019, and continue to exit 234 near Williamsburg.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Capital projects unrelated to COVID-19 generally aren’t intended to be funded through the American Rescue Plan, but the act gives states leeway to spend money on things like roads if the pandemic affected government revenue sources that would typically pay for them.</span></p>
<h3><b>Mapping overlaps between historic inequities and urban green spaces</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price tag: $500,000</span></i></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020, a study co-authored by Science Museum of Virginia chief scientist Jeremy Hoffman </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/08/24/climate/racism-redlining-cities-global-warming.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">made national headlines</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when it found that neighborhoods federal housing officials historically classified as “hazardous” because of their high proportion of low-income and minority residents </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/there-may-be-a-link-between-urban-heat-islands-and-past-redlining-practices-study-finds/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">are hotter than other neighborhoods</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The classification, known as redlining, was used by the federal Home Owners’ Loan Corporation between the 1930s and 1968 to guide banks on granting mortgages to homebuyers and led to wide racial gaps in homeownership. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also contributed to higher temperatures today in historically minority or disadvantaged neighborhoods, where shade-providing trees are in short supply and large swathes of land have been paved. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now the Virginia Department of Forestry wants to use $500,000 to develop heat island maps that pinpoint where higher temperatures overlap with formerly redlined neighborhoods. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The agency says that “federal guidance aligns funding” with projects such as those that aim to create green infrastructure and improve water quality, both of which can be achieved by planting trees and other flora. </span></p>

<h2><b>Electric vehicle infrastructure</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price tag: $33.3 million</span></i></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With federal guidelines allowing funds to be used to replace lost public sector revenues for services including infrastructure, the Department of Transportation is proposing a hefty investment of $33.3 million in electric vehicle infrastructure. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats in the General Assembly and the Northam administration spent the last legislative session </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/02/19/continuing-climate-change-fight-virginia-lawmakers-commit-to-clean-car-standards/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pushing electric vehicles as a way to reduce transportation emissions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Virginia’s largest contributor to carbon emissions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Money was a sticking point, though. Lawmakers acknowledged that infrastructure is lacking in many rural areas. And although the General Assembly signed off on an electric vehicle rebate program, </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/02/27/general-assembly-approves-electric-vehicle-rebate-program-but-leaves-it-unfunded/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislators left it unfunded</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a situation the law’s sponsor attributed to tight pandemic budgets. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_27266" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2048px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/highland_springs_high.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-27266" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/highland_springs_high.jpg" alt="" width="2048" height="1536" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/highland_springs_high.jpg 2048w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/highland_springs_high-300x225.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/highland_springs_high-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/highland_springs_high-768x576.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/highland_springs_high-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/highland_springs_high-80x60.jpg 80w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/highland_springs_high-265x198.jpg 265w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/highland_springs_high-696x522.jpg 696w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/highland_springs_high-1068x801.jpg 1068w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/highland_springs_high-560x420.jpg 560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/highland_springs_high-1920x1440.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  A tour of the construction of the new Highland Springs High School in Henrico, estimated to cost about $80 million.

<h3><b>School construction and improvements</b><b><br />
</b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price tag: $2.6 billion</span></i></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even before the pandemic, school construction was a major issue in Virginia. A recent survey from the state’s Department of Education found that more than half of public school buildings are more than 50 years old. Replacing those aging structures is estimated to cost the state more than $24.7 billion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enter the American Rescue Plan. The federal government set aside specific funds for </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/06/04/federal-funding-restrictions-could-force-schools-to-spend-millions-improving-buildings-that-should-be-replaced/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pandemic-related improvements</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, including new HVAC systems, but VDOE proposes dedicating an additional $2 billion for more general renovation projects. That money would be delivered to local school divisions through a competitive grant fund, according to the agency’s request.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The department is also requesting an additional $600 million for improvements in early and higher education. The majority of that — $500 million over the next three years — would go toward capital improvements for “successful” child care operators, “allowing them to serve additional children and help more parents get back to work.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another $100 million is proposed for modernization efforts at the state’s public colleges and universities, from updated heating systems to new equipment and technology.</span></p>
<h3><b>A new public health lab </b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price tag: $275 million</span></i></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s public health laboratory — once mostly a site for specialized testing and </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/training/publichealth101/laboratories.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tracking rare diseases</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — has taken on a whole new importance throughout the pandemic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the first critical weeks, it was the </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/04/06/with-persistent-testing-shortages-virginia-health-officials-find-new-ways-to-track-coronavirus-cases/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">only lab in the state</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that could test for COVID-19. And over the past year and a half, its responsibilities have expanded dramatically, from </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/04/08/virginias-state-lab-is-one-of-the-first-in-the-country-to-sequence-samples-of-virus-that-causes-covid-19/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sequencing samples of the virus</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/01/25/virginia-confirms-first-case-of-uk-variant-coronavirus-strain/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rapidly detecting new variants</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Department of General Services wants to expand those capabilities even further. The agency is asking for $275 million to replace the state’s aging site in downtown Richmond with a “state-of-the-art” new laboratory in Petersburg. The proposed location is on the same campus as Central State Hospital, a state-run psychiatric facility that’s currently undergoing a </span><a href="http://dls.virginia.gov/groups/mhs/central%20state%20hosp%20Proposal.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">major renovation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And it would boost capacity for complex and high-volume testing, which is already “nearing its limit” at the existing lab, according to DGS.</span></p>
<h3><b>A public health emergency fund</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price tag: $10 million</span></i></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The scramble to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic can be traced, in large part, to </span><a href="https://khn.org/news/tag/underfunded-and-under-threat/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">decades of underfunding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in public health. As Virginia was recording its first cases, some health departments in low-income counties </span><a href="https://www.wric.com/news/local-news/they-basically-abandoned-us-sussex-county-health-department-closed-as-the-pandemic-hit-virginia/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">were abruptly closing their doors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And across the state, employees were pulled from critical services like maternal health and environmental monitoring to serve as case investigators or contract tracers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In those early days, the Virginia Department of Health said it lacked the funding to “quickly ramp up an appropriate operational response.” Now, the agency is requesting $10 million for a public health emergency fund. The money might not be used immediately, but leaders say it would give the department more agility to respond to future pandemics.</span></p>

<h3><b>Staffing at state mental hospitals</b><b><br />
</b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price tag: $335.5 million</span></i></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s state-run mental hospitals have been struggling for years with rising admissions. But the COVID-19 pandemic pushed them into </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/06/28/amid-a-push-to-end-mental-health-hospitalizations-virginia-is-still-funding-more-beds/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">crisis mode</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, with outbreaks making it even more challenging to discharge patients and free up bed space. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That high patient volume, combined with </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/04/21/staffing-shortages-are-overwhelming-virginias-psychiatric-hospitals/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">chronic staffing shortages</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, have made the facilities “</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/06/28/amid-a-push-to-end-mental-health-hospitalizations-virginia-is-still-funding-more-beds/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tremendously unsafe</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” according to Alison Land, commissioner of the state’s Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services. The agency is requesting more than $300 million over the next several years to boost employment, the majority of which would go to salary increases for essential frontline workers. Another $24 million would be dedicated to security guards and safety improvements at aging facilities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The department is also requesting millions for community mental health services — part of an ongoing effort to reduce admissions through better front-end treatment. But staffing needs have often been framed as one of the most urgent challenges facing Virginia’s beleaguered mental hospitals.</span></p>

<h3><b>Septic and sewer overflow repairs and replacements</b><b><br />
</b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price tag: $230 million</span></i></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the biggest-ticket items Virginia’s Department of Environmental Quality has on its wish list is $230 million to help repair and replace failing septic systems, pipes that send waste directly into waterways and “combined sewer overflow” systems that can lead to sewage releases during heavy rainfall.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The federal rescue plan “specifically lists water and wastewater infrastructure as an eligible use,” DEQ says in its justification for the request. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of the $230 million, DEQ wants to see $30 million go to Richmond to speed up its ongoing overhaul of the city’s combined sewer overflow system. The agency has also identified $35 million worth of sewage system fixes in Southwest Virginia, as well as millions of dollars of investment in wastewater connections for underserved communities in Surry, Middlesex, Northampton and Accomack counties.</span></p>

(AP Photo/Steve Helber)</p><p>With the death penalty formally abolished in Virginia as of this week, death row is now officially vacant, according to prison officials.</p>
<p>Department of Corrections spokeswoman Lisa Kinney said the two remaining prisoners facing death sentences were moved off death row after the legislation was signed earlier this year.</p>
<p>For decades, condemned prisoners have been held in a special ward at Sussex I State Prison until a few days before they were scheduled to die, at which point they were transferred to the building that housed the execution chamber at Greensville Correctional Center.</p>
<p>Kinney said the two men have been transferred to other high-security facilities. Thomas Porter, who murdered a police officer who attempted to stop and question him, was transferred to Red Onion State Prison and Anthony Juniper, who murdered two adults and two children, was transferred to Wallens Ridge State Prison. Both facilities are located in Southwest Virginia.</p>

The use of <a href="https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/death-row/conditions-on-death-row" target="_blank">solitary confinement on death row</a> has faced nationwide criticism, but <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/01/14/virginia-prison-officials-say-they-eliminated-solitary-confinement-inmates-say-they-just-gave-it-a-new-name-its-all-very-hannibal-lecter-ish/" target="_blank">similar complaints</a> about the use of isolation have been levied by Virginia prisoners in high security facilities like Red Onion.</p>

<p>The comment came on Twitter in response to a <a href="https://twitter.com/terrymcauliffe/status/1410736477592449025" target="_blank">tweet</a> by Democratic nominee Terry McAuliffe, who wrote that “extreme Republicans are determined to make it illegal again. Yet another example of how Glenn Youngkin and the GOP are out of touch with Virginia.”</p>
<p>“False,” Youngkin’s <a href="https://twitter.com/TeamYoungkin/status/1410980384234520585" target="_blank">campaign responded</a>. “Glenn Youngkin will not seek to repeal.”</p>
<p>Youngkin’s communication’s director Matt Wolking said Youngkin doubts the state’s revenue projections from legalization are realistic. But as governor, he said, Youngkin’s priority would be to emphasize ensuring minors do not use or have access to the drug.</p>
<p>On the campaign trail, Youngkin has spoken unfavorably about the drug and the state&#8217;s decision to legalize it. &#8220;If there was a group of children that were sitting here and I was talking to them about marijuana I would tell them don&#8217;t use it,&#8221; Youngkin said <a href="https://wset.com/news/local/glenn-youngkin-visits-lynchburg-vying-for-veteran-votes-criticizes-legalizing-marijuana" target="_blank">during a stop in Lynchburg</a>. &#8220;I&#8217;ve never met anybody who habitually used marijuana and was successful and I would tell all them the same thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Virginia became the first state in the South to legalize marijuana on Thursday, a move that opinion polling suggests has broad public support.</p>
<p>The legislation passed earlier this year garnered no support from GOP lawmakers.</p>

(Ned Oliver/ Virginia Mercury)</p><p>The Virginia Employment Commission issued its first status report Thursday on its court-ordered efforts to reduce a backlog of claims, reporting that it processed more than half of the 92,000 pending applications for assistance it&#8217;s required to adjudicate by Labor Day.</p>
<p>But the team of legal aid attorneys representing claimants who have been left in limbo for months were quick to point out the commission’s numbers are less impressive than they sound.</p>
<p>In their own court filing, they noted the commission’s numbers don’t include an estimated at 30,000 additional claims that have been added to the backlog since the settlement in May.</p>
<p>The plaintiffs said that while the commission refused to provide firm numbers on how many new claims were added to the backlog, a conservative estimate based on claims data suggests it’s likely been reduced by fewer than 20,000 claims after nearly two months of work.</p>
<p>“We are pleased that the court’s intervention has moved things forward, with folks at the VEC working hard on progress,” said Pat Levy-Lavelle, a lawyer at the Legal Aid Justice Center, one of several legal aid groups around the state working on the case. &#8220;At the same time, we want to move toward cases being processed more quickly, and Virginians who have been getting benefits no longer being cut off without due process. There is much more work to do.”</p>
<p>The state’s beleaguered unemployment assistance program has drawn <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/unemployment-insurance-complaints-continue-businesses-push-for-tax-bailout/" target="_blank">increasing scrutiny from lawmakers</a> frustrated that long delays have persisted nearly a year and a half into the pandemic.</p>
<p>Gov. Ralph Northam’s administration has continued to defend its handling of the issue. In Thursday’s progress report, the commission noted it brought in an additional 100 contract adjudicators last month and expects to bring on an additional 175 later in July.</p>
<p>CORRECTION: <em>This article has been updated to correct the date of the deadline for the Virginia Employment Commission to address its backlog of cases. It is Labor Day.</em></p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>As of today, marijuana is legal for adults 21 and older to possess, consume and grow in Virginia. But unless a doctor has signed off on a prescription, there’s no legal way to buy it.</p>
<p>Lawmakers have set a 2024 target to begin retail sales to recreational users, a runway the legislation’s authors say is necessary to establish the Virginia Cannabis Control Authority, which will regulate the new market.</p>
<p>But some legalization advocates are hoping the General Assembly will agree to speed up that time frame.</p>
<p>“Our priority in the 2022 legislative session is to expedite retail access for adult consumers, both through already operational medical dispensaries and by moving up the date VCCA can begin issuing new licenses,” said Jenn Michelle Pedini, executive director of Virginia NORML, the state chapter of the National Organization to Reform Marijuana Laws.</p>
<p>https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/what-virginias-marijuana-legalization-bill-actually-says/</p>
<p>The medical dispensaries had lobbied to be allowed to begin selling to recreational customers beginning this year, but lawmakers resisted, worrying it would give the companies an unfair head start in a market where they hope to encourage minority-owned and small businesses.</p>
<p>Other advocates say the General Assembly’s immediate focus should be on the criminal justice side of the law. Democratic lawmakers who championed the legislation framed it primarily as a matter of racial justice in light of statistics showing Black people were three times more likely to be charged with possession than White people despite surveys showing the two groups use the drug at roughly the same rate.</p>
<p>Chelsea Higgs Wise, who founded Marijuana Justice, which led a coalition of criminal justice reform groups that worked on the law, applauded the decision to speed legalization. But she said getting the retail market off the ground is secondary to other work the General Assembly has left undone.</p>
<p>Among other things, she pointed to lawmakers’ decision not to include <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/04/23/virginia-legalized-it-but-people-in-prison-on-marijuana-charges-will-stay-there-under-new-law/" target="_blank">a resentencing provision for people currently incarcerated</a> on marijuana charges, a category that likely includes hundreds of people. While lawmakers passed expungement provisions for past charges, they said they ran out of time to include language addressing resentencing.</p>
<p>“Pushing up commercial sales purely for access to weed is not the priority when this always has been and has to be a racial justice issue,” Higgs Wise said. “The July 1 law is rooted in eliminating racist enforcement of simple possession, not to expand access. Because it’s always been accessible, but only certain people have been criminalized for it.”</p>
<p>She said lawmakers should also prioritize eliminating criminal penalties for youth caught with the drug as well as open container laws that make it illegal to have the drug in the passenger area of a vehicle even if it’s not being used &#8212; two laws she predicted would continue to be disproportionately enforced against Black Virginians.</p>

<p>She also called for the repeal of language included in the new law that bars public consumption, something she said would effectively prevent legal use by the homeless and residents of public housing and private complexes that include language in leases prohibiting the use of marijuana.</p>
<p>“We’ve seen places like D.C. and New York when this happen &#8212; those are exactly the people feeling the brunt of the penalties. They’re just too accessible to law enforcement.”</p>

<p>Attorney General Mark Herring, one of the <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/attorney-general-mark-herring-endorses-legalizing-marijuana-does-it-matter/" target="_blank">earlier and more vocal proponents of legalization</a> in Virginia, said all significant legislation requires compromise and refinement. During a tour Tuesday of gLeaf, the medical dispensary in Richmond, he withheld judgement on the approach the General Assembly has taken and the changes they will weigh when they convene next year.</p>
<p>“My goal is going to be identifying any areas moving forward that might need to be adjusted because it conflicts with other areas of the law or it may not be effective,” he said.</p>
<p>Asked if he had any legal advice for state residents trying to navigate the intricacies of the new law, he referred interested parties to <a href="https://www.cannabis.virginia.gov/#895466" target="_blank">an FAQ set up by the executive branch</a>.</p>
<p>“I think the state has a good website,” he said. “Make sure you check that so you’re in full compliance with any rules.”</p>

Ralph Northam signed legislation legalizing marijuana in Virginia at a ceremony in April. (Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>The legislation that will make possession and cultivation of marijuana legal on July 1 is almost 300 pages. But in reality, only a few sections are actually going into effect.</p>
<p>That’s because lawmakers included hundreds of pages of rules and regulations they’d like to enact, but couldn’t yet agree on. So, at the end of the session, they slapped what they call a “re-enactment clause” on it. Basically, it’s a road map for what the General Assembly might do next year.</p>
<p>That’s all well and good, but in this particular case, the approach has the effect of making it exceedingly difficult for normal people without a law degree or a decoder ring to understand what language in the bill has real-life implications. (In some cases, it’s led localities to begin <a href="https://fredericksburg.com/news/local/king-george-looks-into-banning-retail-sales-of-marijuana-by-2024/article_1df29025-523e-5a71-9479-47e04bb9d84c.html" target="_blank">debating provisions</a> that won’t necessarily become law.)</p>
<p>So, without further ado, here’s the language that lawmakers actually inserted into the state’s criminal code governing possession and cultivation by adults. (And if you&#8217;re looking for an explanation sans legalese, see <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/04/07/marijuana-will-be-legal-in-virginia-on-july-1-heres-what-is-and-isnt-permitted-under-the-new-law/" target="_blank">our story from earlier this year</a> or <a href="https://www.cannabis.virginia.gov/#895466" target="_blank">any number</a> <a href="https://www.vanorml.org/legalization_faqs" target="_blank">of FAQs</a>.)</p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><em>Update: After this story was published, the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/eviction-ban-extended-biden-coronavirus-9e7c4dc97c49cbb42a1ecb55b06e3b4c" target="_blank">Centers for Disease Control announced a final extension</a> of federal eviction protections through the end of July.</em></p>
<p>State and federal pandemic eviction protections come to an end next week, but there’s still help available to tenants who have fallen behind on their rent — hundreds of millions of dollars worth of help.</p>
<p>“It’s a huge sum of money,” said Martin Wegbreit, director of litigation at the Central Virginia Legal Aid Society, which represents tenant facing eviction. “My goodness, we should use it and take advantage of this pretty much unprecedented and unique opportunity.”</p>
<p>But to tap into $1 billion worth of federal aid earmarked for Virginia, tenants or their landlords must proactively apply, and there’s no longer any rules requiring property owners to cooperate.</p>
<h2><strong>A ‘national model’ comes to an end</strong></h2>
<p>Last year, state lawmakers established a rent relief program they funded with successive infusions of cash, mostly from federal aid packages. At the same time, they created rules that require landlords to alert tenants that the assistance is available and fill out an application on their behalf. Landlords have been barred from pursuing an eviction except in cases where a tenant refuses to cooperate, is denied, or it takes more than 45 days for the state to process the application.</p>
<p>The approach appeared to work, drawing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/25/opinion/eviction-moratorium-covid-philadelphia.html" target="_blank">recognition as a national model</a> for how to address evictions.</p>
<p>To date, the state has distributed $244.6 million to 49,000 households, according to the Department of Housing and Community Development, which is overseeing the program. And last year, coupled with other interventions, eviction plummeted. An analysis by the RVA Eviction Lab at Virginia Commonwealth University found eviction filings and judgements dropped to about 10 percent of the prior-year’s volume.</p>
<p>The mandatory part of the program, however, comes to an end on June 30, when the state of emergency declared by Gov. Ralph Northam over 15 months ago comes to an end. Northam cited a dramatic <a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/virginias-covid-19-state-of-emergency-to-end-june-30-affecting-eviction-protections-mask-rules/article_4b657b99-7083-5a5f-8107-b3e0c72df519.html" target="_blank">decline in coronavirus infections</a>. A federal moratorium on evictions, which allowed tenants to block court action by attesting financial hardship related to the pandemic, also expires on June 30.</p>
<p>Tenant advocates <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/pandemic-eviction-protections-could-expire-this-summer/" target="_blank">argued it’s too soon to end the protections</a> because financial difficulties caused by the pandemic will linger for months. Northam’s administration has responded by pointing to the extensive aid that remains available to tenants.</p>
<h2><strong>Who is eligible for help</strong></h2>
<p>While the state’s rent-relief program has a range of eligibility requirements, advocates say most people who need help will likely qualify.</p>
<p>The state has set up an <a href="https://dmz1.dhcd.virginia.gov/RMRPEligibility/" target="_blank">interactive eligibility screening tool</a>, but applicants must meet three primary financial criteria:</p>
<p>• The monthly rent must be at or below 150 percent of the federally designated <a href="https://www.vhda.com/BusinessPartners/PropertyOwnersManagers/RMRPDocuments/150Percent-FMR-by-UnitSize-n-Locality.pdf" target="_blank">fair market rent for their locality</a>, which ranges from $1,051 for a two-bedroom apartment in rural Lee County to $2,647 in Fairfax County.</p>
<p>• The household’s income at the time of the application must fall <a href="https://www.vhda.com/BusinessPartners/PropertyOwnersManagers/RMRPDocuments/80Percent-AMI-by-HouseholdSize-n-Locality.pdf" target="_blank">below 80 percent of the area median income</a>, which, again, ranges from $43,000 for a family of three in Lee County to $74,100 in Fairfax.</p>
<p>• Finally, the applicant must have experienced financial hardship that’s in some way related to the pandemic. Examples cited by the state in application materials include being laid off, having hours reduced, being unable to find work and being unwilling or unable to return to work because of child care or high risk of severe illness from COVID-19.</p>
<h2><strong>How to get it</strong></h2>
<p>Tenants or landlords can <a href="https://www.dhcd.virginia.gov/rmrp" target="_blank">apply through the state’s website</a>. Applications require documentation, some of which must come from the tenant and some of which must come from the landlord.</p>
<p>The tenant is required to provide a proof of income in the form of a pay stub, bank statement, letter from an employer or other official documentation.</p>
<p>Either party can provide a copy of the lease or other documentation outlining the rental relationship.</p>
<p>Landlords must provide a rent ledger and a Virginia W-9 tax form, which documents their taxpayer identification number and business information.</p>
<p>While nothing requires landlords to continue notifying tenants of the assistance available or help them apply, property managers say it will likely remain a standard practice.</p>
<p>“I think everyone is going to continue to notify people about the rent relief program,” said Patrick McCloud, who directs the Virginia Apartment Management Association, which represents some of the state’s largest landlords.</p>
<p>Likewise, he said it was unlikely a landlord would decline to cooperate with a tenant’s application. He said the most important thing for tenants to do is to remain in communication with whoever is managing the property.</p>
<p>“If you know you’re going to be late on rent, talk to management before the rent is due.”</p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<h2><strong>Other protections remain</strong></h2>
<p>Wegbreit, who represents tenants facing eviction in court, said that even though there’s no legislative requirement that a landlord cooperate, a court would be unlikely to award back rent to someone who refused to participate in the program. That’s because common law requires parties in a contract to take reasonable steps to mitigate their damages in the event of a breach.</p>
<p>“Certainly I could see some number of landlords foolishly doing that,” he said. “I say foolishly because they’d be cutting off their nose to spite their face by not taking the money and getting made whole when it’s a fairly easy process.”</p>
<p>And while mandatory participation is out, other protections remain.</p>
<p>Through the end of September, tenants who do wind up in court facing an eviction lawsuit are entitled to an automatic, 60-day continuance if they can demonstrate they lost income due to the pandemic.</p>
<p>And through at least July of 2022, landlords will have to wait 14 days instead of the customary five between alerting tenants they’re behind on rent and filing an eviction lawsuit.</p>
<p>“The reason 14 days is particularly useful as opposed to five days is most people get paid twice a month — not every five days,” said Phil Storey, who directs the Virginia Poverty Law Center’s eviction helpline. “If you’re just falling behind, it can make all the difference.”</p>
<p>Finally, landlords with a management interest in 5 or more apartments are still required to offer a payment plan to tenants.</p>
<p>Storey encouraged tenants who need legal advice to contact their local legal aid group or call the <a href="https://evictionhelpline.org/" target="_blank">eviction helpline</a> at 1-833-NoEvict.</p>

<p>The new review, which studied debt-collection efforts of the country’s largest 100 hospitals, shows for the first time the extent to which the two institutions stood out nationally for their billing practices, which executives <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/08/08/from-the-emergency-room-to-the-courtroom-va-medical-providers-sued-patients-for-nearly-600-million-over-past-five-years/" target="_blank">initially described as standard operating procedure</a>.</p>
<p>Researchers found that between January 2018 and July 2020, VCU initiated court action against patients 17,806 times — more than any other institution reviewed. UVA’s medical center came in second, initiating legal action 7,107 times.</p>
<p>VCU and UVA both announced in 2020 they would stop suing patients over unpaid medical bills and both institutions later said they would <a href="https://khn.org/news/article/uva-health-will-wipe-out-tens-of-thousands-of-lawsuits-against-patients/" target="_blank">cancel a backlog of judgements and liens against patients</a> that date back to the 1990s.</p>
<p>The action followed a <a href="https://khn.org/news/uva-health-system-sues-patients-virginia-courts-garnishment-liens-bankruptcy/" target="_blank">2019 investigation</a> by Kaiser Health News and published in the Washington Post that focused on the two institutions. The Virginia Mercury first reported on the volume of medical debt lawsuits <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/08/08/from-the-emergency-room-to-the-courtroom-va-medical-providers-sued-patients-for-nearly-600-million-over-past-five-years/" target="_blank">filed by Virginia hospitals</a> in 2018.</p>
<p>Johns Hopkins University’s research found that the volume of <a href="https://www.axios.com/hospital-lawsuits-slowing-down-media-35ce395a-9fe3-4b23-b815-d7b06cce2773.html" target="_blank">medical debt lawsuits dropped nationwide</a> after the practice began drawing public scrutiny.</p>

(Ned Oliver/ Virginia Mercury)</p><p>The Virginia Employment Commission rolled out<a href="https://vaunemploymenthelp.as.me/schedule.php?owner=22977371&amp;" target="_blank"> a new appointment system</a> Thursday to help people struggling to get their unemployment claims resolved.</p>
<p>Within hours, all of the available slots in the state’s most populous regions were booked up, frustrating lawmakers who had been urged to share the new appointment system with constituents who have been flooding their offices with calls after being unable to get the agency to answer their questions.</p>
<p>“We were very, very pleased to see that there was finally a door opening at the VEC, but it appears that it was a very small door, and it appears that it has already shut,” said Sen. Steve Newman, R-Lynchburg.</p>
<p>The employment commission has generated <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/04/26/virginia-still-ranks-last-in-nation-for-quickly-resolving-issues-with-unemployment-insurance-claims/" target="_blank">bipartisan frustration</a> during the pandemic, but lawmakers said they’ve faced a fresh wave of complaints in recent weeks after a change in federal programs required many people receiving benefits to reapply, which in some cases meant aid has stopped until the agency can conduct a manual review. Lawmakers also cited complications created by the resumption of the work search requirement and new identification checking protocols.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for VEC, Joyce Fogg, did not respond to questions about how many appointments were available and how many have been made, but said people hoping to schedule a time to receive a phone call from a VEC agent should check back daily.</p>
<p>“Appointments are being booked two weeks out,” Fogg said. “More will be added daily.”</p>

Joe Morrissey, D-Richmond. (Photo by Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>Sen. Joe Morrissey, D-Richmond, won a two-year restraining order this week against a Rockingham County man with ties to a far-right militia who had filed a Freedom of Information Act Request with his office.</p>
<p>The bizarre case involved a violent tweet, a threatening phone call and a long-running feud between the defendant and Morrissey’s biggest political donor, Nexus Services, a Virginia-based company that has faced repeated accusations of exploiting vulnerable immigrants.</p>
<p>Retired District Judge Gene Woolard also found the defendant, David Briggman, guilty of a misdemeanor charge of using profane or threatening language during a phone call, but said he denied prosecutors’ request for an active jail sentence to reduce the likelihood the case would be appealed.</p>
<p>“God help another judge hear all this,” Woolard said as the five-hour trial concluded.</p>
<p>Morrissey’s entanglement with Briggman began in early 2020 after a Nexus employee forwarded him a post Briggman made on Twitter about Del. Kathy Tran, D-Richmond, who had announced she was expecting her fourth child. “A Louisville Slugger would be a great tool to enable a post-birth abortion of your bundle of joy!” Briggman wrote about Tran, who became the<a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/01/30/failed-legislation-loosening-restrictions-on-late-term-abortions-which-are-already-legal-in-some-cases-in-virginia-ignites-furor/" target="_blank"> focus of outrage and online threats</a> after video went viral of her presenting a bill in 2019 that would have loosened restrictions on late term abortion<strong>. </strong></p>
<p>Morrissey testified he sent the post and a psychological profile of Briggman prepared by Nexus to the Capitol Police.</p>
<p>Briggman, a former employee of Nexus, has been in a public battle with company since quitting in 2017, publicizing negative information about their business operations, which have <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/libre-by-nexus-immigrants-settlement-virginia/2020/11/30/82b66e8e-2f49-11eb-860d-f7999599cbc2_story.html" target="_blank">drawn</a> <a href="https://www.newsleader.com/story/news/local/2020/07/16/libre-nexus-settles-suit-ca-insurance-commission-5-5-million-verona-virginia-immigrants/5449717002/" target="_blank">nationwide</a> <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/enforcement/actions/nexus-services-inc-et-al/" target="_blank">scrutiny</a> for charging immigrants <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/this-company-is-making-millions-from-americas-broken-immigration-system/2017/03/08/43abce9e-f881-11e6-be05-1a3817ac21a5_story.html" target="_blank">high monthly fees to wear GPS ankle monitors</a> in exchange for arranging their release from ICE detention centers. Briggman has also made derogatory and occasionally violent social media posts about the company’s executives.</p>
<p>Likewise, the company has pursued a range of legal actions against Briggman, including taking him to court for <a href="https://www.dnronline.com/news/harrisonburg/nexus-requests-private-lawyer-in-theft-case/article_3e83da20-3aa7-11e7-b138-e344e42761ed.html" target="_blank">allegedly stealing paper towels and a surge protector</a> from the company.</p>
<p>In that case, an associate employed by Morrissey made an unsuccessful bid to serve as a private prosecutor against Briggman, which both Morrissey and Briggman testified this week was the only time they had previously encountered one another.</p>
<p>They were reunited in September 2020 after Briggman said he learned through a civil lawsuit filed by Nexus in Florida that the company had prepared a psychological profile and provided it to Morrissey.</p>
<p>In an effort to obtain a copy, Briggman filed the Freedom of Information Act request with Morrissey’s office. A phone call followed &#8212; Briggman and Morrissey each claim the other initiated it. And Briggman and Morrissey each claimed the other proceeded to swear and make violent threats.</p>
<p>Morrissey’s version of events was backed by two employees in his office, both of whom said Briggman initiated the call and one of whom said she heard Morrissey’s side of it and did not hear him say anything threatening.</p>
<p>Briggman’s lawyer, John Bauserman, countered that Morrissey’s testimony could not be trusted given his history of criminal convictions and disbarment for lying. Bauserman also questioned Morrissey’s motivations in bringing the case given his political connections to Nexus, which <a href="https://www.vpap.org/committees/332111/morrissey-for-senate-joe/" target="_blank">donated $32,000 to his campaign for Senate</a> &#8212; more than any other single donor, according to the Virginia Public Access Project.</p>
<p>“Mr. Morrissey is not entitled to any benefit of the doubt,” Bauserman said.</p>
<p>To bolster the case for the protective order, three people connected to Nexus testified that they had faced ongoing harassment by Briggman. One Rockingham couple that lives near Briggman and helped repossess a truck on Nexus’ behalf said they found a ski mask, hand cuffs and weapons in the vehicle and that after the vehicle was taken, he spied on them and a horse they own was shot by an unknown person.</p>
<p>Nexus’ vice president of risk management, Erik Schneider, testified that Briggman had posted a surreptitiously taken photo of him on Facebook that he considered threatening. (Briggman countered that the photo had been sent to him and the caption was merely a reference to Schneider’s 2004 appearance on “Dog the Bounty Hunter.”) Schneider also testified about a post in which Briggman edited his face into a violent clip from Stanley Kubrick&#8217;s “The Shining.”</p>
<p>Morrissey took the stand and noted Briggman’s stint as president of the Virginia Oath Keepers, which he described as a “domestic terror organization.” The organization’s website says they are independent of the national militia of the same name, whose members have been <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/30/politics/oath-keepers-capitol-riot-charged/index.html" target="_blank">investigated in connection to the Jan. 6 uprising at the Capitol</a>.</p>
<p>Briggman, meanwhile, acknowledged the social media post about Tran but called it protected “political hyperbole” and noted the Capitol Police did not pursue charges against him. And he flatly denied menacing Nexus’ employees, possessing a ski mask or shooting horses.</p>
<p>He said that before Morrissey sought charges against him, he had filed charges against Morrissey in relation to the same incident, accusing Morrissey of using the court system to retaliate. Briggman’s case against Morrissey is scheduled for a hearing in Shenandoah County next month.</p>
<p>Briggman struggled to control himself as he testified, prompting repeated admonishments by his own lawyer to answer questions without offering additional commentary and refrain from interrupting the judge.</p>
<p>Both the commonwealth’s attorney, who prosecuted the criminal charge, and Morrissey’s lawyer, who represented the senator in the request for the restraining order, referenced Briggman’s conduct in the courtroom in their closing arguments.</p>
<p>“All I can say is, can you imagine what he’s like in the general public if he doesn’t like you? He can’t even control himself here,” said Paul Gregorio, who represented Morrissey.</p>
<p>Briggman’s lawyer, meanwhile, called his client’s Facebook posts despicable, but said they were just “stupid, silly jackass political rhetoric.”</p>
<p>Judge Woolard said his disagreed, calling the posts disturbing. He said he hoped Briggman would “learn to shut his mouth every so often” but that “I can’t make him change” and “anger management would be a waste of time.”</p>
<p>He said any violations of the punishment should return to him. “I wouldn’t subject another judge to this,” he said.</p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>Leaders of the Virginia Employment Commission told state lawmakers Thursday they expect to meet the terms of a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2021/05/26/virginia-unemployment-lawsuit-settlement/" target="_blank">legal settlement</a> that requires them to resolve 92,000 outstanding jobless claims by Labor Day.</p>
<p>But state delegates and senators sitting on the General Assembly’s unemployment oversight committee said their offices continue to face a deluge of complaints from residents struggling to reach the commission.</p>
<p>“My phone is burning up,” said Sen. Lionell Spruill, D-Chesapeake. “I mean, this is my whole time &#8212; we spend all day, every day.”</p>
<p>Lawmakers also complained that a special line set up aimed at making it easier to reach the commission did not appear to be helping. “I have called these numbers myself,” said Del. Candi King, D-Prince William. “It is not working.”</p>
<p>Ellen Marie Hess, who leads the employment commission, said she is continuing to add staff. “We&#8217;re doing the work to get folks on the phones to be able to talk to your constituents, but the truth of the matter is, they don&#8217;t really want to talk to anyone at VEC,” she said. “They want their benefits. So what we&#8217;re trying to do is get through the adjudications, and we are adding adjudicators just like we are adding folks to the phones.”</p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Het6zXIMzH"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2021/04/26/virginia-still-ranks-last-in-nation-for-quickly-resolving-issues-with-unemployment-insurance-claims/">Virginia still ranks last in nation for quickly resolving issues with unemployment insurance claims</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Virginia still ranks last in nation for quickly resolving issues with unemployment insurance claims&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2021/04/26/virginia-still-ranks-last-in-nation-for-quickly-resolving-issues-with-unemployment-insurance-claims/embed/#?secret=ACJiC73qCM#?secret=Het6zXIMzH" data-secret="Het6zXIMzH" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p>Members of the commission also asked Hess to provide regular updates documenting the commission’s progress at resolving the claims backlog and other customer-service functions. Del. Sally Hudson, D-Charlottesville, observed that state leaders have traditionally focused on the balance of the state’s unemployment insurance trust fund, which primarily impacts business tax rates.</p>
<p>“This commission pays a lot of attention to the state’s pocketbook,” Hudson, a labor economist at UVA, said. “We need to pay additional and equal attention to how well this system is serving our constituents. So I hope going forward we won’t think of these constituent service metrics as an unusual addendum to the core presentation.”</p>
<p>Business groups raised their own concerns at the meeting, asking lawmakers to consider dedicating a portion of federal aid from the American Rescue Plan to head off a massive increase in payroll taxes that would otherwise be necessary to rebuild the fund that covers jobless benefits.</p>
<p>Virginia expects to receive $4.3 billion through the American Rescue Plan. The employment commission estimates it would take $1.3 billion to restore the unemployment trust fund to pre-pandemic levels and shield businesses from future payroll tax hikes.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/all-releases/2021/may/headline-895119-en.html" target="_blank">joint statement last month</a>, Gov. Ralph Northam and leaders in the House and Senate listed rebuilding the trust fund as one of four major priorities for the aid, alongside funding for public health programs, small businesses and public schools.</p>
<p>Nicole Riley, the state director of the National Federation for Independent Businesses, said the help would be welcome. “We hope, certainly, that can be a big priority from the General Assembly and governor’s office,” she said.</p>

Hala Ayala, D-Prince William, spoke at a rally in 2019 on the steps of the Capitol in support of the Equal Rights Amendment. (Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>Del. Hala Ayala, the newly minted Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor, drew harsh criticism in the final days of the campaign for flipping on a promise to refuse campaign donations from state-regulated monopolies.</p>
<p>Her campaign ducked questions about the decision last week after <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/06/03/campaign-finance-reports-ayala-flips-on-dominion-youngkin-self-funds-and-a-big-bundle-of-shadowy-money-emerges/" target="_blank">finance reports revealed</a> she had accepted a $100,000 donation from Dominion Energy, but in an interview at a polling place in Prince William on Tuesday, she suggested the decision came down to being able to fund her campaign’s voter outreach.</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s about talking to voters, right? And making sure we communicate and get our message out because it overwhelmingly resonates, as you&#8217;ve seen,” she said.</p>
<p>But she insisted that her perspective on energy and utility regulation had not changed.</p>
<p>“People change their minds all the time. People grow. That doesn&#8217;t change where my focus is,” she said. “I will always fight for renewable energies. I will always fight for Virginians. My record is the only thing that I have to show my accountability.”</p>
<p>Donations from Dominion, the state’s largest corporate donor, have split Democrats in recent years, as has Clean Virginia &#8212; an advocacy group that set out to counter the company’s influence by offering substantial donations to candidates who refuse support from utilities.</p>
<p>Ayala made multiple promises to refuse Dominion’s donation since she was first elected in 2017. After she pledged to refuse the money in her latest campaign for lieutenant governor, Clean Virginia donated $25,000 to her campaign.</p>
<p>She called the organization’s decision to retaliate with a $125,000 ad buy against her “unfortunate,” but said she had no opinion on the broader debate within the Democratic party over the organization’s role in state politics.</p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Terry McAuliffe won Petersburg, the hometown of one of his top opponents, former delegate Jennifer Carroll Foy, who had accused him of neglecting the majority-Black city during his first term. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He won in Richmond, where Sen. Jennifer McClellan had an advantage due to her strong local following.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He won in Nelson County, a hotbed of opposition to the controversial Atlantic Coast Pipeline project that earned McAuliffe the ire of activists who pressed unsuccessfully for him to block it during his first term.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He got almost 65 percent support in Fairfax County, the biggest prize in prosperous Northern Virginia. He did just as well or better in far Southwest Virginia, a region with some of the lowest per-capita incomes in the state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He won everywhere. Literally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By winning the most votes in all 133 of Virginia’s cities and counties, McAuliffe’s victory exceeded the most optimistic expectations of his own campaign, even with its cash advantages and built-in name recognition.</span></p>
<p>https://twitter.com/TerryMcAuliffe/status/1402445317669335043</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you’re a McAuliffe staffer, you might just be coming down from the high,” said Quentin Kidd, director of the Wason Center for Public Policy at Christopher Newport University.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Public polls had shown McAuliffe getting around 50 percent of the vote. Unofficial results showed him exceeding 62 percent, with almost as many raw votes as Gov. Ralph Northam got in his more competitive 2017 primary contest against former congressman Tom Perriello. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Terry was overwhelmed to receive the support of all 133 cities and counties in Virginia,” said McAuliffe spokesman Jake Rubenstein. “Each and every one of these communities mean so much to Terry and Dorothy, and their confidence in his record and vision mean the world.”</span></p>
<p>McAuliffe will now face off against Republican nominee Glenn Youngkin in what&#8217;s expected to be a closely watched, expensive general-election battle.</p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a post-race memo Tuesday night, the Carroll Foy campaign said her distant second-place finish could be partially attributed to “historically difficult” conditions for non-incumbent candidates. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic and the grueling 2020 presidential campaign, the memo said, “voter exhaustion was significant.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It became easier to default to the person voters knew: Terry McAuliffe,” the Carroll Foy campaign wrote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carroll Foy earned almost 20 percent of the vote, and her campaign touted the strides she made going from little-known newcomer to statewide contender in just a few years. But she has no other elected office to return to after quitting her House of Delegates position last year to focus on running for governor and raising money.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After her third-place finish at 11.6 percent, McClellan plans to continue serving in the Senate. Unlike Carroll Foy, she didn&#8217;t sharply attack McAuliffe in the primary contest, perhaps preserving her standing in the party moving forward. Immediately after McAuliffe&#8217;s victory, the Youngkin campaign <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/557472-youngkin-releases-two-new-ads-following-mcauliffe-win-in-virginia-primary" target="_blank">released</a> an ad featuring a highlight reel of Carroll Foy&#8217;s criticisms of McAuliffe as a lackluster, throwback politician.</span></p>

Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond, campaigns for governor in Richmond ahead of the primary. (Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though McClellan and Carroll Foy competed for resources and were often grouped together as two potentially history-making Black women, some political observers say it’s an oversimplification to suggest they hopelessly split a portion of the electorate that would’ve aligned against McAuliffe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McAuliffe and McClellan were both competing in an establishment lane, Kidd said, while Carroll Foy was competing with Del. Lee Carter, D-Manassas, more the party’s progressive wing and running against the status quo. If McClellan hadn’t been in the race, Kidd said, some of her support might have gone to McAuliffe instead.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t think it would’ve all been to Carroll Foy,” Kidd said. “And even if it did, McAuliffe still would have doubled that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McAuliffe was also running against several candidates trying to make the leap from the General Assembly to the top Executive Branch job, forgoing the more traditional route of running for governor after serving as attorney general or lieutenant governor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax’s hopes for higher office changed abruptly in February 2019, when two women accused him of sexual assault. He adamantly denied the allegations, but his fourth-place finish Tuesday showed the scandal was too much to overcome despite his higher profile as a statewide officeholder.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Virginia’s gubernatorial contest serving as one of the first barometers of Democratic enthusiasm, there was debate Tuesday over what to make of the primary turnout. An estimated 8 percent of registered voters participated in the Democratic primary, <a href="https://www.vpap.org/visuals/visual/primary-turnout-down-compared-to-2017/" target="_blank">according to the Virginia Public Access Project</a>, down from the 2017 spike of 9.9 percent but up from 6.4 percent in 2009.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stephen Farnsworth, director of the University of Mary Washington’s Center for Leadership and Media Studies, said he read the numbers as “a draw.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Turnout was not so high that Democrats can be gleeful and not so low that Republicans can be gleeful,” Farnsworth said. “It was better than some years, worse than others.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kidd said he thinks Democrats can feel good about not seeing a bigger dip toward 2009 turnout levels, even if it didn’t match the 2017 levels that foretold the eventual Democratic takeover of state government. The fact that McAuliffe ran against a diverse field and still walked away with more than 60 percent of the vote, Kidd said “says a lot.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s a resounding message of support among Democrats for him,” Kidd said.</span></p>

Lawmakers have sent legislation to Gov. Glenn Youngkin giving localities new powers to go after substandard housing. (Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>Primary voters in Virginia delivered a rebuke to the left wing of the Democratic party on Tuesday, sweeping three outspoken incumbents from office and rejecting progressive challengers in all but one race.</p>
<p>By the end of the night, voters had booted Dels. Lee Carter, D-Prince William, the General Assembly’s only socialist; Ibraheem Samirah, D-Fairfax, a progressive activist who protested Trump during an official visit; and Mark Levine, D-Alexandria, one of the chamber’s most forceful proponents of gun control.</p>
<p>“We just need to be on the same team as much as possible,” said Lisa Giovanini, a stay-at-home mom in Fairfax who said she had supported Samirah in years prior but said she disliked his confrontational style and unwillingness to cooperate with party leadership.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, well-funded attempts to unseat more moderate candidates, including Del. Candi King, D-Prince William, fell flat.</p>
<p>One exception to the trend came in Portsmouth, where political newcomer Nadarius Clark defeated Del. Steve Heretick, one of the most moderate members of the House Democratic Caucus, who had opposed gun control measures and the removal of Confederate monuments.</p>
<p>The local returns came as Democratic primary voters nominated candidates for governor, lieutenant governor and attorney general who were overwhelmingly backed by the establishment wing of the state party.</p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;McAuliffe crushes competitors in Democratic primary for governor&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2021/06/08/mcauliffe-crushes-competitors-in-democratic-primary-for-governor/embed/#?secret=s6NZp2EOIF#?secret=BUcJjdrHP1" data-secret="BUcJjdrHP1" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p>In all, four of 14 Democratic incumbents lost to challengers. On the other side of the aisle, three GOP delegates faced primaries and one, Del. Charles Poindexter, R-Franklin, lost amid criticism he had not sufficiently embraced Trump’s claims of election fraud.</p>
<p>Carter and Levine had both attempted to hold onto their seats while simultaneously running for statewide office. Carter had sought the governorship, coming in last place with just under 3 percent of the vote. Levine did slightly better in the lieutenant governor’s race, coming in third in a six-person field.</p>
<p>But both fared poorly in their delegates races, winning just 40 percent of the vote.</p>
<p>While Levine has not issued a statement, Carter said he was ready to step back from state politics.</p>
<p>“This job has made me miserable for the last 4 years,” Carter tweeted Tuesday evening. “I made a lot of people&#8217;s lives objectively better, but the constant assassination threats and harassment were terrible for my family and my health. I&#8217;m relieved to say that I&#8217;ve done my part, and now it&#8217;s someone else&#8217;s turn.</p>
<p>Carter had primarily emphasized labor issues during his four years in the General Assembly. He also authored legislation capping copays on insulin at $50 a month. He lost Tuesday to Michelle Maldonado, a former lawyer who now works as a leadership consultant. Levine, who served for six years and made gun control measures a focus of his campaign, lost to Elizabeth Bennett-Parker, who currently serves as the vice mayor of Alexandria. Both Maldonado and Bennett-Parker said during the campaign they would focus on education and the economy.</p>
<p>In Fairfax, both Samirah and his opponent, Irene Shin, ran as progressives. But Shin was also backed by more than $100,000 in contributions from a PAC with ties to a group dedicated to electing centrist candidates.</p>
<p>Shin said she shared many of Samirah’s policy goals, but would work more cooperatively with fellow Democrats. A frequent point of criticism on the campaign trail &#8212; and an issue referenced by voters as they left the polls &#8212; were Samirah’s votes against legislation that was supported by most Democrats, including budget language that funded an investigation into racism at Virginia Military Institute.</p>
<p>Samirah had said he supported the investigation but that VMI already got plenty of money from the state and should have to pay for it itself.</p>
<p>Talking to a voter outside a polling place, Shin said she would be more open to compromise to achieve goals. “You don’t get to stomp your feet and say, &#8216;I’m not going to vote on this,” she said. “That is the difference between an activist and an elected official.”</p>
<p>Samirah’s supporters countered that they liked having a delegate who was willing to buck party leadership. And they said they weren’t concerned that Shin had won endorsements from local leaders and state senators, interpreting it as a sign that he was more focused on everyday people.</p>
<p>“They say it like it’s a bad thing,” said Selina Al-Shiahbi, who was volunteering for Samirah’s campaign.</p>
<p>Two other closely watched races had morphed into a proxy-war of sorts, with establishment Democrats and Dominion Energy on one side and progressives and anti-Dominion Clean Virginia on the other. Dominion is the state&#8217;s largest corporate donor and Michael Bills, a hedge fund manager who founded Clean Virginia, is the state&#8217;s largest individual donor, according to campaign finance records compiled by the Virginia Public Access Project.</p>
<p>The anti-Dominion side proved victorious in Portsmouth, where Clark, a 26-year-old political organizer funded almost entirely by Clean Virginia and an associated PAC, beat Heretick, who had been in the House since 2016 and counted Dominion as his biggest donor.</p>

<p>“I’m so happy that I was able to do this — to show Virginia that we needed new representation — that the time is now to make a change,” Clark <a href="https://twitter.com/AndyFoxWAVY/status/1402455039206211585" target="_blank">told WAVY-TV on Tuesday evening</a>. “People like me don’t normally get this opportunity to represent their community.”</p>
<p>Heretick was sharply critical of the advocacy group’s efforts to unseat him. “Any time you see one contributor donating basically over 90 percent of your opponent’s campaign budget, which appears to be unlimited, that’s a little daunting,” he said last week.</p>
<p>Clean Virginia’s efforts were less successful in Prince William, where challenger Pamela Montgomery outraised Del. Candi King six to one but still lost by a wide margin.</p>
<p>At the polls, many of King’s supporters said they were aware King had opted to accept campaign contributions from Dominion, which is in the process of cleaning up leaky coal ash ponds in the district. And while they said they didn’t necessarily agree with King’s stance on the issue, they didn’t hold it against her, either.</p>
<p>“I was like, ‘Oh, why would she take that money,’” said Kayla Mitchell, who attends college at Christopher Newport University. “But how could I sit here and berate her when I’ve made plenty of mistakes of my own in my 23 years on this earth. I just think it shows that not everyone we vote for is perfect.”</p>
<p>Mitchell and others said they supported King because they knew her well and considered her a stronger presence in the community.</p>
<p>“I’m just more familiar with her,” said Jack Bryan, an Army veteran, who said he largely brushed off the piles of <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/05/26/va-house-democratic-caucus-oks-mailers-portraying-top-democratic-donors-as-dark-money-billionaires/" target="_blank">attack ads the race generated</a>.</p>
<p>On the GOP side, three incumbents faced challenges, but only one was remotely competitive. Wren Williams, who served as deputy legal counsel for Donald Trump’s campaign in the Wisconsin recount, ousted Del. Charles Poindexter, R-Franklin, who had held the seat for 14 years.</p>
<p>Williams made Poindexter’s failure to embrace Trump’s election fraud claims a centerpiece of his campaign. “I guess the final straw for me is November came and went, then December, then January, and we didn’t hear a peep out of my delegate,” Williams said last week. “Nothing about the election, nothing about Donald Trump, nothing about election integrity.”</p>
<p>The message apparently resonated with GOP voters; Williams won with more than 60 percent of the vote.</p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>Virginia’s murder rate climbed to its highest level since the late 1990s last year, according to crime statistics <a href="https://www.vsp.virginia.gov/pdf/Crime_in_Virginia/Crime_In_Virginia_2020.pdf" target="_blank">released</a> by the Virginia State Police this week.</p>
<p>Police reported 537 homicides in 2020, up from 455 in 2019, bringing the rate per 100,000 residents to just over six &#8212; a number last seen in 1998 as the crime wave that peaked earlier in the decade began to taper off, according to FBI reports.</p>
<p>Localities large and small have felt the uptick.</p>
<p>Henry County, a jurisdiction of 55,000 along the North Carolina border, saw one of the biggest percentage increases. Police reported nine homicides in the county, up from two the year prior. That’s a 350 percent year-over-year increase and the most recorded in at least a decade. In the most <a href="https://martinsvillebulletin.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/murder-and-conspiracy-charges-advance-in-shooting-death-of-henry-county-woman/article_bd42142a-e537-5a4f-9b01-2582abe4aff2.html" target="_blank">high profile case</a>, a former sheriff’s deputy is accused of conspiring with a lover to murder his wife.</p>
<p>Most of the state’s large jurisdictions also recorded more homicides. Of them, Portsmouth saw the steepest increase &#8212; a 125 percent rise from 16 homicides in 2019 to 36 in 2020. The victims include a 17-year-old felled by a <a href="https://www.wavy.com/news/crime/portsmouth-police-issue-appeal-for-tips-in-teens-homicide/" target="_blank">drive-by shooting</a> and a sailor shot and killed <a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/news/crime/vp-nw-taiquan-moore-preliminary-hearing-20210325-onjz3vlmtvew7g3xi25jglpequ-story.html" target="_blank">during a fight</a>.</p>

<p>Cities around the country have recorded similar increases in murders. Experts, analysts and police have offered a variety of potential explanations.</p>
<p>Among them: The <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-19/the-u-s-homicide-rate-spiked-in-2020-why" target="_blank">destabilizing effects of the pandemic</a>, which shut down services like schools and libraries and led to a surge in unemployment; a <a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/02/21/2020-murder-homicide-rate-causes/" target="_blank">further fraying of relationships between communities and police</a> following the murder of George Floyd, which could have made people less likely to report crimes or disputes to police; and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/03/03/971854488/did-record-gun-sales-cause-a-spike-in-gun-crime-researchers-say-its-complicated" target="_blank">record gun sales during the pandemic</a>. (Police report guns were used in 80 percent of the murders in Virginia last year.)</p>
<p>Outside of homicides and serious assaults, crime was mostly down last year, with police reporting fewer kidnappings, rapes, other sex offenses and robberies.</p>
