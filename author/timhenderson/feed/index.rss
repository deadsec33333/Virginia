Apartment rent has fallen in major metropolitan areas around the U.S. over the past six months according to findings from The Wall Street Journal.  (Brandon Bell/Getty Images)</p><p>A recent immigration surge brought newcomers to every state this year, helping to offset a continued drop in U.S. births while contributing to a national upswing of about 3.3 million new residents, according to new U.S. Census Bureau estimates.</p>
<p>Texas and Florida continued to dominate state population growth, together adding more than 1 million people from mid-2023 to mid-2024 and making up almost a third of the nation’s population increase. The state numbers include births, deaths, immigrants and residents moving from other states.</p>
<p>Nationally, this year’s population growth was up from the 2.8 million increase in 2023 and the 1.9 million boost in 2022, according to state population estimates released Thursday.</p>
<p>The population jump — the largest single-year increase since 2001 — was buoyed by a 21% increase in net immigration.</p>
	<div class="newsroomSidebarContainer ">
	<div class="newsroomSidebar">Virginia saw a 0.9% increase in its population from July 2023 to July 2024, according to U.S.  Census Bureau figures, with 76,510 newcomers arriving in the commonwealth in that time.</p>
<p>Of that growth, 73.4% was due to immigration, with 56,155 migrants moving here over the same time period.</div>
	</div>
	
<p>Immigration has become a more significant factor in population changes, making up all or almost all the growth for 18 states in every part of the country this year, according to an analysis of the data by William Frey, a demographer for the Brookings Institution, a left-leaning think tank.</p>
<p>“This points up the importance of immigration, not just to a couple of big states but to a broad swath of our country,” Frey said. “It’s going to be very welcome in a lot of places that would not be gaining many people or [would be] losing people because of lower fertility and higher deaths.”</p>
<p>Immigration grew in every state, ranging from an increase of about 69,000 people in Florida and California and 57,000 in Texas, down to a few hundred in Montana and Wyoming. The growth in the immigrant population ranged from 19% in Alaska to 36% in Montana.</p>
<p>California and Illinois were among states that had lost residents earlier in the decade, and their growth over the past year could help both stem expected losses in congressional representation after the next nationwide census in 2030.</p>
<p>If the growth continues, it would trim California’s loss to three seats in the U.S. House of Representatives instead of four, and Illinois could lose one seat instead of two, said Kimball Brace, a Virginia-based redistricting expert.</p>
<p>Florida, where growth has slowed slightly, could gain one fewer congressional seat than predicted — three instead of four, he said.</p>
<p>“Clearly immigration is coming into play — a couple years ago you had people talking about California going off the deep end [with population loss] and now it doesn’t look so deep,” said Brace, president of political consulting firm Election Data Services Inc.</p>
<p><iframe id="datawrapper-chart-lc1Ro" title="Immigration sparks population growth" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/lc1Ro/6/" height="530" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" aria-label="Map" data-external="1" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></p>
<p>California ranked third in the number of new residents from July 1, 2023, to July 1, 2024, according to census estimates, with a gain of about 233,000, thanks to both immigration and people moving in from other states. The Golden State was followed by North Carolina (165,000) and New York (130,000). Illinois grew by about 68,000 and Louisiana by about 9,700.</p>
<p>Florida and Texas also were the leaders in percentage change, growing about 2% in that year, followed by Utah (1.8%), South Carolina and Nevada (both up 1.7%), and Idaho and North Carolina (both up 1.5%).</p>
<p>Only three states had population losses for the year, of a few hundred people each: West Virginia, Vermont and Mississippi.</p>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" title="“5 Southern states had most of the nation’s population growth” — Stateline" src="https://stateline.org/2023/12/20/5-southern-states-had-most-of-the-nations-population-growth/embed/#?secret=2GFSGOZpH2#?secret=nvaSVLIAUj" width="500" height="432" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" sandbox="allow-scripts" data-secret="nvaSVLIAUj" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></p>
<p>In Texas, the cities of Houston, Austin and Dallas added the most new housing last year — almost 40,000 new units among them — and are likely to be the centers of new population growth, according to a <a href="https://www.demographics.texas.gov/Resources/TDC/Presentations/6d12aaac-2724-4c5e-861e-6bc84f200cfa/2023_EstimatesWebinar.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">state report in November</a>. Collin County, a Dallas suburb, is also one of the state’s fastest growing areas, with more than 16,000 new housing units added last year and almost 64,000 since 2020, according to the report.</p>
<p>Florida’s recent growth was concentrated in Jacksonville, Port St. Lucie, Miami, Tampa and Orlando, according to a <a href="https://edr.state.fl.us/Content/population-demographics/reports/econographicnews_2024_Volume%201.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">state report this year</a>.</p>
<p>A surplus of births over deaths helped most in New York, California, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan.</p>
<p>New York City has built more housing, which helped stem net losses from people moving away, said Jan Vink, a senior extension associate at Cornell University’s Program on Applied Demographics.</p>
<p>That’s encouraging news for the state’s future, Vink said. In November, the <a href="https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2024/11/stark-population-decline-projected-nys" target="_blank" rel="noopener">university estimated</a> that New York’s population could shrink by as much as 2 million people over the next 25 years because of low fertility rates and aging, unless those losses are offset by new arrivals in the form of immigration or people moving from other states.</p>
<p>Texas, the Carolinas, Florida and Tennessee had the largest numbers of new residents moving in from other states, though the numbers were down in all those states from the previous year as high interest rates and housing prices led more people to postpone moves.</p>

Multiracial cultures such as Puerto Rican and Dominican may pose problems for new proposed Census Bureau survey formats that ask about race and Hispanic status separately. (Stephanie Keith/Getty Images)</p><p>The U.S. Census Bureau and a growing number of states are starting to gather more detailed information about Americans’ race and ethnicity, a change some advocates of the process say will allow people to choose identities that more closely reflect how they see themselves.</p>
<p>Crunching and sorting through those specific details — known as data disaggregation — will help illuminate disparities in areas such as housing and health outcomes that could be hidden within large racial and ethnic categories. But some experts say the details also might make it harder for Black people from multiracial countries to identify themselves.</p>
<p>Racial data gleaned from the census is important because local, state, tribal and federal governments <a href="https://www.census.gov/acs/www/about/why-we-ask-each-question/race/#:~:text=Local%2C%20state%2C%20tribal%2C%20and,or%20services%20for%20specific%20groups." target="_blank" rel="noopener">use it to guide</a> certain civil rights policies and “in planning and funding government programs that provide funds or services for specific groups,” according to the Census Bureau.</p>
<p>The form will have checkboxes for main categories — current census groupings include “Asian,” “Black,” “African American” and “White,” among others — followed by more specific checkboxes. Under Asian, for example, might be Chinese, Asian Indian, Filipino, Vietnamese, Korean or Japanese. And then there will be an empty box for people to write in more specific subgroups.</p>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" title="“Census change will lead to more data on health of Middle Eastern, North African people in US” — Stateline" src="https://stateline.org/2024/04/19/census-change-will-lead-to-more-data-on-health-of-middle-eastern-north-african-people-in-us/embed/#?secret=hBxpUfAhA6#?secret=XZ6sRY7dqH" width="500" height="461" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" sandbox="allow-scripts" data-secret="XZ6sRY7dqH" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></p>
<p>Collecting more detail by allowing free-form answers, for example, will make it possible for people to identify themselves as part of more racial and ethnic subgroups — such as “Sardinian” (an autonomous region within Italy) instead of simply “Italian” — and include alternative names for certain groups, such as writing “Schitsu’umsh,” the ancient language for “Coeur D’Alene Tribe.”</p>
<p>And the Census Bureau will for the first time include Middle Eastern/North African as a separate racial/ethnic category for respondents with that heritage. Until now, Middle Eastern people who did not choose a race were treated as a <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2023/09/2020-census-dhc-a-mena-population.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">subcategory</a> under “white,” based on a 1944 court <a href="https://www.lwv.org/blog/representing-middle-eastern-and-north-african-citizens-census#:~:text=It%20would%20not%20be%20until%20a%20district,Walter%2DMcCarran%20Act%20nullified%20all%20previous%20Asian%2Dexclusion%20laws." target="_blank" rel="noopener">ruling</a> intended to protect Arab immigrants from racist laws banning U.S. citizenship for nonwhite immigrants.</p>
<p>Under <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/03/29/2024-06469/revisions-to-ombs-statistical-policy-directive-no-15-standards-for-maintaining-collecting-and" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new federal guidelines</a> approved in March, the bureau also will give people the option to check no race at all if they identify as Hispanic or Middle Eastern/North African.</p>
<p>The Census Bureau already has decided to use more open-ended questions in both the 2027 American Community Survey and the nation’s 2030 census. But the agency is seeking <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/11/18/2024-26827/the-census-bureaus-proposed-raceethnicity-code-list-for-the-american-community-survey-and-the-2030?utm_source=censusSDC&amp;utm_medium=twitter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">public comment</a> on the way write-in responses will be categorized.</p>
<p>The bureau wants to hear how people are likely to identify themselves, said Merarys Ríos-Vargas, chief of the bureau’s Ethnicity and Ancestry Branch, Population Division, in a <a href="https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2024/webinar-race-ethnicity-coding-improvement.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent webinar</a>. The agency also is interested in whether there are missing or incorrect entries in its proposed list of possible responses.</p>
<h4 class="editorialSubhed">    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘It’s about people’s lives’</h4>

	</h4>
<p>Nancy López, a University of New Mexico sociology professor, said she and other experts in Black Hispanic culture think the census should have a “visual race” or “street race” question, so people can communicate how others see them as well as how they identify themselves. The answer might be “Black” or a yet-unrecognized racial category such as “brown.”</p>
<p>“A separate question on race as a visual status helps illuminate the kind of things we are interested in — discrimination in housing, discrimination in employment, discrimination in education and accessing health care in public spaces,” said López, who is the daughter of Dominican immigrants and a co-founder of the university’s Institute for the Study of “Race” &amp; Social Justice.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" title="“Multiracial Residents Are Changing the Face of the US” — Stateline" src="https://stateline.org/2022/05/13/multiracial-residents-are-changing-the-face-of-the-us/embed/#?secret=l7LNDRSW7o#?secret=JvoforhEXM" width="500" height="560" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" sandbox="allow-scripts" data-secret="JvoforhEXM" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></p>
<p>“It’s about people’s lives, it’s about the future, it’s about children, it’s about access to opportunities and it’s about fairness,” she added, noting that even if the federal government doesn’t add such questions to surveys and the decennial census, state and universities can still do it on their own as they collect data for health care, student enrollment and other topics.</p>
<p>The NALEO Educational Fund, an organization representing Latino elected and appointed officials, supports the decision to make a race choice optional for Hispanics.</p>
<p>“Many Latinos did not see themselves in any of the categories for their racial identity,” said Rosalind Gold, NALEO’s chief public policy officer. “There’s a large number of Latinos who feel that identifying as Latino is both their racial and ethnic identity.”</p>
<p>Gold said NALEO understands the concern some have that failing to require a race designation will obscure racial information on Black Hispanics. But her group argues that the census can get what it needs by educating the public on how to respond and by including prompts on the questionnaires to guide race choices.</p>
<p>Black Hispanic people often see themselves as having a single racial and ethnic identity, according to several experts in Hispanic identity who spoke at a Census Bureau National Advisory Committee meeting Nov. 7.</p>
<p>“They conceptualize themselves as belonging to one [group],” said Nicholas Vargas, an associate professor of ethnic studies at the University of California, Berkeley, speaking at the committee meeting.</p>
<p>“They check ‘Black’ and they check ‘Dominican’ — and don’t want to be counted as two or more,” he said.</p>
<p>In response, Rachel Marks, an adviser for the Census Bureau on race and ethnicity, said the bureau will consider that issue and other “feedback on how people want to be represented” before making a final decision on survey details.</p>
<p>The bureau may recognize a term, Afro-Latino, that could be used to indicate both Black race and Hispanic ethnicity, according to a proposed code list from the agency, as well as “Blaxican” for Black Mexican and “Blasian“ for Black Asian.</p>
<p>The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, a coalition of civil rights groups, called the more detailed questions <a href="https://www2.census.gov/about/partners/cac/nac/meetings/2024-11/public-comment-leadership-conference-civil-rights.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“a step forward”</a> but also suggested more guidance on the forms to ensure people are categorized the way they want to be. In its comment on the changes, the group noted that in 2020, some people who wrote in “British” under the Black checkbox were categorized as partly white even if they didn’t mean that.</p>
<p>The group <a href="https://civilrights.org/resource/leadership-conference-comments-on-timeline-for-updated-race-and-ethnicity-standards-implementation-on-the-acs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">also said</a> it is “concerned about a conflation of the concepts of race and ethnicity,” and it asked for more research to make sure people understand how to respond.</p>
<h4 class="editorialSubhed">    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">State actions</h4>

	</h4>
<p>Some states are acting on their own to gather more detailed data about identity.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" title="“Black homeowners start to close gap in property values” — Stateline" src="https://stateline.org/2024/05/01/black-homeowners-start-to-close-gap-in-property-values/embed/#?secret=3P9umaNsCr#?secret=3qDw0WdARz" width="500" height="453" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" sandbox="allow-scripts" data-secret="3qDw0WdARz" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></p>
<p>New Jersey is among the latest states to <a href="https://www.nj.gov/governor/news/news/562024/20240112g.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pass a law</a> requiring more detailed race and ethnic data collection for state records such as health data and school enrollment.</p>
<p>A similar <a href="https://legislature.mi.gov/Bills/Bill?ObjectName=2024-HB-5447" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bill</a> in Michigan would require state agencies that gather information to offer “multiracial” and “Middle Eastern or North African” as choices; the bill remains in committee.</p>
<p>And advocates in Oregon, which already <a href="https://secure.sos.state.or.us/oard/viewSingleRule.action?ruleVrsnRsn=315084" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has a law</a> requiring detailed ethnic data collection, are <a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/education/2024/10/asian-american-students-advocates-call-for-the-state-to-collect-more-detailed-data-about-their-ethnicities.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">asking the state</a> for more details on Asian subgroups who face education challenges.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://civilrights.org/edfund/resource/disaggregation-nation-a-landscape-review-of-state-race-ethnicity-data-collection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">December 2023 report</a> by The Leadership Conference Education Fund identified 13 other states with laws requiring more detailed state data on ethnic and racial groups, including laws passed last year in Hawaii, Illinois, Massachusetts and Nevada.</p>
<p>The states of California, Connecticut, Minnesota, New Mexico, New York, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island and Washington already had such laws, the group found.</p>

A historic recovery in manufacturing jobs between 2019 and 2023 was concentrated in small urban areas such as McLean County, where Normal is located, and where car and candy factories have added jobs. (Courtesy of Rivian)</p><p>Before the COVID-19 pandemic, McLean County, Illinois, was known mostly as the home of State Farm Insurance in Bloomington and Illinois State University in Normal.</p>
<p>Now, the area illustrates a trend that’s bringing more factories to small cities with lower costs of living: It has thousands of new jobs manufacturing Rivian electric vehicles and a new candy factory that will produce Kinder Bueno and other Ferrero candies.</p>
<p>“Food and electric cars. This is not something we were known for before 2019,” said Patrick Hoban, president of Bloomington-Normal Economic Development Council in McLean County.</p>
<p>“We’re primarily an insurance and university town that’s just now seeing a rise in manufacturing. Rivian has ramped up from 300 to 8,000 employees, and I don’t think anyone realized how fast that was going to happen,” Hoban said.</p>
<p>President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to rebuild American manufacturing, and he won handily in most areas hollowed out by the movement of factory jobs overseas. But the rebound Trump promises has already been underway in many places: McLean County is part of an unusually strong jump in manufacturing jobs between 2019 and 2023 — the first time manufacturing employment has recovered fully from a recession since the 1970s, according to a <a href="https://eig.org/manufacturing-rebound/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent report</a> from the Economic Innovation Group, a bipartisan public policy organization in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>There were about 12.9 million manufacturing jobs in 2023, slightly more than in 2019. However, the number of manufacturing jobs has declined precipitously since the all-time peak in 1979, when there were 19.4 million of them and they were a much larger share of overall employment.</p>
<p><iframe id="datawrapper-chart-Y3XBW" title="U.S. manufacturing jobs" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Y3XBW/5/" height="400" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" aria-label="Interactive line chart" data-external="1" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></p>
<p>Joseph McCartin, a Georgetown University professor and labor history expert, said manufacturing has been on an upswing since 2010 as the nation started recovering from the Great Recession. The pandemic interrupted the trajectory, but the United States recently saw a hopeful increase in pay for the new jobs, he said, as the Biden administration aimed to increase both wages and jobs through the CHIPS and Science Act and the Inflation Reduction Act.</p>
<p>“The Biden administration tried to use policy to ensure that more of these would be union jobs or at least offer union-level wages,” McCartin said. “This approach is almost certainly dead due to the results of the election.”</p>
<p>Employers may have a hard time filling lower-paying manufacturing jobs such as meat processing if the new Trump administration deports the immigrants who fill them, said William Jones, a University of Minnesota history professor and former president of the Labor and Working Class History Association.</p>
<p>“These will be hard hit if Trump follows up on his deportation plan,” Jones said. “The political rhetoric is that a bunch of native-born workers will move into these jobs, that they’re getting squeezed out, but that’s actually not the case. Some of these industries are extremely dependent on immigrant labor.”</p>
<h4 class="editorialSubhed">    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Where growth happened</h4>

	</h4>
<p>Small urban areas such as McLean County got most of the increase in manufacturing jobs between 2019 and 2023, according to the Economic Innovation Group report. Rural areas lost those jobs, and large cities saw no change.</p>
<p>It was mostly Sun Belt and Western states that saw the increases during those years, according to a Stateline analysis of federal Bureau of Labor Statistics data.</p>
<p>The largest percentage changes in manufacturing jobs were in Nevada (up 14%), Utah (up 11%), and Arizona and Florida (each up 9%). The largest raw numbers of new manufacturing jobs were in Texas (up 48,200), Florida (up 35,100) and Georgia (up 22,900).</p>
<p>Southern states such as Alabama and Mississippi also have seen more automotive jobs as manufacturers have taken advantage of lower costs and state “right-to-work” laws that weaken unions. Vehicle manufacturing jumped by 7,800 in Alabama and 6,600 in Mississippi, the largest increases outside California.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, traditional Rust Belt states have seen continued declines, with manufacturing jobs down about 2% in Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania, and also in Illinois — despite McLean County’s success.</p>
<p><iframe id="datawrapper-chart-6eENR" title="Manufacturing jobs bounce back after pandemic" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/6eENR/3/" height="594" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" aria-label="Map" data-external="1" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></p>
<p>Manufacturing is playing a critical role in Nevada as it tries to diversify its tourist-oriented economy so it can better weather downturns such as the one during the pandemic, said Steve Scheetz, research manager for the Nevada Governor’s Office of Economic Development.</p>
<p>Automotive and other battery manufacturing and recycling, driven by electric carmaker Tesla and battery recycling firm Redwood Materials, account for much of the increase in Nevada manufacturing, Scheetz said.</p>
<p>As in Illinois, the job growth tended to be in smaller areas outside big cities, such as Storey County, just east of Reno, with a population of about 4,200.</p>
<p>“Fifteen years ago, this small county in rural Nevada was relatively unknown,” Scheetz said, adding that jobs and economic output has risen tenfold and the number of total jobs — including manufacturing — has grown from less than 4,000 to almost 16,000 in those 15 years. The county also is home to plants making building materials, industrial minerals and molded rubber, among other products.</p>
<p>The Biden administration focused on bringing more blue-collar jobs to small cities like Normal and Bloomington, said Jones, the University of Minnesota professor.</p>
<p>“Much of the growth is due to [President Joe] Biden’s manufacturing investments. There was a conscious strategy to focus on small towns to get the political benefit in places that tended to vote Republican,” said Jones.</p>
<p>If there was a play for political benefit, it got mixed results: Vice President Kamala Harris <a href="https://apnews.com/projects/election-results-2024/illinois/?r=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">carried McLean County</a>, Illinois, on Nov. 5, but she lost <a href="https://silverstateelection.nv.gov/county-results/storey.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Storey County</a>, Nevada, by the largest margin for a Democrat in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storey_County,_Nevada" target="_blank" rel="noopener">40 years</a>.</p>
<h4 class="editorialSubhed">    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Blue-collar wages</h4>

	</h4>
<p>The decline of unions and the availability of cheaper labor overseas have dampened U.S. factory job wages in recent decades. Even so, manufacturing jobs remain an attractive path for blue-collar workers.</p>
<p>Manufacturing pay still <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=1zA74#0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ranks fairly high</a> among the blue-collar fields at an average $34.42 per hour as of October — less than wages in energy ($39.98) or construction ($38.72), but considerably more than hospitality ($22.23) or retail ($24.76). That also was the case in 2019, and it has led many state and cities to seek more factory positions to balance out the lower-paying service jobs that have blossomed as manufacturing has waned.</p>
<p>But in the past year, state Republican leaders have pushed back on a burgeoning Southern labor movement that aims to bring higher wages and better benefits to blue-collar workers.</p>
<p>In Alabama, Republican Gov. Kay Ivey signed a new law in May that would claw back state incentives from companies that voluntarily recognize labor unions. GOP leaders in Georgia and Tennessee also <a href="https://stateline.org/2024/05/20/as-a-key-labor-union-pushes-into-the-south-red-states-push-back/" target="_blank">passed laws</a> pushing against a reinvigorated labor movement, viewing unions as a threat to the states’ manufacturing economies.</p>
<p>Much of the increase in Alabama manufacturing jobs has been in the northern part of the state, near Tennessee and Georgia. Since the pandemic began, Mazda Toyota Manufacturing came on line with the goal of hiring 4,000 vehicle production workers and another 2,000 in nearby parts factories as other manufacturers also boosted hiring. Private investment in Alabama automotive manufacturing totaled $7 billion over the same time frame, Stefania Jones, a spokesperson for state Commerce Secretary Ellen McNair, said in a statement to Stateline.</p>
<p>Supply-chain problems during the pandemic illustrated the advantages of American-made goods, said McCartin, the Georgetown University professor. However, without union support, today’s factory workers are unlikely to achieve the middle-class lifestyle enjoyed by earlier generations, he said.</p>
<p>“The growth of manufacturing itself is unlikely to become a panacea for what ails working-class America,” McCartin said.</p>

Citing public safety, other cities and the state of New Mexico are considering banning pedestrians, including panhandlers, from medians. (Dan Scanlan/Jacksonville Today)</p><p>Despite court rulings that soliciting money is protected as free speech, some cities and at least one state are considering new restrictions on panhandling in traffic medians, arguing it’s a safety hazard.</p>
<p>New Mexico’s Democratic governor this year and an Arizona Republican lawmaker last year proposed statewide bans on asking for money on street medians, though neither passed. Wilmington, North Carolina, passed a similar <a href="https://portcitydaily.com/latest-news/2024/02/08/wilmington-council-limits-standing-in-the-median-debate-threats-to-public-safety/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ordinance this year</a>, and Roanoke, Virginia, has stepped up enforcement of a <a href="https://www.roanokerambler.com/new-roanoke-city-law-may-impact-panhandling-just-dont-call-it-panhandling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">law</a> that has been on the books since last year. Advocates for homeless people have sued over a similar law in Jacksonville, Florida.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="glK89sRl2J"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/10/20/helping-panhandlers-involves-more-than-just-easing-bans-on-begging/">Helping panhandlers involves more than just easing bans on begging</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Helping panhandlers involves more than just easing bans on begging&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/10/20/helping-panhandlers-involves-more-than-just-easing-bans-on-begging/embed/#?secret=y3A9ygxpmO#?secret=glK89sRl2J" data-secret="glK89sRl2J" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p>A handful of cities are turning to incentives as a solution: Oklahoma City, where courts struck down a panhandling ban, <a href="https://www.okc.gov/departments/planning/programs/homelessness/a-better-way#:~:text=How%20it%20works,parks%20and%20other%20public%20areas." target="_blank" rel="noopener">offers city cleanup work to panhandlers</a>. Philadelphia and Fairfax County, Virginia, have similar programs, and Albuquerque, New Mexico’s largest city, recently reinstated one.</p>
<p>The efforts have grown amid a nationwide homelessness crisis, with more people visibly soliciting money in the streets, and higher <a href="https://www.ghsa.org/resources/Pedestrians24" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pedestrian deaths</a> compared with before the pandemic. Backers of the bans argue that they promote safety, but opponents say that there’s no proof such restrictions protect pedestrians and that they infringe on free speech rights. Court rulings have been mixed.</p>
<p>Many of the newest laws or proposed laws banning pedestrians on narrow medians followed one in Sandy City, Utah, which a federal appeals court upheld in 2019. The U.S. Supreme Court in 2020 declined to take up the case, leaving the law in place. <a href="https://library.municode.com/ut/sandy/codes/city_code?nodeId=COOR_TIT14TRCO_CH14-10STRE_S14-10-13ME" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The ordinance</a> makes it “illegal for any individual to sit or stand, in or on any unpaved median, or any median of less than 36 inches for any period of time.”</p>
<p>In New Mexico — which has the highest rate of <a href="https://www.ghsa.org/sites/default/files/2024-06/2023%20Pedestrian%20Traffic%20Fatalities%20by%20State.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pedestrian fatalities</a> of any state, according to a Governors Highway Safety Association report based on 2023 data — Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham this year proposed a state law banning pedestrians on narrow medians. Some cities in New Mexico, including Santa Fe and Española, already have such bans. Benjamin Baker, a public safety adviser to the governor, said it makes sense to keep panhandlers and others off medians near cars.</p>
<p>Like other proponents of the bans, Baker acknowledged there’s no clear connection between panhandling and pedestrian deaths. But he said it makes intuitive sense to ban seemingly dangerous activities such as standing on narrow medians in heavy traffic.</p>
<p>“Exercising free speech is not the issue,” said Baker, who added that panhandling from a safe area is fine.</p>
<p>But lawmakers from her own party <a href="https://sourcenm.com/2024/07/12/no-lawmaker-has-signed-up-to-sponsor-nm-govs-panhandling-bill/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">declined to sponsor</a> Lujan Grisham’s bill. And during a special session on public safety in July called by the governor, the bill’s <a href="https://www.nmlegis.gov/Legislation/Legislation?Chamber=S&amp;LegType=B&amp;LegNo=11&amp;year=24s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sole sponsor</a> was Republican state Sen. Mark Moores of Albuquerque.</p>
<p>“The panhandling just got out of control across New Mexico and primarily Albuquerque,” said Moores. “It’s just unsafe. People are running back and forth through heavy traffic. We have to balance their right to free speech with public safety.”</p>
<p>Despite her legislative defeat, Lujan Grisham continued to <a href="https://sourcenm.com/2024/07/31/nm-govs-latest-stop-on-public-safety-tour-is-espanola-where-tensions-rise-about-a-homeless-camp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lobby for her proposed bill</a> in a series of town halls across the state in July, saying she wants a statewide version of the city of Española’s 2022 law banning loitering on narrow medians.</p>
<h4 class="editorialSubhed">    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Efforts elsewhere</h4>

	</h4>
<p>The American Civil Liberties Union has <a href="https://www.aclumaine.org/en/press-releases/bangor-loitering-ban-violates-first-amendment" target="_blank" rel="noopener">opposed</a> a <a href="https://ecode360.com/6893084#6893084" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new law</a> in Bangor, Maine, passed in June, that bans pedestrians from medians less than 6 feet wide in high-speed traffic areas.</p>
<p>Courts have overturned some similar laws. In 2020, the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals <a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca10/19-6008/19-6008-2020-08-31.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">struck down</a> an Oklahoma City ban, ruling the city had failed to prove a clear safety problem because of pedestrians in street medians. The U.S. Supreme Court declined to take up the case, leaving the ruling in place.</p>
<p>Scout Katovich, an attorney at the ACLU’s Trone Center for Justice and Equality, said pedestrian safety is not a credible motive for the recent legislation.</p>
<p>“Everybody’s talking about how we have to get rid of these panhandlers, ‘We don’t want to see unhoused people,’ and then they turn around and say this is about safety. That’s not going to fly,” Katovich said.</p>
<p>In Roanoke, Virginia, <a href="https://www.roanokerambler.com/new-roanoke-city-law-may-impact-panhandling-just-dont-call-it-panhandling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a ban on panhandling</a> on medians less than 4 feet wide has been on the books since last year and enforcement is on the rise, with about a hundred $25 citations issued since spring, said Roanoke Police Capt. Andrew Pulley. Larger fines or jail sentences could follow for repeat offenders, he said.</p>
<p>Police have gotten complaints about panhandlers, and the city tries to respond to them, Pulley said. Issuing citations deters panhandling, he said, but the effect is usually temporary.</p>
<p>“It’s like speeding. When we’re there, it’s better, but you go away and come back and it’s there again.”</p>
<p>In Arizona, Republican state Sen. John Kavanagh, who had sponsored anti-panhandling legislation in 2015, last year <a href="https://legiscan.com/AZ/drafts/SB1022/2023" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introduced a bill</a> targeting panhandling on traffic medians. A committee approved the bill along party lines, but it didn’t reach the Senate floor.</p>
<h4 class="editorialSubhed">    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">A legal challenge</h4>

	</h4>
<p>In Florida, the Homeless Voice, a newspaper that employs homeless people to distribute it on the street and ask for donations, sued the city of Jacksonville over its new law banning panhandling in high-traffic areas, which prevented many of its workers from operating in the city.</p>
<p>Workers could make up to about $100 a day, which was often enough to split a hotel room or even pay rent in some areas, said Sean Cononie, publisher of the Homeless Voice.</p>
<p>“We’re going backwards in this country,” Cononie said. “People think homeless people are lazy, and they are not lazy. This is hard work.”</p>
<p>The Jacksonville Homeless Voice staff is down from 90 recently to eight, he said, as police have warned his workers to stop asking drivers for money on the street.</p>
<p>In the Jacksonville case, federal Judge Timothy Corrigan allowed the city to continue enforcing the law during an upcoming trial, noting that the city offered to suspend enforcement on public sidewalks and enforce it only on medians. Corrigan called it a “clash between First Amendment rights and public safety concerns,” but did not say how he might rule.</p>
<p>In court papers, Jacksonville defended the ban, saying it’s motivated by concern for pedestrian safety and that the city respects the Homeless Voice’s right to ask for money on sidewalks but not “in and on the city’s busiest roadways” without a required permit.</p>

Almost 5 million new housing units, mostly single-family homes, have been added nationwide since 2020, according to new data. Texas is a leader with about 806,000 new homes. (David J. Phillip/The Associated Press)</p><p><em>Read more <a href="https://stateline.org/category/housing-shortage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stateline coverage</a> of how communities across the country are trying to create more affordable housing. </em></p>
<p>The United States has added almost 5 million housing units since 2020, most heavily in the South and most of them single-family homes, making a housing shortage look conquerable in much of the nation. Of those, Virginia added 99,435 housing units from 2020 to 2023, a 3% increase.</p>
<p>Still, even more homes need to be built — especially single-family homes, experts say — and continuing high interest rates are hurting potential homebuyers.</p>
<p>Almost half of the housing increase from April 2020 to July 2023 came in six states: Texas, Florida, California, North Carolina, Georgia and Tennessee, according to a Stateline analysis of U.S. Census Bureau estimates to be released Thursday. That mirrors <a href="https://stateline.org/2024/04/03/swing-states-see-newcomers-as-americans-move-from-blue-to-red-counties/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">America’s post-pandemic moving patterns</a> to plentiful suburban housing in Texas and Florida, but also California’s <a href="https://stateline.org/2023/04/27/with-few-rentals-available-states-push-local-officials-to-allow-more-housing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">persistent push</a> for more apartments in resistant areas across the state.</p>
<p>Housing experts caution that the supply has still not caught up with demand even after another good year for home construction in 2023. Last year produced the most housing units since 2007. “One Good Year Does Not Solve America’s Housing Shortage” was the title of a <a href="https://cre.moodysanalytics.com/insights/cre-news/one-good-year-does-not-solve-americas-housing-shortage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moody’s Analytics report</a> in January, which found single-family homes in particular remain in short supply.</p>
<p>Moody’s estimated a shortfall of about 1.2 million single-family homes and 800,000 other units, noting that home sales had slowed since reaching all-time-high prices in 2022 as interest rates climbed and made purchases even more unaffordable.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" title="“Anxiety over squatters, fueled by TikTok, inspires a wave of legislation” — Stateline" src="https://stateline.org/2024/04/26/anxiety-over-squatters-fueled-by-tiktok-inspires-a-wave-of-legislation/embed/#?secret=AyoF2qH1z0#?secret=n9cSt1OAkp" width="500" height="440" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" sandbox="allow-scripts" data-secret="n9cSt1OAkp" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></p>
<p>The National Association of Realtors, <a href="https://www.realtor.com/research/us-housing-supply-gap-feb-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in a February report</a>, offered a higher housing shortage estimate of about 2.5 million units, mostly single-family homes.</p>
<p>Most of the new housing units in recent years have been single-family homes, according to a <a href="https://www.census.gov/construction/nrc/historical_data/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">separate U.S. Census Bureau construction survey</a> through the end of 2023. Production of new single-family homes reached more than 1 million annually in 2022 and 2023 for the first time since the housing bubble burst in 2007, according to the survey.</p>
<p>Apartment construction is also at historic levels, with 438,500 units built last year, the highest level since 1987. The number of apartments under construction at the end of the year, about 981,000, was an all-time high since the survey began in 1969.</p>
<p>New housing should continue to arrive at a strong pace for several years because so much construction has already started, said Daniel McCue, a senior research associate at Harvard University’s Joint Center for Housing Studies.</p>
<p>“New construction can really only slow overheated rental rates, but it’s really hard-pressed to bring down rents or make things more affordable for people at the bottom,” McCue said. “Our focus is not on the overall shortage of housing units, but on the specific shortage of affordable and available homes for low- and moderate-income people.”</p>
<p>The housing unit data released Thursday, which tracks changes through the middle of 2023, shows continued increases across the country, with about 1.6 million new units annually for the past two years.</p>
<p><iframe id="datawrapper-chart-qjGJ1" title="Construction boom boosts housing units " src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/qjGJ1/2/" height="544" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" aria-label="Map" data-external="1" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></p>
<p>Increases were concentrated in the West and South, with half the 4.8 million new units since 2020 in a handful of states: Texas (about 806,000), Florida (586,500), California (371,000), North Carolina (270,500), Georgia (200,000) and Tennessee (164,000).</p>
<p>Percentage increases were highest in fast-growing Western states: Utah (up 9% since 2020), Idaho (up 8%) and Texas (up 7%). Five states had 6% growth in housing units: South Carolina, South Dakota, Florida, Colorado and North Carolina.</p>
<p>Arizona, Georgia and Nevada — all of which are key swing states in this year’s presidential election — were not far behind, with 5% growth in housing units.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" title="“Too many cubicles, too few homes spur incentives to convert offices to housing” — Stateline" src="https://stateline.org/2024/04/17/too-many-cubicles-too-few-homes-spur-incentives-to-convert-offices-to-housing/embed/#?secret=gTXKZyMkuU#?secret=9xFgjtoKbp" width="500" height="482" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" sandbox="allow-scripts" data-secret="9xFgjtoKbp" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></p>
<p>The housing shortage has become a major political talking point, even as states <a href="https://stateline.org/2023/03/20/governors-push-faster-construction-to-meet-housing-needs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scramble</a> to get more units built and people housed.</p>
<p>Even with Utah’s nation-leading growth in housing units for the decade, for example, Republican Gov. Spencer Cox called high housing prices “the single largest threat to our future prosperity” in his <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tR5Hr9gLrXcJ7bVQm5K-vFiamJYP0Pv7/view" target="_blank" rel="noopener">State of the State address</a> this year.</p>
<p>“Housing attainability is a crisis in Utah and every state in this country,” Cox said, announcing a plan to build 35,000 small “starter” single-family homes in the next five years.</p>
<p>The Federal National Mortgage Association, known as Fannie Mae, <a href="https://www.fanniemae.com/media/50731/display" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported last year</a> that the typical homebuyer paid 35% of their income in mortgage payments in October, the highest since at least 2000.</p>
<p>A Utah-based think tank, the Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute at the University of Utah, <a href="https://d36oiwf74r1rap.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/State-Of-Housing-Sep2023.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in a report last year</a> said the pandemic years brought a boom-and bust-cycle to the state’s housing construction. New permits increased 26% in 2021, only to drop 21% the next year as interest rates climbed. The new U.S. Census Bureau figures show new units in the state peaking at 38,500 in 2022 and falling back to about 30,000 in 2023.</p>

<p>All states saw some housing growth, according to the Stateline analysis and census data, but it was slowest in some states affected by poverty or low population growth. There was only a 1% increase in housing units since 2020 in Rhode Island, Illinois, West Virginia, Connecticut, Alaska and New Jersey.</p>
<p>Alaska Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy also mentioned housing affordability as one of the biggest challenges facing the state this year in his <a href="https://gov.alaska.gov/governor-dunleavy-delivers-6th-state-of-the-state-address-focusing-on-opportunities-for-alaska-present-and-future/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">State of the State address</a>. Dunleavy proposed a state-funded down payment assistance program for first-time homebuyers, and lumber grading changes designed to make homebuilding materials more affordable.</p>
<p>New Jersey Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy mentioned in <a href="https://www.nj.gov/governor/news/news/562024/approved/20240109b.shtml#:~:text=And%20my%20fellow%20New%20Jerseyans,that%20is%20stronger%20and%20fairer." target="_blank" rel="noopener">his State of the State address</a> the state’s low housing stock at a time when tens of thousands of New Yorkers are seeking suburban housing there.</p>
<p>“If our population grows while our housing stock remains steady, homeownership will be a luxury reserved only for those at the top. That is untenable,” Murphy said.</p>

<p>HERNDON, Va. — Juan Ramirez, watching his dog play in Chandon Park here in suburban Virginia on a Saturday morning, tries to imagine the massive office buildings next to the park becoming apartments and townhouses.</p>
<p>“I guess it’s inevitable. People don’t use offices as much now. I hope it’s affordable. Maybe it’ll bring more young people to town, more taxes for parks,” said Ramirez, 38, who grew up in the area and returned recently to take a restaurant management job after living in Minnesota and Ohio.</p>
<p>Cities and suburbs around the country are struggling with vacant office space as remote work becomes an established post-pandemic reality. States are stepping in with tax breaks and zoning changes to help replace the unwanted cubicle farms with much-needed housing. In suburbs such as Herndon, the answer might be tearing down an office complex and replacing it with a residential building. In more urban environments it might mean renovating and retrofitting office buildings to create apartments.</p>

(Tim Henderson/Stateline)</p></figure><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i></figcaption></figure>
<p>“Office vacancy has climbed to a 30-year high and at the same time there’s a housing shortage. So naturally the question is, ‘Why can we not convert all these vacant office buildings into housing?’” said Jessica Morin, research director for CBRE, a commercial real estate firm. CBRE research shows converting offices to other uses, mostly housing, is set to peak this year at more than 20 million square feet, up from 6.3 million in 2021.</p>
<p>Some places that started conversions before the pandemic are leading the way: New York state and New York City changed their laws during a 1990s downturn to allow more office-to-apartment conversions in Manhattan, although now there’s a state vs. city standoff on zoning rules to convert newer offices.</p>
<p>Ohio, where interest in city living grew when Cleveland spruced up its downtown for the 2016 Republican convention, now has three cities — Cleveland, Cincinnati and Columbus — in the top 15 list for office conversions to housing, according to CBRE.</p>
<p>Nationwide, 119 office conversion projects, including for residential and other use, are under construction or were completed this year, the most since CBRE began tracking them in 2016. Those projects could add about 44,000 new housing units when completed.</p>
<p>Since 2016, projects representing 125 million square feet of offices have or are slated to be converted to other uses, usually to housing but sometimes to warehouses or laboratories. But despite the recent increase, that represents only about 2% of all U.S. office space.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" title="“Desperate for affordable housing, some cities sweeten tax breaks for developers” — Stateline" src="https://stateline.org/2024/02/06/desperate-for-affordable-housing-some-cities-sweeten-tax-breaks-for-developers/embed/#?secret=5pLPwKWcf1#?secret=ImCP9U6w59" width="500" height="509" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" sandbox="allow-scripts" data-secret="ImCP9U6w59" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></p>
<p>Impediments to making apartments out of offices include the still-high value of office buildings in some downtown areas in cities such as San Francisco, and the cost of demolishing or refitting old office buildings with plumbing for individual kitchens and bathrooms. Many office buildings also lack windows with natural light, which apartment-dwellers often demand.</p>
<p>That’s why state incentives have played a large part, as well as streamlined zoning that makes project costs more predictable for developers. Some states are further along than others. A new California law allows residential “building by right” in office and other commercial zones, meaning developers don’t have to petition for a zoning change. <a href="https://app.leg.wa.gov/billsummary?BillNumber=1042&amp;Year=2023&amp;Initiative=false" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Washington state</a> passed a law last year requiring cities to ease zoning requirements for housing in existing commercial buildings. And an <a href="https://azcapitoltimes.com/news/2024/04/12/hobbs-signs-housing-bill-more-in-the-works/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arizona bill</a> signed into law this month will allow larger cities to convert more commercial buildings into housing without zoning changes.</p>
<p>Predictable zoning rules are important to developers who don’t want to get bogged down in negotiations and refusals that could sink a project.</p>
<p>“Developers just urge their states and localities to be really transparent, streamline the process, make the unknowns limited, because it’s the unknowns that drive risks,” said Julie Whelan, a vice president at CBRE. “Otherwise, they’re going to go look at the next pasture.”</p>
<h4 class="editorialSubhed">    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Incentive programs</h4>

	</h4>
<p>In addition to the Ohio cities, Chicago; Dallas/Fort Worth; Houston; Hartford and Fairfield County in Connecticut; the Kansas City metro area; Louisville, Kentucky; Minneapolis/St. Paul; Pittsburgh; Milwaukee; New Jersey; and Washington, D.C., are on CBRE’s top 15 list for rate of office space converted to apartments.</p>
<p>Ohio has two incentive programs for office conversion to housing. A 2020 program for <a href="https://development.ohio.gov/business/state-incentives/transformational-mixed-use-development-program" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“transformational”</a> projects that could spur further development helped convert four floors of offices to apartments under construction at Playhouse Square in Cleveland. A historic building preservation incentive <a href="https://www.heritageohio.org/programs/historic-tax-credits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in place since 2007</a> helped partly convert Carew Tower in Cincinnati to apartments, said Mason Waldvogel, a spokesperson for the Ohio Department of Development.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" title="“The US needs homes. But first, it needs the workers to build them.” — Stateline" src="https://stateline.org/2024/01/24/the-us-needs-homes-but-first-it-needs-the-workers-to-build-them/embed/#?secret=QW6Vj4syLv#?secret=Gmziq9zVBF" width="500" height="432" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" sandbox="allow-scripts" data-secret="Gmziq9zVBF" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></p>
<p>Missouri is hoping to replicate that success in St. Louis, where about a quarter of the commercial space, including offices, is vacant. That includes the massive 44-story One AT&amp;T Building downtown, with almost 1.5 million square feet, that sold for $3.6 million this month, compared with $205 million in 2006.</p>
<p>Missouri state Sen. Steven Roberts, a Democrat who represents the downtown St. Louis area, said a bill he’s sponsoring has bipartisan support from suburban Republicans, and is aimed at creating downtown areas in St. Louis and elsewhere where people can live, shop and eat as well as work. The bill was <a href="https://www.senate.mo.gov/24info/BTS_Web/Actions.aspx?SessionType=R&amp;BillID=23" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voted out of committee in February</a> and is awaiting consideration by the full Senate.</p>
<p>The bill would create a state tax credit for up to 30% of the cost of converting office space to housing, retail or other uses.</p>
<p>“It’s a creative workaround to make downtown more vibrant and successful. We want to get more restaurants, more stores, more nightlife — and the way to do that is to get more people living there,” said Roberts. “It’s an issue for downtown and also for the whole state.”</p>
<p>Other states have enacted laws to encourage more conversion of offices to housing, according to a <a href="https://www.minneapolisfed.org/article/2023/states-reform-regulations-to-support-more-housing-production" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank report</a> last year. Laws passed by <a href="https://www.natlawreview.com/article/florida-live-local-act-provides-incentives-to-build-affordable-and-workforce-housing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Florida</a> and <a href="https://leg.mt.gov/bills/2023/billpdf/SB0245.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Montana</a> in 2023 allow new and converted multifamily housing in commercial areas, and laws in <a href="https://marketurbanism.com/2023/06/26/rhode-islands-housing-process-package/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rhode Island</a> and <a href="https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2023/proposals/ab268" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wisconsin</a> support conversion of existing commercial and office buildings.</p>
<p>A Colorado bill now in committee would provide tax credits for commercial conversion to housing starting in 2026, supporting Denver’s plans to transition its office-oriented Central Business District to a “Central Neighborhood District.” Denver identified 16 commercial buildings as prime candidates for housing.</p>
<h4 class="editorialSubhed">    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Zoning changes</h4>

	</h4>
<p>Starting in the mid-1990s, a combination of state and city laws <a href="https://cbcny.org/sites/default/files/media/files/CBCREPORT_421-G_12122022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">helped transform</a> lower Manhattan’s business district with more apartments, a process that accelerated after 9/11. A proposal by Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul to expand the program to newer buildings <a href="https://therealdeal.com/new-york/2023/09/01/the-daily-dirt-breaks-down-nycs-office-conversion-options/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">failed to pass the legislature</a> as part of a <a href="https://www.cityandstateny.com/politics/2023/11/hochul-abandon-required-construction-mandates-ambitious-housing-plan/392350/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">broader measure</a> that included requirements for suburban and upstate communities to build more housing. Negotiations are continuing with lawmakers to make the change for New York City this year.</p>
<p>New York City also has begun working on its own rules to allow office-to-housing conversions citywide for buildings built before 1990, said Casey Berkovitz, spokesperson for the Department of City Planning. The state could do it faster and could also create tax incentives that the city cannot create on its own, and that’s also part of current negotiations with the state legislature, Berkovitz said.</p>

<p>“When you have a 20% office vacancy rate and a 1.4% rental apartment vacancy rate, it makes a lot of sense to substitute one for the other,” Berkovitz said. “We don’t want our own regulations standing in the way of that if it makes financial sense.”</p>
<p>In Herndon, Virginia, town officials last month approved a zoning change that would clear the way for demolition of the Worldgate Drive offices and the construction of a combination of rental apartments, townhouses and “two over two” units with accessory living areas an owner can rent out or share with family members. All apartments would be market rate without subsidized affordable units, Ken Wire, an attorney for the developer, Boston Properties, said at last month’s hearing on the zoning change.</p>
<p>“We believe that by providing more housing in the area, we are adding to the overall supply, which thereby reduces price pressures in the market,” Wire said.</p>

<p>Virginia considered two state Senate bills this session that would have created incentives to convert offices to apartments but neither has passed, said Allison Brown, policy associate for the nonprofit Virginia Housing Alliance. One would have created a <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB512" target="_blank" rel="noopener">state income tax credit</a> for office-to-residential conversion, and <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB430" target="_blank" rel="noopener">another</a> would have allowed more residential building in commercial areas if they included affordable housing.</p>
<p>The Worldgate Drive housing plan may spur Herndon to change its zoning rules to allow similar projects without zoning changes, said Elizabeth Gilleran, the town’s director of community development.</p>
<p>Herndon wants to “retain its sense of community and historic small-town feel” but also keep a strong commercial tax base that has helped support the town’s tax coffers when home values inevitably rise and fall, Gilleran said. The town recently approved conversion of a small office park and a hotel to homes. But offices and other commercial buildings will remain a key component of the town’s suburban building mix as density grows with a recent new commuter rail stop that opened in 2022.</p>
<p>“The town doesn’t wish to become a bedroom community,” Gilleran said.</p>

His only worry is that fares, which once ate up $60 or more of his monthly pay, might come back and go even higher, making it harder for him to afford to get to work.</p>
<p>“It could throw a lot of people like me out of their comfort zone. I think people would lose their jobs over this, especially if it happened too fast,” said Wilson, who was waiting with other riders at a downtown transfer station on a cold, sunny day earlier this month.</p>
<p>Richmond is one of the few cities where transit systems have regained pre-pandemic ridership, according to a Stateline analysis, and waiving fares has played a large part. A $4.5 million state grant from Virginia’s <a href="https://drpt.virginia.gov/our-grant-programs/transit-ridership-incentive-program-trip/#:~:text=Program%20Background,and%20regionally%20significant%20transit%20networks." target="_blank">Transit Ridership Incentive Program</a> has helped make the free rides possible.</p>
<p>In addition to Richmond, only 22 other cities had ridership in 2023 that was equal to or higher than in 2019, and 14 of those had free rides at least part of the year, according to the Stateline analysis of <a href="https://www.transit.dot.gov/ntd" target="_blank">National Transit Database data</a>. The largest of the cities that fully recovered ridership all offered free rides at least part of the year: Tucson, Arizona; Albany, New York; Birmingham, Alabama; Worcester, Massachusetts; and Shreveport, Louisiana, with 2023 ridership ranging from 17.5 million in Tucson to 3.3 million in Shreveport.</p>
<p>It’s not surprising that free rides can juice ridership numbers for systems struggling to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting shift to at-home work. And offering free and reduced-price rides is a boon to the low-income workers who disproportionately rely on public transit. The question is whether such policies are financially sustainable — or fair, given that higher-income riders benefit too.</p>

<p>As is the case with Richmond, states will play a pivotal role in determining the viability of city transit systems facing diminished ridership and a “fiscal cliff” of the end of federal pandemic funding, according to a <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/ensuring-the-intertwined-post-pandemic-recoveries-of-downtowns-and-transit-systems/" target="_blank">Brookings Institution</a> report last year.</p>
<p>In Richmond, regional leaders first dropped fares in <a href="https://ridegrtc.com/fares/and-rates/" target="_blank">March 2020</a> during the pandemic to support essential workers and to make it easier for people to get to hospitals and doctors. Scrapping fares also prevented passengers from clustering around fare boxes and eliminated the need for some face-to-face interactions.</p>
<p>Officials kept the free rides when they realized how the change was helping lower-paid workers and the employers who depend on them. A survey found 71% of riders had household incomes of less than $40,000 a year, while higher-paid riders such as state employees got free passes as part of their jobs, said Henry Bendon, spokesperson for the Greater Richmond Transit Company, or GRTC, which runs bus service in the Richmond area.</p>
<p>“There was an equity issue. Fares were falling on the backs of people who could least afford it,” he said. “Transit is a public service. We build roads and we don’t charge people to use them, so why should we charge for this?”</p>

		<p style="font-size:13px"><b>– Henri Bendon, Greater Richmond Transit Company</b></p>
	</div>
	</div>

	
<p>Bendon took buses to work and school on a recent day — he’s studying for a master’s degree in public administration at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond, and many students pile onto free buses that pass by the downtown campus. Riders saw the transit insignia on his jacket and asked questions or voiced concerns, mostly about cleanliness and security on buses. But riders were generally happy with new service expansion that brought service every 15 minutes on main lines, up from every half-hour a few years ago.</p>
<p>Dee Otey, a 25-year-old restaurant worker at Lee’s Famous Recipe Chicken in Richmond, said she also worries about fares coming back higher than before. She doesn’t miss the weekly struggle to calculate her transportation needs to determine whether it made more sense to pay single fares of $1.50 or buy a weekly pass.</p>
<h4>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">A free ride for all?</h4>

	</h4>
<p>Other cities are grappling with the question of whether higher-income riders should support the system by paying fares. In the Worcester, Massachusetts, area, which includes part of Connecticut, the Worcester Regional Transit Authority has extended <a href="https://www.wrrb.org/news/2023/04/fare-free-service-on-wrta-extended-to-june-2024/" target="_blank">fare-free rides</a> one year at a time, and some want to keep it that way.</p>
<p>Alex Guardiola, vice president of public affairs and public policy at the Worcester Regional Chamber of Commerce, said “there are many benefits to our residents and employers getting employees to their jobs as well as health care [appointments].” But some local officials see a benefit in charging fares to those who can afford it.</p>
<p>“I appreciate that we are trying to increase ridership, but adding riders without any increase in funding puts us in the position of not being able to afford drivers,” said Robin Grimm, town administrator for the Worcester suburb of Sturbridge and a member of the agency’s board. Using a sliding scale would still allow lower-income riders to pay less or nothing, she said.</p>
<figure id="attachment_37931" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:300px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/transit-riders-300x213-1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-37931" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/transit-riders-300x213-1.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="213" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Melvin Wilson, left, and Dee Otey wait for buses to go to their jobs in downtown Richmond. Both said free rides have made their lives easier and they worry about the expense and hassle if they have to pay fares to get to work. (Tim Henderson/Stateline)</p></figure>
<p>Brian Taylor, a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles and director of the university’s Institute of Transportation Studies, said reduced or free rides make less sense in cities with more affluent commuters, such as San Francisco.</p>
<p>“It’s difficult to make an equity case for it,” Taylor said. “There is an excellent argument to be made for free fares in the right situation. But to do it universally would cost enormous amounts of money and actually convey benefits to high-income people who don’t need it.”</p>
<p>Historically, city transit systems were for-profit businesses, but they became subsidized public services after World War II when widespread car ownership made them unprofitable. Systems in Richmond and other cities that have recovered their pre-pandemic ridership have large populations that depend on public transit because they don’t have access to cars, Taylor said.</p>
<p>But even in Richmond, there’s a financial strain from the loss of fare revenue, which amounts to more than $8 million a year. That loss is offset somewhat by not having to cover the $1.5 million cost of managing fare cards, plus the state money the system gets because it does not collect fares. The authority is considering asking for tax-deductible contributions from employers such as Amazon whose employees benefit from free rides, Bendon said.</p>
<figure><i></i></figure>
<p>“There will be some difficult conversations about funding in the next five or six years,” Bendon said. “We’ll go back to charging fares only if everything else fails. We don’t want to do that, and we don’t ever want to do that.”</p>
<p>Even some of the largest systems are experimenting with limited free rides. New York City’s Metropolitan Transit Authority, which Stateline found has recovered about 76% of its 2019 bus and subway ridership, is using a state grant to <a href="https://new.mta.info/guides/riding-the-bus/fare-free-bus-pilot" target="_blank">fund five fare-free bus</a> routes among its 325 total routes. Washington, D.C., <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/05/19/dc-free-bus-fare-economics/" target="_blank">delayed a free city bus proposal</a> until later this year; its regional ridership on bus and rail service, which includes suburbs in Maryland and Virginia, is about 71% of 2019 levels.</p>
<h4>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Staffing shortages</h4>

	</h4>
<p>But it’s harder for very large transit systems to waive fares without damaging their finances, said Stephanie Lotshaw, director of TransitCenter, a New York City foundation devoted to transportation funding and strategy.</p>
<p>“In Richmond they get significant state support, and they are a small agency, but for larger operations it is less feasible,” Lotshaw said. San Francisco’s Bay Area Rapid Transit, for instance, <a href="https://www.bart.gov/sites/default/files/docs/FiscalCliff_Factsheet_022123.pdf" target="_blank">received 71% of its operating costs</a> from fares, parking and advertising before the pandemic. That figure is down to about 50% now.</p>
<p>And some of the big cities that have waived fares still haven’t regained pre-pandemic ridership. In New Mexico, Las Cruces and Albuquerque both have free rides, but only Las Cruces has recovered ridership fully and Albuquerque is still at about 75%, said Leslie Keener, the Albuquerque system’s transit director.</p>
<p>One reason is a shortage of drivers and other employees: Albuquerque has only about 62% of the service hours it did in 2019, with a job vacancy rate of 34% overall and almost 50% for mechanics.</p>
<p>“We have been struggling with vacancies peaking last summer. We are starting to see some hiring come back, but we still have a ways to go,” Keener said.</p>
<p>Richmond addressed its driver shortages by raising pay 43% to $24.91 an hour <a href="https://richmondfreepress.com/news/2023/apr/20/grtc-drives-starting-pay-43-percent/" target="_blank">last year</a> and waiving a requirement for a commercial license, instead requiring only a clean driving record and training.</p>
<p>“We set an ambitious goal to bring back the 300 drivers we needed in a year and a half, and we met that goal in pretty much half the time,” Bendon said.</p>
<p>Staffing shortages are part of the ridership problem with most mass transit agencies, along with decreased commuting as work-from-home becomes a permanent consequence of the pandemic, said Tracy Hadden Loh, a Brookings fellow and co-author of its recent transit report.</p>
<p>“Some systems are dropping way more trips than others because of lack of staffing. People can’t use something they can’t rely on,” Loh said. “There’s no doubt that free fares juice ridership. Just look at Richmond.</p>
<p>“So, do we cling to the fantasy that somehow transit will pay for itself,” she said, “or do we figure out a way to pay for it that really solves the free rider problem?”</p>

Five Southern states — Texas, Florida, North Carolina, Georgia and South Carolina — collectively added almost 1.2 million people this year, according to U.S. Census Bureau estimates. (Tony Gutierrez/Associated Press)</p><p>Southern states continued to get the lion’s share of new residents this year as Texas, Florida, North Carolina, Georgia and South Carolina added almost 1.2 million people among them. The South was the only region that drew net new residents from other states.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the national population grew by 1.6 million people from births and immigrants, according to U.S. Census Bureau estimates released Tuesday.</p>
<p>South Carolina had the largest percentage increase between mid-2022 and mid-2023, a 1.7% increase of about 91,000 residents, most of it from people moving in from other states. The Summerville area, inland from Charleston, has been a magnet for movers, drawing hundreds of new residents each month, according to a Stateline analysis of <a href="https://about.usps.com/who/legal/foia/documents/change-of-address-stats/coa-stats-explanation.pdf" target="_blank">change-of-address data</a> from the U.S. Postal Service.</p>
<p>South Carolina also rose into the top five in terms of the number of new residents, as Arizona tumbled from that spot to No. 7, with growth of about 66,000 people.</p>

<p>Despite booming populations in coastal areas, rural parts of South Carolina are still expected to decline 15%-30% over the next decade, the state predicts. Newcomers have helped offset an aging population that has seen more deaths than births, said Daniel Tompkins, a statistician at the state Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Office.</p>
<p>In Texas, the one-year increase of about 473,000 includes hundreds of thousands of people moving in from other states and countries as well as new births. The state is drawing a large number of movers to fast-growing suburbs, where newcomers tend to be younger than Texans in general and more likely to have a college degree, said State Demographer Lloyd Potter.</p>
<p>“Like so many others, work brought us here,” said Jason Hall, who recently moved to Georgetown, Texas, an Austin exurb north of Round Rock.</p>
<p>“There is much more opportunity here than where we were before, Las Vegas, and you don’t have the crazy housing prices of California,” said Hall, a surgical assistant whose wife works for an online retailer. He added that suburban Georgetown reminds him of the South Texas area where he lived after leaving the Army 20 years ago.</p>
<p>“Georgetown still has that Texas feel that Austin kind of lost,” Hall said.</p>
<p>Georgetown has had some of the largest numbers of people moving in, according to the postal data for the period covered by the census estimates — the year ending July 1.</p>
<p>The destination list is dominated by Texas and Florida locales: in Texas, Georgetown as well as Katy and Conroe near Houston, and Aubrey and Prosper north of Dallas; in Florida, Port St. Lucie and Palm Bay on the East Coast and Wesley Chapel, north of Tampa.</p>
<p>Florida’s population boom, about 365,000 between mid-2022 and mid-2023, has been made up mostly of people 50 and older moving to the state looking toward downsizing and retirement, while Texas has drawn more working-age people.</p>
<p>In other states, Henderson, Nevada, and Queen Creek, Arizona, have drawn many new movers.</p>
<p>Growth in popular Texas suburbs has been so fast that roads and other infrastructure have been strained, said Potter, the state demographer.</p>
<p>“They’re building big apartment buildings and single-family houses, really just as fast as they can,” Potter said. “With all the new people you need instant housing, but there’s going to be three cars in each of those driveways. It can take years for the infrastructure to catch up.”</p>
<p>The newcomers are more likely to have college degrees than those already living in Texas, Potter said. The Lone Star State, like Florida, grew 1.6%.</p>
<p>In Florida, however, state officials <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/florida-population-growth-continues-projected-205624525.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAABwaHuOWPNm8Sa6fAy7RVX1Iq3_JhflHwedf9580M9_wink-eCWfczyxLE74ZFPHFVrbn7tb1QdfCorT4raMjItwBe0bmkxxSwRPnfDLgB98ntgNzWdtQZJPE7w9jdNd2B_GGy-lna19YjZB6XBfl4F6dNuqFA_N5vAijkSCqrgM#:~:text=In%202022%2C%20the%2060%2Dto,people%20ages%2050%20to%2059." target="_blank">have said growth will slow</a> over the next decade as baby boomers age out of the 50-70 age range that feeds most moves to the state.</p>
<p>The state’s fastest-growing counties as of April, when the state makes its own population estimates, are in north and central Florida, where retirement communities are concentrated, said Richard Doty, a research demographer for the Bureau of Economic and Business Research at the University of Florida.</p>
<p>Population dropped in eight states, down from 19 last year: New York, California, Illinois, Louisiana, Pennsylvania, Oregon, Hawaii and West Virginia.</p>

<p>Most economists surveyed by Stateline said the states with elevated unemployment rates and lagging production were experiencing growing pains as they continue to recover from the pandemic. A modest slowdown might even be a good thing if it cools interest rates and inflation, they said.</p>
<p>“We’re not falling off the top of a flight of stairs, we’re only falling off the first step,” said EJ Antoni, an economist at the conservative Heritage Foundation. Unemployment is bound to tick up as more workers sidelined by the pandemic start looking for work, he added.</p>
<p>“One of the reasons why unemployment is so low is that there are something like 5 million people missing from the labor force,” Antoni said. “The labor market never returned to its pre-pandemic trend.”</p>
<p>The labor force has shrunk since 2020 in 19 states — with especially dramatic drops in California, Maryland, New York, Ohio and Massachusetts, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Meanwhile, manufacturing employment, often used as an indicator of economic health, dipped in October because some autoworkers were on strike.</p>

<h4>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">States’ tax revenues</h4>

	</h4>
<p>A slowdown in the economy could be bad news for states that have already suffered declining tax revenue for more than a year. Many legislatures <a href="https://stateline.org/2023/10/25/blue-and-red-states-slash-taxes-despite-warnings-of-hard-times-ahead/" target="_blank">cut taxes</a> this year in response to robust tax revenue growth in fiscal years 2021 and 2022; those lawmakers now may need to trim spending agendas informed by rosier forecasts.</p>
<p>California, for example, had to cut $8 billion in spending in <a href="https://apnews.com/article/california-state-budget-2023-2db8442a1d7c0ecc5b6827207c1dad03" target="_blank">this year’s budget</a> and delay other programs to cover a $32 billion deficit; Maryland recently announced <a href="https://www.marylandmatters.org/2023/12/02/state-set-to-announce-deep-cuts-to-transportation-agencies/" target="_blank">across-the-board transportation</a> budget cuts because of ballooning deficits.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, still-booming states are reacting differently: Virginia embarked <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/09/14/youngkin-signs-virginia-budget-offering-tax-reductions-major-new-spending/" target="_blank">on new tax cuts combined with major spending</a> in September as part of a bipartisan budget compromise. In November, Texas Republicans <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2023/11/02/texas-budget-surplus-border-education/" target="_blank">proposed spending a $2.7 billion tax windfall</a> on border security and education.</p>
<p>Nationally, state tax revenue has been declining for 14 straight months and was down 5.6% in September compared with the year before, according to <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/la1uh9odrpbix1zjzcskg/MonthlySTRH_Sep2023.pdf?rlkey=4jizsyof4w70o6r6swk0r6jud&amp;dl=0" target="_blank">data</a> compiled by the left-leaning Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. Early October reports show “continued weakness” for most states, though a recent stock market turnaround may help states for the rest of the year, said Lucy Dadayan, principal research associate at the center.</p>
<p>“The stock market improved a bit in the months of October and November and that might improve income tax revenues,” Dadayan wrote in an email. “A lot depends on the stock market performance in December.”</p>
<p>But Dadayan also pointed to other signs of trouble for state economies and tax revenue: Home price growth is slowing, corporate profits are falling, and there are fewer public offerings to lift stock prices.</p>

<p>As of October, California’s unemployment rate was 4.8%, compared with 4.1% in October 2022. That is the third highest in the country, behind only Nevada and the District of Columbia.</p>
<p>Chas Alamo, a fiscal and policy analyst for the California Legislative Analyst’s Office, called California’s unemployment increases a danger sign for other states.</p>
<p>“There were 26 states with significant changes and all of them were increases in the unemployment rate — not a single decrease. That struck me as an unambiguous signal,” Alamo said in an email.</p>
<p>California’s year-over-year monthly unemployment rate has been up by at least half a point for eight months in a row. There have been similar spikes in New Jersey (also eight months in a row) and the District of Columbia (nine months) through October.</p>
<p>Despite a higher unemployment rate in New Jersey, “there are still more job openings than unemployed New Jersey residents,” said state labor department spokesperson Angela Delli Santi. More people seeking work is a sign of optimism, she said, and more people are returning to the state labor force.</p>
<p>Nationally, the number of people who are neither working nor looking for work is still about 4.8 million more than in early 2020, according to <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LNS15000000" target="_blank">federal data</a>.</p>
<p>Fifteen states, including California, Illinois and New York, have fewer jobs than they did in early 2020.</p>
<h4>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">State-by-state GDP figures</h4>

	</h4>
<p>New state-by-state <a href="https://www.bea.gov/news/2023/gross-domestic-product-state-2nd-quarter-2023-and-comprehensive-update#home" target="_blank">estimates</a> of gross domestic product for the first half of the year, released Dec. 5, were good news for some states — California’s economy, for example, continued to expand despite recession fears. And Georgia, Hawaii, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, Ohio and West Virginia bounced back from first-quarter losses to second-quarter gains. Only Delaware, Mississippi and Wisconsin suffered inflation-adjusted drops in GDP through June of this year.</p>
<p>However, state economic indexes maintained by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia showed 32 states with lower economic output expected in October than September, though those numbers could change as data is revised. (For instance, in October 2022, the <a href="https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2023/jan/are-state-economic-conditions-harbinger-recession-update" target="_blank">initial data</a> showed 27 states in decline, but after two revisions only 12 states showed a decrease that month, according to the Stateline analysis.)</p>
<p>Many of the country’s largest states are not among the 32 states where GDP is thought to have declined in October. The economy expanded in California, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Texas that month.</p>
<p>However, Arizona, Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Ohio and Virginia were among those where the economy contracted.</p>
<p>Individual state economies can be significantly affected by local industries.</p>
<p>In California, a <a href="https://lao.ca.gov/LAOEconTax/Article/Detail/785" target="_blank">state report</a> co-written by Alamo in October said the state appeared to have had a “mild recession” from the last quarter of 2022 to the first quarter of 2023, noting that there’s no formal definition for a state-level recession. The report cited a drop-off in tech investment, fewer home sales and regional bank failures as factors.</p>
<p>“The slowdown is suggestive of the importance of the technology and housing sectors to the vitality of the state’s economy,” the report concluded.</p>
<p>Washington state, another technology center hosting giants such as Microsoft and Amazon, has fared better than California, recovering jobs lost in the pandemic more quickly and seeing lower unemployment this year. Washington’s jobless rate is 3.8%, down from 4.6% in October 2022.</p>
<p>Rural areas of Washington state recovered more quickly than Seattle, said Anneliese Vance-Sherman, the state’s chief labor economist. There are more industries deemed “essential” such as health care and agriculture in those communities, while Seattle suffered from more tech layoffs and declines in businesses that depend on commuters, such as restaurants.</p>
<p>A slight increase in unemployment in recent months for Washington state could be a healthy development if it means some workers are coming back to the job market, Vance-Sherman said.</p>
<p>“For Washington state, much of the recent rise in the unemployment rate stems not from people losing their jobs but from new people entering or reentering the workforce,” she said.</p>

(VDOT photo by Trevor Wrayton)</p><p>Traffic deaths are lingering near historic highs in most states despite less driving overall, prompting policymakers to consider deploying more police or installing automated monitoring such as speed cameras to curb speeding and reckless driving.</p>
<p>People are driving fewer miles than they were in 2019, but more are dying on roadways. Traffic deaths spiked 18% from 2019 to 2022 — though miles traveled fell 3%, according to a Stateline analysis of federal records from the <a href="https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/#!/" target="_blank">National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</a> and the <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/VMT" target="_blank">U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics</a>.</p>
<p>Experts blame bad driving habits that took hold when roadways suddenly cleared out as the COVID-19 pandemic started in 2020. At the same time, law enforcement agencies shifted their priorities away from traffic violations and many struggled to hire officers amid heightened scrutiny and criticism, especially after a police officer killed George Floyd in May 2020 in Minneapolis.</p>
<p>States and cities are trying to reduce the number of deaths caused by risky driving with a mix of more police officers and controversial technologies such as speed and red-light cameras. But many critics see those approaches as potentially troublesome, since traffic tickets are a heavier financial burden on low-income drivers. And others say cameras violate people’s privacy and right to due process.</p>
<p>“Law enforcement has really stepped back from enforcing traffic laws,” said Jonathan Adkins, CEO of the Governors Highway Safety Association. “We have to get police back out there and get support for police back. But this has to be done the right way, and it has to be done fairly. And we do want to look at technology — cameras don’t see race, they don’t see gender.”</p>
<p>The nation’s two most populous states, California and Texas, have taken different paths. In October, California approved <a href="https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/newsom-signs-bill-oking-speed-cameras-in-3-socal-cities/3246063/" target="_blank">a speed camera pilot program</a>, to begin next year. Texas hasn’t reconsidered its 2019 ban on local speed and red-light cameras, but state transportation officials have asked local police to <a href="https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/public-safety/2023/07/19/457250/in-effort-to-decrease-fatal-car-wrecks-more-law-enforcement-will-be-on-the-roads-through-july/" target="_blank">step up ticketing</a>. Police in Fort Worth ramped up <a href="https://www.wfaa.com/article/news/local/fort-worth-police-to-ramp-up-traffic-enforcement-jump-driver-complaints/287-50837050-e4bc-4174-90fd-7939f37a5da7#%3A~%3Atext=Fort%20Worth%20police%20to%20ramp%20up%20traffic%20enforcement%20after%20'frustrating,people%20violating%20school%20zone%20rules" target="_blank">enforcement</a> in response to residents’ complaints about reckless drivers, according to press reports, writing 12,000 tickets for speeding and careless driving between November 2022 and April 2023.</p>

<p>Traffic deaths were up 18% in California and 24% in Texas between 2019 and 2022, the latest full year available from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.</p>
<p>In Washington state, traffic fatalities were up 38% last year compared with 2019, reaching a 30-year high. In response, the state is considering expanding its limited speed camera use. State officials plan a <a href="https://washingtonstatestandard.com/briefs/traffic-deaths-are-down-in-finland-wa-leaders-will-travel-there-to-find-out-how/" target="_blank">visit to Finland next month</a> to see how that country used automated enforcement to reduce traffic deaths.</p>
<p>“When people see a sign, ‘Speed Camera Ahead,’ they slow down,” Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, said in a <a href="https://washingtonstatestandard.com/2023/06/28/inslee-calls-for-more-speed-cameras-to-curb-deadly-traffic-crashes/" target="_blank">June interview</a> with the Washington State Standard.</p>
<p>Nationally, most of the change in fatal accidents has been caused by speeding, careless driving and drug or alcohol use, according to federal <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/research-data/fatality-analysis-reporting-system-fars" target="_blank">Fatality Analysis Reporting System</a> data from 2019 to 2021, the latest year available from that source.</p>
<p>Driver deaths increased the most in that time, 21%. Deaths of pedestrians and motorcyclists rose by 18%, and bicyclist deaths by 12%.</p>
<p>Most of the increase from 2019 to 2022 has been in cities, suburbs and small towns, with rural areas less affected, according to separate federal statistics on deaths caused by traffic accidents kept by the federal <a href="https://wonder.cdc.gov/mcd.html" target="_blank">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>.</p>

<p>Vermont, which has been <a href="https://www.wcax.com/2023/06/28/faced-with-dwindling-troopers-vsp-realigns-staffing/" target="_blank">struggling to fill police jobs</a>, saw the largest percentage increase of any state from 2019 to 2022, a 64% jump from 47 to 77 deaths. Other states with large percentage increases included Connecticut (54%), New Hampshire (47%), the District of Columbia (39%) and Washington state (38%).</p>
<p>Traffic accidents are the most common cause of death for people under 40 in <a href="https://stateline.org/2023/09/05/death-rates-for-people-under-40-have-skyrocketed-blame-fentanyl" target="_blank">Arkansas, Nebraska and Texas</a>, according to a September Stateline analysis.</p>
<p>The only states to see a decrease in traffic deaths from 2019 to 2022 were Wyoming (down 9%), Rhode Island (down 5%), North Dakota (down 3%) and Idaho (down 2%). Those four states did see increases in the first six months of 2023, however, compared with 2022.</p>
<p>About half of Wyoming’s fatal crashes in 2022 involved speeding or failure to wear seat belts, according to a <a href="https://www.dot.state.wy.us/files/live/sites/wydot/files/shared/Highway_Safety/_Crash%20Data/Publications/Report%20on%20Traffic%20Crashes/2022%20Report%20on%20Traffic%20Crashes.pdf" target="_blank">state report</a>.</p>
<h4>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Legislative efforts</h4>

	</h4>
<p>In California, <a href="https://cal.streetsblog.org/2023/09/13/ca-legislature-passes-speed-camera-bill" target="_blank">speed camera legislation has been stymied in the past</a> by disagreements over fines and impacts on residents with low incomes. The <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240AB645" target="_blank">compromise bill</a> as enacted in October will allow community service in lieu of fines for low-income drivers who are ticketed in the pilot program, and limit placement of cameras to streets with speeding issues in a handful of cities.</p>
<p>Adkins, the CEO of the governors’ safety group, said other states should be similarly cautious.</p>
<p>“You have to be really careful with these camera programs. We don’t want cameras to be a ‘gotcha,’” Adkins said. “They should only be in areas that have a problem.”</p>
<p>Another state considering more speed cameras is Pennsylvania, where a pilot program put speed cameras on one street in Philadelphia and in work zones statewide. A bill to make the program permanent and expand it within Philadelphia <a href="https://legiscan.com/PA/bill/HB1284/2023" target="_blank">passed the state House and is now pending in a state Senate committee</a>. Pennsylvania’s traffic fatalities increased 12% from 2019 to 2022, according to the Stateline analysis.</p>

<p>In Philadelphia, speed cameras cut fatal accidents in half, saving an estimated 36 lives, and reduced speeding by 95% after they were introduced in 2020 on the 14-mile stretch of Roosevelt Boulevard, a main artery, according to city records obtained by Stateline. Cameras detected 8,305 speeders in February 2023 compared with 224,000 when they were first installed in June 2020.</p>
<p>States that have banned cameras for speeding and/or red-light violations often cite driver complaints about high fines and say it&#8217;s unfair for drivers to have to face accusations from machines instead of police officers. The National Motorists Association, a driver advocacy group, opposes <a href="https://ww2.motorists.org/issues/red-light-cameras/" target="_blank">red-light</a> and <a href="https://ww2.motorists.org/issues/speed-cameras/" target="_blank">speed cameras</a>, saying they infringe upon due process rights.</p>
<p>Some Texas lawmakers called cameras a violation of constitutional principles of presumption of innocence and the right to confront one’s accuser as they passed a bipartisan 2019 <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2019/05/07/texas-red-light-cameras-could-be-removed-after-house-vote/" target="_blank">measure that banned photographic enforcement.</a> Other states with laws banning traffic cameras include Maine, Mississippi, New Hampshire, New Jersey, South Carolina, West Virginia and Wisconsin, according to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, a trade group.</p>
<p>The Missouri Supreme Court struck down St. Louis&#8217; red-light cameras in 2015, saying they were unconstitutional because cameras couldn&#8217;t document who was driving the car. However, in the face of increased fatalities, the city announced in September it is considering a new plan for speed and red-light cameras that record drivers’ faces as well as license plates.</p>
<p>In Iowa, where <a href="https://www.legis.iowa.gov/docs/publications/FN/1370436.pdf" target="_blank">19 cities and towns</a> use cameras for speed or red-light enforcement, Republican state Sen.<a href="https://www.legis.iowa.gov/legislators/legislator?ga=90&amp;personID=30547" target="_blank"> Mike Klimesh</a> said he plans to reintroduce a bill next year limiting fines and requiring revenue-sharing with the state to benefit a retirement fund for volunteer workers like firefighters. Cities should have to prove that the cameras are placed in areas where they improve safety, Klimesh said.</p>
<p>“This would require the cities to provide some data to prove it makes sense to put the camera at that specific location, that it’s not just a gotcha or a revenue generator,” Klimesh said. “We’re trying to make sure they’re looking first and foremost at law enforcement presence, officers in vehicles,” he added. Klimesh sponsored <a href="https://www.legis.iowa.gov/legislation/BillBook?ga=90&amp;ba=SF489" target="_blank">a similar bill this year</a> that did not progress to a floor vote.</p>
<h4>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Risky behavior</h4>

	</h4>
<p>As with Washington officials’ planned visit to Finland, states are increasingly finding inspiration in Europe’s mostly automated traffic control strategies that are cutting fatalities, said Andi Hamre, director of policy and research at the Eno Center for Transportation, a nonprofit traffic policy think tank. That interest could help revive “Vision Zero” initiatives, meant to eradicate traffic deaths entirely, that have recently seen numbers headed the wrong way.</p>

<p>“We’re leaving a lot on the table as far as traffic safety goes, compared to some places in Spain, France and Scandinavia. Vision Zero works. What doesn’t work is ‘Vision Zero Lite,’ which is what we’ve been seeing,” Hamre said. States such as Texas that have banned red-light and speed cameras “have just taken that tool away from localities altogether,” Hamre said.</p>
<p>Along with more speeding and careless driving, there has been a puzzling increase in the number of people killed in crashes who were not wearing seat belts. The number of drivers and passengers killed in crashes who were unbelted rose 24% between 2019 and 2021, according to data from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System. The increases were highest for 25- to 34-year-olds, up 51%.</p>
<p>“It seems like there was something going on with people that was leading to this riskier behavior, and we really don’t know what was causing it,” said Jessica Cicchino, vice president of research for the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.</p>
<p>“Even when people weren’t driving that much, the people who were driving were doing it in a more risky way,” Cicchino said.</p>
<p>Adkins said the decline in seat belt use is “kind of nuts” but that other factors are more understandable, considering the early pandemic days let some people feel free to drive poorly.</p>
<p>“People started driving crazy because they could,” Adkins said. “They were so used to these roads being full. … And then our driving behavior didn’t go back to normal. We have to learn to share the roads, and absent that we have to have better engineering and more enforcement out there, unfortunately.”</p>

(Sarah Vogelsong/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>An unprecedented surge in the nationwide construction of new housing — mostly apartments — may finally be making a dent in fast-rising rents that have been making life harder for tenants.</p>
<p>More than 1.65 million housing units were under construction last year, the highest annual number since federal record-keeping started in 1969. This year, the number was even higher — almost 1.7 million in September.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the typical annual rent increase nationally fell to zero in June for the first time since the pandemic began, after peaking at 17.8% in 2021, according to <a href="https://www.apartmentlist.com/research/national-rent-data" target="_blank">Apartment List</a>, a rent information aggregator and research firm. In September, rents fell 1.2%.</p>
<p>Vacancy rates are rising, said Alexander Hermann, a research associate at the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University.</p>
<p>“You’ve had this huge rush to build apartments in the last couple of years, and projects are bigger and bigger. It’s more common now to be building 50 or more units,” he said. “You can start to see where new supply is coming online, you see starker and stronger rent decreases.”</p>
<p>Federal statistics, which don’t track active construction below the regional level, show that construction hasn’t been higher in the Northeast since 1987 or in the Midwest since 2005, and it’s at all-time highs in both the West and South. A growing share of the country’s housing construction is in the South, up from 40% in 2017 to 46% in 2022.</p>

<p>In some places, rents are falling back a little, but they’re still plenty high compared with just a few years ago. In Texas, Austin has seen rents drop more than 6% for the fiscal year ending in September to $1,734 for a two-bedroom — but that’s still up almost 20% from 2020, according to Apartment List.</p>
<p>Austin’s rent decreases are the most in the Sun Belt, according to Apartment List, while its surrounding metro area is issuing more housing permits than any other large metro — “signaling the important role construction plays in managing long-term affordability.”</p>
<p>Travis County, which includes Austin, increased its housing units by more than a third between 2012 and 2022, creating 169,700 new units in that time as its population swelled by almost 230,000, according to a Stateline analysis of census estimates.</p>
<p>Among the arrivals to Austin in the past decade is K.N., a single father who asked to be identified only by his initials because he doesn’t want his children’s schoolmates to hear about his problems. K.N., a tech programmer who moved from San Francisco a decade ago, said his increasingly high rent may force him to move.</p>
<p>The landlord for his two-bedroom townhouse has asked for annual $100 rent increases in recent years, and just asked for another $200, K.N. said, upping his monthly housing costs with utilities to around $2,500.</p>
<p>“It would reduce my disposable income to basically zero, and that’s not wise with all the extras kids need in school,” K.N. said. “I’d have to pinch pennies to the point that it would cause anxiety. Being housing poor is something I’m trying to avoid.”</p>
<p>Despite a good income, K.N. said, he might have to move farther from his children’s school, which now is within walking distance. He moved to Texas in the first place partly to save money on rent in hopes of buying a house. But he says he sees apartment construction everywhere in Austin.</p>

<p>His observations match reality: Last year, Austin built 24 million square feet of apartment buildings alongside 8.7 million square feet of single-family housing, according to <a href="https://data.austintexas.gov/stories/s/New-Residential-Development-in-Austin/wq6n-itt3/" target="_blank">city records</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a similar story nationally, with nearly 1 million apartments under construction as of September. By comparison, there were 914,500 apartments under construction in 2022 and 736,900 in 2021.</p>
<p>The number of single-family homes being built is also high, though the pace has slowed in the past two years. There were about 694,000 homes under construction in September, down from about 736,000 at the end of 2022 and 750,500 at the end of 2021. The last time construction was so high was in 2006, when about 748,000 single-family homes were under construction during the housing bubble before the Great Recession.</p>
<p>The new supply is already having an effect.</p>
<p>Rents dropped in 71 of the nation’s 100 largest cities in the year ending in September. That eclipses the most recent large decrease, in June 2020, when 65 cities had year-over-year declines, according to Apartment List. In early 2022, rents were rising year over year in all 100 cities.</p>
<p>Apartment List said in an October report that construction is one reason vacancies are rising, combined with a decline in remote work as more companies call employees back to the office, which has led to fewer renters in “Zoom towns” in states such as Arizona, Idaho and Nevada.</p>

<p>Other areas with big recent drops in rents are also mostly in the South and West, where construction is at all-time highs. The Austin metro area dropped 6%; Portland, Oregon, dropped 5%; and Atlanta, Las Vegas, Orlando, Phoenix, Salt Lake City and San Francisco all dropped by 4% in the past year as of September.</p>
<p>Some of those areas are, like Austin, just beginning to see modest drops in average rents but remain much pricier than just a few years ago. The Miami metro area, for instance, has had the nation’s biggest jump in rents since 2020, at 40%. Orlando, Florida, rose 32% over the same time, according to Apartment List.</p>
<p>In the past six months, rents dwindled just 1% in each city.</p>
<p>“Recent gains in housing supply have helped to slow rental prices and housing costs, although I would be cautious about calling rent decreases of 1% very significant,” said Randy Deshazo, director of economic development and research at the South Florida Regional Planning Council. Soaring prices are particularly painful in the region, he said, because affordability, in terms of housing costs compared with income, <a href="https://thecapitolist.com/miami-homeowners-devote-81-percent-of-income-to-housing-property-taxes/#:~:text=The%20report%2C%20based%20on%20data,Broward%2C%20and%20Palm%20Beach%20counties." target="_blank">is the worst in the country</a>.</p>

<p>In some parts of the Northeast and Midwest, where the construction boom hasn’t been quite as robust, rents have continued to rise in the past six months as of September. Rents were up by 7% in Providence, Rhode Island, for example. During the same period, the increase was 5% in Boston, New York City and Hartford, Connecticut.</p>
<p>Estimates of the nation’s housing shortage, which many experts blame for high rents, vary. <a href="https://www.fanniemae.com/media/45106/display" target="_blank">Fannie Mae</a> last year estimated that there were 4.4 million too few units in large metro areas, and <a href="https://www.realtor.com/research/us-housing-supply-gap-march-2023/#:~:text=The%20gap%20between%20single%2Dfamily%20home%20constructions%20and%20household%20formations%20grew%20to%206.5%20million%20homes%20between%202012%20and%202022.%20However%2C%20including%20multi%2Dfamily%20home%20construction%20reduces%20this%20gap%20to%202.3%20million%20homes." target="_blank">Realtor.com</a> this year pegged the shortage at 2.3 million units. About 1.4 million units were finished in 2022, the most since 2007, and another nearly 947,000 were finished in 2023 through August, according to a U.S. Census Bureau construction <a href="https://www.census.gov/construction/nrc/historical_data/index.html" target="_blank">survey</a>.</p>
<p>Permits issued from mid-2022 to August 2023 point to likely large increases in housing in Utah, Idaho, Florida, Texas, South Dakota, North Carolina, the District of Columbia, South Carolina, Arizona, Tennessee, Georgia and Colorado.</p>
<p>Those states could all see housing stock grow by about 2% above census estimates for mid-2022, the latest available, according to a Stateline analysis.</p>
<p>Nationwide, the number of permits issued in 2023 is down compared with a peak in late 2021 and early 2022, even as the numbers remain high in some states. That’s one reason most analysts expect some kind of slowdown from the recent torrid pace of building, said Hermann, of Harvard’s Joint Center for Housing Studies.</p>
<p>South Dakota’s building permits have fallen back from a 48% surge in 2020 followed by a 24.8% increase in 2022. This year they dropped 37% in the second quarter.</p>
<p>Even so, South Dakota had one of the highest rates of new building permits between mid-2022 and August 2023 — more than 2% of its existing units, or almost 9,000 new housing units, if they all get built.</p>
<p>The initial pandemic boom was “likely induced by more work-from-home options and increased demand for space and land, of which South Dakota has an abundance,” said Aaron Scholl, an assistant economics professor at Northern State University in Aberdeen, South Dakota, who worked on <a href="https://www.dakotainstitute.org/research_analysis/housing-demand-remains-strong-despite-increased-borrowing-costs/" target="_blank">a Dakota Institute report on real estate in September. </a></p>
<p>The recent decline likely points to stagnation in the state’s housing market and eventually its whole economy, Scholl said.</p>
<p>“Building permits are often a leading indicator for not only housing market demand, but the overall economic landscape,” Scholl said. “As the housing market cools, I’d expect the economy to do so as well.”</p>

Accidental overdose has become a primary cause of deaths for people under 40. (Tim Henderson/Stateline)</p><p>A new Stateline analysis shows that U.S. residents under 40 were relatively unscathed by COVID-19 in the pandemic but fell victim to another killer: accidental drug overdose deaths.</p>
<p>Death rates in the age group were up by nearly a third in 2021 over 2018, and last year were still 21% higher.</p>
<p>COVID-19 was a small part of the increase, causing about 23,000 deaths total between 2018 and 2022 in the age group, which includes the millennial generation (born starting in the early 1980s), Generation Z (born starting in the late ’90s) and children. Vehicle accidents and suicide (about 96,000 each) and gun homicide (about 65,000) all took a cumulative toll from 2018 to 2022, according to a Stateline analysis of federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data.</p>
<p>Overdose deaths, however, took almost 177,000 lives in that time.</p>
<p>Accidental overdose became the No. 1 cause of death in 13 states for people under 40, overtaking suicide in nine states and vehicle accidents in five others; it’s now the top cause in 37 states. The only other change was in Mississippi, where homicide became the main cause of death, overtaking car accidents. In 40 states and the District of Columbia, overdose was the biggest increase in deaths for young people.</p>
<p><iframe id="datawrapper-chart-aQ7mz" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" title="Death rate for people under 40 as of 2022" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/aQ7mz/2/" height="547" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" aria-label="Map" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
</script></p>
<p>States are responding to the skyrocketing death rates with “harm reduction” strategies that can include warning of the new danger of recreational drugs laced with deadly fentanyl, training and equipping people to counteract overdoses when they see them, and even considering controversial supervised drug use sites to keep addicts safer.</p>
<p>A “fourth great wave” of accidental overdose deaths driven by drugs spiked with powerful fentanyl is now washing over young America, said Daliah Heller, vice president of drug use initiatives at Vital Strategies, an international advocacy group that works on strengthening public health.</p>
<p>Prescription opioids led to one surge in drug dependency from 2000 to 2016, then when supply waned in response to crackdowns, users turned to heroin, synthetic opioids and finally fentanyl, which is 50 times more potent than heroin and easier to get in the pandemic, Heller said.</p>
<h4>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘Very common’ experience</h4>

	</h4>
<p>Jonathan Diehl of Silver Spring, Maryland, died in 2019 at age 28 after using heroin he likely did not know was spiked with fentanyl, said his mother, Cristina Rabadán-Diehl. Jonathan Diehl earned a degree in construction management and was starting a promising new job in home heating and air conditioning four days before he died, his mother said.</p>
<p>“I think Jonathan’s trajectory was very common,” said Rabadán-Diehl, who now works as an adviser on substance use disorders. “He started with opioid pills, and when the government started putting restrictions on prescriptions, he as well as millions and millions of Americans transitioned into the illegal market. And then fentanyl made its appearance.”</p>
<p>Now, a fresh wave of overdose deaths — different from <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0955395919300180#:~:text=The%20triple%20wave%20epidemic%3A%20opioid,methadone%20(Ciccarone%2C%202017)" target="_blank">the first three</a> — is fed by fentanyl making its way into all kind of recreational drugs, and by pandemic isolation that led to more solitary drug use, Heller said.<br />
<i></i></p>
<p>“Somebody might think they’re getting a Xanax [for anxiety], or methamphetamine or cocaine,” Heller said. “They have no experience with opioids, it’s not what they’re expecting and now they have a much higher risk of overdose and death.”</p>
<p>Authorities generally classify overdose deaths as an accident or suicide based on individual investigations of the circumstances surrounding each death.</p>

<p>States struggling the most with deaths of young people, driven mostly by accidental overdoses, include New Mexico, which eclipsed West Virginia and Mississippi since 2018 to have the highest death rate in the nation for people under 40 — about 188 deaths per 100,000, up 43% since 2018.</p>
<p>Other states with high death rates for the age group include West Virginia (170 deaths per 100,000), Louisiana and Mississippi (164), and Alaska (163).</p>
<p>In New Mexico, where accidental overdoses became the main cause of death for people under 40 in 2022, overtaking suicide and rising 90% to 394 deaths since 2018, the overdose problem has <a href="https://ibis.doh.nm.gov/indicator/summary/DrugOverdoseED.html" target="_blank">generally been concentrated</a> in poverty-plagued rural areas such as Rio Arriba County on the Colorado border.</p>
<p>Democratic state Rep. Tara Lujan, who has relatives in that county, sponsored <a href="https://www.nmlegis.gov/Legislation/Legislation?chamber=H&amp;legType=B&amp;legNo=52&amp;year=22" target="_blank">harm reduction legislation</a> signed into law last year. It is similar to laws in many other states that include wide distribution of naloxone to reverse overdoses, legalized testing equipment for deadly additives like fentanyl, and good Samaritan laws that allow friends to report overdoses without legal consequences for their own drug use.</p>
<p>Lujan hopes to reintroduce a bill that would create so-called overdose prevention centers or harm reduction centers where drugs can be used in a supervised and safe environment. The legislation died in committee this year after Republicans called the idea “state-sponsored drug dens.”</p>
<p><i></i>“It’s all issues that were in place before the pandemic, but the pandemic made everything completely off the rails,” Lujan said. “My committee meetings have been packed with family members saying, ‘We know they won’t quit on their own, but we don’t want them to die.’”</p>
<p>Only New York City has two such facilities in operation, run by advocates; the sites claim some success in reversing overdoses. But federal law enforcement authorities are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/08/nyregion/drug-overdoses-supervised-consumption-nyc.html" target="_blank">threatening to shut them down</a> without a specific state mandate, since otherwise they fall under a federal law banning operations that allow illegal drug use on-site.</p>
<p>In California, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom last year <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/SB-57-veto-msg-August-22-2022.pdf" target="_blank">vetoed</a> legislation that would have allowed jurisdictions to open safe injection sites, saying they “could induce a world of unintended consequences” in cities such as Los Angeles, San Francisco and Oakland.</p>
<p>“Worsening drug consumption challenges in these areas is not a risk we can take,” Newsom wrote in a veto message.</p>

<p>Rhode Island is the only state so far to pass legislation allowing supervised drug-use sites as a pilot project, in 2021, but <a href="https://www.browndailyherald.com/article/2023/02/rhode-island-moves-closer-to-opening-first-overdose-prevention-center#:~:text=According%20to%20Marshall%2C%20the%20delay,a%20licensing%20procedure%2C%20he%20said." target="_blank">has yet to open any centers</a>. New legislation <a href="https://webserver.rilegislature.gov/billtext23/housetext23/h5044.htm" target="_blank">introduced this year</a> would push the expiration of the pilot project from 2024 to 2026.</p>
<p>Bills on the same topic of supervised drug-use sites were under consideration this year in <a href="https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/hb23-1202" target="_blank">Colorado</a>, <a href="https://ilga.gov/legislation/BillStatus.asp?DocNum=2&amp;GAID=17&amp;DocTypeID=HB&amp;LegId=141833&amp;SessionID=112&amp;GA=103" target="_blank">Illinois</a> and <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?default_fld=%0D%0A&amp;leg_video=&amp;bn=S00399&amp;term=2023&amp;Actions=Y" target="_blank">New York</a> but did not pass.</p>
<p>In a sign of the impact on young people, a Massachusetts bill would have required all state university dorm assistants to have naloxone training to reverse overdoses, but it stalled.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wmur.com/article/overdose-prevention-van-to-deliver-life-saving-resources-across-new-hampshire/43065554" target="_blank">New Hampshire</a> is one of several states experimenting with vans that go to known drug-use locations and offer overdose prevention supplies and advice.</p>
<h4>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Death rate disparities</h4>

	</h4>
<p>The lowest death rates for young people in 2022 were in Hawaii (78), Massachusetts and Rhode Island (79), and Utah and New Jersey (80). Massachusetts and New Jersey were the only states to see decreases in overall deaths for people under 40 since 2018, and also had drops in overdose deaths, although overdose remained the No. 1 cause of death for young people in both states.</p>
<p>Nationally, accidental overdoses dominated the increase in deaths in residents under 40 across racial and urban-rural divides, but many disparities exist. The increase in young overdose death rates was 154% for Black Americans, 122% for Hispanic residents and 37% for white people, yet even for white residents they represented the largest increase.</p>
<p>The largest urban areas saw increases in overdose death rates of 70%, and rural areas 64% — the largest increases in both areas for any cause of death.</p>
<p>Across races and age groups overdose death rates are higher for men and slowed in 2017, but picked up again after 2018 and skyrocketed in the pandemic until 2021, according to a federal National Center for Health Statistics <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db457.htm%5C" target="_blank">data brief</a> published last year.</p>

(AP Photo/Marta Lavandier)</p><p>The median age rose in almost every state last year, census estimates show, continuing a long-term trend that is pushing states to prepare for aging populations.</p>
<p>Seventeen states had median ages over 40 in 2022, according to new U.S. Census Bureau estimates of the age at which half of residents are older and half are younger. That’s up from 12 states in 2020 and just seven in 2010.</p>
<p>Nationwide, the median age <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/241494/median-age-of-the-us-population/" target="_blank">was below 30 until 1980</a>, but it rose to 38.9 as of 2022, according to the bureau estimates.</p>
<p>That leaves more states planning for future health and housing challenges for older residents. Some states have issued or are considering executive orders, agency plans and legislation to assist state residents who need more help with health crises, housing and long-term care as they live longer.</p>
<p>Millennials started turning 40 last year, and the youngest baby boomers are quickly approaching 60.</p>
<p>“As the nation’s median age creeps closer to 40, you can really see how the aging of baby boomers, and now their children — sometimes called echo boomers — is impacting the median age,” said Kristie Wilder, a Census Bureau demographer, in a statement.</p>
<p><a href="https://stateline.org/2023/05/11/low-fertility-rates-high-housing-prices-mean-fewer-children-in-most-states/" target="_blank">Lower birth rates also play a role</a> and will likely continue to drive median age slowly but steadily higher, Wilder added. Some states have passed legislation requiring that health insurers cover fertility treatments in response to lower fertility rates, according to a University of California, Irvine study <a href="https://www.fertstert.org/article/S0015-0282(22)01752-6/fulltext" target="_blank">published last year</a>. New York state’s <a href="https://www.dfs.ny.gov/apps_and_licensing/health_insurers/ivf_fertility_preservation_law_qa_guidance" target="_blank">2020 law</a>, for example, requires coverage of in vitro fertilization in some cases.</p>

</script></p>
<p>No states saw a drop from 2021 to 2022, and states with unchanged medians were Alabama, Maine, Tennessee and West Virginia, along with the District of Columbia. The largest increase in median age in recent years was in Delaware, where it rose three years since 2010 to age 41.8.</p>
<p>The portion of Delaware residents over 60 will jump from a quarter to more than a third of the state population by 2040, according to a 2020 state report, creating new challenges for state services. A <em>Delaware Journal of Public Health</em> <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8482973/" target="_blank">report</a> published in 2021 said a growing number of Delaware’s older residents suffer from dementia, requiring more expensive help from the state and family caregivers.</p>
<p><a href="https://dail.vermont.gov/sites/dail/files/documents/FY24%20Budget%20Presentation~2-8-2023.pdf" target="_blank">Vermont held six public listening sessions</a> around the state last year to help prepare recommendations this year for <a href="https://www.healthvermont.gov/wellness/brain-health-dementia/age-strong-vermont-our-roadmap-age-friendly-state" target="_blank">Age Strong Vermont</a>, its road map for an “age-friendly state.”</p>
<p>“Vermont had this older demographic for a long time but it’s taken a while for the state broadly to really reckon with that,” said Angela Smith-Dieng, Vermont’s Adult Services Division director. Part of the challenge is that older Vermont residents tend to live in big rural houses and need help with in-home health care, renovations for mobility and transportation on demand, she said.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/executive-order/no-23-establishing-new-york-state-master-plan-aging" target="_blank">New York executive order</a> in November also calls for a statewide plan on aging.</p>

<p>Vermont and New York joined other states already planning comprehensive strategies for aging populations: California, Colorado, Massachusetts and Texas, according to a <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/state-legislatures-news/details/supporting-older-adults-with-approaches-spanning-multiple-policy-areas" target="_blank">January report </a>by the National Conference of State Legislatures.</p>
<p>California’s <a href="https://mpa.aging.ca.gov/" target="_blank">Master Plan for Aging</a>, released in 2021, aims to create an “age-friendly California” by 2030, including housing and health care strategies. A <a href="https://openstates.org/ca/bills/20232024/AB1006/" target="_blank">bill currently progressing</a> in the state legislature would create a statewide system of respite providers by 2025 to help give primary caregivers of older adults enrolled in Medi-Cal, the state's Medicaid program for low-income residents, a break.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, an Oregon <a href="https://openstates.org/or/bills/2023R1/SB99/" target="_blank">bill</a> to study long-term care needs for older residents has passed both chambers of the legislature.</p>
<p>Only North Dakota is younger now than it was in 2010, down 1.2 years from age 37 to 35.8. The state’s burgeoning oil industry has drawn younger workers to jobs that pay well and don’t require four-year college degrees.</p>
<p>Energy counties in other states have seen similar influxes of young people. Loving County, Texas, for example, saw its median age decrease from 52.7 in 2010 to 35.3 in 2022, a difference of more than 17 years.</p>
<p>Skeet Lee Jones, county judge there, said the tiny county has work camps for more than 1,000 oil workers and hundreds more young workers living in recreational vehicle camps, with good-paying jobs that create their own challenges for county government.</p>
<p>“We’ve had to start paying our own county workers what we call ‘oil-field wages’ just to get things done, about four or five times minimum wage,” Jones said.</p>
<p>The oldest state in the country remains Maine at 44.8. It also was the oldest in 2010, at 42.7.</p>
<p>Other states with median ages at 40 or above in 2022: New Hampshire (43.3), Vermont (43.2), West Virginia (42.8), Florida (42.7), Delaware (41.8), Pennsylvania and Connecticut (40.9), Hawaii (40.7), Rhode Island (40.6), Wisconsin (40.4), New Jersey, Oregon and South Carolina (all 40.3), Montana and Michigan (40.2), and Massachusetts (40.1).</p>
<p>The youngest states and the only ones with median ages below 37 were Utah (31.9), the District of Columbia (34.8), Texas (35.5), and Alaska and North Dakota (35.8).</p>
<p>On the county level, the median age in 2022 was as low as 20.9 in Madison County, Idaho, home of Brigham Young University-Idaho, where <a href="https://www.boisestatepublicradio.org/economy/2014-06-26/how-madison-county-idaho-became-the-youngest-place-in-america" target="_blank">many young students are also starting families</a>.</p>
<p>The median age was as high as 68.1 in Sumter County, Florida, part of the sprawling The Villages retirement community. In 2010 Sumter County’s median age was 62.7, the only county with a median age of 60 or higher in the nation at the time.</p>
<p>In 2022 there were six others: Catron County, New Mexico (62.1); Jeff Davis County, Texas (61.7); Harding County, New Mexico (60.5); Jefferson County, Washington (60.4); Charlotte County, Florida (60.2); and Highland County, Virginia (60.0).</p>
