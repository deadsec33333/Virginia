Hundreds of teachers, led by a red school bus, marched near the Richmond convention center. (Mechelle Hankerson/The Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For years, Democratic lawmakers called on Republicans — who had legislative and budgetary control — to fully fund public education to the threshold set by the state Board of Education.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But if Gov. Ralph Northam’s budget proposal is approved as presented, the new Democratic majority would still fall short, advocates say, despite investments Northam calls “historic.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year, the Board of Education didn’t hold back when it laid out what it says schools in the commonwealth need: <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/07/29/virginias-board-of-education-is-considering-recommendations-to-force-the-hand-of-the-general-assembly/" target="_blank">Close to a billion dollars</a> for teacher training and compensation; funding for support positions like nurses and custodians; specialized teachers and money for localities to spend on local needs.</span></p>
<p>The board creates and adopts Standards of Quality, which determines the minimum amount of funding the state is constitutionally required to give to school districts. The standards address things like the number of teachers and staff in a school, class sizes and extra funding for specific school needs. The standards can and have been altered by budget language in preceding years, meaning the state hasn&#8217;t always funded the standards, passing the responsibility to localities.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Northam responded in his budget proposal, setting aside $1.2 billion for public K-12 schools, but it’s not allocated the way the Board of Education recommended. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Educators United, the group that leads the state’s Red4Ed movement, called Northam’s education budget “unconstitutional and unacceptable to Virginians.” <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/education/wp/2018/04/26/first-it-was-west-virginia-then-kentucky-and-oklahoma-now-arizona-and-colorado-teachers-prepare-to-walk-out/" target="_blank">Red4Ed is the organized national effort</a> advocating for better teacher pay and supported educator walkouts in states like West Virginia, Oklahoma and Arizona. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About $800 million of Northam&#8217;s proposed $1.2 billion is dedicated to &#8220;rebenchmarking,&#8221; a process that gives districts more money to account for inflation and enrollment changes. It doesn’t restore any funding lost in the last decade, VEU said in a statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While we recognize that it includes some necessary investments, we believe that overall this proposal falls far short of what is desperately needed,” the group said.</span></p>
<p>VEU is working with the Legal Aid Justice Center, The Commonwealth Institute for Fiscal Analysis and New Virginia Majority to start the Fund Our Schools campaign.</p>
<p>&#8220;Across Virginia, in communities that cannot afford to supplement state funding for education, student outcomes suffer while students and educators languish in crumbling buildings with inadequate technology, textbooks and other resources,&#8221; the group wrote. &#8220;Even in communities that can more easily afford to supplement the state’s investment, students who need extra support to succeed often do not get an adequate amount and lag far behind their peers.&#8221;</p>
<h2><b>Teacher pay</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the second year, Northam is proposing a teacher pay raise. He&#8217;s proposing a 3% raise in the second year of his proposed biennial budget, which is just under $1,500 more a year for the teacher making the average state salary of $49,457.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, the legislature approved a 5 % raise. All the raises are dependent on local matches.  It still leaves average Virginia teacher pay under the national average of $59,539.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Northam set aside $145 million for the state’s portion of the raise. Localities are required to put up a portion of the cost, an amount that depends on its local composite index and number of staff afforded to the district by the Standards of Quality and budget.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Governor Northam’s 3% proposal is a step forward, but we still have a long way to go to pay our educators what they deserve,” Virginia Education Association President </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/proposed-pay-raise-would-still-leave-the-average-virginia-teacher-salary-below-national-average/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jim Livingston said.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “Our elected leaders must make this a priority.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Educators United was more specific in their critique of the proposal: “The 3% increase to teacher salaries amounts to a pay cut after calculating for inflation,” the group wrote in a press release.</span></p>
<h2><b>At-risk add-on and other flexible spending</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Calling it the largest single increase to the fund, Northam wants to add $140.4 million for distribution among school districts with students considered “at-risk.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That can be districts with high levels of poverty or students who need English language or special education services and other circumstances that mean students need more support in school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">School districts have some flexibility in how they use at-risk add-on money. For example, some localities said they could use at-risk funding to pay for their portion of last year&#8217;s 5% teacher raise. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Northam also wants to use a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">proposed new tax on emerging “games of skill” to create a per-pupil fund that will give districts some extra money based on enrollment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Districts will be able to use that money as they see fit, like the at-risk add-on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This budget provides extra funding to help close the achievement gap in high-need schools, especially in urban and rural Virginia,” Northam said in a statement. “Every child should have access to a world-class education, and this budget advances that commitment.”</span></p>
<h2><b>School support staff cap</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One recurring ask from Democratic lawmakers under the Republican majority was to remove the support staff cap implemented during the recession to save money.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cap meant the state hasn’t added funding for additional staff like nurses, custodians, social workers or guidance counselors since the recession despite changes in school populations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">School systems that had enough local revenue could add those positions, but it was an effort fully paid for with local money.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Northam’s K-12 budget proposal begins to catch up on that by providing $99.3 million for more counselors. The Board of Education has recommended having one counselor for every 250 students, a standard many school districts were already following with local money.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Northam’s change may not mean more counselors on the ground, but it will mean the state will begin paying for some of them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Northam’s budget proposal didn’t include a language change that would lift the cap on all support positions, a disappointment for Virginia Educators United.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When we faced economic hardship as a state, we continued to financially prioritize businesses while the belt was tightened on schools in the form of lay-offs for non-instructional personnel,” the organization wrote in a statement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As educators, we know how critical support staff are to the well-being of our students. That is why Virginia Educators United call for, at a bare minimum, an elimination of this arbitrary cap on support staff positions and a return to 2009 levels of funding for school support staff.”</span></p>
<h2><b>School construction</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Notably absent from Northam’s proposal was money set aside for school construction and rebuilding. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, he proposed $80 million for school buildings, a portion of that coming from Lottery proceeds. It was a bipartisan priority, with Republican Sen. Bill Stanley of Franklin County leading the charge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year, Stanley appears to be on his own in his crusade to fix Virginia’s aging school buildings. Northam proposed using $895 million for collegiate building projects but left out funding for buildings at lower educational levels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state typically provides funding for colleges. There is no established program to fund K-12 construction projects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Educators United took issue with that decision and suggested a return to a pre-2010 construction grant program and increasing the use of the literary fund (from lottery proceeds) to pay for school construction costs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stanley has filed two bills to help school districts with construction projects. One would require the Board of Education to <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+sum+SB5" target="_blank">set minimum, uniform standards</a> for school buildings and another establishes <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+sum+SB4" target="_blank">a grant program</a> that would disperse money to school districts for facility construction or rehabilitation. </span></p>

</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans made college affordability a priority in their time as the majority party and used those successes — like last year’s<a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/05/28/tuition-freezes-are-a-watershed-moment-for-college-affordability-advocates-say/" target="_blank"> tuition freeze</a> — in campaigns.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year, the new Democratic majority will consider the historic undertaking of making community college free for some students and decide if some of the Republicans’ past efforts to make college more accessible should continue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to budgetary items, lawmakers will have to contend with a recent Virginia Supreme Court decision that says it’s OK for foundations tied to public colleges to keep some donation information from the public, among other issues of transparency.</span></p>
<h2><b>Free community college</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/northams-free-community-college-plan-would-cost-145m-the-state-of-recycling-programs-in-virginia-and-more-headlines/" target="_blank">Northam wants to spend $145 million</a> to make community college free for some students seeking certain degrees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His proposed “Get Skilled, Get a Job, Give Back” or G3, initiative will provide low and middle income students with free tuition and up to $1,000 in grants throughout their time in school to pay for things like books and transportation. The students will be required to sign a Community Engagement Agreement and complete two hours of work experience per credit hour they are enrolled in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The program will be offered only in key subject areas to funnel more trained workers into industries in need of more people, like information technology and health care.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With Virginia’s record low unemployment rate, businesses are hungry for skilled talent,” Chief Workforce Development Adviser Megan Healy said in a statement. “The G3 program will help Virginia businesses of all sizes fill open jobs, connect Virginians with the necessary training and credentials to find good-paying work and grow the commonwealth’s economy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The program won’t be offered to every student: only those who are eligible for full Pell Grants.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The G3 program will extend higher education to Virginians who have opted out of traditional college because of rising tuition costs, Secretary of Education Atif Qarni said in a statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the proposal isn’t without criticism, and “opens up a much bigger conversation about how the state funds its public colleges and who benefits most,” Partners for College Affordability and Public Trust President James Toscano said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The $145 million budget initiative represents just a fraction of the billions in total state spending on higher education that favors a few resource-rich universities – with no affordability or employment outcomes required.”</span></p>
<h2><b>Tuition freeze </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In last year’s General Assembly session, Republicans made a deal with public colleges: If they kept tuition the same, the state would give them some extra money.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It worked, and every public college agreed not to raise tuition in exchange for a piece of $53 million lawmakers set aside (though it didn’t stop schools from raising mandatory fees, which were not part of the deal).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Northam didn’t include such an offer in his budget, but the General Assembly could implement the freeze through legislation, said Secretary of Education Atif Qarni. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Last year Republicans set aside $53 million to freeze tuition at our public colleges for the first time in 20 years, making it easier for young people to afford higher education,” outgoing Majority Leader Del. Todd Gilbert said in a statement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Not only does the governor’s budget fail to continue the freeze, it has a slush fund for House and Senate Democrats nearly four times that size. I doubt this is what voters were expecting when they voted for Democrats,” he said, referring to $200 million the governor reserved for the General Assembly to use as the body sees fit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Already, the University of Virginia and the College of William &amp; Mary have approved tuition raises.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Returning in-state undergraduates at William &amp; Mary won’t see an increase as part of the school’s policy of not increasing tuition for returning students. But in-state freshmen and transfer students will pay 3% more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UVA students will see a 3.6% increase, which will range from about $500-$800 for in-state students and about $1,700 to $2,000 more a year for out-of-state students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a presentation given to UVA’s Board of Visitors, the school anticipates $7 million less from the state and at least a $31.9 million increase in costs, about half of which is related to staff and faculty pay increases.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The school committed to paying its employees at least </span><a href="https://news.virginia.edu/content/university-virginia-announces-15-living-wage" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a $15 an hour living wage</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2><b>Financial aid</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Northam wants to provide colleges with $45 million more for financial aid. The state already allocates about $273 million to help with various state grant programs for college students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The State Council of Higher Education for Virginia, which allocates aid money to schools, <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/11/14/fixing-the-formula-how-the-state-plans-to-get-more-financial-aid-to-the-students-who-need-it-most/" target="_blank">reworked its formula</a> to give more money to schools with more low-income students instead of sending more money to schools with higher tuition (the idea is that more expensive schools likely have more students who can afford higher education with less help). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For private colleges, the governor proposed to increase the Tuition Assistance Grant amount to $4,000 per student. The program gives private school students financial aid based on a completed application, not need or merit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the proposed budget also removes a provision that allows students to use TAG for online college programs, a change that will have a big impact on Liberty University, the largest private college in the state.</span></p>
<p>According to SCHEV data, there were <a href="https://research.schev.edu//enrollment/E20_report.asp" target="_blank">195,000 instances of registration</a> for online classes at the school in the spring 2019 semester.</p>
<h2><b>Transparency on campus</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following a state <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/va-supreme-court-rules-university-foundations-can-keep-donor-records-secret/" target="_blank">Supreme Court decision</a> that ruled university’s foundations aren’t subject to the Freedom of Information Act, Del. David Bulova, D-Fairfax, said he plans on changing state law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">University foundations raise private funds to support public colleges. Last year, students at George Mason University sought information from the GMU Foundation about a large donation from conservative mega-donor Charles Koch and his family. The foundation claimed it wasn’t subject to the FOIA law and didn’t have to share that information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The courts agreed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bulova said he <a href="https://wamu.org/story/19/12/17/virginia-democrats-want-more-transparency-in-university-donations/" target="_blank">plans to file two pieces</a> of legislation to make it more clear what the public should be able to see.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One bill will clarify that any donation to a public university that comes with conditions related to academic operations has to be public. Another bill will call for those conditions to be explicitly laid out in a document when the money changes hands from foundation to university. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Even if the foundation isn’t subject to FOIA, the terms are and the terms and donations should be transparent,” Bulova said in an interview.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislation will codify several university policies GMU changed as students challenged its decision on donations, Bulova said, making it permanent and applicable to all public universities. Sen. Richard Stuart, R-Stafford, has </span><a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+sum+SB140" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">filed the same legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in his chamber.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stuart also wants the General Assembly to consider how much information students get before a tuition increase or pay raise for university leaders. </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/a-republican-senator-wants-students-to-approve-tuition-increases-before-governing-boards-do/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">He’s proposed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a bill that would require a student vote before a tuition increase and another bill that would require a more open process when giving some university administrators a raise.</span></p>
<p>Former journalists Dels. Chris Hurst, D-Montgomery and Danica Roem, D-Prince William, have also <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+sum+HB36" target="_blank">re-filed legislation</a> to protect student journalists at all educational levels. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. David Marsden, D-Fairfax, has filed the same bill, which would </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">protect the student’s First Amendment rights “regardless of whether the media is supported financially by the school board or governing board.” </span></p>

Richard Stuart, R-Stafford. (Photo by Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A proposal from a Republican senator would require student approval before a public college or university approves a tuition raise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Richard Stuart, R-Stafford, wants tuition hikes to go to the students who will have to pay for it before a governing board votes. His legislation, which he introduced last year too and calls &#8220;crazy,&#8221; calls for two-thirds of a school’s student body to approve the raise before formal adoption.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I think that these trustees and presidents need to make the case to the student body that they are managing the money wisely, it&#8217;s really that simple,&#8221; Stuart said. &#8220;I think these young people are smart enough to approve it or disapprove it based upon the case these folks make to them. They&#8217;re much smarter than folks give them credit for.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last General Assembly session, lawmakers approved legislation that requires college governing boards to hold public comment before voting on a tuition increase. It passed unanimously in both chambers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Concerns about skyrocketing rates for tuition and fees aren’t isolated to one campus or another,” said James Toscano, president of Partners for College Affordability and Public Trust </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/tuition-raises-would-have-to-go-to-public-comment-under-bills-from-both-parties-in-both-chambers/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said at the time.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">  “And college trustees who set them need to hear firsthand what the public thinks beyond getting briefings and handouts from college officials.”</span></p>
<p>Stuart said that was a good change, but it&#8217;s not enough. He&#8217;s not sure the bills he&#8217;s put in this year will pass, but it will force lawmakers to continue discussing college affordability.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it’s the right thing to do. I think students should have a say in their own financial destiny,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to keep putting them in until we get something satisfactory for these students.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From 2004 to 2019, instate undergraduate tuition increased $4,949, according to a pre-session </span><a href="http://hac.virginia.gov/Committee/files/2019/11-19-19%20Retreat/VI%20-%20Update%20on%20Higher%20Education%20Affordability%20PRINT%20and%20WEB%20ver.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">presentation given by House Appropriations staff.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Tuition increased $10,074 for out-of-state undergraduates. Neither of those figures include increases in mandatory fees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Staff acknowledged part of that is driven by a decrease in state funding, which has decreased about $1,249 per studen</span>t<span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the same time period. But for every $1 in state funding public colleges lost, tuition increased about $4, appropriations staff estimated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It could be argued that colleges have a spending problem, not a revenue problem,” staff wrote in their presentation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stuart wants to make other cost increases at public colleges more understandable. He filed separate legislation that requires university governing boards  to provide written notice of why they want to increase a president’s compensation and where the funding for the raise would come from. The boards must allow public comment on the change and the increase has to be voted on in an open meeting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That means the next time Virginia Commonwealth University President Michael Rao — the highest paid state employee — gets a raise, the school’s Board of Visitors will have to explain why and who is ultimately paying for the raise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stuart’s bill also says such a raise can’t happen the same year governing boards raise tuition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the </span><a href="https://data.richmond.com/salaries/2018/state" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richmond Times-Dispatch’s database</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of state employee salaries, seven of the 10 highest paid state employees were university presidents this past year: </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michael Rao at VCU made $1 million</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">University of Virginia President James Ryan made $962,875</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> J.H. Binford Peay at Virginia Military Institute made $837,267</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Tech President Timothy Sands made $775,000</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paul Trible at Christopher Newport made $771,287</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Angel Cabrera, who left his position as president of George Mason this summer, made $763,226</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">John Broderick at Old Dominion made $638,217</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those amounts include housing, cell phone allowances, transportation, bonuses and other items that made up the presidents’ total compensation. </span></p>

Ralph Northam has <a href="https://dpb.virginia.gov/budget/buddoc20/partb/OfficeOfHealthAndHumanResources.pdf" target="_blank">proposed spending nearly $17 million</a> over two years to help families who take in relatives’ children before they enter the foster care system.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/06/02/they-forgot-about-us-thousands-of-families-are-doing-the-same-work-as-foster-parents-in-virginia-without-the-support/" target="_blank">Tens of thousands of Virginia children</a> are being raised by relatives instead of being put into foster care. But unlike formal foster families, these kinship families don’t receive the monthly stipend and other support formal foster families receive.</p>
<p>With Northam’s proposal, families could begin getting financial help to take care of those children, a need that&#8217;s grown in recent years, said Allison Gilbreath of Voices for Virginia&#8217;s Children, an advocacy organization on issues affecting children.</p>
<p>The money can be used for food, child care and other costs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even when relatives want to (take care of a child), they might not be able to afford it,&#8221; Gilbreath said. &#8220;This will help.&#8221;</p>
<p>Foster parents <a href="https://www.dss.virginia.gov/files/division/dfs/fc/intro_page/guidance_manuals/fc/07_2019/section_18_funding_maintenance_costs.pdf" target="_blank">currently receive</a> between $486 to $721 a month per child, depending on the child&#8217;s age. The families can also be reimbursed for certain costs.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear yet if kinship families will get the same amounts.</p>
<p>Kinship care helps social services departments manage an already demanding workload, advocates have said.</p>
<p>“If someone were to pull that safety net away, child welfare would truly crumble,&#8221; Gilbreath said. &#8220;Caseloads would double and they would have such a spike in need for families that they would not be able to properly care for them all.”</p>

Norfolk State is one of two state historically black universities to get a boost in funding from Gov. Ralph Northam's proposed budget. (Photo by Mark Wilson/Getty Images)</p><p>Virginia’s historically black colleges and universities have some of the lowest <a href="https://research.schev.edu/gradrates/cohortgradsrates.asp" target="_blank">four-and five-year graduation rates</a> in the state, falling well below 50% at most of the schools.</p>
<p>It’s an outcome driven in part by decades of inadequate funding for the large populations of low-income, first-generation and minority students the institutions serve, Gov. Ralph Northam said Tuesday.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s proposed giving Norfolk State and Virginia State universities — the two public HBCUs here — $143 and $150 million, respectively, for capital improvements. It&#8217;s part of an $895 million item for similar improvements at all colleges and universities.</p>
<p>Northam also proposed money to support the state&#8217;s share of a federal grant at the two schools to train more students of color to become science, math and technology teachers.</p>
<p>&#8220;This spending plan makes generational investments in areas that have been underfunded for years, and ensures that we take care of our most vulnerable Virginians,&#8221; Northam told lawmakers when presenting his budget. &#8220;Many of our HBCUs attract students from the first generation in their families to attend college. Those students often need additional guidance and support, no matter what school they attend.&#8221;</p>
<p>His proposal still has to work its way through the General Assembly, where the House Appropriations committee is now chaired by Del. Luke Torian, D-Prince William, a three-time HBCU graduate. He has degrees from Winston Salem State, Virginia Union and Howard universities.</p>
<p>Norfolk State and Virginia State are generally funded in the same manner as other public colleges in the state. This year, the state is carving out money specifically for HBCUs as part of Northam&#8217;s overall goal of addressing &#8220;long-neglected needs.&#8221;</p>
<p>HBCUs are &#8220;game-changers&#8221; and &#8220;economic engines,&#8221; Secretary of Education Atif Qarni said. But over time, the schools have experienced some enrollment decline as educational integration happened.</p>
<p>&#8220;They really are very intentional about getting students of color (and) students who are economically disadvantaged,&#8221; Qarni said of HBCUs. &#8220;It&#8217;s not just about HBCUs, but it&#8217;s part of that package because they are serving a purpose for students with economic fragility.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An increase of financial aid to public colleges earlier this year went to all public schools. </span>The Legislative Black Caucus pushed to include more funding to help HBCUs during the last General Assembly session, a request that was amplified after <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/why-does-gov-northams-yearbook-page-include-blackface-and-kkk-robes/" target="_blank">a racist photo</a> was found on Northam&#8217;s medical school yearbook. The governor<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/va-gov-ralph-northam-says-he-wants-to-focus-rest-of-his-term-on-racial-equity/2019/02/09/2a739b20-2c76-11e9-984d-9b8fba003e81_story.html" target="_blank"> committed to addressing racial inequities</a> in the aftermath.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s important to note that there were discussions prior to the yearbook incident to support HBCUs &#8230; but the level that showed up in the budget didn&#8217;t match the need we discussed,&#8221; said Del. Lashrecse Aird, D-Petersburg. She works in administration at Richard Bland College and is a graduate of Virginia State University.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When you have an HBCU that’s trying to support (students’) needs, maintain the affordability and then also have the student supports in place, I think we have seen and continue to see that’s a significant challenge,&#8221; Aird said.</span></p>
<h2><strong>&#8216;A long history of unequal funding&#8217;</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Historically, black colleges have always fallen behind other schools when it comes to funding and resources, said Marybeth Gasman, a professor at Rutgers University and leading scholar on historically black colleges and universities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s a long history of unequal funding when it comes to black education,” Gasman said. &#8220;Because one of the things about wealth is that wealth begets wealth, so it you start out wealthy, you’ll get wealthier.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">HBCUs were created because of educational segregation or governments&#8217; refusal to fund schools for black students.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> NSU, now the largest HBCU in Virginia with 5,601 students, came under <a href="https://webapps.nsu.edu/foundersday/history.html" target="_blank">state control in 1944. </a>Virginia started <a href="http://www.vsu.edu/about/history/history-vsu.php" target="_blank">VSU in 1882.</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With limited economic opportunities, black founders could only do so much with their own money to launch schools. NSU, for example, started in a Norfolk YMCA building in 1935. Today, the school can&#8217;t provide the same kind of classroom experiences, internships and scholarships other schools can, said Cassandra Newby-Alexander, dean of NSU&#8217;s College of Liberal Arts.</span></p>
<p>Virginia&#8217;s general funding for colleges is about equal when comparing institutions of similar size. Christopher Newport University has <a href="https://research.schev.edu/enrollment/E2_Report.asp" target="_blank">a few hundred more students</a> than VSU and a few hundred fewer than NSU. All <a href="https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/secretariat/2019/1/HB1700/Chapter/1/office-of-education/" target="_blank">three schools received</a> a little more than $330 million each from the state in the current budget.</p>
<p>&#8220;Equal versus equity is the issue,&#8221; Newby-Alexander said. &#8220;If somebody has a 100-year head start on me … and then you just start funding me equally &#8230; you have infrastructure that I don’t have.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s this fiction that, &#8216;Oh, you all have enough,'&#8221; she said. &#8220;That’s if I forget the fact that many of the majority institutions have a billion-dollar endowment so they&#8217;re drawing millions just from the interest. HBCUs do not have those deep pockets.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to a study by the <a href="https://www.nacubo.org/research/2019/nacubo-tiaa-study-of-endowments" target="_blank">National Association of College and University Business Officers,</a> NSU has a $24 million endowment as of 2018 and VSU has a $35 million endowment. Hampton, one of Virginia&#8217;s private HBCUs, has a $285 million endowment.</p>
<p>The University of Virginia, by comparison, <a href="https://www.dailyprogress.com/news/local/uva-endowment-grew-by-nearly-b-last-fiscal-year/article_a0666916-beb2-11e8-a116-23e475d429e4.html" target="_blank">has an endowment of $9.5 billion</a>. The University of Richmond&#8217;s is $2.5 billion and Virginia Commonwealth University is $1.9 billion. William &amp; Mary&#8217;s was <a href="https://www.wm.edu/about/administration/senioradmin/financeadministration/financialreport/financialoverview/investments/index.php" target="_blank">$962 million</a> as of last year.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Predominantly white institutions, or PWIs, have had the time and generational resources to build endowments and programs that attract more and wealthier students, Gasman said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s how HBCUs get into this situation where they don’t have as much funding, they’re not doing as well financially,” she said. “To be frank, one of the things that happens is that people look down on HBCUs … and that has to do with how racism works. It not only works against people, but it also works against institutions.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">HBCUs have a higher need than PWIs, Gasman said, because many students at HBCUs are low-income, a minority or the first in their family to attend college. All of those students typically need more help — like financial aid or advising — in a college environment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the 2017-2018 academic year, Virginia’s two public HBCUs had the highest percentage of students receiving a Pell Grant of any public college, one way to measure how much of the student population is considered low-income.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://research.schev.edu//fair/pell_dom_report.asp" target="_blank">According to the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia</a>, 68% of students at NSU attended the school with the help of a Pell Grant in the 2017-2018 school year. Most of Virginia&#8217;s other HBCUs have a similarly high percentage of students using Pell Grants: 71% at both Virginia State and Virginia Union and close to 99% of students at Virginia University at Lynchburg receive Pell grants, university president Kathy Franklin said.</span></p>
<p>About 39% of students at Hampton University received Pell Grants last school year.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Funding structures threaten HBCUs’ ability to provide some of the most affordable college educations, Gasman said.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We set up these institutions and then starved them from the get-go so I think it&#8217;s really important to make up for that,&#8221; she said. &#8220;If you want to do anything about equity, you have to disproportionately invest.&#8221;</p>
<p>SCHEV recently <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/11/14/fixing-the-formula-how-the-state-plans-to-get-more-financial-aid-to-the-students-who-need-it-most/" target="_blank">reworked its financial aid model</a>, which determines how much money schools get to allocate to students. The changes should drive more money to schools with higher concentrations of low-income students, like HBCUs.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a good change, Aird said, but it won&#8217;t be enough.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;At HBCUs you still see such a concentration of need, it still doesn&#8217;t go far enough,&#8221; she said.</span></p>

Education groups still doubt that the state's current spending on teacher salaries is enough to reverse current staffing shortfalls. (Ned Oliver/ Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Teachers earning average pay in Virginia will get nearly $1,500 closer to earning the national average teacher salary under Gov. Ralph Northam’s budget proposal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Northam has proposed using $145 million for a 3% teacher pay raise. It&#8217;s part of a <a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/all-releases/2019/december/headline-849963-en.html" target="_blank">$1.2 billion package</a> of K-12 education initiatives the governor is asking lawmakers to consider in the upcoming General Assembly session.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/whats-the-average-teacher-salary-in-virginia-depends-who-does-the-math-lawmakers-find/" target="_blank">average Virginia teacher salary is $49,457</a> a year. Northam&#8217;s proposed raise will put the average teacher at making just under $51,000 a year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s the <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/12/11/with-a-positive-economic-outlook-northam-proposes-teacher-pay-raise-more-money-for-school-construction/" target="_blank">second consecutive year</a> Northam has proposed a teacher pay raise, but it still leaves the average Virginia teacher making thousands less than the national average used by the National Education Association, about $59,000 a year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Governor Northam’s 3% proposal is a step forward, but we still have a long way to go to pay our educators what they deserve,” Virginia Education Association President Jim Livingston said in a statement. “Our elected leaders must make this a priority.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Northam’s proposal requires <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/01/16/some-school-districts-may-struggle-to-find-local-match-for-proposed-teacher-pay-raise/" target="_blank">a local match</a>, which could pose problems for low-income districts that don’t have the funds for their portion of the raises. But Northam also included increased at-risk add-on money, a funding stream that could be used for teacher salaries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The percentage raise means teachers in some parts of the state will still be making well above the state average and others in rural areas will still fall well below. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Arlington, one of the highest-paying school districts, teachers make an average of $78,000 a year, meaning those teachers will take home about $2,300 more a year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But in other parts of the state, like Southside and Southwest Virginia, teachers’ average pay hovers between $30,000 and $40,000. Those teachers will get about $1,000 more a year &#8212; still at or below $40,000 a year, less than the state average.</span></p>

Ralph Northam rolled out $22 million worth of budget proposals to combat the rise of maternal mortality. (Mechelle Hankerson/The Virginia Mercury)</p><p>Black women in Virginia are <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/03/05/birthing-while-black-african-american-women-face-disproportionate-risks-during-pregnancy/" target="_blank">three times more likely</a> to die after giving birth than white women, a disparity Gov. Ralph Northam has said he wants to <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/northam-announces-2025-goal-to-eliminate-racial-disparity-in-pregnancy-related-deaths/" target="_blank">eliminate by 2025.</a></p>
<p>To do that, Northam has come up with a $22 million, two-year plan he introduced Monday in a room of toddlers, babies and their parents.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It is unacceptable that in our country and in our commonwealth, maternal mortality rates are on the rise,&#8221; said the governor, a pediatric neurologist.</span></p>
<p>His proposals came from a series of listening sessions administration officials held around the state in recent months to discuss maternal and infant mortality.</p>
<p>Medicaid expansion has helped a number of women, Northam said, but added that his budget proposals will help reduce the rate further.</p>
<p>Among his ideas:</p>
<p><strong>• Extend post-partum Medicaid coverage to a year after birth. </strong>Right now, women using Medicaid are covered during pregnancy and up to 60 days after birth. But many women who die because of childbirth do so more than 43 days after giving birth, Northam said. &#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe that these preventable deaths are … women being left to navigate a complex health care system on their own,&#8221; he said. </span>Black women die most often after giving birth because of cardiac problems, according to <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/in-maternal-mortality-causes-vary-significantly-by-race/" target="_blank">data from the Department of Health</a>.</p>
<p>Makunda Abdul-Mbacke, an OBGYN in Martinsville and Henry County, said Northam&#8217;s proposal gives women a chance to &#8220;breathe&#8221; after having a baby.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You have no idea how difficult it is to try to wrap up someone&#8217;s post-partum depression, to wrap up their hypertensive crisis, to wrap up their heart issues and so many things … that need to get wrapped up in a 60-day period after they deliver,&#8221; Abdul-Mbacke said.</span></p>

Ralph Northam as he rolled out a $22 million plan to reduce maternal mortality rates. (Mechelle Hankerson/The Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><strong>• Allow home visits to be reimbursed by Medicaid. </strong>The most expensive of Northam&#8217;s proposals was a $12.8 million plan to include a home visitation program in Medicaid coverage.</p>
<p>&#8220;We know home visiting programs help parents be more resilient, they help coordinate care and services and teach parents the skills they need,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p><a href="https://mchb.hrsa.gov/maternal-child-health-initiatives/home-visiting-overview" target="_blank">Home visits</a> can help parents with a range of things, including breastfeeding, helping parents further their own education or find work and managing children&#8217;s behavior.</p>
<p><strong>• Study the possibility of covering doula services under Medicaid.</strong> This change doesn&#8217;t require money, but requires adding some language in the budget to instruct the Secretary of Health and Human Resources to make recommendations for creating a doula benefit for women who use Medicaid.</p>
<p>Doulas aren&#8217;t doctors, but assist women through pregnancy, childbirth and post-partum. They can provide some medical support to women as well as <span style="font-weight: 400;">home services, like cleaning, cooking and child care.</span></p>
<p>In his administration&#8217;s listening tours, many people spoke positively of doulas, Northam said. But not everyone has access to them: According to various Virginia-based doula companies&#8217; websites, it can cost anywhere from $600 to more than $1,000 to hire a doula.</p>
<p><strong>And some others:</strong> Northam&#8217;s announcement included other proposals related to women&#8217;s health, including $4 million to bolster the <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/03/11/virginia-groups-urge-governor-to-veto-budget-language-they-say-will-eviscerate-contraception-program/" target="_blank">Long-Acting Reversible Contraception Program. </a>The program provides low-income women with contraception. Anti-abortion advocates have criticized the program, calling it a <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/03/11/virginia-groups-urge-governor-to-veto-budget-language-they-say-will-eviscerate-contraception-program/" target="_blank">&#8220;slush fund for Planned Parenthood.&#8221;</a></p>
<p>According to the Virginia Department of Health, LARCs can reduce the rate of unintended pregnancies and abortions. &#8220;It is time for us to allow women to decide if and when they want to start families,&#8221; Northam said.</p>
<p>He also included $660,000 more dollars for a program that helps mothers with addictions seek treatment; $879,000 for <a href="https://www.dmas.virginia.gov/files/links/3961/Press%20Release%20for%20Healthy%20Birthday%20Virginia%20(07.01.2019).pdf" target="_blank">continued work</a> on reducing racial inequities in maternal and infant health; and $400,000 for <a href="https://www.medicaid.gov/state-resource-center/downloads/spa-and-1915-waiver-processing/bundled-rate-payment-methodology.pdf" target="_blank">bundled payments</a>.</p>

(Ned Oliver/ Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This Black Friday and Cyber Monday, some online shoppers might notice they’re paying more state taxes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the first holiday season online shopping regulars might notice the tax, which stems from a <a href="https://www.aicpa.org/advocacy/state/south-dakota-v-wayfair.html" target="_blank">U.S. Supreme Court decision</a> that ruled states could collect sales tax from companies that don’t have physical locations in said states. Virginia lawmakers passed a law formalizing the tax during this year’s General Assembly session.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Big online retailers, like Amazon, were already remitting sales tax to the state, Virginia Secretary of Finance Aubrey Layne said. Since the law passed, 1,200 more businesses have signed up to pay their share, he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s hard to know how much this holiday season’s online shoppers will contribute to the state’s coffers because of the new tax, but finance officials said it’s already yielded more than expected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If we did not put this in, we would’ve been well behind last year,” Layne said. Virginia will make about $150 million more a year from the internet sales tax, he said.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_2910" class="wp-caption alignright" style="max-width:100%;width:150px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/house-appropriations-mugs-1.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-2910" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/house-appropriations-mugs-1-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Secretary of Finance Aubrey Layne. (Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p>It&#8217;s not all coming in just because the tax is in place. It also helps that more people are turning to online shopping, Layne said.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Virginia Commonwealth University marketing professor Katie Gilstrap, shoppers have moved online en masse, as evidenced by <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/stores-closing-in-2019-list-2019-3" target="_blank">large chain stores shutting down physical locations</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And times like Black Friday and the holiday season are “extreme” examples of people turning to online retailers to finish a shopping list.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Convenience is becoming more and more precious and as peoples’ time is becoming more and more scarce,” Gilstrap said.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_13295" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:300px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/BUDGET_PIECHART.png" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class=" td-modal-image wp-image-13295 size-medium" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/BUDGET_PIECHART-300x200.png" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/BUDGET_PIECHART-300x200.png 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/BUDGET_PIECHART-768x512.png 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/BUDGET_PIECHART-1024x683.png 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/BUDGET_PIECHART-696x464.png 696w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/BUDGET_PIECHART-1068x712.png 1068w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/BUDGET_PIECHART-630x420.png 630w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/BUDGET_PIECHART.png 1072w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  General fund revenue breakdown for the 2018-2020 budget.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginians’ online shopping habits help the state make up for stagnating sales at brick-and-mortar stores.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sales tax usually makes up about 16% of the state&#8217;s general revenue. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sales tax base has declined in recent years because more shoppers are spending money on non-taxable purchases. The internet sales tax has kept total sales tax revenue afloat, finance staff told lawmakers at the <a href="http://hac.virginia.gov/Committee/files/2019/11-19-19%20Retreat/I%20-%20Revenue%20and%20Budget%20presentation.pdf" target="_blank">House Appropriations retreat</a> earlier this month.</span></p>

Every Tuesday and Thursday evening, he’s back at the Wolf Creek Cherokee Museum in Henrico County for the tribe’s traditional drum circle, where men play drums and sing songs in the Cherokee language.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Price is welcomed around Virginia as a predominant chief and has a full schedule for <a href="https://nativeamericanheritagemonth.gov/" target="_blank">National Native American Heritage Month,</a> his tribe doesn’t have state recognition despite several attempts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State recognition doesn’t come with financial benefits like federal recognition does, but it’s a symbolic acknowledgement of the native population&#8217;s challenges and existence considering </span><a href="https://history.state.gov/milestones/1830-1860/indian-treaties" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">governments tried to systematically erase Native culture</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Price said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want respect,” he said. “<a href="https://www.virginia.org/virginiaindians/" target="_blank">Cherokee people</a> were always here, there were more Cherokee people than any other people at one time. And we want respect for my family … and all the troubles we had in the past.”</span></p>
<p>The Mattaponi and Pamunkey tribes are recognized by the state because of Colonial-era treaties. Others had a variety of paths to state recognition, like General Assembly action or judicial action.</p>
<p>Now, tribes like the Wolf Creek have to petition the Office of Secretary of the Commonwealth, which will consult an appointed Indian Advisory Board before approval.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Wolf Creek tribe is the <a href="https://www.commonwealth.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/secretary-of-the-commonwealth/indian-advisory-board/pdf/Wolf-Creek-Cherokee-Tribe---Letter-of-Intent.pdf" target="_blank">first to alert the state</a> they intend to seek recognition with that process, Secretary of the Commonwealth Kelly Thomasson said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If approved for state recognition, the Wolf Creek tribe would be the first Cherokee tribe to earn state recognition in Virginia, Price said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Wolf Creek’s application will be reviewed by the <a href="https://www.commonwealth.virginia.gov/virginia-indians/virginia-indian-advisory-board/" target="_blank">Indian Advisory Board</a>, which includes representatives from other Virginia tribes and non-Native members of state agencies like the Library of Virginia and Department of Education. </span></p>

<h3><b>Who are the Wolf Creek tribe?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Native tribes are blood-related family units. The Wolf Creek tribe is made up of people who had a blood relation to Price. Many of the tribe&#8217;s members</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> live in the mountains of Southwest Virginia or just east of Richmond, though they can be found all over the state, Price said. They count about 170 members but only have 69 on official tribal rolls.</span></p>
<p>According to the tribe&#8217;s letter to the state to start the process of gaining recognition, &#8220;the press of white settlement &#8230; forced many Cherokee to leave their homeland, some to travel the <a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part4/4h1567.html" target="_blank">Trail of Tears</a>, others to disperse themselves to other places across the vast continent &#8230; our own ancestors chose to retreat into the mountains &#8212; and into the area near Wolf Creek Mountain.&#8221;</p>
<p>Later, the tribe was erased from official documents by Virginia&#8217;s first registrar of Virginia&#8217;s Bureau of Vital Statistics and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/how-a-long-dead-white-supremacist-still-threatens-the-future-of-virginias-indian-tribes/2015/06/30/81be95f8-0fa4-11e5-adec-e82f8395c032_story.html" target="_blank">white supremacist</a>, Walter Plecker, the letter reads.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Wolf Creek tribe is in a better position than many other native tribes. Price has extensive documentation of the tribe’s history, ownership of some tribal land and enough members to keep traditions and language alive.</span></p>
<p>All of those can be used to evaluate the tribe&#8217;s application. The advisory board also asks for genealogy, proof the tribe is an active, organized group and has <a href="https://www.commonwealth.virginia.gov/virginia-indians/virginia-indian-advisory-board/tribal-recognition-criteria/" target="_blank">&#8220;retained a specific Indian tribal identity.&#8221; </a></p>
<p>When Price became chief, he moved the Wolf Creek Cherokee Museum to Henrico, where many members were living. There, <span style="font-weight: 400;">visitors can see what has been found on archaeological digs on nearby tribal land, photos of events and members and view traditional regalia. It&#8217;s also</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a gathering place for tribe members.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We teach our history because they do not teach it in schools,” Price said. “If we don’t do that, who else is going to do it? The state’s not going to do it. There’s a lot of hidden history.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every tribe operates differently. In Virginia, the Pamunkey tribe is pursuing a </span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/government/local/vp-nw-norfolk-casino-deal-update-20190910-poqv7hrxeffmlc7hj4dmlop424-story.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">waterfront casino</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> project in Norfolk. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When asked if the Wolf Creek tribe had similar economic development aspirations, Price said, “Not all Natives are the same. If they do their thing … that’s their thing. We want to just keep things simple.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chancellor Glenn DuBois, who is in charge of leading the community college system as it </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/04/02/virginias-community-colleges-expect-fewer-18-year-olds-to-enroll-by-2026-what-happens-after-that/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">anticipates a decline in enrollment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, said he thinks housing would draw more students to certain campuses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Northern Virginia is missing out in thousands, potentially millions, from international students,” he said at a board meeting Thursday. “No parent is going to send their child to America if they don’t know where they’re going to live.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Members of the Virginia Community College System State Board unanimously voted to allow the facilities department to issue a request for statements of interest and qualifications from companies that could design, build and manage student housing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They board added a condition that the responses should consider building Section 8 units into any proposal to provide housing for the system&#8217;s lowest income students. About <a href="https://research.schev.edu//enrollment/DistUnder_RepPop.asp" target="_blank">25% of all the students</a> enrolled in a community college in Virginia receive Pell Grants, one way to measure income level.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Responses will help the community college system gauge what housing, if any, they could offer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Community college campuses weren’t laid out to accommodate dorms, said board member Robin Sullenberger, but there may be creative solutions, like </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">re-purposing unused buildings as housing.</span></p>
<p>The board has no timeline on receiving responses or making decisions on moving forward with campus housing. <span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re kind of fishing to see what some entrepreneurs out there can provide,”  DuBois said. “I don’t think it makes sense for every college to provide housing but it could help on the access and retention side.”</span></p>

Members were pushing for more education funding, especially for teacher salaries. (Mechelle Hankerson/ Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>NORFOLK</strong> — To help lawmakers tackle a bipartisan goal of raising teacher pay, state budget staff tried to untangle for them exactly what the average teacher&#8217;s pay is in the state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The takeaway: There are different ways to calculate that number, but it’s clear some districts fall far below any of those averages while others easily exceed those estimations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers realized reaching a uniform average likely can’t be a one-size-fits-all approach. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think to look at an average for the state is going to be very misleading,” Del. Joe McNamara, R-Roanoke County, said at the House Appropriations Committee retreat Wednesday.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;In concept, as Virginians, we want to compensate our teachers, but what might make sense in Northern Virginia might not make sense in middle Virginia,&#8221; McNamara said.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Members of the Appropriations Committee, including <a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/government/elections/vp-nw-elx19-southside-delegate-wrap-20191106-kjqjv2vkwva5pfjzlkwxjhz2ye-story.html" target="_blank">those who lost their election bids</a>, were in Norfolk Tuesday and Wednesday to go over budget numbers and needs. Gov. Ralph Northam will present his budget proposal to lawmakers Dec. 17.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers and Northam have expressed <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/12/11/with-a-positive-economic-outlook-northam-proposes-teacher-pay-raise-more-money-for-school-construction/" target="_blank">a commitment</a> to raising teacher salaries to at least the national average. The teacher pay raise last year, which totaled 5% between the state and <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/01/16/some-school-districts-may-struggle-to-find-local-match-for-proposed-teacher-pay-raise/" target="_blank">local share</a>, still left some Virginia teachers below that average.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The percentage raise didn’t make up the gap for some of the state’s lowest-paid teachers, who make as little as $33,000 a year. Plus, the raise requires a local match, potentially causing <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/01/16/some-school-districts-may-struggle-to-find-local-match-for-proposed-teacher-pay-raise/" target="_blank">difficulty for cash-strapped municipalities. </a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are three calculations of teacher salaries, appropriations analyst Susan Hogge told lawmakers: There’s a simple average calculated by the Virginia Department of Education, a figure calculated by the National Education Association and a blended average that drives how much money school districts get in the state budget. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state&#8217;s &#8220;blended average&#8221; starts with simple averages and then applies a weighted factor to the divisions&#8217; elementary and secondary school salaries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Appropriations staff used that average to determine the average state-funded teacher salary is $49,457, almost $10,000 less than the national average of $59,539 used by the NEA. The organization estimates the average Virginia teacher salary is $52,340.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Across the state, budget staff found:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">59 school districts in all corners of the commonwealth reported salaries below the state average. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">19 of those districts, many in Southside and Southwest Virginia, had average salaries that ranged from $37,048 to $44,247 a year.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">73 school districts around the state pay above the state average.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">25 school districts pay above the higher NEA average state salary estimate of $52,340. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seven Northern Virginia districts pay higher than the national NEA average of $59,340: Manassas ($64,390), Loudoun ($65,678), Prince William ($65,902), Fairfax ($68,883), Alexandria ($74,738), Falls Church ($77,157) and Arlington ($78,617).</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 59 districts paying below the state’s average would need $80.9 million to catch up, Hogge said. The percentage change in spending ranges from 1-33% at those districts &#8211; a “huge lift” for some of them, Hogge said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To meet the NEA national average for the whole state, it would cost the state $480 million and localities would have to come up with $390 million. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Budget staff offered lawmakers two potential changes to help raise salaries &#8211; use the national average in the formula to determine state funding or provide a temporary incentive to increase pay to the national average across several budget cycles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both suggestions would require a local match.</span></p>

</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New changes to the formula that determines how much financial aid money colleges get from the state will redirect money to low-income students.<strong> </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The State Council of Higher Education for Virginia allocates aid money from the state to each public college and university, which is then responsible for awarding it to students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The council has used the same allocation formula for aid since 2005, which has caused state financial aid to shift from low-income recipients to those who attend high-cost schools and usually have higher family incomes. In 2018, SCHEV estimated, $12 million, or more than 7% of financial aid money the state allocated to four-year schools, was awarded to students who meet the definition of high income —</span> families of four making more than $98,400 a year.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://schev.edu/docs/default-source/Reports-and-Studies/2019/financialaidreport102019.pdf" target="_blank">The new model</a>, approved by the state council in October, will start to reverse that trend.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The shift of financial aid awards to higher-income students was slow, said Lee Andes, assistant director for financial aid at SCHEV.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I<span style="font-weight: 400;"> don&#8217;t know there was an epiphany moment as much as a gradual concern,&#8221; he said. I</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">n the 1992-1993 school year, low-income students received 94% of state-funded financial aid. Low-income students come from families with annual household incomes of less than $49,200 for a family of four, according to SCHEV definitions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By 2017-2018, low-income students got 66% of state financial aid, a change attributed to SCHEV’s allocation model.</span></p>
<blockquote class="td_quote_box td_box_right">
<h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Forms of financial aid</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">College students can get financial aid from the federal and state government that doesn’t require repayment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Federally, middle-class and low-income students can receive <a href="https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/types/grants-scholarships/pell" target="_blank">Pell Grants</a>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, in-state students at public schools can receive several grants, like the <a href="https://www.schev.edu/index/tuition-aid/financialaid/state-student-aid/virginia-commonwealth-award-program" target="_blank">Commonwealth Award</a> the Virginia Guaranteed Assistance Program (<a href="https://www.schev.edu/index/tuition-aid/financialaid/state-student-aid/virginia-guaranteed-assistance-program" target="_blank">VGAP</a>). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For students who opt for private school, the similar <a href="https://www.schev.edu/index/tuition-aid/financialaid/state-student-aid/tuition-assistance-grant-program" target="_blank">Virginia Tuition Assistance Grant</a> provides some aid based on how much money the General Assembly approves for the program and how many students apply for it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are other forms of financial aid, like scholarships that can come from community groups, businesses or the school. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Student loans can be taken out through the government (and then managed by a private loan company) or from private loan companies, like Sallie Mae or a commercial bank.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new model changes how the state estimates a student’s <a href="https://fafsa.ed.gov/help/fftoc01g.htm" target="_blank">estimated family contribution</a> (EFC). The old formula assumed some students could contribute small amounts of money from summer jobs or other sources. The state considered that part of the EFC for the state even if the Federal Application For Student Aid (FAFSA) estimated a person’s EFC to be zero.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andes said the single most important change SCHEV made to the formula is considering the average cost of attendance among state schools instead of individual costs of attendance. The old formula rewarded schools with higher costs with more financial aid funding, Andes said, but it&#8217;s likely most students at high-cost institutions don&#8217;t have the highest need, as a higher cost naturally discourages middle and low-income students. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;By overestimating a student’s financial strength, the funding models undercount a student’s unmet need,&#8221; SCHEV wrote <a href="https://schev.edu/docs/default-source/Reports-and-Studies/2019/financialaidreport102019.pdf" target="_blank">in a report last month.</a></p>
<p>According to SCHEV&#8217;s data, Norfolk State and Virginia State universities have the highest percentage of students with EFCs of zero, at 56% and 51%, respectively. SCHEV estimates that from the number of students who complete a FAFSA. Virginia Military Institute and Christopher Newport University have the lowest percentage of students with an EFC of zero (11% and 12%).</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another change to the allocation model will consider how much money the average low- or middle-income student typically needs at a school and how many of those students attend an institution.</span></p>
<p>Every student with a zero EFC is now assigned a maximum value of $300 that could be awarded to the school for financial aid, said Tom Allison, a senior associate for finance and innovation at SCHEV. As students&#8217; EFC amounts increase at an institution, that $300 will decrease. It functions like a bonus for having low- and middle-income students.</p>
<p>&#8220;Institutions wanted to know how they can get more financial aid dollars and here&#8217;s how they can do it: Enroll more low-income students with low EFCs,&#8221; Allison said.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;">The changes will affect some of the <a href="https://research.schev.edu/enrollment/E2_Report.asp" target="_blank">state’s largest schools</a>, George Mason and Virginia Commonwealth universities, the most. </span></p>
<p>In the next two-year budget cycle, the new formula would give GMU $10.3 million more for state financial aid, for a total of $66.4 million for state financial aid. VCU will get $6.9 million more for a total of $70.4 million over two years.</p>
<p>All of the funding is dependent upon the General Assembly&#8217;s approval. In total, the changes would require $45 million more for financial aid funding and is a significant portion of the <a href="https://schev.edu/index/reports/schev-reports/2019-reports/2020-22-budget-recommendations" target="_blank">$212 million budget increase SCHEV has recommended to the governor.</a></p>

(By Cnucaptain - Own work, CC BY-SA 4.0, Wikimedia Commons) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ETTRICK — To fulfill Amazon’s need for workers with advanced technology skills as well as those of other tech employers, the state is investing $1 billion over 20 years at Virginia colleges and universities</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state will spend the money on schools that have committed to producing a certain number of graduates in computer science-related fields. Although the effort is driven largely by the needs of Amazon&#8217;s future headquarters, the state already had a shortage of tech workers, Gov. Ralph Northam said Thursday at Virginia State University, one of the schools receiving part of the funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Graduates will fill jobs at hundreds of companies around Virginia, including Amazon,” Northam said. “This helps our tech business of all sizes and strengthens our ability to support the rapidly growing tech industry.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The $1 billion investment is intended to produce 31,000 more graduates with computer science-related degrees at 11 public colleges over 20 years. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;Strategic state investments in talent and infrastructure will ensure that Amazon’s chosen Virginia location provides a fertile environment to sustainably support HQ2’s rapid growth as well as the growth of other tech employers,&#8221; Virginia <a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/governor-of-virginia/images/AVEDP_NOVA_R1_Partnership-Proposal.pdf" target="_blank">wrote in its pitch</a> for the highly-sought Amazon HQ2 project.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The schools made individual agreements with the state to produce specific numbers of computer science-related graduates:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Tech: 16,235</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Christopher Newport University: 392</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Old Dominion University: 765</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">George Mason University: 7,605</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia State University: 186</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">James Madison University: 467</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">University of Virginia: 3,416</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Radford University: 394</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Commonwealth University: 722</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">William &amp; Mary: 930</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Norfolk State University: 126</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year, schools will get a share of $16.6 million included in the state budget. Schools can use the money for almost anything, from hiring and training staff to building new facilities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Northam emphasized that the chosen schools are meant to capture a diverse range of students, including historically black colleges.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The 11 colleges are both large and small, so if you&#8217;re a student, whatever kind of institution you are seeking, you can find a (computer science program),&#8221; he said. &#8220;I want everyone in Virginia to have the opportunity for a good education and a good job.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VSU is already one of the nation’s top producers of black computer scientists and the leading HBCU in the state when it comes to computer science degrees, according to University President </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Makola Abdullah. VSU had 60 computer science-related graduates last year, <a href="https://research.schev.edu//Completions/C16_DataSciences.asp" target="_blank">according to SCHEV</a>. Norfolk State, the only other public HBCU, had 59.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right now, computer science degrees make up about 2% of the total degrees awarded at Virginia’s public four-year schools, according to the State Council for Higher Education of Virginia. The same number of graduates get degrees like accounting and political science.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://research.schev.edu//Completions/C16_DataSciences.asp" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to SCHEV</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, GMU and Tech produce the most bachelor’s degree in subjects like computer science, information sciences, math, statistics and computer engineering. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last school year, 1,032 GMU graduates received one of those degrees and 1,148 students at Tech did the same.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It means the policies and proposals that have floundered under a Republican majority stand a chance, as long as it gets the final approval of Gov. Ralph Northam’s signature.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think Virginians spoke yesterday,” Northam said in a public cabinet meeting held the morning after elections. “They like the progress we’ve made in the last two years. I believe we have a unique opportunity in the next two years.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Northam discussed a few policy areas he was all in on and some supported by more progressive members of his party that he appears less excited about.</span></p>
<h2><b>Guns</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Northam said he said he thinks Democratic voters were especially incensed over Republicans’ failure to pass gun violence prevention laws after the Virginia Beach mass shooting. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">He’s open to whatever legislation comes his way, but said he’s especially focused on eight policies he set forth for the <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/06/04/northam-hopes-to-ratchet-up-pressure-on-gop-but-some-advocates-see-little-hope-for-special-session-on-gun-control/" target="_blank">special legislative session</a> he called in June to address gun violence in the state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They’re pieces of legislation that will save lives, they’re also pieces of legislation that Virginians agree with,” Northam said. “We&#8217;ll at least start with those.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His list:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Universal background checks</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A ban on weapons with high-capacity magazines, suppressors and bump stocks</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reinstating Virginia’s one-handgun-a-month rule</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Requiring reporting of lost and stolen firearms within 24 hours</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">An extreme risk protection, or red flag, law</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tougher penalties for allowing children under 18 to access to loaded firearms</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Allowing municipalities to “enact any firearms ordinances that are stricter than state law”</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prohibiting anyone subject to a protective order from possessing firearms</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of those proposals died in committee during the regular session and were referred to the <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/08/21/in-a-statehouse-thats-debated-guns-for-decades-testimony-treads-familiar-ground/" target="_blank">State Crime Commission</a>. Lawmakers are due back in Richmond Nov. 18 to reconsider the legislation, but Northam isn’t holding his breath that anything will come of it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Here we are in November,” he said. &#8220;Right around the corner is January and we&#8217;ll be back in session so I suspect most of the work will be done in January.&#8221;</span></p>

<h2><strong>Confederate monuments</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Northam reiterated said he’s ready to let localities decide what to do with their Confederate monuments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The localities are in the best position to make that decision,” he said. “Obviously there needs to be a change in the code to do that. I suspect legislation will be introduced to move in that direction.”</span></p>
<p>The issue is playing out courts across the state, including <a href="https://www.dailyprogress.com/news/local/charlottesville-to-ask-va-supreme-court-to-settle-issue-of/article_56eb987b-6415-56f9-8638-c377f53a371f.html" target="_blank">Charlottesville</a> and <a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/government/local/vp-nw-confederate-monument-norfolk-remove-20191022-2nlkbzm3jjedneo6tqd7omluwq-story.html" target="_blank">Norfolk</a>.</p>
<h2><strong>Labor policy</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Northam isn’t biting on policy ideas from younger, more progressive members of his party.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said he doesn’t deal with “hypotheticals,” like some members’ calls to repeal the state’s long-standing Right to Work law, which prohibits unions from, for instance, making dues mandatory in organized workplaces.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic Socialist Del. Lee Carter in Manassas is the lead voice in pushing for that repeal. He <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+sum+HB1806" target="_blank">filed legislation</a> for it and </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/01/29/a-march-not-a-strike-thousands-rally-for-virginia-education-funding/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a bill that would allow</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> government employees, like teachers, to strike without punishment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/plus/schapiro-doing-a-job-on-labor-is-old-school-va/article_bc6f2d5b-1976-5dc2-b759-34138c76e363.html" target="_blank">Older Democrats</a> have balked at Carter’s suggestion to repeal the Right to Work law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Northam, who enjoyed success as a state senator and whose moderate politics were hailed as a key to winning his gubernatorial race, didn’t say what he would do if those sorts of things made it to him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s a hypothetical question,” he said. “I don’t deal with hypothetical questions, I deal with what’s put on my desk.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carter’s bills languished in committees this year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Northam said he’s focused on “realities,” like helping workers by making sure people get training for available jobs and raising the minimum wage.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Minimum wage</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Northam isn’t ready to say how high the state’s minimum wage should go or how fast it should get there. He’s only willing to say it needs to more than $7.25 an hour.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think all of us can hopefully agree there’s no way you can support yourself or your family on $7.25 an hour,” he said. Past proposals from Democrats to raise the minimum wage have “fallen on deaf ears,” according to Northam.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this year’s General Assembly session, legislation from Sen. Rosalyn Dance, D-Petersburg, would have incrementally raised minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2021.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Marijuana</strong></h2>
<p>As part of his larger criminal justice reform effort, Northam is ready to decriminalize marijuana.</p>
<p>Decriminalization isn&#8217;t the same as legalization. He didn&#8217;t mention legalization, which would allow recreational marijuana use.</p>
<p>Northam&#8217;s version of loosening marijuana-related punishment would make violations related to the drug a civil offense instead of criminal &#8212; like getting a traffic ticket instead of going to jail.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/gov-northam-renews-calls-to-decriminalize-marijuana-in-speech-to-general-assembly/" target="_blank">supported decriminalization</a> since his 2017 gubernatorial run and several lawmakers who support it have said <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/10/17/a-democratic-takeover-could-make-virginia-more-marijuana-friendly-but-legalization-may-still-be-years-away/" target="_blank">they expect traction</a> on the issue with a Democratic majority.</p>

The slips of paper were placed inside old film cannisters and drawn from the bowl to decide a tied race between the two candidates. Yancey's name was pulled from the bowl and Republicans retained control of the Virginia House of Delegates.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That will be formally declared Nov. 18, when the state Board of Elections certifies all elections. Before that, local elected officials need to count write-in votes and deal with any recounts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So what happens between now and certification? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">First comes the </span>canvass.<span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Local elections officials, led by the general registrar, will meet today to tally votes. That count can last until Nov. 12, the last day for people who had to vote with a provisional ballot because of voter I.D. issues to provide an I.D.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year, the canvass might take longer in some places because of </span>write-ins<span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p>The most famous write-in campaign this year was carried out by Del. Nick Freitas, R-Culpeper, who missed a deadline on his paperwork and didn&#8217;t make the ballot. <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/11/05/its-a-free-pen-in-culpeper-delegates-write-in-effort-gets-literal/" target="_blank">Freitas appears to have kept his seat. </a></p>
<p>Another write-in campaign, mounted by supporters of ousted GOP Del. Chris Peace of Hanover, who lost his primary to Republican Scott Wyatt in a bitter and contested process,<a href="https://www.vpap.org/electionresults/20191105/election-9855/" target="_blank"> appears to have fallen short</a>.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Write-in options are only counted if they add up to 10% of the total votes cast. In some local races this year, there are no candidates running so write-ins have to be looked at one-by-one no matter what.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Electoral boards will have to go through write-in entries and decide which variations of names count as a vote for a specific person. That count could last as long as the canvass, which is open to the public and political observers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the count is done and if things seem a little too close to call, candidates can ask for a </span>recount.</p>
<h2><strong>Heading for recounts? </strong></h2>
<p>Right now, at least four races across the state appear to be within the margins for a recount. In Virginia Beach, Republican Del. Chris Stolle, who trailed Democrat Nancy Guy, and Democratic senate candidate Cheryl Turpin, who appears to have come up a few hundred votes short in her race with Republican Jen Kiggans, may be able to ask for recounts. Turpin&#8217;s campaign said it&#8217;s too early to know if she will pursue a recount. Stolle, who could not be reached by the Mercury for comment, told <a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/government/elections/vp-nw-elx-recount-virginia-beach-leg-20191106-pjvytblphzdmhgz2e6yvr6dyiq-story.html" target="_blank">The Virginian-Pilot</a> he was &#8220;confident&#8221; he would win in a recount.</p>
<p>Near Emporia, Republican candidate Otto Wachsmann said he would be waiting for the local canvass to end before deciding on whether to pursue a recount in his race against Del. Roslyn Tyler. Democrat Larry Barnett in Chesterfield said he was doing the same in the contest with Republican Del. Roxann Robinson.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia doesn’t have automatic recounts and there are <a href="https://www.elections.virginia.gov/media/formswarehouse/recount/officials/VirginiaElectionRecountsContests-11-4-15.pdf" target="_blank">certain conditions</a> that have to be met before an apparent loser is granted one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The difference in the number of votes cast for the winner and loser must be less than 1% of the total. General Assembly candidates must notify the clerk of their respective chamber for a recount and it has to be after the Board of Elections has certified the results from Election Day. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recounts in races with write-in candidates have one main difference: The difference between the apparent winner and loser can be up to 5% of total votes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For referendums and bonds (of which there were 20 such questions in 13 localities across the state this year), the difference between votes has to be less than 50 or less than 1% of the total votes cast- whichever is a bigger number.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, 50 people qualified to vote on the referendum may petition for a recount.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In elections involving people, the recount doesn’t cost the person money if the difference between the two candidates is half a percent or less. Localities will pay for local races and the state would pay for House of Delegates or State Senate races.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the difference is between half a percent to 1%, the candidate requesting the new count has to pay.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cost of that process depends on several factors, including voter turnout and the size of the locality, said Chris Piper, commissioner of elections.</span></p>
<p>And if that ends in a tie,<span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/government/virginia/article_15b120de-e515-53ae-b000-297fe11a5d62.html" target="_blank">Virginia’s infamous bowl</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> could make a reappearance and the winner will be determined by drawing, like <a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/government/virginia/article_cdda6053-f653-5ce1-9ad0-5123990c5374.html" target="_blank">Newport News’ 94th District</a> race in 2017. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In that race, anyway, the bowl won&#8217;t be necessary since </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrat Shelly Simonds <a href="https://www.vpap.org/electionresults/20191105/election-9852/" target="_blank">apparently cruised to victory</a> over incumbent Republican Del. David Yancey. </span></p>

(Parker Michels-Boyce/ for the Virginia Mercury)</p><p>While voting got off to a mostly uneventful start across the state, there was some déjà vu from the 2017 legislative elections in one county.</p>
<p>In Stafford County, some early-morning voters in six precincts received the wrong ballots. State elections officials are still investigating the problem, but it appears to have affected voters in House Districts 2, 28 and 88, said Commissioner of Elections Chris Piper in a morning briefing.</p>
<p>House District 28 had a <a href="https://wtop.com/virginia/2018/01/exclusive-va-knew-voting-wrong-house-districts-issues-2017-election/" target="_blank">significant wrong-ballot problem in 2017</a>. Democratic candidate Josh Cole lost the race to Republican Del. Bob Thomas by 73 votes. About 150 voters were assigned to incorrect precincts and voted in the wrong election.</p>
<p>Cole was running again this year in a competitive race against Republican Scott Milde. This time, though, Cole <a href="https://www.vpap.org/electionresults/20191105/election-9788/" target="_blank">appeared to have pulled ahead</a>.</p>
<p>The state is not sure how many people were impacted or how it happened this year. The problem was fixed quickly, but voters who already submitted their vote on an incorrect ballot won&#8217;t be able to recast their vote, Piper said.</p>
<p>Democratic Del. Jennifer Carroll Foy defended her seat from Republican Heather Mitchell in House District 2 and Republican Del. Mark Cole appeared to have cruised to reelection over Democrat Jess Foster in the 88th district.</p>
<p>The state was also monitoring issues with at least one polling place in Richmond running out of ballots, Piper said. The polling place included a split precinct, which requires more than one ballot. The local registrar&#8217;s office sent too many ballots for one precinct to the polling place and not enough for the other.</p>
<p>The local office had more ballots at the site within 15 minutes, Piper said.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nbc12.com/2019/11/05/election-day/" target="_blank">NBC12 reported </a>about 40 people left the polling place without voting because of the lapse.</p>

(NBC 12)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Compared to past cycles, the Virginia GOP is running a more diverse slate of candidates for this year&#8217;s General Assembly elections that includes 13 women who are not incumbents, two black men and one Asian man.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there’s still work that can, and should, be done on that front, some of the candidates said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The party needs to have a tough conversation about where they want to be,” said Garrison Coward, the young, black chief operating officer of a data analytics firm who is running against Democratic Del. Dawn Adams to represent parts of the city of Richmond and Chesterfield and Henrico counties. “They should rally behind everyone and anyone who wants to run on our side.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Historically, <a href="https://www.people-press.org/2018/03/20/1-trends-in-party-affiliation-among-demographic-groups/" target="_blank">black Americans have favored Democratic</a> candidates and more recently in Virginia, <a href="https://apnews.com/6021e1c6253f43d4a38262bd2dcc6314" target="_blank">white suburban women</a> have also flocked to Democrats.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The last several years have really been marked by rapidly increasing diversity in terms of people being elected to office,” said Stephen Farnsworth, political scientist at the University of Mary Washington. “The Democratic candidates who prevailed in 2017 House of Delegates races, specifically in the suburbs, made the House much more diverse. The Republican Party is trying to catch up to provide candidates who aren’t just white males.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/democrats-poised-to-make-significant-gains-in-virginia-legislature/2017/11/07/9c2f4d24-c401-11e7-aae0-cb18a8c29c65_story.html" target="_blank">That year</a>, the Democratic Party welcomed the first openly transgender delegate, first openly lesbian delegate, first Asian American woman and the first two Latinas to the General Assembly. That&#8217;s in addition to 18 black members between the two chambers who are all Democrats.</span></p>
<p>But even if Republicans had an equally diverse roster this year, it&#8217;s unlikely to help them on Election Day for now, Farnsworth said.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Donald Trump is a key factor in a lot of races around the country and around Virginia and it’s very hard for a Republican candidate — no matter what their policy positions are, no matter what they look like — to get (people) out from under the orientation for voting for Democrats if they don’t like Trump and voting for Republicans if they do,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coward, whose campaign focuses on a promise to lower taxes, support affordable health care and create good-paying jobs, said both parties need to move away from “identity politics” and welcome people who want to run, regardless of what they look like.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Folks are waking up, I believe, and they’re becoming more party-agnostic,” he said. “People nowadays are more focused on results.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shannon Kane, a Republican running in Virginia Beach’s 21st District against Democratic Del. Kelly Fowler, said her party could use more women, especially in south Hampton Roads. There are two other Republican women running in that area: Jen Kiggans in the 7th Senate District seat vacated by Frank Wagner and Elizabeth Lankford, who is running against Sen. Lynnwood Lewis to represent part of Norfolk and all of the Eastern Shore.</span></p>
<p>In the 2019 General Assembly session, there were 37 women between both chambers and parties. Eight of those women were Republicans.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I consider myself a common-sense person,” Kane said. “I try to listen to both sides and I think my city council background really opened me up to listening to all angles of things.” Kane <a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/government/local/article_55b54a92-5235-11e9-a7a3-e35778696737.html" target="_blank">served on the Virginia Beach City Council</a> for </span>five years before resigning in March when she moved out of the council district she represented.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She wanted to run for higher office in part because of Virginia Beach’s recurring severe flooding, but also wants to see increased teacher pay and see the state do more to support businesses owned by minorities and women. </span></p>
<p>Speaker of the House Kirk Cox, R-Colonial Heights, donated $82,000 to Kane&#8217;s campaign through his leadership political action committee in October and House Majority Leader Todd Gilbert, R-Shenandoah, pitched in $25,000, according to the <a href="https://www.vpap.org/committees/331085/raw-reports-in/?schedule=A" target="_blank">Virginia Public Access Project.</a></p>
<p>Kane said that&#8217;s one way the party could encourage more diverse candidates to run for office — making sure they have support.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t know if it’s the party that can make people step up,” Kane said. “The politics are tough. It’s not something that I ever thought I would want to do.”</span></p>

Ralph Northam (left) and Christine Harris, director of the Office of Humanities in the Department of Education at the first meeting of the Virginia Commission on African American History Education in the Commonwealth (Mechelle Hankerson/The Virginia Mercury)</p><p>CHARLOTTESVILLE — The commission charged with making recommendations to create a more accurate and complete representation of black history in state education guidelines plans to finish its work by the time the state makes changes to the Standards of Learning again.</p>
<p>The 34-member Virginia Commission on African American History Education in the Commonwealth started about 10 months of work Monday at the University of Virginia.</p>
<p>Gov. Ralph Northam established the <a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/executive-actions/EO-39-Establishment-of-the-Commission-on-African-American-History-Education-in-the-Commonwealth.pdf" target="_blank">commission via executive order</a> in August, the same day he spoke at an event to mark the arrival of the first slaves at Fort Monroe more than 400 years ago.</p>
<p>Northam said in the order that black history in Virginia is &#8220;difficult, complex and often untold.&#8221; At the commission&#8217;s meeting, he said black history in schools is often &#8220;inadequate&#8221; and &#8220;inaccurate,&#8221; a <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/05/01/virginia-explained-how-virginias-history-textbooks-are-vetted/" target="_blank">concern that has been echoed by educators.</a></p>
<p>&#8220;The commonwealth has long been known for its rigorous academic standards, including its history and social science standards of learning, first established in 1995,&#8221; <a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/executive-actions/EO-39-Establishment-of-the-Commission-on-African-American-History-Education-in-the-Commonwealth.pdf" target="_blank">the order reads</a>. &#8220;Virginia&#8217;s standards must be inclusive of African American history and provide opportunities for students to engage deeply, drawing connections to its relevance in our contemporary communities.&#8221;</p>
<p>The commission isn’t rewriting Standards of Learning or other curriculum guidelines, but will make suggestions for what to change, add or take out. Some changes, like fixing inaccurate information, will be sent to Superintendent of Public Instruction James Lane, who could approve the change and instruct school systems to observe the amendment immediately.</p>
<p>A report of recommendations should be completed in time for the department and the Board of Education’s regularly scheduled curriculum and standards review.</p>
<p>“I think it’s fair to say after what happened in February in the Commonwealth of Virginia and also the fact that we’ve just commemorated the 400 years of history in our commonwealth at Fort Monroe, that there is a level of awareness regarding race and equity that I certainly have never seen in my lifetime,” Northam said at the meeting, alluding to <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/02/02/in-his-own-words-northam-describes-moonwalking-in-blackface-denies-appearing-in-kkk-photo/" target="_blank">the photo</a> of a person in blackface and another in a Ku Klux Klan costume found on his medical school yearbook earlier this year. (Northam at first admitted he was in the photo, then denied he was either of the people shown.)</p>
<p>Northam said one of the most pressing issues he hopes the commission will address is casting the end of slavery as the end of oppression for black people. The Jim Crow Era, Massive Resistance and mass incarceration have followed, he said</p>
<p>“My perception is that when we talk about black oppression, I think a lot of us need to understand that concept a lot better and this needs to start with the education of our children,&#8221; Northam said. &#8220;Black oppression is alive and well today, it’s just in a different form.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cassandra Newby-Alexander, a former teacher and current dean at Norfolk State University, recalled the teaching material she encountered in the classroom.</p>
<p>“I would read it and I would not read anything about slavery,” Newby-Alexander said. “I would read it and read nothing about the contributions of African Americans except in a token manner.”</p>
<p>Native American history, Newby-Alexander recalled, disappeared after history books acknowledged Pocahontas’ death.</p>
<p>The Board of Education has undertaken the process of revamping professional development standards, which will dovetail with another one of the group’s goals &#8212; teachers&#8217; professional development.</p>
<p>It is likely teachers will need to shift from teaching to standardized tests to more conceptual and “culturally responsive” teaching, said Christonya Brown, the history curriculum coordinator for the state.</p>
<p>Northam, who has no education background, offered a humble suggestion: Consider thematic instead of chronological teaching and utilize Virginia&#8217;s numerous historic sites as a teaching tool.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get our students out of the classrooms and &#8230; to see and feel our 400 years of history,&#8221; he explained to the commission.</p>

(Ned Oliver/ Virginia Mercury 2019) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In some competitive races around the state, Democratic candidates are promising to restore funding for public schools.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it’s not a small — or cheap — task.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, the state Board of Education recommended new standards for public schools that would require <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/07/29/virginias-board-of-education-is-considering-recommendations-to-force-the-hand-of-the-general-assembly/" target="_blank">close to a billion more dollars</a> a year if lawmakers chose to fully fund those standards. Which means if Democratic candidates are serious about delivering on their promise to fully fund education, they’ll have to find that money in the state budget.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Educators in some of the most competitive General Assembly races have a range of ideas on how to better fund education, from vague commitments to redirecting some state revenue streams back into the classroom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The answer is simple: A budget is a set of priorities and properly funding our children&#8217;s schools should be at the top of our list of priorities. I am focused on investing in education so that we ensure that all children are given a fair shot, regardless of their zip code,” said Ghazala Hashmi, a Democrat challenging Republican Sen. Glen Sturtevant in a district that includes part of the city of Richmond and its southern suburbs. Hashmi is the director of the Center for Excellence in Teaching and Learning at J. Sargeant Reynolds Community College.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia decreased education funding during the Great Recession, a decision that impacted most facets of public schools, from staffing levels to maintenance schedules. Money hasn’t been restored to pre-recession levels and many funding metrics, like teacher salaries and money for specialized instructors in Virginia schools, have fallen below the national average.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We need to be realistic, it’s not a one-year fix,” said Schuyler VanValkenburg, D-Henrico, who is a high school teacher. “The frustrating thing is that there’s been a complete lack of will over the last 10 years.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislature, under almost complete Republican rule since the recession except for four years of a Democratic majority in the state Senate from 2008 to 2012, has made relatively small increases in education funding while shifting the cost of education to localities.</span></p>
<p>Total education funding in the state has increased since the recession — it was about $30 billion in 2009 and about $39 billion in the most recent budget. But the amount of money the state pitches in has fallen, according to <a href="https://www.thecommonwealthinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-Statewide-K12-Public-Schools-in-Virginia.pdf" target="_blank">The Commonwealth Institute</a>. When the recession hit, the state covered about 45% of education costs, with localities covering 48.6% and federal funding making up the remainder. Localities carried about 51% of the cost burden in the school year that ended in 2018, with the state share falling to 41.6 percent.</p>
<p>That can create discrepancies in school funding, since not all cities and counties have the same revenue available to make up the difference.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even with the total increase in funding, the state has regularly fallen short of what the Board of Education considers full funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The General Assembly can codify and fund the Standards of Quality as the board recommends them, or change them to fit what they’re willing to fund, as they have in the past. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 1984, the General Assembly, with Democratic majorities in both chambers that year, codified the standards into state law, meaning lawmakers could change them and that those changes trump the Board of Education&#8217;s recommendations. The standards as revised would then be what lawmakers were constitutionally required to fund instead of the board&#8217;s suggestions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since 1988, the General Assembly has passed 197 bills changing the Standards of Quality, &#8220;the overwhelming majority of which were unrelated to the SOQs as prescribed by the Board of Education,&#8221; the board wrote in a resolution passed with the new standards.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaker of the House Kirk Cox, R-Colonial Heights, was a high school government teacher for 30 years before retiring. He&#8217;s made calls for increased funding for higher education and supported the 5% teacher pay raise during the last General Assembly session.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We have held the line on bureaucracy in education, so that we can prioritize funding to teachers and the classroom,&#8221; he wrote in a statement. &#8220;The General Assembly is returning 40% of all lottery proceeds back to school divisions with no strings attached. I am committed to continuing that success with smart investments such as raising teacher salaries to the national average.”</p>

<div>Shelly Simonds, a Democrat running in Newport News against Republican Del. David Yancey for a second time, has two priorities when it comes to education: more guidance counselors and more funding for school building maintenance.</div>
<div></div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In <a href="https://twitter.com/nowthisnews/status/1184545292986662912" target="_blank">a digital ad by NowThis</a>, a progressive youth-focused organization, Simonds stands in front of boarded-up doors at Huntington Middle School in southern Newport News.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Unfortunately the school board had to close (the school) in 2017 due to overwhelming maintenance needs. The condition of the school just couldn&#8217;t handle students anymore,” Simonds said in the video. She’s been on the Newport News School Board since 2012 and was a part-time Spanish teacher in the system until 2009, when her school had to cut her position because of budget constraints.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is personal to me,&#8221; she said in an interview. &#8220;One of the reasons why I&#8217;m running now is to protect education funding to be sure that we never balance the budget of the state of Virginia on the backs of the students and teachers.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simonds said she&#8217;s not sure exactly how to restore funding and promised to work with Republicans in the NowThis ad. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her initial thought is to direct tax revenue from a new internet sales tax to education, an idea shared by Karen Mallard, a Democratic candidate running against Republican Del. Glenn Davis in Virginia Beach.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+oth+SB1083F161+PDF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Impact statements for the legislation establishing the tax, </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">which passed earlier this year, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">estimated it would net the state about $860 million over five years, well short of what the new Standards of Quality would require over that time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mallard also suggested re-routing money from Lottery proceeds that currently pay for programs that used to be paid for in the state’s general fund. Lottery proceeds come from game sales and it has been used to make up for the cuts lawmakers have made in the budget, Mallard said, leaving increasing </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">lottery proceeds to try to plug the hole. But full education funding requires more general fund money too, she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lottery money pays for a number of programs. In the current budget, it’s primarily used to increase the per-pupil funding amount, which has fallen since the recession. State funding for </span><a href="https://www.thecommonwealthinstitute.org/2018/10/04/k-12-funding-trends-at-a-glance-statewide-and-in-all-132-school-divisions/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">per-pupil money has fallen 9%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> since the recession despite the Lottery’s help.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also pays for some class reduction measures and the state’s preschool initiative. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VanValkenburg said there are a number of ways Virginia could restore full education funding: Redirect money from ineffective business subsidies to the education budget, looking at “tax reform in a way to raise revenues without hurting households,” he said and changing the education funding formula that determines how much state money districts get.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s not a quick fix, but we haven’t even been trying,” VanValkenburg said. “We need to chip away and get back in the game.</span></p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>The commission charged with finding racial inequities in state laws plans to be done with most of its work shortly after Election Day.</p>
<p>Gov. Ralph Northam announced he was creating the commission in June and named the members in September. The move followed <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/newsboys-shoe-shiners-and-doormen-will-now-have-to-be-paid-at-least-minimum-wage/" target="_blank">legislation in the last General Assembly session</a> carried by Sen. Lionel Spruill, D-Chesapeake, and Del. Marcia Price, D-Newport News, that removed jobs historically held by black people from the list of positions allowed to be paid less than minimum wage.</p>
<p>&#8220;Racial discrimination is rooted in many of the laws that have historically governed our commonwealth — identifying and eliminating racist and discriminatory language will help make Virginia more equitable for all who live and work here,&#8221; Northam wrote in a statement announcing members of the commission.</p>
<p>Northam&#8217;s creation of the commission came about five months after <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/why-does-gov-northams-yearbook-page-include-blackface-and-kkk-robes/" target="_blank">a photo of a person in blackface</a> and another in a Ku Klux Klan costume was found on his medical school yearbook page. Northam admitted, then denied he was in the photo, but said he would spend the remainder of his term <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/va-gov-ralph-northam-says-he-wants-to-focus-rest-of-his-term-on-racial-equity/2019/02/09/2a739b20-2c76-11e9-984d-9b8fba003e81_story.html" target="_blank">dedicated to racial equity</a>.</p>
<p>The Commission to Examine Racial Inequity in Virginia law, made up of almost all attorneys, agreed that explicit mentions of &#8220;white&#8221; or &#8220;colored&#8221; people in the state&#8217;s Acts of Assembly should be recommended for repeal.</p>
<p>They are looking for similar references in health, financial, voting, housing and criminal laws.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the group added several old laws from the early 1900s to their list that explicitly barred black people from traveling on trains with white people. There were several versions of the law, with some specifically for certain rail companies, meaning each would have to be repealed separately.</p>
<p>Some cases aren&#8217;t as simple as finding a specific word. In one example discussed at the group&#8217;s Wednesday meeting, former Richmond Commonwealth&#8217;s Attorney Mike Herring suggested removing a provision that allowed Dickenson County to purchase buses to transfer students to a specific school.</p>
<p>While it didn&#8217;t mention black students specifically, Herring said he was concerned it was a way of implementing Massive Resistance, allowing white students to avoid going to school with black students.</p>
<p>By Nov. 7, the group plans to have a list of state laws and regulations that they think should be repealed.</p>
<p>Jerrauld Jones, a Norfolk judge and father to Democratic Del. Jay Jones, said the mechanism and breadth of their recommendations could depend on which party takes a majority in the legislature Nov. 5.</p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before the state’s top elected officials called on lawmakers to address what they called Virginia’s gun violence emergency over the summer, Attorney General Mark Herring decided not to reapply for a federal grant to pay for a long-running violence reduction program in the state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead, the Virginia Association of Chiefs of Police is overseeing the roughly $665,000 grant which will continue to be used to support community outreach efforts to reduce violence. Herring&#8217;s office is overseeing a <a href="https://external.ojp.usdoj.gov/selector/awardDetail?awardNumber=2018-BJ-BX-0007&amp;fiscalYear=2018&amp;applicationNumber=2018-H1324-VA-BJ&amp;programOffice=BJA&amp;po=All" target="_blank">separate $1 million</a> violence reduction grant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Political opponents, including the <a href="https://www.nraila.org/articles/20191013/virginia-s-anti-gun-politicians-put-politics-before-fighting-gun-crime" target="_blank">National Rifle Association</a>, have accused the attorney general of playing politics with funding. <a href="https://freebeacon.com/issues/pro-gun-control-virginia-dems-turned-down-anti-gun-crime-funds/" target="_blank">They say</a> a new clause in the grant acceptance paperwork for Project Safe Neighborhoods grants that would require Herring to say the state will cooperate with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has caused the Democrat to distance the state from that grant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attorney General’s Office spokesman Michael Kelly said it&#8217;s &#8220;flimsy&#8221; to tie the office&#8217;s decision to the ICE requirement. The decision to forego the grant that is now the VACP&#8217;s responsibility was “mostly logistical,&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<p>However, in <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/BJA-Routing-and-Transmittal-ForAFA-2018-GP-BX-0068-and-2018-GP-BX-0067-Virginia-Department-of-CriminalJustice-Services-199592-and-466081-1.pdf" target="_blank">the federal paperwork</a> transferring the grant from the purview of the state&#8217;s Department of Criminal Justice Services to the VACP, it&#8217;s noted the department wouldn&#8217;t be able to take the money specifically because the agency wouldn&#8217;t be able to comply with the clause requiring ICE cooperation.</p>
<p>“The attorney general and governor and everybody seems to say day in and day out that we’re having a gun violence emergency in Virginia, and if we are having an emergency, then by golly, we should do everything we can to address it,” said Del. Todd Gilbert, R-Shenandoah, House majority leader.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My primary concern here is that we’re not bringing every possible resource to bear on this problem,” Gilbert wrote in an email to the Attorney General’s office in July.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“From what I’ve learned of the program’s history and its success in Virginia, it seems to me that even the chance of obtaining more resources — which if I understand correctly, could be used to add relevant staff — is worth taking, especially given the surge in violence in Richmond in recent months.”</span></p>
<p>In a document that officially transfers the grant money to the Association of Chiefs of Police, officials note &#8220;the proposed award to the Virginia Association of the Chiefs of Police will not change the scope or purpose of the project, increase the dollar amount needed to carry out the terms of the existing grant or the amount of time needed for its performance.&#8221;</p>
<p>Various state agencies and the VACP have received Project Safe Neighborhood grants several times since at least 2010, according to a federal database of grant recipients.</p>
<p>In 2017, the <a href="https://external.ojp.usdoj.gov/selector/title?solicitationTitle=BJA%20FY%2017%20Violent%20Gang%20And%20Gun%20Crime%20Reduction%20Program%20(PSN):%20BJA%20FY%2017%20Violent%20Gang%20And%20Gun%20Crime%20Reduction%20Program%20(PSN):%20USAO%20district%20populations%20of%205%20million%20or%20more.&amp;po=BJA" target="_blank">Attorney General&#8217;s Office received $500,000</a> for a violent gang and gun crime reduction program.</p>

<p>The Attorney General&#8217;s Office said it was working toward those goals by revamping a <a href="https://respectrichmond.com/" target="_blank">Respect Richmond</a> website; attending a Richmond Redevelopment and Housing Authority gala that had &#8220;a showcase of public housing residents in PSN focus areas who are active participants in the community, working to make a difference&#8221;; participating in a Richmond Homicide Memorial, &#8220;which aims to celebrate the lives of those lost to violence and promote community healing&#8221;; and scheduling various meetings and appearances with Richmond schools and police.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposal, which the Board of Education could approve next month, would let local school boards decide how much test scores factor into annual evaluations as long as it’s at least equal to other standards.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since 2012, 40 percent of a teacher’s evaluation is based on student test performance, a metric that was put into place in 2012 so the state would have access to certain federal funding streams. That federal policy has since changed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other six metrics teacher are judged on &#8212; including professional knowledge, professionalism and instructional delivery &#8212; are only worth 10 percent of an evaluation.</span></p>
<p>Teachers with several bad evaluations can be put on improvement plans or dismissed by their school district, according to state guidelines.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State law only requires that student test scores are a “significant” portion of a teacher’s evaluation, state Superintendent James Lane told teachers at a Virginia Education Association conference last weekend.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s still a requirement to keep (that standard),” he told the group. “But it does not have to be 40%. What we know is test scores were not intended to sort students into programs, test scores were not intended to be the sole basis for teacher evaluation.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Teachers at the conference applauded and some cheered when Lane said the Board would be considering the change. </span></p>
<p>Jim Livingston, president of the VEA, said the current evaluation process is &#8220;onerous&#8221; and likely part of the reason <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/03/31/that-really-wears-on-you-pay-challenges-of-poor-districts-pushing-virginia-teachers-out-of-the-classroom/" target="_blank">Virginia has a teacher shortage</a> and experienced teachers might avoid low-performing schools.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is a significant portion of someone’s performance evaluation based on another individual,&#8221; Livingston said. &#8220;So if students are not performing well or meeting expectations &#8230; then what happens is people shy away from (teaching).&#8221;</p>

																						<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-size:12px;"></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Beach Republican Del. Glenn Davis came up with a way to narrow an almost $300,000 fundraising difference between him and his opponent, Karen Mallard: claim a donation from the Democratic Party worth three-and-a-half times more than what his own party contributed in September.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, Davis <a href="https://www.vpap.org/candidates/84659/raw-reports-in/?schedule=B&amp;committee=" target="_blank">reported a $44,000 contribution</a> from the Democratic Party of Virginia on behalf of Mallard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Davis has been using mailers from Mallard’s campaign (paid for by the Democratic Party) in campaign ads and appearances, he said. He used several of them in a recent <a href="https://www.facebook.com/delgdavis/videos/2390279564575345/" target="_blank">Facebook live video</a> to talk about his legislative record.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_9893" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:150px;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-9893" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/glenn-davis.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="200" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Del. Glenn R. Davis, R-Virginia Beach.</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Based on Virginia’s campaign reporting requirements and the definition of ‘in-kind </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">contribution’ … we feel a legal obligation to report this donation,” Davis said in a statement. “We used the fair market value of her mail and the likely volume to estimate her costs, but in terms of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">value to our campaign, her advertising has been priceless.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Davis’ campaign said recent internal polling shows that voters have positive impressions of the Republican incumbent, a result of “the response of intelligent, honest voters to (Mallard’s) dishonest attempts to destroy the character and record of a delegate that people know and trust.&#8221; Davis has been a state delegate since 2014 and served five years on Virginia Beach City Council before that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nick Paprocki, Mallard’s campaign manager, said the disclosure was a “funny stunt.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ll see what voters think on Election Day,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Democratic Party of Virginia said in a release Davis was “getting desperate” and it was an “embarrassing ploy to get attention by falsely padding his fundraising numbers to avoid an embarrassingly low fundraising total.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Including the $44,000 item Davis claimed from Democrats, he raised $82,027 in the last filing period. Mallard raised $341,589. She has more money now, with $463,276 to Davis&#8217; $347,747.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_12126" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:150px;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-12126" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/karen_Mallard-150x150.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/karen_Mallard-150x150.png 150w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/karen_Mallard-300x300.png 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/karen_Mallard-420x420.png 420w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/karen_Mallard.png 673w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Karen Mallard, the Democratic candidate for the 84th House of Delegates District in Virginia Beach. (www.karenmallard.com)</p></figure>
<p>Democratic candidates statewide have raised $31.7 million for the Nov. 5 election, when all 140 seats in the House of Delegates and Senate are up, <a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/virginia/democrats-double-their-fundraising-as-virginia-s-legislative-elections-near/article_8f354d16-29bf-5a01-a79d-20674b7f0e83.html" target="_blank">the Richmond Times-Dispatch reported. </a>Senate hopeful Del. Debra Rodman, D-Henrico, leads the pack, raising just over $1 million last month. Senate Republican candidates still have more cash in the bank though, with $4.6 million to Senate Democrats&#8217; $4.3 million, according to an <a href="https://www.vpap.org/updates/3398-mid-october-reports-general-assembly-candidates20191015/" target="_blank">analysis by the Virginia Public Access Project.</a></p>
<p>House Democrats also outraised their Republican counterparts and have more cash on hand — <a href="https://www.vpap.org/money/top-raw-cash/house/" target="_blank">$9.1 million to Republicans&#8217; $6.9 million.</a></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of Mallard’s primary attacks on Davis has been his record on education funding. She claims he has defunded public education and favors charter schools, in particular the only public charter in Virginia Beach, which is Davis’ alma mater. It wasn’t a charter when he attended. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One ad said Davis started his own charter school and “continues to game the system to help them at the expense of our public schools.” Green Run Collegiate, the school she refers to, was created by </span><a href="http://www.doe.virginia.gov/boe/committees_standing/charter_schools/2013/feb27/green_run_collegiate_application.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“seasoned educators and community leaders with strong ties to Virginia Beach City Public Schools</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” and is housed in a public high school. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Davis sits on a governing board for the school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike many charter schools, Green Run Collegiate isn’t affiliated with a charter school company, though founding board members had experience launching charter schools around the country, according to the school’s application to the state Board of Education.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In general, opponents of charter schools take issue with the practice of sending public per-pupil funding with students who attend charters. It takes public money away from public schools and gives it to schools that have the flexibility to seek private funding. Green Run Collegiate has a nonprofit foundation to manage private money and can get funding from the Virginia Beach School Board.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I have received many calls from voters in the district who know me and know what I’ve done as their representative,” Davis said in a statement. “They have felt angered and betrayed by my opponent’s willingness to say and do anything to get elected. If the Democratic Party of Virginia or my opponent believes there is any semblance of truth in these attack ads, then they need to come out from behind their computer screens and mail pieces and defend them with me in a public forum.”</span></p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state’s largest city unanimously added a request to its </span><a href="https://www.vbgov.com/government/departments/city-clerk/city-council/Documents/BookmarkedAgenda.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislative agenda</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Tuesday night to ban conversion therapy in the state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Beach’s only gay councilmember, Michael Berlucchi, and the city’s Human Rights Commission added the issue to the city’s package of statewide priorities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being the state’s largest city puts weight behind the effort, Berlucchi said, and it means the city council should set the tone for other localities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s always important to do the right thing,” he said. “It’s important to raise awareness of the fact that our neighbors and our friends are being subjected to this treatment. It’s almost 2020, we’re evolving as a community and we’re becoming a more inclusive community that warmly embraces everyone.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In September, </span><a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/local/richmond-city-council-condemns-conversion-therapy-for-lgbtq-people/article_8b4f688e-d321-5ff3-88d3-7b28596a6f0d.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richmond City Council</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> adopted a nonbinding resolution banning the practice in the city. The city is still working on its legislative agenda. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conversion therapy’s aim is to change a person’s sexual orientation. Several professional organizations, including the <a href="https://www.psychiatry.org/newsroom/news-releases/apa-reiterates-strong-opposition-to-conversion-therapy" target="_blank">American Psychological Association</a> and the <a href="https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2015/04/therapies-sexual-orientation" target="_blank">American Psychiatric Association,</a> oppose and dismiss it as a legitimate therapy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It can lead to higher suicide attempt rates among LGBTQ youth who undergo the therapy, according to a study by the <a href="https://familyproject.sfsu.edu/conversion-therapy-begins-at-home" target="_blank">Family Acceptance Project.</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I refuse to call it a therapy,” Berlucchi said. “The practitioners aren’t basing their practice in science or medicine.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People who oppose a ban say it infringes on First Amendment rights, religious beliefs and freedom to seek counseling.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The entire move is an attempt to limit people’s freedom in a way that these people are seeking this counselor,&#8221; Family Foundation President Victoria Cobb <a href="https://wtvr.com/2019/09/10/richmond-gay-conversion-therapy-ban/" target="_blank">told the Richmond City Council last month</a>. &#8220;You don’t need Christian values to think freedom for counselors and their clients – is absolutely what this country is all about. We don’t limit people’s ability to get a service that they’re looking for.&#8221;</p>
<p>Berlucchi rejected that argument.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is not an infringement on religious liberty,” he said. “What we’re simply asking is that psychological care be done in concert with the professional standards of the field and there are no professional standards for conversion therapy. The practice has been discredited.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cole Werkheiser, president of Hampton Roads Pride, said he doesn’t know of any place in the region practicing conversion therapy. Some licensed professionals may have offered the service, but recent state regulatory decisions will make that difficult.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/regulatory-board-edges-closer-to-banning-conversion-therapy-on-minors/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Board of Psychology adopted a guidance document</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> earlier this year that stated conversion therapy practice &#8220;could result in a finding of misconduct and disciplinary action&#8221; against people licensed by the Board. The </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/02/11/we-cant-change-what-we-never-chose-a-second-state-board-agrees-to-ban-conversion-therapy/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Board of Counseling followed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s the first step in tamping down conversion therapy practitioners, but it doesn&#8217;t make it illegal. Statewide legislation to do that has </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/10/08/the-general-assembly-has-consistently-stopped-efforts-to-outlaw-conversion-therapy-but-state-licensing-boards-might-be-able-to-do-it-themselves/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">consistently failed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to get out of committees on party lines. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Virginia Wesleyan University is committed to inclusiveness and acceptance of all, especially those seeking academic and life success at our institution and others across the nation,” President Scott Miller said in a statement. Virginia Wesleyan, in Virginia Beach, was one of more than 150 colleges across the country to sign onto the amicus brief filed earlier this week.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The amicus brief demonstrates our support for DACA and immigrant students. We stand with those aspiring citizens and urge the Supreme Court to pass a responsible, humane ruling that will preserve access to our institutions of higher education and other avenues that will ensure that those who are registered for DACA, or defined as &#8216;undocumented,&#8217; may continue to make contributions to America.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">None of Virginia Wesleyan’s currently enrolled students receive DACA benefits, according to spokesperson Stephanie Smaglo. At Marymount in Arlington, about 100 enrolled students are Dreamers (the name for people who are in the United States under the DACA policy).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a Cuban immigrant myself, I am grateful to the U.S. for the opportunities this country gave me to put myself through college and be a university president today,” Marymount President Irma Becerra said in a statement. “These DREAMers, like I did, are living out their daily lives with hope and determination to flourish and contribute to society. They should not have to live in constant fear of deportation.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.governing.com/gov-data/other/daca-approved-participants-by-state.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Governing magazine estimates</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> there were about 12,000 DACA recipients in Virginia as of 2017. The same year, there were</span><a href="https://www.wvtf.org/post/my-purpose-here-get-education-more-1200-daca-recipients-attend-virginia-colleges#stream/0" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">an estimated 1,200 DACA students</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at Virginia colleges.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former President Barack Obama implemented the DACA policy, which allowed people who came to the United States illegally as minors- usually with their families- to apply to be safe from deportation for two years and receive a work permit. Trump cancelled the DACA policy, an action that has been legally challenged and will be heard by the U.S. Supreme Court next month. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the meantime, Congress has struggled to agree on a legislative solution for DACA recipients.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Banishing them once more to immigration limbo—a predicament they had no part in creating—is not merely cruel, but irrational,” the amicus brief states. “If such an unlawful decision is allowed to stand—and these young people take their tremendous talent, enthusiasm, and skills elsewhere—we &#8230; will be the losers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Any college or university could sign on to the Supreme Court brief, said Jose Magaña-Salgado, spokesperson for the </span><a href="https://www.presidentsimmigrationalliance.org/about/statement/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Presidents’ Alliance on Higher Education and Immigration</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a group of higher education leaders that support immigration policies that “create a welcoming environment for immigrant, undocumented and international students.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In September, more than a dozen Virginia colleges and universities signed on to</span><a href="https://www.acenet.edu/Documents/Institutional-DACA-Letter-to-Congress.pdf" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">a letter to Congressional leaders</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> urging them to agree on a bipartisan replacement for DACA. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We believe it is long overdue for Congress to pass bipartisan legislation, in both the House and Senate, to provide permanent protection for Dreamers—young, undocumented, high-achieving individuals brought to our country as children,” the letter reads. “We respectfully urge you to come together on a bipartisan basis to address this challenge by doing the right thing for these outstanding young people and for our country.”</span></p>

Taylor and other vape shop owners are worried how a potential state tax could affect them. (Mechelle Hankerson/The Virginia Mercury)</p><p>It used to be that Jay Taylor smoked his first cigarette — a Marlboro Red — before getting out of bed in the morning.<span style="font-weight: 400;"> By the time most days were over, he would have smoked three packs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taylor worked at UNOS, which manages organ transplants, so he knew that smoking degraded his lungs, heart and other vital organs. But he couldn’t stop, until he was introduced to vaping.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I approached it as a way to cut back,” he said. “Within 48 hours, I didn’t want a cigarette.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taylor left his job at UNOS to open one of the first vape shops in Virginia in 2013. It&#8217;s still open today in Chesterfield County. He&#8217;s also president of the Virginia Smoke Free Association, which lobbies policymakers on behalf of the state&#8217;s 400 vape shops. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But steps at the state level to tax vapor products could stymie Taylor’s businesses and the hundreds of other shops in the state, who say vaping is a safer and healthier alternative to smoking tobacco cigarettes. And, Taylor and other proponents warn, an existing black market of vape products would only grow stronger if the products get too expensive because of additional taxes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The conversation straddles tax and health policy now that several deaths — <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/health-department-confirms-first-vaping-death-in-virginia/" target="_blank">including one of a Virginia man </a>— have been attributed to vape products. <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/10/24/as-cigarettes-lose-popularity-lawmakers-look-at-potentially-taxing-vaping-devices-liquid/" target="_blank">It&#8217;s not the first time</a> lawmakers have had to weigh the issue. Sen. Adam Ebbin, D-Alexandria, has introduced legislation related to taxing or limiting access to vape products since 2014. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A lot of this is still unstudied and unregulated … but they’ve flooded the market,”  said Will Hockaday, outreach coordinator for the Department of Health&#8217;s Tobacco Control Program. “A lot of benefits are really widely unknown and unfortunately the risks to health are just starting to come around.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">President Donald Trump said <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/11/health/trump-vaping.html" target="_blank">he intended to pull flavored e-cigarettes</a>&#8211; a favorite among young users- from the market until the Federal Drug Administration reviews the product. Gov. Ralph Northam “is continuing to monitor this issue closely — as a doctor, his top priority is ensuring the health and safety of Virginians,” spokesperson Alena Yarmosky said in an email.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of Oct. 1, there have been 33 confirmed or probable cases of vaping-related illness in the state, according to the Virginia Health Department. Symptoms include chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, fever and abdominal pain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the VDH, most of the people who reported lung injuries from vaping were using products <a href="http://www.vdh.virginia.gov/vdhlivewell/vaping/" target="_blank">with THC and nicotine.</a>  Not all vaping products contain THC and none in Virginia should have it, since THC remains illegal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some states <a href="https://time.com/5685936/state-vaping-bans/" target="_blank">have banned</a> vaping because it’s not clear how safe the products are and some products, especially electronic cigarettes, like JUULs, have become popular among teenagers. Others tax it, either based on nicotine content, the amount of vaping liquid purchased or the cost of the entire purchase.</span></p>
<p>Last month, the acting commissioner of the federal Food and Drug Administration, which gained the authority to regulate vaping devices in 2016, <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/fda-voices-perspectives-fda-leadership-and-experts/how-fda-regulating-e-cigarettes" target="_blank">said the agency</a> &#8220;has worked at maximal speed to regulate this rapidly evolving class of new tobacco products, but our policies and procedures in this area are still evolving.&#8221;</p>
<p>The FDA has enforced the prohibition on selling e-cigarettes to minors and conducted inspections of what it calls &#8220;electronic nicotine delivery systems&#8221; manufacturing facilities and vape shops.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This seems to be inevitably a public health (and) public safety issue, not just taxes,” said Del. Lee Ware, R-Powhatan, chair of the Joint Subcommittee to Evaluate Tax Preferences, at a Monday meeting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The subcommittee is considering <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+sum+SB1606" target="_blank">Ebbin&#8217;s </a>2019 bill that would impose a 40% tax rate on the wholesale price of vape products and funnel most of the revenue into a fund for more school counselors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vape products include traditional cartridge machines, which use flavored liquid, and e-cigarettes, which use pods pre-filled with product. Both have varying levels of nicotine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers like Ebbin have concerns about e-cigarette products, which appeal to younger customers and usually people under 20 years old. It’s not legal to purchase the products until age 21 in Virginia, but many teenagers and young adults purchase the products online to get around the law. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For high school students for example, where this is proliferating rapidly … it doesn’t stop smoking, it drives youth to a dangerous habit,” Ebbin said.</span></p>
<p>Vape usage patterns are &#8220;very murky,&#8221; Hockaday said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We know it&#8217;s very easy to argue that some of these products are reduced risks,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But they do still promote addiction.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Smoke Free Association says it considers vaping primarily as a smoking cessation tool and thinks the state shouldn&#8217;t tax the products for that reason. At Taylor&#8217;s shop, he said there are customers who eventually buy nicotine-free vape liquid (though they still like the ritual of using the vape). The Department of Health advises people trying to quit smoking to use &#8220;evidence-based treatments, including counseling and FDA-approved medications, rather than e-cigarettes.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Taxing vape products won&#8217;t stop the off-market practices causing many of the illnesses, proponents of vaping told lawmakers.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">JUUL, manufacturer of a popular e-cigarette, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/09/juul-to-stop-selling-mango-other-e-cigarette-flavors-in-stores.html" target="_blank">pulled its flavored pods off the market to discourage young users.</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And what happened? <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/26/fake-juul-pods-fill-shelves-after-vaping-giant-pulled-fruity-flavors.html" target="_blank">Counterfeit products</a>,” Max Behlke, director of state public policy for JUUL told lawmakers.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">“Until these products are properly regulated and enforced, taxes aren’t going to make a difference.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like Behlke, vape shop owners maintain that recent vaping-related deaths are because of knock-off products, not ones vetted before being offered in legitimate shops. In cases where vape users buy off-market products, sellers often cut THC liquid with dangerous ingredients, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2019/09/05/contaminant-found-vaping-products-linked-deadly-lung-illnesses-state-federal-labs-show/" target="_blank">like Vitamin E acetate</a>, Taylor said. </span></p>
<p>At Taylor&#8217;s shop, he visits each lab that makes the liquid for traditional vapes with cartridges.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have there been bad players? Sure. But every industry has bad players,&#8221; Taylor said. &#8220;This industry wants to do the right thing.&#8221;</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Missy Cotter Smasal, Democratic candidate for the 8th State Senate District, sponsored and released the ad.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cotter Smasal is challenging Sen. Bill DeSteph, R-Virginia Beach, who has served in the General Assembly since 2014. Both are former naval officers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s unclear what kind of impact the Virginia Beach shooting, and Cotter’s choice to invoke it in her campaign, will have on the race or other elections on Nov. 5 when every seat in the General Assembly is up. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joshua Zingher, a political scientist at Old Dominion University, said other states that have experienced mass shootings haven’t had huge political upheaval afterward.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The effects of mass shootings can be very short-lived. I don’t anticipate some anomaly in Virginia Beach either as a function of guns or gun reform or lack of gun reform or the mass shooting specifically,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quentin Kidd, a political scientist at Christopher Newport University, said he thinks the shooting and gun policy will motivate a key voting bloc &#8212; white suburban women, who are “driving politics in Virginia Beach” and areas outside of Richmond. Those are also the areas where the Democratic Party is hanging its hopes to win a majority in the statehouse. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I woke up in the morning and threw up in the toilet, that’s how upset I was,” </span><a href="https://www.wavy.com/virginia-beach-mass-shooting/truth-tracker-ad-for-va-state-senate-race-focuses-on-virginia-beach-mass-shooting/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">he told WAVY.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DeSteph’s campaign said it&#8217;s received more unsolicited online donations (70% of them have been less than $200) in the days following the ad’s debut than any single month of the campaign so far. Campaign staff attributes that to people being “disturbed by the ad.”</span></p>
<h2><b>&#8216;The special session … has really angered a lot of people&#8217;</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gun policy is a top issue for Virginia voters across the political spectrum, according to a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/new-poll-finds-virginia-voters-focused-on-gun-policy-ahead-of-pivotal-election/2019/10/03/db034922-e472-11e9-a331-2df12d56a80b_story.html" target="_blank">recent Washington Post-Schar School poll</a>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A majority of those polled support proposals from Democrats, like bans on assault weapons (57%) and high capacity magazines (56%), and reinstating Virginia&#8217;s one-handgun-a-month law (58%).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even more voters favor expanded background checks (88%) and red flag laws (82%).  The </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Rifle Association has said it could support red flag laws <a href="https://www.nraila.org/get-the-facts/emergency-risk-protection-orders-erpos/" target="_blank">if the proposals protect due process rights</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats filed bills that would have implemented each of those policies during the special legislative session Gov. Ralph Northam called in July after the Virginia Beach shooting. Republicans used their majorities in both chambers to refer all legislation for study,<a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/07/09/special-session-on-guns-a-big-crowd-a-quick-adjournment-a-post-election-punt-and-a-confusing-charade/" target="_blank">  adjourn</a> and come back Nov. 18. Democrats around the state threatened to flip Republicans’ seats in the Nov. 5 elections preceding the second meeting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think the special session and the failure to do anything … has really angered a lot of people, and people across the political spectrum,” Cotter Smasal said in an interview in Virginia Beach. “The special session really provided some extra motivation to work hard because (the lawmakers) had this amazing opportunity sitting in front of them. They could’ve saved lives.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cotter Smasal calls DeSteph a gun “extremist” because he’s permitted to sell guns out of his home. DeSteph, </span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/news/article_c64d10cf-9da0-511e-b8d4-fed28b809198.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">when applying for the local permit in 2009</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, said at the time he had about 20 guns he planned to sell to dealers, military, law enforcement and other elected officials.</span></p>
<p>He keeps the guns — antiques and collectibles — in a reinforced steel vault in his home, he said in an interview. There are several security systems protecting the vault.</p>
<p>DeSteph said he would support legislation requiring gun owners to secure the weapons, though not to the extent he does &#8212; he said he&#8217;s spent thousands of dollars to store his firearms.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the special session, DeSteph sponsored a number of mandatory minimum sentencing bills, including one for people who violate protective orders with guns and one for people who use stolen guns while committing other crimes. He also carried finance bills to assist Virginia Beach with renovating the site of the shooting, and to create a VBSTRONG license plate and memorial resolutions for each of the victims.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Cotter Smasal’s ad, Havekost says she asked DeSteph to “do something,” but he didn’t meet with her and then blocked gun legislation from getting a vote during the special session.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He has a chance to make a difference and he did not do it,” Havekost says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to emails provided by DeSteph’s office, Havekost emailed the senator before the special session asking him to consider legislation to ban silencers (<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/wexton-wants-to-reinstate-gun-silencer-regulation-after-virginia-beach-shooting/2019/06/21/5925ad18-936f-11e9-aadb-74e6b2b46f6a_story.html" target="_blank">one was used in the Virginia Beach shooting</a>) and allow localities to decide if government buildings should be gun-free zones.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DeSteph’s chief of staff responded, saying the senator was reviewing existing gun laws. The chief of staff invited Havekost to make an appointment with the senator to discuss it further. Havekost didn&#8217;t follow up, DeSteph said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Karen had an important story to tell as a survivor and we wanted to give her space to do that,” Cotter Smasal said. “She’s saying she’s done with the complacency and that’s what I’m saying. … It’s time we take action to reduce gun violence. Lawmakers need to step up.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gun violence was a campaign focus for Cotter Smasal from the beginning, she said. She started <a href="https://www.change.org/p/virginia-beach-public-schools-locked-doors-save-lives-lock-the-doors-to-the-virginia-beach-public-schools" target="_blank">a successful petition</a> two years ago calling for a new requirement that every Virginia Beach school keep its doors locked and use buzzer systems to let people in the building.</span></p>
<p>At the time, <a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/news/education/article_e9c8468d-c05d-5802-bd35-586103de741d.html" target="_blank">the school system had buzzer security systems</a> at three schools and was testing it at three others.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At her Rita’s Italian Ice franchise (she’s since sold the business), she employed high schoolers who told her they were scared of going to school after shootings in other places. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They were terrified,” she said. “You could see what our failure to protect them has done to their psyche.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While other Democrats running to represent parts of Virginia Beach mention gun reform on their websites, most haven’t circulated ads focused on the shooting. </span></p>
<p>Other issues have moved to the forefront in other Virginia Beach districts: In the House of Delegates race between Republican Del. Glenn Davis and teacher Karen Mallard, the two have gone toe-to-toe on <a href="http://campaign.r20.constantcontact.com/render?m=1112902269819&amp;ca=1c4aea13-3a9c-4fcb-be89-3b372b44e9ab" target="_blank">public education funding</a>; Former Virginia Beach school board member Nancy Guy has talked about gun policy in her campaign against Republican Del. Chris Stolle, but hasn&#8217;t mentioned the shooting in campaign materials.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Cheryl Turpin, a Democrat from Virginia Beach running for the Senate seat vacated by former Republican Sen. Frank Wagner, released a handful of online ads about gun reform in her race against Republican candidate Jen Kiggans, though none so far have included survivors or explicit mentions of the mass shooting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a video ad, Turpin recounted the day she watched Columbine students “slide out of the window.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And you know what we did?” the high school teacher asks the camera. “We chose to teach our students how to protect themselves in the building by doing lockdown drills, and that’s a shame because really what we need is common-sense gun reform.”</span></p>

<p>SCHEV used information <span style="font-weight: 400;">from financial aid paperwork and statistics from the Department of Social Services to estimate </span><a href="http://dashboards.schev.edu/college-students-on-snap" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">how many college students use SNAP benefits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or food stamps, and how many potentially qualify for the assistance.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.benefits.gov/benefit/1593" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, one person must make less than $16,237 annually to qualify for SNAP. A family of four must make less than $33,475 a year to qualify.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2017, 93,618 students enrolled in a college in the state could have potentially accessed SNAP benefits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The council has established a statewide goal to become the best educated in the nation,” said Tod Massa, director of the multi-agency Virginia Longitudinal Data System. “That will likely only be achieved if we support the students we have and the students we know are coming that are less traditional. We have a lot of students whose basic needs are simply not being met.”</span></p>
<p>Students who qualify for SNAP may opt not to take advantage of the program because of on-campus dining options, Massa said. For example: At Virginia Military Institute, where 101 students in 2017 qualified for the program, students march to meals.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the 2015-16 academic year, the most recent year available, 2,830 students in four-year colleges used SNAP benefits. It was 1.7% of total enrollment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among all institutions of higher education &#8211; which includes community colleges and private institutions- 16,700 used SNAP in 2015-2016. It was 3.8% of total enrolled students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state’s community colleges, made up the largest portion of that, with 12,300 community college students receiving SNAP benefits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of those, 2,450 attended Tidewater Community College.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Old Dominion University had the most students (691) receiving SNAP benefits of public four-year institutions and Liberty University had the most students using the program out of private institutions (765).</span></p>

The Republican incumbent is running to represent the 100th House of Delegates district again, this year challenged by a Democratic candidate, Phil Hernandez, who has raised almost four times as much as him. (Mechelle Hankerson/The Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VIRGINIA BEACH — In the stands on a Friday night at his son’s high school football game across the Chesapeake Bay from the Eastern Shore-based House of Delegates district he represents, Rob Bloxom isn’t especially worried about the looming election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bloxom’s been told &#8212; jokingly, he says &#8212; that he should spend more time in the district to knock on doors. But he says he has meetings to attend as a legislator, a business to run and has to catch his son, Brant, play quarterback for Broadwater Academy (he promised not to miss any games, home or away, when he was elected).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This job doesn’t make me, it doesn’t define me,” he said of his five years representing the district that includes all of the Eastern Shore and part of Norfolk. “But I want to win and I think I represent the Shore well.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 100th District is one of the few rural districts in the state that could flip, meaning Phil Hernandez, Bloxom&#8217;s opponent, is getting an influx of cash. Hernandez has more than four times the amount of money Bloxom has.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And he’s brought in Democratic heavyweights to rally volunteers, like U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine </span>and Arizona gun reform activist and former U.S. Sen. Gabby Giffords.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The district could be a chance for Democrats to pick up one more seat in November&#8217;s General Assembly elections, where </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/09/04/cheat-sheet-the-house-and-senate-races-most-likely-to-decide-control-of-virginias-statehouse/" target="_blank">control could hinge</a> on a handful of races.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joshua Zingher, a political science professor at Old Dominion University, said the district may have been overlooked in the past because of assumptions that rural districts favor Republicans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s not overwhelmingly Republican despite being rural,” Zingher said of the 100th District. “There are (significant) black and Latino populations that might contribute to that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Almost half (49%) of the district&#8217;s voters broke for Hillary Clinton in 2016 and more than half voted for Eastern Shore native Gov. Ralph Northam (53%) in 2017 and U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine (54%) in 2018.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bloxom, who recently opened an auto parts store, has held on to his seat since a special election in 2014 to replace then-Del. Lynwood Lewis, a Democrat who now serves in the state Senate. Democrat Willie Randall challenged Bloxom in 2014, 2015 and 2017. Each election, Randall earned a few percentage points more, topping out at 47% in 2017.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think some of the Democrats’ challenge has been recruiting quality candidates,” Zingher said, though he noted Randall performed well. “It’s a tricky type of district to recruit a Democratic candidate in. Finding someone that lives in that district that can appeal to both the city of Norfolk and also to the Eastern Shore — it’s a tough ask.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hernandez grew up in Virginia Beach and was the first person in his family to attend college. He went on to William &amp; Mary law school and was a policy analyst for former President Barack Obama.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That experience didn’t earn Hernandez statewide attention from his party right away. When campaigns launched, he didn’t often make it into state party press releases and he wasn’t getting as much financial support.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That has changed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There are a lot of districts that are competitive this year, more than any in the past and we’re definitely really excited about Phil as a candidate,” said Kathryn Gilley, spokesperson for House Democrats. “He’s put together a really strong campaign that’s really focused on grassroots enthusiasm … (and) made his mark as a candidate who would be a true representative of the full district.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the first campaign filing period, from January to April, Hernandez’s largest donor was Sonjia Smith, a major Democratic contributor from Charlottesville who is married to another mega-donor, Michael Bills. The Democratic party and caucuses hadn’t contributed cash at all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By June, Gov. Ralph Northam’s PAC had donated $2,500 to Hernandez’s campaign. </span></p>

<p><b>“</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think I knew I would have to earn every inch of this path,” Hernandez said in an interview in Norfolk. “We have lots of grassroots support, we have the attention of the caucus in a way that we didn’t at the beginning.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like fellow Democratic candidates around the state, Hernandez wants to increase education funding. He said it’s a ticket out of poverty for children in the area &#8212; 17.8% of people in Accomack County and 18.6% in Northampton County live in poverty compared to 11% statewide, according to the U.S. Census.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He wants to see the state put more money toward sea-level rise mitigation and have an honest debate about gun reform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I know that is a sensitive issue for a lot of people but … you’re never going to agree with government 100% of the time,” he said.  “What we feel good about is at least there’s a process … to have a debate. We fell far short of that standard.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hernandez criticized Bloxom for attending a closed town hall event hosted by the National Rifle Association in July after the Virginia Beach municipal building mass killings. Bloxom</span><a href="https://www.delmarvanow.com/story/news/2019/07/03/delegate-bloxom-special-session-guns-dominated-nra-town-hall/1626860001/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> shared what was discussed with media</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> afterward. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bloxom didn’t sponsor or sign on to gun legislation in the regular or special General Assembly sessions. In recent years, Republicans have killed gun legislation in small committees that Bloxom isn’t assigned to, so he hasn’t had to vote on legislation that would tighten gun laws in the state. Bloxom received </span><a href="https://www.vpap.org/donors/137269/recipient/247903/?start_year=2014&amp;end_year=2019&amp;recip_type=all" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a $250 donation from the NRA</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2017, according to the Virginia Public Access Project.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bloxom is focused on the economy and jobs in his district. Every accomplishment he lists involves bringing something new to the Eastern Shore: </span><a href="https://www.delmarvanow.com/story/news/2019/02/08/new-eastern-shore-community-college-building-underway/2801072002/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A new community college</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> location, more money for a </span><a href="https://www.delmarvanow.com/story/news/2018/11/01/marine-science-lab-virginia-shore-get-upgrade/1810963002/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Institute for Marine Sciences facility</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, big investments in NASA’s Wallops Island site.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re in an area where jobs are precious,&#8221; Bloxom said. &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The forces from outside are going to be so heavy, and I don’t want the people on the Shore to lose representation, and in my mind that’s what this race is about.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He’s raised about $84,000 to Hernandez’s $356,000 to run what he calls a “friends and family” campaign, calling people up personally and reminding them to vote — and that he lives on the Eastern Shore. Hernandez lives in Willoughby Spit, a neighborhood in the Norfolk section of the district.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bloxom’s inexpensive campaigns have worked in the past, he said, and thinks it can work again despite Hernandez’s nonstop campaign (Hernandez said he left his job to campaign full-time) and deep pockets. In 2017, <a href="https://www.vpap.org/offices/house-of-delegates-100/elections/?year_and_type=2017regular" target="_blank">Bloxom was outspent</a> by Randall&#8217;s campaign by nearly $166,000, according to VPAP, but still held on to his seat. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It can consume your life if you let it,” Bloxom said. “You’ll lose your family, you’ll lose your business, you’ll lose everything because for some reason you think you’re so important the state can’t operate without you, which is totally false. Whichever guy gets it next, the state will move on. Maybe in a little bit different direction, but it will move on.”</span></p>

(Courtesy of UVA-Wise).</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The University of Virginia at Wise has asked the State Council of Higher Education to start a master’s in education program by fall 2020 which could help 30 more teachers in Southwest Virginia earn advanced degrees every year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What we’ve found is that teachers trained from UVA-Wise tend to stay in the region and they want to get their education here in the region, so for us to meet our teacher shortage, we felt it was important for us to have our local teacher education program,” said Donna Price Henry, chancellor of UVA-Wise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s a </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/03/31/that-really-wears-on-you-pay-challenges-of-poor-districts-pushing-virginia-teachers-out-of-the-classroom/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">statewide teacher shortage</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but Henry said there’s an added challenge in Southwest Virginia: Only about 20 percent of teachers in the region have advanced degrees. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other parts of the state, like Northern Virginia, almost all teachers have advanced degrees, she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To become a teacher, students get an undergraduate degree in the subject area they want to teach and then have to enter a graduate program to get an education degree.</span></p>
<p>Undergraduate degree-holders can be hired as a teacher under a provisional license and then have three years to get their master&#8217;s degree.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The council recently approved</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/state-approves-new-teacher-education-programs-to-fight-shortage/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 26 new four-year teacher education programs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at eight public universities and college to make the process faster and more accessible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the New River Valley, only two colleges offer master’s programs in education: Bluefield College and Radford University. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have a lot of teachers hired provisionally, so our master’s program allows those students to go in as non-degree seeking in order to get their full license,” said Thomas Brewster, dean of Bluefield’s School of Education.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UVA-Wise’s program would allow for the same.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Teachers now are expected to meet the needs of all students,” Henry said. “So while they might have undergrad experience, getting a certificate program in another field or focused on curriculum development brings them that other (opportunity).”</span></p>

Virginia isn&#8217;t one them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attorney General Mark Herring said in a release he won’t agree to a settlement until it’s in the “best interest of Virginians” and Purdue and the Sacklers “must face real, significant, personal accountability.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state alleges that over the past decade, Purdue convinced Virginia doctors to prescribe hundreds of millions of opioid pills while downplaying how addictive they are and claiming early signs of opioid abuse could be managed with higher and more doses of the drugs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This crisis is the direct and foreseeable result of a decades-long, complex, large-scale campaign of misrepresentations and deception by the opioid manufacturers, including Purdue,” Herring wrote in </span><a href="https://files.constantcontact.com/bfcd0cef001/c67ae699-6c7c-4530-bb31-0f6ec65642bd.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a lawsuit the state filed against Purdue</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Tazewell County Circuit Court earlier this month.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia’s lawsuit, Herring suggests fining Purdue and the Sacklers (the family that owns Purdue) up to $2,500 for each time the company &#8220;deceptively&#8221; marketed prescription opioids, among other fines. The number of violations would be determined in court.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other pharmaceutical companies are responsible for distributing opioids. A bipartisan, multi-state group of attorneys general had enough evidence to sue Purdue and the Sacklers, Herring said in an interview, but as the group gathers more facts, it’s possible for “more action.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s what the lawsuit says and what it could mean for the state:</span></p>
<p><b>Who are the Sacklers and Purdue Pharma?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Purdue is a Connecticut pharmaceutical company that creates and sells prescription drugs, including Oxycontin. The Sackler family owns the company. </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/sackler/#18f587e95d63" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forbes estimates</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the Sacklers are worth $13 billion, wealth built in part from the sale of opioid medications through Purdue. The family makes about $3 billion a year from Purdue.</span></p>
<p><b>Why sue them?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dozens of localities across Virginia as well as the state have filed complaints against Purdue and the Sacklers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lawsuits make the same basic claim: Purdue and the Sacklers caused and worsened Virginia’s opioid crisis. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Sacklers founded Purdue and they have directed much of their company’s strategies toward trying to sell more and more opioids all across the country,” Herring said in an interview. “They have led a life of unimaginable luxury and comfort as families across Virginia have suffered … because of their lies and deceit.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2018, people who overdosed on opioids went to the emergency room 7,323 times around the state, according to state Department of Health data. Just over 500 people in Virginia died from an opioid overdose in 2017, the most recent year available. Between 2007 and 2017, almost 5,000 people in Virginia overdosed on opioids, the lawsuit states. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the past, opioids were used sparingly — after surgery, during cancer treatment or palliative care. In the mid-1990s, Virginia’s lawsuit claims, Purdue and the Sacklers began marketing opioids, specifically OxyContin, for chronic pain and downplayed how addictive it was.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s lawsuit also claims:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Purdue knew about medical providers who were over-prescribing opioids and flooded them with calls to encourage prescribing even more, even as those providers were in danger of losing their medical licenses; </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Peddled a questionable diagnosis of “pseudoaddiction” that Purdue representatives said could only be managed with higher opioid dosages;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Explored options for entering the drug treatment business as opioid abuse became more common.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia is suing Purdue and Richard Sackler, the company’s former chairman and president, for violating the Consumer Protection Act, “specifically in misrepresenting the risks of addiction and the ease in preventing it; the potential benefits of opioids, especially as related to other non-opioid pain relief; and the effectiveness of prescription opioids in offering treatment and relief for chronic pain.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lawsuit sues Richard, Kathe, Jonathan and Mortimor Sackler. The four held ownership interests and positions on the company’s board that meant they controlled the entire company, the lawsuit states. Richard Sackler in particular pushed for aggressive marketing that downplayed how addictive opioids were and pushed sales representatives to convince more medical providers to prescribe more and stronger doses, the lawsuit stated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By suing the Sacklers and the company, the state is trying to make sure it has access to money the family absorbed from company profits. </span></p>
<p><b>48 Virginia cities and counties are also suing individually.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cities, towns and counties may be looking to recoup different damages than the state, said Andrew Miller, an attorney at the Washington D.C. law firm </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sanford Heisler Sharp. The company is handling cases against Purdue for 48 Virginia localities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The localities have incurred harm that is distinct from the state,” Miller said in an interview. “A lot of the damage that’s been done in terms of paying for and allocating resources based on the harms has fallen to the hands of city and local governments.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lawsuits in Virginia have been filed almost everywhere — from Accomack County on the Eastern Shore to Bristol in the west; from Alexandria in the north to Danville in the Southside.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state filed its lawsuit in Tazewell County, but Tazewell filed its own complaint in 2018. The opioid prescribing rate there was 179.3 pills per 100 residents in 2016, the county’s lawsuit states. The nationwide median rate is 82.4.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cities, towns and counties can choose to settle separately from the state, Miller said, and other communities could still file suit against Purdue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We still have some folks that potentially could be interested in filing,” he said. “It’s certainly not too late.”</span></p>
<p><b>Purdue filed for bankruptcy. Can Virginia and its localities still get money?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Purdue filed for bankruptcy Sept, 15, as a way to wrap up more than 2,000 pending lawsuits, </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-purdue-pharma-bankruptcy-hearing/oxycontin-maker-purdue-begins-bankruptcy-in-push-to-settle-opioid-lawsuits-idUSKBN1W217E" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reuters reported.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company’s bankruptcy case would require the Sacklers to give Purdue to a trust controlled by plaintiffs, which would include states that sued them. The Sacklers would sell their non-U.S. pharmaceutical companies and contribute at least $3 billion of their own money to settle lawsuits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In most cases, a bankruptcy means any lawsuits against an entity have to wait, said Steven Walt, a law professor at the University of Virginia. States can file for an exception so civil matters — like many of the cases against Purdue — can proceed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bankruptcy and settlement agreement has to be approved by a judge.</span></p>
<p><b>If Virginia gets settlement money, what happens with it?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Purdue and the Sacklers settled a </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/03/26/706848006/purdue-pharma-agrees-to-270-million-opioid-settlement-with-oklahoma" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">similar lawsuit to Virginia’s in Oklahoma in March</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The settlement agreement included $270 million for addiction research in the state, $60 million in legal fees, $12.5 million for Oklahoma localities and $20 million for medicines in a new drug treatment facility. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s my hope that recovery of money for the damage that the Sacklers and Purdue has caused will go to help expand treatment and resources for those who are battling addiction right now,” Herring said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before Kemp’s position existed, borrowers had few options for recourse if they thought their loan was being mishandled. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I really spend a good amount of time reinstalling hope,” Kemp said. “Most of the people that come to me are just exhausted dealing with their student loan issue on their own.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In recent months, tens of thousands of people across the country have found out they don’t qualify for some public loan forgiveness programs. Kemp said about 10 of his cases have been related to loan forgiveness programs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I have state workers in their 60s, close to retirement for loan forgiveness and can’t get forgiveness,” he said. “It’s very unfortunate.”</span></p>

Mike Mullin, D-Newport News, in college. He accrued over $80,000 in student debt and thought he would qualify for loan forgiveness.</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of those people who found out they don’t qualify for forgiveness is Del. Mike Mullin, D-Newport News. He didn’t bring his case to Kemp.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mullin, the assistant Commonwealth’s Attorney in Hampton, said he took out more than $82,000 worth of student loans for law school</span> and has repaid roughly half<span style="font-weight: 400;">. Mullin said he was assured he would qualify for loan forgiveness when the program was introduced in 2007, as long as he made on-time payments for 10 years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, he applied for it — only to be told his loans didn&#8217;t qualify.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Pardon me for a moment while I start throwing furniture,”</span><a href="https://twitter.com/mikemullin4VA/status/1160979695162318850" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> he tweeted.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We delayed buying a house because we thought we would have more money,” Mullin said in an interview. “It affects when and how many children you have, it affects how you save. It was a decade of financial family planning and then to have someone say, ‘Nope our bad,’ that’s pretty upsetting.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mullin filed an appeal with the federal Department of Education, but he’s not optimistic he’ll be granted forgiveness. Right now, he thinks he will be paying off all of his loans on a public prosecutor’s salary (he makes $78,100 a year), something he anticipates will take him at least until his young children are in college.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ll be making these payments until the day I die”</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Borrowers also can report issues to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. It has regulatory authority, but according to data about Virginia complaints, most are closed with an explanation suggesting the borrower misunderstood the process or terms of their loan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginians have made more than 1,200 complaints about student loans to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau since 2016. Almost half of them have been about Navient, a company that took over loans from the private Sallie Mae and is</span><a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/loans/student-loans/navient-student-loan-lawsuit/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> facing lawsuits in six states</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kemp said a number of the 107 cases in his office involve Navient but none have risen to the level of taking legal action. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If Kemp finds a complaint worthy of investigation, it goes to the Attorney General’s office. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, none have been referred there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One complaint to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was about a loan co-signed for a now-deceased son. According to the complaint, Navient agreed to receive a final payment, returned it as an overpayment but credit agencies were still showing an open student loan account.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I notified Navient and the three credit reporting agencies and provided a copy of my son’s death certificate,” the complaint noted. “The reporting agencies show an active account when in fact the loan should be paid off and closed out.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In another complaint, also to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the borrower wrote: &#8220;We have been harassed over the years. I know for a fact that I&#8217;ll be making these payments until the day I die.&#8221;</span></p>

<p>“It may be that mail won’t get delivered from these locations,” said Chris Piper, elections commissioner. “That obviously affects our uniformed and overseas citizens.”</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overseas absentee voters have until Oct. 29, a week before the election, to request a ballot for the Nov. 5 election. I</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">f the U.S. decides to leave the Universal Postal Union, the country may stop receiving and delivering international mail Oct. 17.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Piper told the Board of Elections this week the department has instructed registrars to reach out to people eligible to vote absentee from other countries to request and return a ballot “as soon as possible, just in case.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2018, </span><a href="https://results.elections.virginia.gov/vaelections/2018%20November%20General/Site/Statistics/Absentee.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">14,259 Virginia voters requested absentee ballots</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> because they were out of the country. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Almost 150,000 ballots were returned by mail, though the state’s data doesn’t specify how many of those came from out of the country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Universal Postal Union is an agency of the United Nations and has been in place since 1874. The 192-country agency sets rules for international shipping.

Greene Elementary in Richmond has the largest concentration of Hispanic students in the state. (Mechelle Hankerson/ Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the last five years, Jimmy Trujillo’s stepdaughter has moved through elementary and middle school in Richmond with average grades but below-average and stagnating English skills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His daughter, now in high school, can only read, write and speak a handful of English words, according to her standardized language test results.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without a better grasp of the English language, Trujillo knows his daughter’s chances of graduating are low. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The family’s experience is one of the most pressing concerns for schools with large and ever-growing populations of Hispanic and Latino students: accessing English-language education and navigating an unfamiliar system complicated by language barriers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In schools with large populations of Latino and Hispanic students that dynamic is especially apparent: Students and parents might not know how to ask for language services, impacting students&#8217; success.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">E.S.H. Greene Elementary in Richmond, where Trujillo was PTA president, has a student body that is 86 percent Hispanic, the highest concentration of Latino students in the state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eleven schools in Virginia have student bodies that are more than 75 percent Latino or Hispanic, the threshold the U.S. Government Accountability Office’s uses to define segregation. Greene Elementary is the only one outside of Northern Virginia.</span></p>
<p><iframe id="datawrapper-chart-Lt5a0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" title="Concentration of Hispanic students at Virginia schools" src="//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Lt5a0/2/" height="887" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" aria-label="Table"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}})}();</script></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The same things that happen at black schools happen at Latino schools,” said Patricia Gandara, a researcher at UCLA’s Civil Rights Center, which studied <a href="https://civilrightsproject.ucla.edu/research/k-12-education/integration-and-diversity/miles-to-go-a-report-on-school-segregation-in-virginia-1989-2010" target="_blank">school segregation in Virginia in 2013</a>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Generally the school is much, much poorer and they have little access to opportunities. Parents are usually immigrants so parents can’t navigate the school system and no one knows because they’re all in the same boat.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hispanic&#8221; refers to people of Spanish-speaking origin. &#8220;Latino&#8221; refers to geographical origin — from Latin-American countries. Some people interviewed for this story use the terms interchangeably, <a href="https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-white-house-initiative-educational-excellence-hispanics-release-college-planning-resource-guide" target="_blank">as has the U.S. Department of Education</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conversations about school segregation have <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/08/26/decades-after-brown-decision-virginia-is-still-grappling-with-school-segregation/" target="_blank">historically focused on black students</a>, but the issue is just as relevant for Latino students. Black students tend to attend schools that are in the process of desegregating, while white and Latino students are more likely to attend schools that are already segregated</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://civilrightsproject.ucla.edu/research/k-12-education/integration-and-diversity/harming-our-common-future-americas-segregated-schools-65-years-after-brown" target="_blank">according to a UCLA report.</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of Virginia’s school systems are no longer under racial desegregation orders (<a href="https://www.justice.gov/crt/case-document/file/950006/download" target="_blank">Suffolk has an outstanding order</a>). Recent federal orders in the state have focused on English-learning services, a resource most commonly used by Spanish-speaking students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trujillo, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">who moved to the United States 21 years ago from Colombia</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, said it’s hard to get the Richmond school system to listen to Latino families. He’s become a de facto representative for most of Richmond’s Latino and Hispanic families because many don&#8217;t know English or worry that a school official will report them to federal authorities because of their immigration status, Trujillo said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My community doesn’t have a voice. They don’t listen to us. We don’t get nothing. Nothing. My fight isn’t only for Greene, it’s for Boushall, it’s for Reid, it’s for Wythe,” Trujillo said, listing Richmond schools that have large concentrations of Hispanic students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Richmond, a <a href="https://www.rvaschools.net/Page/5515" target="_blank">citywide school rezoning process</a> would redraw some boundaries for schools with the highest Hispanic populations, mostly in an effort to ease overcrowding. In some of the options, the reconfiguration would cut the percentage of Hispanic students at one school in half.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Integrating Latino students in school districts requires careful consideration, Gandara said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">School leaders may want to keep a “critical mass” of Latino and Hispanic students in one school to respect natural communities and make sure short-staffed districts can get an appropriate number of specialized teachers assigned to students, Gandara said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Research isn’t totally clear on this …  but in places where you have more of these children, the districts are able to serve the kids better if they have a limited number of bilingual teachers or people trained for English-learners,” she said.</span></p>
<p>Gary Orfield, another researcher at the UCLA Civil Rights Center, said segregation of Latino students has been increasing since the 1970s, mirroring the growth of the Latino population.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s Latino population was about 631,000 people, or 7 percent of the total, in 2010, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. In 2018, the census estimated that the population had grown to 816,000, or nearly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 10 percent of the population.</span></p>
<h3><strong>&#8216;There were a lot of students who fell through the cracks&#8217;</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though only one of the schools with the highest concentration of Hispanic students in the state is in Richmond, the district has had notable challenges with English-learning services.</span></p>
<p>Of school systems that reported dropout data for student demographic groups, Richmond’s Hispanic students have the third-highest dropout rate in the state (60%), behind all of Richmond’s students learning or who have recently learned English (65%) and Fredericksburg English-learners (66%).</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jennifer Blackwell, the current English-learning specialist for Richmond schools and a former counselor at Huguenot High School in the city, acknowledged system-wide shortfalls for English-learners.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Richmond is a unique situation because we had our big boom of immigrants come in 2015 and with that the district was completely unprepared,” she said. “There were a lot of students who fell through the cracks so we are definitely still feeling the effects of all of that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This school year, Richmond officials <a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/plus/richmond-schools-undercounted-esl-students-it-cost-the-district-hundreds/article_fa6886ad-b58f-5550-91c7-bc102c25d6e7.html" target="_blank">didn’t count 800 English-learning students</a>, meaning the state didn’t give the city funding for additional teaching positions. The city will have to find money to fund those positions unless the state is willing to adjust its budget.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That doesn’t mean students aren’t receiving English-learning services, Blackwell said, but it could be better with more teachers. </span></p>
<p>At the end of last school year, Richmond had 3,051 students who required English-learning services. The school district has 48 English-as-a-second-language teachers and are hiring for three more, Blackwell said.</p>
<p>If all three positions are filled, it fulfills the state&#8217;s Standards of Quality, which require 17 ESL teachers for every 1,000 ESL students.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other school systems with high concentrations of Hispanic students have faced similar challenges when it comes to delivering English-learning services. <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/department-justice-reaches-settlement-virginia-school-district-ensure-equal-opportunites" target="_blank">Prince William County</a> and <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/united-states-reaches-settlement-arlington-public-schools-ensure-equal-opportunities-english" target="_blank">Arlington</a> were parties in recent federal complaints about inadequate English-learning services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not clear if the complaints were filed by a Spanish-speaking family. Those details are confidential.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Arlington, Spanish-speakers make up most of the students learning English, but the district also has large numbers of students who speak Arabic and Mongolian, said district spokesperson Frank Bellavia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.justice.gov/crt/case-document/file/1168041/download" target="_blank">Arlington agreed</a> to a number of changes after a complaint was filed, including properly identifying English learners, training middle school teachers so English learners can understand content and properly monitoring the effectiveness of English learning programming over time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arlington already offers most of their parent information programs in Spanish and have started using the WhatsApp messaging app to share information with Spanish-speaking families (the app is </span><a href="https://www.pewinternet.org/2018/03/01/social-media-use-in-2018/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">particularly popular among Spanish speakers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prince William County agreed to similar actions, according to <a href="https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/crt/legacy/2013/10/23/pwcsagreement2013.pdf" target="_blank">the settlement agreement. </a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Students are resilient,” Bellavia said. “For parents, anytime you move to a new country, the institutions are difficult because they’re different. The idea of going into a government building or school is intimidating if you don’t have a strong command of the language.”</span></p>

(Taber Bain/Flickr/Creative Commons License 2.0)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a long-awaited higher-speed passenger rail project between Richmond and Washington gets a key federal approval, a coalition of business, higher education, transportation and environmental groups wants the state to study the possibility of connecting the state via east-west passenger rail service.</span></p>
<p>On Tuesday, the Virginia Department of Rail and Transportation announced that the lengthy environmental impact review for the <a href="https://dc2rvarail.com/about/project-history/" target="_blank">DC2RVA rail project</a>, which aims to boost passenger and commuter rail capacity and cut travel times along the Interstate 95 corridor, is complete, making the project eligible for federal funding for advanced planning.</p>
<p>“DC2RVA includes a long-term vision for transforming the future of rail in Virginia for generations to come,” said DRPT Director Jennifer Mitchell. “Now that environmental clearance is complete, construction of additional rail capacity in the Northern Virginia region can begin.”</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The same day, Virginians for High Speed Rail, Virginia21, the Southern Environmental Law Center and the Roanoke Regional and Hampton Roads chambers of commerce <a href="http://www.vhsr.com/sites/default/files/2019-09/VCC%20Report%20Final.pdf?eType=EmailBlastContent&amp;eId=c9a9920f-026f-4ad7-ae72-2984f41e02c7" target="_blank">published a report</a> urging the state to come up with a plan to connect “the Blue Ridge to the beach” by train. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This expansion to our rail system would increase points of access for so many people across the state and beyond,” said Danny Plaugher, executive director of Virginians for High Speed Rail. “The corridor could serve nearly 3.7 million Virginians who live within 20 miles of a rail station by expanding our transportation connectivity.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mitchell said the state is enthusiastic about a future east-west connection.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s definitely something we’d like to see in the long term,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The last cross-state train, Amtrak’s Hilltopper, stopped running almost 40 years ago, the report stated. Now, passenger rail service run largely north-south. Riders who want to travel between Norfolk and Roanoke are in for a 16-hour ride, which includes a six-hour layover in Washington D.C.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An east-west train connection would connect 35 colleges or universities, the report stated, impacting close to half a million students when factoring in train transfers from the proposed east-west route.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using the train to cross the state would reduce traffic and environmental impacts of driving, the report said, encourage more tourism and better connect 17 military installations in the state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The group suggested using Norfolk Southern tracks from Christiansburg to Charlottesville, then Buckingham Branch to Doswell and then switch to CSX tracks, where some trains would go down the Peninsula to Newport News and others would go southeast to Norfolk with a bus connection to Virginia Beach. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are portions of that proposed route that don’t have tracks suitable for passenger trains, the report said. Plus, the state would have to work out an agreement to use the tracks that are owned by private companies (CSX and Norfolk Southern).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, Amtrak and the state would have to figure out a way to provide enough train sets to run the new route. Right now, Amtrak doesn’t have enough, meaning Virginia would have to purchase its own or assist Amtrak in rehabilitating old trains.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the moment, the state is prioritizing connections to Washington D.C., since so many regional passenger routes will go through or to D.C. and Northern Virginia, Mitchell said.</span></p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A liberal think tank estimates that more than a million Virginia taxpayers won’t receive tax refund checks lawmakers approved as part of a <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/02/08/general-assembly-governor-agree-on-a-tax-plan-that-borrows-heavily-from-democrats-failed-bill/" target="_blank">major tax policy change </a>earlier this year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of those will be lower-income Virginians, according to </span><a href="https://thehalfsheet.org/post/187642997358/over-1-million-virginia-taxpayers-expected-to-miss" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a new analysis by The Commonwealth Institute</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a Richmond policy nonprofit. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;Although this group of taxpayers does not owe state income taxes after they apply their deductions and credits, they pay a large share of their income toward other state and local taxes – particularly sales and excise taxes,&#8221; the report says. &#8220;Households with annual income under $22,000 pay, on average, 9.6% of their income in state and local taxes, while households that have annual incomes of $587,000 and above pay only 7% of their income in state and local taxes.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The General Assembly agreed on a bipartisan plan earlier this year to deal with federal tax law changes. The debate was over how to handle an </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/08/21/republicans-arent-warming-up-to-northams-tax-proposal/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">expected windfall from taxpayers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who would have to file their taxes differently to take advantage of a new higher federal standard deduction while Virginia’s remained unchanged.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers agreed to spend some of that money and give some back through refunds that should be mailed to recipients by mid-October. Single filers would get $110 and couples would get $220 back from the state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, The Commonwealth Institute noted, “many taxpayers will not receive checks because their state income tax liability is already offset by existing deductions, credits, or other provisions.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That means because some people can claim certain deductions or credits, like the Earned Income Tax Credit, the amount of state tax they owe decreases. If they owe nothing, they won&#8217;t get a check.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Because it’s based on net state income tax liability, there are a lot of filers who are not ever going to receive the checks even though a lot of lawmakers and other folks talk about how they delivered tax relief to all Virginians,” said Chris Wodicka, a policy analyst at The Commonwealth Institute.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Institute estimates about two-thirds of the million people getting no refund or a reduced refund check are people who typically claim the Earned Income Tax Credit, but it also applies to </span><a href="https://www.tax.virginia.gov/tax-credits" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">any tax credit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which ranges from historic property rehabilitation to farming and environmental credits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Ralph Northam wanted to change </span><a href="https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/amendment/2019/1/HB1700/Enrolled/GE/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">budget language to allow anyone</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> claiming tax credits to receive a refund, but it failed in the Senate. Northam estimated his proposal would affect 150,000 people. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are others who may not get checks, The Commonwealth Institute wrote, including people who owe certain state debts, filers who missed the July 1 filing deadline and people who have to file corrected returns.</span></p>

(Robert Zullo/ Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The National Rifle Association dropped a $200,000 donation into House Majority Leader Todd Gilbert’s political action committee this week, a departure from its usual practice in Virginia of relying on grassroots support to stop gun law changes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before this week’s donation, the Fairfax-based NRA had donated less than a million dollars total to state lawmakers since 1996, the earliest year available through the </span><a href="https://www.vpap.org/donors/137269-national-rifle-association/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Public Access Project.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> New gun restrictions have typically died in small committees in the GOP-controlled legislature. </span></p>
<p>“The  NRA is fully engaged in this election to protect the self-defense rights of every law-abiding Virginian,&#8221; NRA spokesperson Catherine Mortenson said in an email. &#8220;We are focused on educating and mobilizing our members in support of candidates who will protect our fundamental rights.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The influence of the NRA and other gun-rights groups has been more strongly exerted through </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/07/12/its-not-the-nras-money-that-sways-virginia-politics-its-the-members/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">voters who support the organization’s mission</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

(Photo by Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Party leader PACs typically use money to support other candidates in the same party. Gilbert’s PAC </span><a href="https://www.vpap.org/committees/330964/service/2/?start_year=all&amp;end_year=all" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">gave $5,000</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to Del. Roxann Robinson of Chesterfield earlier this year and $10,000 to Del. Bob Thomas of Fredericksburg in 2018. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“(The donation) means the Republicans are worried about losing their majorities and are bringing out the financial big guns, so to speak,” said Stephen Farnsworth, a political science professor at the University of Mary Washington.</span></p>
<p>In response to the donation, House Minority Leader Eileen Filler-Corn donated $200,000 to the House Democratic Caucus. It&#8217;s common for party leaders to donate money from their established PAC in election years.</p>
<p>&#8220;Democratic control of the Virginia House of Delegates is my top priority,&#8221; she said in a release. &#8220;We will work on behalf of all Virginians and get to work on gun violence prevention and other important issues across our Commonwealth.&#8221;</p>
<p>All 140 seats in the General Assembly are up for reelection this November and Republicans hold a small majority in both chambers.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Republican party is likely willing to take large donations from whoever is offering it, Farnsworth said, even if lawmakers have been accused of being </span><a href="https://twitter.com/SenatorLocke/status/1148735062520848384" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“bought and sold”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the organization.</span></p>

<p dir="ltr">“It’s really shocking to see how blatantly the NRA controls the House Republican leadership,&#8221; Filler-Corn said in a release before announcing her donation to the Democratic Caucus. “Less than two months after blocking any discussion or allowing us to do our work to keep Virginians safe, it is disappointing the Republican leadership now receives this large donation.&#8221;</p>

Todd Gilbert, (House Speaker) Kirk Cox and their Republicans colleagues have sold their souls to the NRA, and on Nov. 5, we are going to take their majorities,&#8221; Jake Rubenstein, communications director for the Democratic Party of Virginia, said in an email.</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Issues like guns tend to have pretty polarized public views,” he said. “The people who would be bothered by the NRA donation probably wouldn’t be voting Republican anyway.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The NRA’s donation pales in comparison to money pro-gun control groups have pumped into the state and still plan on contributing: Everytown for Gun Safety, an organization created by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, said it </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/national-gun-control-group-launches-campaign-against-suburban-republicans-in-virginia/2019/08/21/d4004f6c-c39d-11e9-b72f-b31dfaa77212_story.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">plans to spend $2.5 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Virginia legislative races.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Big city financiers seeking to buy this election have committed more than $2.5 million to gun control groups,&#8221; Mortenson said. &#8220;The Bloomberg and Everytown/Moms Demand lobbyists may outspend the NRA, but they will never outwork us.”</p>

<p>The small group was rallying support to leave Fox&#8217;s zoning alone, part of a <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/08/26/decades-after-brown-decision-virginia-is-still-grappling-with-school-segregation/" target="_blank">saga that played out over summer vacation</a> and an issue that the area&#8217;s Republican state senator waded into the night before students went back to school.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Glen Sturtevant, R-Chesterfield, said in a Facebook post from outside Mary Munford Elementary, another school being considered for rezoning, that he’s heard from &#8220;countless parents&#8221; at Fox and Munford who oppose the district&#8217;s potential plans to shift neighborhood lines. He said <a href="https://www.glensturtevant.com/schools" target="_blank">he will introduce legislation</a> that would require additional steps for local school boards before approving zoning changes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These are some of the best schools not only in Richmond, but in central Virginia and this rezoning plan would have a major impact on Munford and Fox,” said Sturtevant, a former Richmond School Board member, in a brief Facebook video titled “Save Fox and Munford.&#8221; He encouraged viewers to click through a link to sign a petition.

<p>Several commenters on the video were quick to point out that Fox and Munford are only two of the schools potentially affected by the rezoning change. The schools also have the largest concentrations of white students in Richmond.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“‘Save’ them — your campaign is to save them for white, affluent families,” one commenter wrote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richmond proposed pairing majority-white Fox and Munford with majority-black Carver and Cary elementary schools, respectively.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The plan would split up siblings, complicate morning drop-off routines and null the benefits of families who bought homes in the neighborhood specifically to attend those schools, Sturtevant said, echoing concerns parents have submitted to the school system. Richmond Superintendent Jason Kamras said that first wave of parental feedback “sounded eerily like Massive Resistance 2.0.”</span></p>
<p>But Sturtevant didn&#8217;t say anything about race in his video, likely a purposeful tactic to try to convince some white city-dwellers to vote for him in November&#8217;s legislative elections, said Alex Keena, a political scientist at Virginia Commonwealth University. All 140 seats in the General Assembly are up for reelection and Republicans hold a small majority in both chambers.</p>
<p>Sturtevant won his last election by two percentage points and is probably looking to secure more support in his district, Keena said. Sturtevant&#8217;s district <a href="https://www.vpap.org/offices/state-senate-10/district/" target="_blank">voted overwhelmingly</a> for Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine last year and for the Democratic slate of Gov. Ralph Northam, Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax and Attorney General Mark Herring in 2017.</p>
<p>In Sturtevant&#8217;s district, Richmond city is the most progressive-leaning enclave, which makes it hard for the Republican to change voters&#8217; minds &#8212; unless he finds the right issue.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you want to get white liberal Richmonders upset, talk about schools,” Keena said. “Talk about something very, very personal to them.”</span></p>
<p>And even though Richmond&#8217;s school issues come back to race and historical discrimination, it&#8217;s a complicated subject for even the most progressive white voter to talk about, Keena said.</p>
<p>“(Sturtevant) is hardly the first person to talk about race without talking about race,” he said. &#8220;We see this any time you talk about rezoning schools: There&#8217;s an auditorium full of white parents who say, &#8216;No, no I&#8217;m not racist but I want to keep my status. &#8230; It&#8217;s hard to deny that race isn&#8217;t a part of that.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sturtevant wants local school boards to treat rezoning plans like a state constitutional amendment: Voters would have to approve the plan through a referendum or there would have to be a school board election between introduction and approval of the plan. The plan would have to be approved by the old and newly elected board. A draft of the legislation wasn&#8217;t available with Sturtevant&#8217;s announcement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This process will increase transparency and accountability by ensuring that the public has a meaningful role in approving or vetoing new school rezoning plans,” Sturtevant’s office said in a release detailing the plan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several commenters pointed out that Sturtevant’s legislation sounds like an overreach and reminded him he’s not on the Richmond school board anymore.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This isn&#8217;t your job. RPS has an elected school board,” one person wrote. “This (is) a gross overreach on your part. You are pandering.”</span></p>
<p>Sturtevant did not respond to an interview request from the Mercury.</p>

<p>&#8220;Richmond families can&#8217;t trust Glen Sturtevant to protect our public schools,&#8221; Hashmi&#8217;s campaign manager, Philip Stein said in an email.</p>
<p>&#8220;He was sued for attempting to secretly rezone Richmond City schools behind closed doors to benefit affluent families at the expense of others. Now he&#8217;s back to playing politics with our schools again in an effort to distract people from his record voting in lockstep with Republicans in the Senate to undermine public education funding. Richmonders don&#8217;t need a lecture on public schools; they need a state senator who will fight for every student&#8217;s access to a quality education.&#8221;</p>

(Mechelle Hankerson/The Virginia Mercury)</p><p>Michael McConkey can&#8217;t keep enough pawpaw trees in stock at his landscaping business in Afton.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s a small renaissance going on with it. There are an awful lot of backyard growers,” McConkey said. He&#8217;s stocked the fruit tree at his store, Edible Landscaping, since the business opened in 1987. </span></p>
<p>And as popularity of the once-obscure fruit grows, state agriculture experts say they see an opportunity for farmers and are taking steps to encourage them to grow the native plant. To that end, the Virginia Cooperative Extension is holding <a href="https://www.ext.vsu.edu/events/2019/9/6/pawpaw-production-amp-marketing-workshop" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an event</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at Virginia State University with national <a href="https://www.petersonpawpaws.com/" target="_blank">pawpaw guru Neal Peterson</a> in September.</span></p>
<p>For now, McConkey&#8217;s store is one of few places in the state that sell the pawpaw tree, which can grow to 25 feet tall and produce a fruit with a mango-like tropical taste. For most people, raising their own tree or foraging for the fruit along riverbanks and forests are the only ways to get pawpaws.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They’re like a pudding consistency,” McConkey said. “Very smooth. And they’re rich and yellow, and that yellow reminds you maybe of a mango.”</span></p>
<p>Despite how much work it takes to get a pawpaw, it has a dedicated fanbase. In a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rva/comments/9alf0e/pawpaw_season_is_here_again/" target="_blank">Richmond subreddit page</a>, contributors have alerted each other to good pawpaw picking spots over the years, and some said Labor Day weekend is a good time to stock up on wild pawpaws. Other fans of the fruit have suggested <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rva/comments/clzdlo/state_fruit/" target="_blank">making it the official state fruit.</a></p>

(Mechelle Hankerson/The Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fruit has a long history in Virginia. Portuguese explorers visiting the New World described Native Americans eating the fruit, the Cooperative Extension said, and Founding Fathers George Washington and Thomas Jefferson considered it a favorite. Washington, McConkey wrote on his website, preferred his chilled for dessert.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many pawpaw variations come from Virginia and have Virginia-themed names: the Rappahannock has fewer seeds and are “sweet and refreshing,” according to Edible Landscapes; the Allegheny version has a hint of citrus flavor and the Susquehanna is large (and pawpaw enthusiast Peterson’s favorite).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An increased interest in eating local foods makes it a good time to encourage more pawpaw growth, said Reza Rafie, a niche crop specialist at VSU’s extension office.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It fell out of favor because of industrial development of agriculture and food production,” he said. “It’s perishable and doesn’t ship well. And if it doesn’t ship well and doesn&#8217;t have that long shelf life, then why bother? I believe if we could introduce it and provide farmers and consumers with the right kind of information, it can make a comeback.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pawpaws will get overripe on a cross-country trip (ripe pawpaws are best consumed in a two to three-day window), so they’d do well in local markets and farm stands, Rafie said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McConkey said he suspects people will naturally get into commercial pawpaw growing. He recently met a customer who has 200 pawpaw trees in the ground.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They’re a no-brainer because they don’t require spraying or commercial pesticides, they’re native and really easy to grow,” he said. “It’s a really nice plant to add to anyone’s backyard.”</span></p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emporia is a well-known speed trap, dreaded by heavy-footed drivers who might think the city near the border of North Carolina funds its operations entirely through the punishment of too-fast drivers.</span></p>
<p>But 124 miles away, there&#8217;s a town that relies <span style="font-weight: 400;">on bad drivers’ traffic fines and similar payments more than Emporia: Eastville, a 200-person town on the Eastern Shore, has a $349,232 town budget that comes mostly (72%) from fines and forfeitures,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> according to an </span><a href="https://www.governing.com/topics/finance/fine-fee-revenues-special-report.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">analysis by Governing magazine.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Washington D.C.-based magazine created a database tracking how much localities around the country collected in court costs and other fines, like traffic tickets. The issue got national attention after a Ferguson, Mo. police officer killed 18-year-old Michael Brown, prompting widespread protests, the magazine wrote. Excessive fees and subsequent arrests for non-payment of those fees were <a href="https://www.npr.org/2014/08/25/343143937/in-ferguson-court-fines-and-fees-fuel-anger" target="_blank">part of the reason the Ferguson community didn&#8217;t trust police.</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Governing&#8217;s analysis excluded any locality that collected less than $100,000 in fines and focused on jurisdictions in which fines and court revenues accounted for more than 10 percent of general revenues or where revenues exceeded $100 per adult resident. Eight Virginia localities made the cut.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We found that for hundreds of mostly small cities and towns, fines are a critical source of funding, at times accounting for more than half of all general revenues,” the magazine wrote.</span> That could become a problem for towns like Eastville that rely heavily on those fines to fund its basic operations.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Mounting legal and political movements are targeting cuts to fines and court fees. The eventual proliferation of autonomous vehicles and improvements in driver technology could further one day drastically reduce traffic fines,” Governing wrote. “For these and other reasons, it’s an open question as to whether the financial viability of governments most dependent on fines could be threatened over the long term.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Governing determined which localities in Virginia rely more on fine and court revenue by looking at the most recent annual financial reports filed with the state Auditor of Public Accounts. The magazine said no information was available for many small towns, since only localities with populations of 3,500 or more are required to submit annual financial reports to the state.</span></p>
<p>The magazine requested financial reports for some of those smaller governments that reported high fine collections in Census of Government surveys.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to Eastville, the list of localities in which fines and forfeitures made up major pieces of the budget were:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emporia (fines make up 2.7% of the city’s total revenues)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sussex County (fines make up 4.7% of county revenues)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brunswick County (fines are 5.6% of county revenues)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Greensville County (fines are 7.3% of county revenues)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gordonsville (fines are 8.2% of the town’s total revenues)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">LaCrosse (fines make up 20.8% of the town’s total revenues)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Waverly (fines are 34.8% of the town’s revenue, though Governing based that amount on a 2014 financial statement)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.governing.com/topics/finance/gov-addicted-to-fines.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Governing wrote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that many of the places that topped its nationwide list are in the South, where there are more rural areas with high poverty rates, limited or weakening tax bases and local independent courts.</span></p>
<p>In 2012, the General Assembly passed a law that would allow the state to take a percentage of the fine revenue localities collected. <a href="https://www.progress-index.com/news/20161001/another-chance-for-hopewells-million-dollar-mile" target="_blank">Drivers rejoiced, but localities considered it a financial loss. </a>Lawmakers reversed the law in 2016, allowing localities to keep all of its fine revenue.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">None of the places in Virginia made it to the top of Governing’s list of places that rely most on fine revenue. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of the localities on that list are in Louisiana, where some towns use fines to fund 80-92 percent of their local budgets.</span></p>

																						<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-size:12px;"></p><p>The percentage of Latino voters in Virginia who support Trump is getting smaller, according to polling from Equis Labs, which released an 11-state <a href="https://www.equisresearch.us/research" target="_blank">survey</a> this week it calls the deepest look yet at voter sentiment in the demographic.</p>
<p>Equis polled 500 Latino voters in the state and found 20 percent plan on voting for Trump in the 2020 presidential election, down from the 30 percent that exit polls showed voting for him in 2016.</p>
<p>Most of the voters surveyed (63%) told Equis they would vote for a Democrat over Trump. The remaining 17 percent are still undecided, but most indicated leaning toward voting for a Democrat.</p>
<p>The results may not be surprising, given the president&#8217;s <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/08/16/even-before-el-paso-latinos-said-trumps-anti-immigrant-rhetoric-made-them-feel-unsafe/" target="_blank">negative and inflammatory remarks about Latino</a> immigrants. The survey isn&#8217;t all bad news for Trump: Half of the respondents said they like the way Trump has handled the economy — a number higher than in any state surveyed except Florida. Much smaller percentages of Latino Virginians (29% and 24%, respectively) agree with Trump on health care and immigration.</p>
<p>Majorities also support finding a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants (79%), protecting the Affordable Care Act (64%), and consider themselves pro-choice (63%).</p>
<p>Equis Labs, a newly launched progressive think tank, encourages Democrats to reach out more to Latino voters, a group they say could make or break the party&#8217;s chances in the 2020 presidential election.</p>
<p>&#8220;Old modes of thinking about Latinx voters, and outdated infrastructure to engage them, leaves many disconnected from the political process — leading to lower rates of participation and less power,&#8221; Equis said in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Often our voters aren&#8217;t being targeted; when they are targeted, they are not being reached; and when they are being reached, it is with messages that aren&#8217;t connecting. It leaves our voters at a deficit of information, even about who&#8217;s on the ballot.&#8221;</p>

Nick Freitas, R-Culpeper. (Ned Oliver/ Virginia Mercury)</p><p>The spelling rhyme goes something like: I before E except after C — and R if your name is Nick Freitas.</p>
<p>Freitas, R-Culpeper, is <a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/virginia/government-politics/all-it-s-done-is-made-me-mad-freitas-announces/article_dff0ca59-c9ae-50e5-9d11-99897c1ee930.html" target="_blank">running a write-in campaign </a>to win re-election to the House of the Delegates. The conservative up-and-comer failed to make it on the ballot as the Republican nominee because his candidate qualification form was filed too late.</p>
<p>Even though the 30th House District (which includes Culpeper, Madison and Orange counties) favors Republicans, Freitas&#8217; slip-up is especially serious because all 140 seats in the General Assembly are up for re-election and Republicans hold slim majorities in both chambers.</p>
<p>When the Board of Elections voted to block Freitas from appearing on the ballot, a local party representative told them <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/board-of-elections-member-makes-unsuccessful-push-to-get-del-nick-freitas-on-the-ballot/" target="_blank">it would be difficult to mount a write-in campaign</a> because of voters who &#8220;have difficulty with language, speaking and writing.&#8221;</p>
<p>But, according to state policy, as long as a voter makes it &#8220;reasonably clear&#8221; they&#8217;re writing in Freitas, it will probably count as a vote for him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Determining what may be counted as a write-in vote for a particular candidate often requires determining voter intent: Any abbreviation, misspelling, or other minor variation in the form of the name of a candidate or a political party should be disregarded in determining the validity of the ballot, if the intention of the voter can be ascertained,&#8221; a <a href="https://www.elections.virginia.gov/media/grebhandbook/Individual-Chapters/14_Canvass2019.pdf" target="_blank">handbook for election officials states.</a></p>
<p>Local electoral boards are responsible for determining and counting write-in votes.</p>
<p>In short: If a voter writes Nick Frietas or another variation, it could still count as a vote for the actual candidate.</p>
<p>The state handbook says write-in candidates should educate voters on the correct spelling of their names.</p>
<p>Freitas&#8217; campaign manager <a href="https://www.starexponent.com/news/freitas-write-in-campaign-focused-on-winning-supporting-other-gop/article_9587ac0c-3637-5efe-b1b5-8b9ab94dee82.html" target="_blank">told the Culpeper Star-Exponent</a> that the campaign might use &#8220;printed bracelets&#8221; to give people at the polls the correct spelling.</p>

Cary Elementary in Richmond. Ama will be entering fourth grade this year. (Mechelle Hankerson/The Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jenny Aghomo was excited about the new teachers and friends her daughter would meet if the majority-black school she attended in Richmond merged with a nearby majority-white school as part of a plan to increase the diversity of both student bodies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then Aghomo heard what some parents from that majority-white school, Fox Elementary, were saying about the proposal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Knowing what I know now, attitudes would have to change because you don’t want your kids to go somewhere they’re not really welcome,” Aghomo said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A vocal contingent of Fox parents said they supported diversity but practical concerns made the proposal less palatable. Some lamented they&#8217;d no longer be able to walk their kids to school. Others worried their property values would drop.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The response, which Richmond Superintendent Jason Kamras said “</span><a href="https://twitter.com/JasonKamras/status/1151512867134496768" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sounded eerily like Massive Resistance 2.0</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” is just one example of how plans to better integrate Virginia’s remaining segregated schools and systems still face pushback 65 years after the Supreme Court’s landmark Brown V. Board of Education decision.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A lot of folks are good with diversity in principle, or maybe they’re good with a little diversity,” Kamras said. “But in reality, when it hits a certain threshold, things suddenly change.”</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_10856" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="max-width:100%;width:1920px;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-10856 size-full" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/DSCF0833.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1280" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/DSCF0833.jpg 1920w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/DSCF0833-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/DSCF0833-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/DSCF0833-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/DSCF0833-696x464.jpg 696w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/DSCF0833-1068x712.jpg 1068w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/DSCF0833-630x420.jpg 630w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  John B. Cary Elementary School in Richmond is part of a potential citywide reassignment plan to promote student diversity, among other goals (Mechelle Hankerson/The Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That reality continues to have real-world implications. As some legal protections implemented following the Brown decision have expired, studies have shown schools have steadily become more segregated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 1989, 3 percent of Virginia’s schools were “intensely segregated,” with 10 percent or less of the student population identifying as white, according to a </span><a href="https://www.civilrightsproject.ucla.edu/research/k-12-education/integration-and-diversity/miles-to-go-a-report-on-school-segregation-in-virginia-1989-2010/siegel-hawley-miles-to-go-2013.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report by UCLA’s Civil Rights Project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. By 2010, that number doubled to 6 percent. In 2018, about 7 percent of Virginia’s schools fell into that category, according to school enrollment data.</span></p>
<p><b>“</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we keep kids separate, it’s really hard to imagine how we’re going to move forward in a multiracial democracy,” said Genevieve Siegel-Hawley, a Virginia Commonwealth University professor who co-authored the 2013 UCLA report. “There are real social and psychological benefits to desegregating schools and damage (from) segregated ones.”</span></p>
<h2><b>Where are segregated schools?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In total, 93 schools in the state have student bodies that are more than 75 percent black, the threshold the U.S. Government Accountability Office uses to define segregation. The majority are in Richmond, Norfolk, Henrico County, Portsmouth, Petersburg and Newport News.</span></p>
<p><iframe id="datawrapper-chart-Ma1P4" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" title="What schools have the highest concentration of black students" src="//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Ma1P4/3/" height="753" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" aria-label="Table"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richmond rolled out a draft of its</span><a href="https://croppermap.com/richmond/documents/rezoning/RPSCommitteeMeeting2June27PowerPoint_190627.pdf" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">rezoning proposal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in June. The district needs to ease overcrowding in some parts of the city. Kamras said it also presented an opportunity to make some schools more diverse by “pairing” elementary schools, including Fox, which is 56 percent white, and John B. Cary, which is 82 percent black. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the proposal, students from both schools would attend Fox until third grade, then matriculate to Cary for third to fifth grade. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Siegel-Hawley says pairing is a common tool used by school districts to increase diversity among student bodies, Fox parents worried about the logistics of being assigned to different school buildings at a community meeting last month.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_10740" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="max-width:100%;width:1920px;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-10740" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/fox-elementary-redistricting-1.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1280" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/fox-elementary-redistricting-1.jpg 1920w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/fox-elementary-redistricting-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/fox-elementary-redistricting-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/fox-elementary-redistricting-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/fox-elementary-redistricting-1-696x464.jpg 696w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/fox-elementary-redistricting-1-1068x712.jpg 1068w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/fox-elementary-redistricting-1-630x420.jpg 630w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Officials in Richmond proposed pairing Fox Elementary School in Richmond with a nearby majority black school to increase the diversity of both student bodies. (Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Parents were forceful in anonymous written comments submitted to the school system, which included threats to leave the school district: “If option 2 is passed, I know that I, along with many other neighbors, would carefully weigh the decision of whether to send my children to private school or to move out of the district for a better elementary school option for our family.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kamras has viewed such responses with skepticism.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is fair to make critiques of the proposal but what is not fair from my perspective is critiques that are masquerading as critiques when they’re really resisting the ultimate goal, which is integration,” Kamras said in an interview. “I think we need to have some tough and honest conversations about that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Parents, most of whom declined to provide their names when approached by a reporter at a community meeting in July, also questioned why Fox and Cary were part of the plan, noting that neither school is among the most segregated in the city. That designation goes to Richmond’s Fairfield Court Elementary School, with a student body that is 98 percent black.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the first reassignment draft, Richmond has come up with <a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/plus/new-richmond-rezoning-options-include-combining-mary-munford-cary-elementary/article_a767a18f-f8aa-578f-8a76-84cec9609500.html" target="_blank">other options</a> that pair Cary with Mary Munford Elementary (which has the highest concentration of white students in Richmond) and Fox with Carver Elementary.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kamras said Fox and Cary’s geographic proximity presented an opportunity to address the issue without too much disruption. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That is a part of the city where we actually have diversity in close proximity,” he said. “If you were to think a little bit more broadly about those school zones, you could end up with two schools that are roughly 50-50.”</span></p>
<h2><b>Segregation outside of schools</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richmond and Norfolk have historically been home to large proportions of minorities, a pattern intensified by the white flight that began in the 1950s and ’60s after court-ordered school integration. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even as the share of white residents has increased, both cities remain highly segregated because of past racist policies like </span><a href="https://dsl.richmond.edu/holc/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">redlining,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which relegated black homeowners to certain parts of the city, and</span><a href="https://vpm.org/radio/news/mapping-projects-show-lasting-impact-of-redlining-racial-covenants-in-virginia" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">neighborhood covenants</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that barred minorities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Since our schools reflect those housing patterns, we remain a very, very segregated school system. I’m committed to doing whatever we can to reverse that,” Kamras said of Richmond.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After courts ordered schools integrated, most school districts started busing students between neighborhoods to meet the mandate &#8212; a practice many have since abandoned.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Norfolk, the city stopped busing elementary school students in the 1980s. Paul Riddick, a current Norfolk city councilman, sued to maintain the practice, arguing that without it, the schools would resegregate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Riddick lost the case, but he was right. The city stopped all busing in 2001. Ruffner Middle School &#8212; once viewed as an integration success story &#8212; went from having a student population that was one third white in 2000 to a student population that was 93 percent black as of last year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Riddick, however, says he doesn&#8217;t consider busing a solution anymore and instead thinks school funding is more effective since it can ensure each school has access to the resources it needs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our district is 70 percent or more African American, so I think anywhere you go it’s going to be majority African American,” he said. (State data shows 59 percent of Norfolk&#8217;s total student body is black as of 2018).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s a non-issue to me,&#8221; Riddick said.</span></p>
<h2><b>&#8216;We know diversity is good for all kids&#8217;</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though policies like busing may be political non-starters, experts say school districts that want to address segregation still have options.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to pairing schools, Siegal-Hawley said magnets and other specialized programs give families a reason to send their kids to schools that may be far from home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Some of these kids will travel for good opportunities,” she said. “It’s not about the busing, it’s about what the busing is being used for.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regardless of the approach, she said fully integrated schools are a worthwhile goal. It can improve graduation and dropout rates and help students become more comfortable with different types of people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Desegregated schools often retain more experienced teachers and can get more students into college and then into well-paying jobs, Siegel-Hawley wrote in the 2013 UCLA report.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kamras agreed, noting diverse schools often have higher SAT scores and student satisfaction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s a whole host of benefits to integrated, diverse schools,” he said. “On top of that, this is a city which has a diverse population, so it is a shame to not have schools that reflect that.”</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.cbpp.org/" target="_blank">The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities</a>, a progressive Washington D.C. think tank, recommended four policies to &#8220;welcome immigrants &#8230; into the mainstream economy and foster community well-being&#8221;:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allowing undocumented immigrants to get driver&#8217;s licenses, which could make the roads safer and drive down insurance costs</li>
<li>Giving undocumented immigrants access to in-state college tuition and financial aid would allow them to enter the workforce more easily and create more workers in the state.</li>
<li>Strengthening labor laws, like making sure people are paid minimum wage, would benefit all workers, but undocumented workers are more likely to be the victims of wage violations.</li>
<li>Expanding health care coverage to all children would improve long-term outcomes and ease the economic burden of being uninsured.</li>
</ul>
<p>Virginia is one of 21 states that hasn&#8217;t enacted any of the four policies. The <a href="https://www.dailyprogress.com/news/uva/uva-expands-financial-aid-to-include-daca-students/article_db3394c2-430f-5764-945f-f33150bab570.html" target="_blank">University of Virginia recently decided</a> to allow students in the country with Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals status to receive institutional financial aid from private sources.</p>
<p>The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimated the country&#8217;s 11 million undocumented immigrants pay nearly $12 billion annually in state and local taxes, an amount that could grow to nearly $14 billion if they had a pathway to citizenship.</p>
<p>&#8220;States can strive to treat all people with dignity and maximize the contributions of all of their residents, regardless of origin or legal status,&#8221; the report stated. &#8220;Giving all residents access to economic opportunity would enable them to earn higher wages, spend more in the economy and contribute more to the tax base from which states fund schools and other investments that are critical to a strong economy.&#8221;</p>
<p>The report did not include figures for how much enacting the policies might cost. Estimates on the cost of providing health care to undocumented immigrants nationwide, widely supported by the field of Democratic presidential hopefuls, are tough to come by, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/03/health/undocumented-immigrants-health-care.html" target="_blank">The New York Times reported</a> last month. In California alone, however, the cost of covering all people over the age of 19 who were in the country illegally <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/california-considers-health-care-undocumented-immigrants-n1008201" target="_blank">was pegged at $3.4 billion</a>, the Associated Press reported.</p>
<p>The Virginia General Assembly has<a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/virginia/government-politics/general-assembly/es-cuando-muere-virginia-senate-panel-again-kills-bill-to/article_1eb7d1ad-a2cd-5a02-a26f-28df205c1dd5.html" target="_blank"> historically rejected efforts</a> to grant immigrants driving privileges, despite some bi-partisan support and a past endorsement from the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles.  Four years after Connecticut allowed undocumented immigrants to obtain driver&#8217;s licenses, though, the state saw &#8220;a reduction in hit-and-run crashes and a steep decline in the number of people found guilty of unlicensed driving,&#8221; <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/05/24/719959760/licensed-undocumented-immigrants-may-lead-to-safer-roads-connecticut-finds" target="_blank">NPR reported.</a></p>

Ralph Northam, he said during a financial update to lawmakers.</p>
<p>Northam, speaking at a presentation to the Joint Money Committee, owns and leases about 50 acres of farm land on the Eastern Shore.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a farmer,&#8221; said Northam, who is generally better known as a pediatric neurologist. This year, he said, his leases farm land is full of soybeans, but he and <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/09/05/id-prefer-they-just-stay-out-of-it-virginia-farmers-caught-in-the-middle-of-trade-war/" target="_blank">other growers</a> in the state may not be willing to harvest crops if they won&#8217;t be able to sell them.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;They may very well stay in the fields if they can&#8217;t sell,&#8221; Northam told the Joint Money Committee. &#8220;The farmers would much rather sell at a profit than rely on federal subsidies.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Soybeans are usually <a href="https://www.vdacs.virginia.gov/agriculture-exports.shtml" target="_blank">Virginia&#8217;s top export</a> to China. The country bought $700 million worth of agricultural exports from Virginia in 2016.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s fallen to $235 million because of Trump&#8217;s trade war with the country, Northam said. In 2018, Virginia exported more than $58 million soybean products to China – an 83 percent decrease from 2017, U.S. Sens. Tim Kaine and Mark Warner said <a href="https://www.warner.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/pressreleases?page=5" target="_blank">in a statement </a>criticizing the president&#8217;s &#8220;haphazard, ill-planned trade war with China that raised taxes on a number of Virginia commodities.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/01/trump-says-us-will-impose-10percent-tariffs-on-300-billion-of-chinese-goods-starting-september-1.html" target="_blank">Trump has floated the potential of imposing additional tariffs</a> on Chinese products on top of others he rolled out last summer. That round of tariffs came with a federal farm bailout was intended to soften the blow of the retaliatory tariffs.</p>
<p>Trump&#8217;s potential tariffs against China and retaliatory tariffs imposed in response could cost the United States billions of dollars in production and lost jobs, the independent nonprofit<a href="https://taxfoundation.org/tariffs-trade/" target="_blank"> Tax Foundation</a> estimated<span style="font-weight: 400;">. In the last few days, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-china-tariffs/trump-delays-tariffs-on-chinese-cellphones-laptops-toys-markets-jump-idUSKCN1V31CX" target="_blank">Trump has appeared to back away</a> from some of the tariffs.</span></p>
<p>The tariff concerns are especially acute right now because of an expected national economic downturn that would impact Virginia, Northam said.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Layne said</span> it seems there could be an economic downturn on the horizon, but it will pale in comparison to 2008&#8217;s Great Recession. Trump has discussed policy changes that suggest it&#8217;s coming, he said, citing the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/white-house-officials-eyeing-payroll-tax-cut-in-effort-to-reverse-weakening-economy/2019/08/19/4cab28ec-c2bd-11e9-b72f-b31dfaa77212_story.html" target="_blank">president&#8217;s potential proposal to implement a payroll tax cut.</a></p>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">You don&#8217;t do that unless there&#8217;s something wrong,&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<p>Del. Chris Jones, the Republican chair of the House Appropriations committee, said if there is a recession, the state is prepared to weather it with about $1 billion in the reserves.</p>
<p>&#8220;We feel comfortable that we’re in a good spot, the best we’ve probably been in to deal with a recession but we don&#8217;t have any new money, really, to spend,&#8221; Jones said. &#8220;It&#8217;s business as usual, we&#8217;re not getting too excited.&#8221;</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>University spokesperson Mike Porter confirmed that the school&#8217;s housing department worked with American Campus Communities (the private real estate company that rebuilt the dorm) to convert some lounges into temporary rooms.</p>
<p>&#8220;The temporary spaces will have similar amenities as other students living on campus,&#8221; Porter said in an email. &#8220;Those students will be notified when a permanent room becomes available. These students assigned to these spaces received information about the room being a temporary room assignment prior to accepting the assignment.&#8221;</p>
<p>Because of that, Porter said, those students in the makeshift dorm rooms will pay a traditional housing rate (the <a href="https://schev.edu/docs/default-source/Reports-and-Studies/Tuition-and-Fees/201920tuitionandfeereportacc.pdf" target="_blank">State Council of Higher Education of Virginia</a> reports room and board at VCU is about $10,800 a year).</p>
<p>VCU <a href="https://commonwealthtimes.org/2018/08/24/new-grc-opens-allowing-more-freshmen-to-experience-the-suite-life/" target="_blank">opened the $96 million GRC last summer, adding about 600 beds to the school&#8217;s Monroe Park Campus</a>. It was luxurious for a dorm building, with a small gym, rooms dedicated to movie viewing, a lobby with games and several lounges residents could use for studying.</p>
<p>American Campus Communities owns several off-campus student apartments on the outskirts of VCU&#8217;s campus, but students will not be relocated there, Porter said.</p>
<p>&#8220;There can be some housing openings late in the process if students who have been accepted to VCU and provided with housing in a residence hall ultimately decide not to come,&#8221; Porter said. &#8220;We won&#8217;t have a feel for that until after Move-In is complete.&#8221;</p>
<p>Students will get an update by Sept. 6, Porter said.</p>
<p>While VCU&#8217;s temporary dorms are because of an increase in students seeking on-campus housing, Virginia Tech had to get similarly creative with housing because of an overall increase in freshman enrollment.</p>

The unexpected influx means some freshmen will be <a href="https://www.dailyprogress.com/news/education/virginia-tech-will-check-students-into-holiday-inn-for-upcoming/article_68abfd39-9a1d-522d-a2f2-a7193679b3e0.html" target="_blank">living in a nearby hotel instead of a traditional dorm.</a></p>

Police currently provide the vast majority of transports to psychiatric hospitals across Virginia.

Todd Gilbert, R-Shenandoah, wants Virginia to establish more programs that encourage people to leave violent lifestyles in order to curb shooting deaths.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Weeks after the General Assembly abruptly adjourned a special session called to address gun violence after a mass shooting in Virginia Beach, Gilbert, the House majority leader, filed legislation to create new <a href="https://www.nationalgangcenter.gov/spt/Programs/42" target="_blank">group-violence reduction</a> or intervention initiatives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?192+sum+HB4032" target="_blank">Gilbert&#8217;s bill</a> would create a new state board, a new division in the state Department of Criminal Justice Service and a pair of grant funds called Project Exit and Project Ceasefire. The bill will be evaluated by the State Crime Commission, along with the other legislation filed for the special session.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The General Assembly plans to reconvene Nov. 18 &#8211; after legislative elections &#8211; to consider bills, which ranged from universal background checks, allowing localities to decide how to regulate guns in governmental buildings and new mandatory minimum sentences for some crimes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Project Ceasefire is based off a program implemented in the 1990s in Boston to reduce youth gang violence. The city provided resources to people trying to transition out of a gang while warning people who were committing violence in the city that if they didn’t stop, they’d be punished as harshly as possible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the second year of implementation in Boston, youth homicide numbers </span><a href="https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/188741.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fell by more than 60 percent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, according to the National Institute of Justice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In Boston, violent gangs were put on notice: until the shootings stop, there will be a heavy police presence in your neighborhood. Law enforcement targets the worst offenders, and sends a clear message: Until the shooting stops, ‘business as usual’ is over,” said Gilbert, a former prosecutor, in a statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gilbert’s proposal would allow money from a new fund to be disbursed to localities, social services providers, law enforcement agencies, commonwealth&#8217;s attorneys offices and nonprofits to implement programs “substantially similar to Operation Ceasefire as implemented in Boston,” the legislation reads.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other part of Gilbert’s proposal is Project Exit, an effort to allocate money to nonprofits, social services agencies and localities to assist former gang members or people transitioning out of a gang. With the state money, those groups could offer people mentoring services, job training, GED classes or other education, housing assistance and gang-related tattoo removal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There&#8217;s something here for everybody across the political spectrum, I would hope,&#8221; Gilbert said in an interview. &#8220;I would hope when a program shows how well it is able to work in improving the lives of people especially in communities of color &#8230; that everybody would be willing to come to the table.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Violence reduction programs, especially those targeted to urban areas, are among the recommendations the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence made to reduce the number of <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/06/16/the-number-one-form-of-gun-violence-in-virginia-isnt-homicide-its-suicide/" target="_blank">gun deaths</a> in Virginia. The liberal organization was created in the early 1990s under a different name and merged with an organization formed by former Arizona Congresswoman Gabby Giffords after she seriously wounded <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/congresswoman-shot-by-gunman-in-arizona" target="_blank">in a 2011 mass shooting.</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, the Giffords center wrote, gun violence has a disproportionate impact on communities of color.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richmond topped the list for the most gun-related murders last year, with 49. Norfolk was second, with 26 and Newport News was third, with 20, according to State Police crime data.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The data also shows Newport News had the most firearm violations last year (1,407). The count includes murders and general weapons law violations. Richmond had the second-most firearm violations (1,396), then Norfolk (859).</span></p>

(Photo by Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p>Gilbert said he expects his proposed programs would be targeted to the state&#8217;s metro areas that show the &#8220;most serious and immediate need.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Ralph Northam called the special session for gun violence within days of a mass shooting in Virginia Beach that killed 12 </span>and injured four others. But he made clear he expected the General Assembly to do something to deal with day-to-day gun violence.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Less than a week before the Virginia Beach shooting, one person was killed and nine were injured at a <a href="https://pilotonline.com/news/local/crime/article_211da7a0-7faa-11e9-984c-d3da735fa014.html" target="_blank">house party in Chesapeake</a>. The same week, 9-year-old Markiya Dickson was<a href="https://wtvr.com/2019/05/27/markiya-dickson-obit/" target="_blank"> shot and killed</a> during a Memorial Day weekend party at a Richmond park.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Every life lost is a tragedy, but this most recent wave of violence has fallen disproportionately on communities of color, and the economically disadvantaged,&#8221; Gilbert said in a statement. &#8220;Children should be able to play in the park without fear. Real-world results show that these programs work. They save lives, and stop shootings before they happen.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia already has a number of small-scale violence reduction programs often funded by federal grants, said Dana Schrad, executive director of the Virginia Association of Chiefs of Police and Foundation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The money can flow through a number of agencies and offices, like the Department of Education to implement programs for children or state behavioral health offices, Schrad said. And the money is used in a number of different ways, depending on what part of the state it goes to.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have such a variety across the state because it depends a lot on the kind of crime happening in different areas,” she said. “Every area is specific and complex, whether it’s gang-related or some kind of organized criminal activity.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the more well-known violence reduction programs implemented in Virginia was<a href="https://www.crimesolutions.gov/ProgramDetails.aspx?ID=413" target="_blank"> Project Exile</a>, Schrad said. It launched in Richmond and later Norfolk in the 1990s. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Project Exile educated communities about the consequences of using illegal weapons and required people in violation of those laws to be punished with a mandatory five-year prison sentence. In Richmond, homicides decreased by 50 percent (though some attribute that to a nationwide trend of falling violent crime at the time). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike Project Exile, Gilbert’s idea includes a social services component, which is key to the effectiveness of violence reduction, said Mike McLively, spokesman for the Giffords Law Center.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s most effective when it’s not just police going in and saying, ‘We’re aware that you’re a risk and if the violence continues there’s going to be a consequence,’” he said. “It’s that combined with a very robust social services component.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s not just a talking-to from police, it’s engagement from the community.”</span></p>

<p>SCHEV&#8217;s annual tuition and fees report details increases in public college charges, including tuition, mandatory fees and room and board.</p>
<p>The agency attributed the relatively small increase in cost (about $479 more a year) to the General Assembly&#8217;s approval of additional state funding if colleges agreed to keep tuition level. <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/05/28/tuition-freezes-are-a-watershed-moment-for-college-affordability-advocates-say/" target="_blank">Every public college and university did it.</a></p>
<p>The average total cost of public college tuition and mandatory fees for an in-state undergraduate is now $12,836, with community colleges being the cheapest option at $4,620 a year. The College of William &amp; Mary was the most expensive at $23,628 a year.</p>
<p>Many students in the state pay about half of the total cost because of financial aid, the report noted.</p>
<p>Despite the small increase in average cost, Virginia public colleges and universities are still among the most expensive in the country. SCHEV staff estimated Virginia&#8217;s public research universities will be the seventh-most expensive in the country and comprehensive universities will be the fourth-most expensive based on current costs.</p>
<p>Among other findings from the report:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mandatory non-educational fees, which fund non-instructional items, increased an average of 4 percent, or $155.</li>
<li>Room and board charges, which includes dorms and meal plans, now cost an average of $11,000, a 3.5 percent increase from last year. Those charges make up 44 percent of the average Virginia student&#8217;s college costs.</li>
<li>At most public colleges and universities, student fees mostly go toward athletics. Exceptions include the University of Mary Washington, where roughly $1,332 of a student&#8217;s mandatory fee payment goes toward student unions and George Mason University, where about $1,231 of a student&#8217;s fee payment goes toward facilities.</li>
<li>Virginia&#8217;s college students currently pay for about 52 percent of the cost of college, while the state funds 48 percent of the cost. State policy calls for the state to fund 67 percent of the cost and if that was implemented, tuition could be reduced by up to $2,800, SCHEV estimated.</li>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">O’Bannon first made a motion to allow Del. Nick Freitas, R-Culpeper, on the ballot despite late and missing paperwork. When that failed, O’Bannon made a motion to allow the Republican Party to nominate someone else.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve already acted in affirmative action on a case-by-case basis after hearing the details on House District 1 and House District 76,” O’Bannon said, referring to the board’s recent decisions to <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/board-of-elections-allows-kilgore-on-ballot/" target="_blank">allow Del. Terry Kilgore, R-Scott,</a> and <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/board-of-elections-approves-another-candidate-for-the-ballot-after-paperwork-problems/" target="_blank">Chesapeake-area Democratic candidate Clint Jenkins</a> on the ballot despite late nomination paperwork.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The reason I’ve made my motion is because I’ve listened to and weighed our responsibility to allow political parties access to the ballot as opposed to the technicalities … of timelines,&#8221; he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">O&#8217;Bannon made it clear he wasn&#8217;t going to bat for Freitas because they share party affiliation: &#8220;It’s not the 30th district’s candidate’s most shining moment. I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;s helped his cause with the <a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/virginia/government-politics/general-assembly/state-elections-officials-say-it-s-too-late-to-add/article_ceb92818-f7d3-51f5-8c20-6c6b9941ea95.html" target="_blank">ad hominem attacks</a> of members of this board. I think we all serve in good faith. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have a responsibility to put candidates on the ballot.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Freitas missed the deadline to submit two key pieces of paperwork to get his name on the ballot in November. All 140 seats in the General Assembly are up for election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Freitas never submitted paperwork establishing his qualification to be a candidate or a form from local party representatives saying he won a party contest to be a candidate. Kilgore and Jenkins were only missing the paperwork from local party officials confirming their nominations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Freitas’ situation was different because he was also missing the qualification paperwork, elections Commissioner Chris Piper said at the meeting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican officials from Freitas’ area submitted a new nomination form about a week ago, Piper said. But state code says a nominee can only be replaced after the paperwork deadline if someone withdraws, dies or under other extenuating circumstances. Because Freitas never technically made it on the ballot, the later nomination didn’t count either, Piper said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is still the department’s position that because A: the candidate qualification form was not filed and B: the 511 was not filed that there was no (Republican) nominee for the 30th House District,” Piper said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bob Brink, a former Democratic delegate who served with O’Bannon, said allowing Freitas on the ballot while missing the candidate qualification form could potentially open up more than 40 single-candidate General Assembly races to a late opponent trying to get on the ballot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What we’re doing here is trying to strike a balance between the appropriate principle of access to the ballot and uphold deadlines that are in the code and promote uniformity and finality,” Brink said.</span></p>
<p>Freitas is still allowed to run a write-in campaign, which <a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/virginia/government-politics/general-assembly/state-elections-officials-say-it-s-too-late-to-add/article_ceb92818-f7d3-51f5-8c20-6c6b9941ea95.html" target="_blank">he has said he will undertake.</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jim Smith, chairman of the Madison County Republicans, told the board he was worried not letting Freitas on the ballot would disenfranchise voters. Freitas is very popular in the district, he said, and having to write him on to a ballot could cause problems. Freitas won the 2017 election with 62 percent of the district&#8217;s votes, according to the Virginia Public Access Project.</span></p>
<p>“We have many who sadly have difficulty with language, speaking and writing,” he said. “It’s going to be a very, very difficult time with a write-in.”</p>
<p>Democrat Ann Ridgeway is also running in the district, which includes Orange, Culpeper and Madison counties.</p>

Ibraheem Samirah (D-Fairfax) holds up a sign as President Donald Trump delivers remarks during the 400th anniversary celebration of the first representative legislative assembly at Jamestown on July 30, 2019 in Jamestown, Virginia.

<p>“Mr. President, you can’t send us back; Virginia is our home,” said Del. Ibraheem Samirah, D-Fairfax, shouting as he waved a sign that read &#8220;deport hate.&#8221;</p>
<p>Samirah, a Palestinian American dentist and the second Muslim lawmaker elected to the General Assembly, won a special election in February to fill the House seat vacated by Jennifer Boysko.</p>
<p>The crowd booed and chanted Trump’s name as police escorted him out of the ceremonial meeting at the Jamestown settlement, which was planned to mark the General Assembly&#8217;s status as the oldest continuously operating legislative body in North America.</p>
<p>https://twitter.com/ABC/status/1156232909742727169</p>
<p>Trump&#8217;s speech stuck primarily to the history of the settlement and the United States, making a point to mention the arrival of the first enslaved Africans in 1619, the beginning of what he called &#8220;a barbaric trade in human lives.&#8221; He also steered clear of the vitriol he has recently heaped on<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/07/30/he-should-investigate-himself-trump-echoes-fox-news-again-lash-out-elijah-cummings/?utm_term=.eca721b39472" target="_blank"> minority members of Congress</a>, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/videos/media/2019/07/28/baltimore-sun-response-trump-cummings-attack-rs-vpx.cnn" target="_blank">the city of Baltimore</a> and others.</p>
<p>He paused and looked on during the interruption, but did not remark on it directly until after the event, when he <a href="https://twitter.com/atrupar/status/1156269955878391808" target="_blank">complained</a> to reporters that the protest had dominated news coverage of his speech. &#8220;You gave the protester 100 percent of the time,&#8221; Trump said. &#8220;The protester didn&#8217;t look so good to me. I&#8217;m going to be very nice. But you gave him 100 percent.&#8221;</p>
<p>Samirah put out a statement on Twitter shortly after police escorted him out saying he believed his constituents would rather see him &#8220;stand up and be heard than sit down, be police, and passively accept the presence of a man who has sowed fear, division and hate from the highest office in the land.&#8221;</p>
<p>“400 years ago today, a group of undocumented immigrants formed a government to rule this commonwealth, beginning a centuries long tradition of people from across the world immigrating here for a chance at safety, democracy and prosperity; my parents, who are Palestinian refugees, included. The fact that the racist-in-chief, who so openly stokes hate against immigrants, was even invited to this event is insulting to Virginians and insulting to the history of our commonwealth’s democracy.&#8221;</p>
<p>https://twitter.com/IbraheemSamirah/status/1156232131485605890</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>House Speaker Kirk Cox, R-Colonial Heights, called Samirah&#8217;s move disappointing. &#8220;It was not only inconsistent with common decency, it was also a violation of the rules of the House,&#8221; he said in a statement.</p>
<p>Some Democrats, meanwhile, cheered Samirah. “I’m proud of him,” tweeted Del. Lee Carter, D-Manassas.</p>
<p>The party was divided over Trump’s visit. Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax (D) sat on stage and shook Trump&#8217;s hand alongside Republican leaders. Democratic congresswomen Elaine Luria and Jennifer Wexton also attended, as did Del. Danica Roem, who told The Washington Post she planned to use the occasion to draw attention to issues important to her by bringing “as her guest a black transgender woman who is a health-care advocate.”</p>
<p>Gov. Ralph Northam (D) extended the initial invitation, but later said he only did so at the request of the committee planning the commemorations. He was not in attendance when Trump spoke, but delivered a speech at a separate event earlier in the morning.</p>
<p>The Virginia Legislative Black Caucus boycotted the entire day of ceremonies, organizing a counter event in Richmond that included a wreath laying at the Capitol honoring black lawmakers of the Reconstruction era followed by a commemoration of the first documented arrival of enslaved Africans to Virginia, which coincides with the 400th anniversary of representative democracy at Jamestown.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Delores McQuinn, D-Richmond, a member of the caucus, sat on the steering committee that planned the Jamestown event but said she didn&#8217;t find out about Trump&#8217;s involvement until the public did. She said Trump&#8217;s involvement was a nonstarter for her. &#8220;My thoughts about it may have been different …  if it had been prior to the day he told those young ladies to go back to their countries,” McQuinn said, referring to Trump’s tweet last week directed at U.S. Democratic Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Ayanna Pressley, Rashida Tlaib.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“He wasn’t just talking about those four women of color … he was speaking to every person of color in the United State of America, make no mistake about it,” she said, addressing a crowd at the site of a former slave jail. She referred to Trump only as “The tenant in the White House.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“There were days where I sat in tears,” she said before crying onstage. “And then I said to myself, the state of Virginia can allow them to suck the energy out of them by inviting him here, but I refuse to allow him to suck the energy out of me.”</p>
<p>Members of the black caucus said they&#8217;ll participate in an event organized by the Jamestown committee next month. But caucus chair Del. Lamont Bagby, D-Henrico, said it was important to recognize the contribution of the first Africans at the same time as the first elected legislature was honored.</p>
<p>“You do not have a General Assembly, its building, the people that were here, the food that was served, you do not have that without the enslaved,” he said. “You cannot commemorate one without another.”</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Historically, access to higher education has been dramatically unequal,” the report stated. “This pattern persists today as African-American and Latino students struggle to fund their college experiences due to broad societal discrimination …  As a result, students of color accumulate high levels of unsustainable debt.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fifty-six percent of college graduates in Virginia have student loan debt when they graduate, the Institute for College Access and Success estimates. The average graduate in the state has $29,887 in loans, close to the national average of $29,669. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Christopher Newport University has the highest average debt per graduate, according to the institute’s data, at $32,994. Old Dominion University is close behind, with an average $32,092 debt among graduates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Virginia State University, a historically black college, has the highest proportion of students graduating with debt. According to the institute, 92 percent of VSU’s graduates leave with some sort of student loan debt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The institute doesn’t have information on how that average might be different among races, but the Center for Responsible Lending estimated the the average white college student in the United States graduates with $30,093 in debt; black graduates with $33,993 and Latino graduates have $25,452 in debt at the end of an undergraduate career.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Almost half of black borrowers owe more on a degree four years after getting it compared to 17 percent of white graduates, the Center for Responsible Lending’s report found. That happens in part because minorities &#8220;are too often preyed upon by poor quality for-profit institutions,&#8221; the report claims.</span></p>
<p>Latino students, who typically borrow the least amount of money, are more likely to drop out of college which can lead to issues in repayment, the report stated.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Student debt is a significant drag on the economy as it depresses the purchasing power of millions, preventing people from starting families, investing in their own businesses, going back to school and buying homes,” the report states. “And because students of color carry larger debt burdens, these consequences also exacerbate the racial wealth divide by impacting families of color the most acutely.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The center, which has been a proponent of <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/07/10/738506646/student-debt-forgiveness-sounds-good-what-might-happen-if-the-government-did-it" target="_blank">debt-cancellation policies</a> that some Democratic presidential candidates have presented, suggested implementing such a policy in its report.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Without action, this problem will only worsen,” it states.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, the cost of college was the impetus for a tuition freeze at public schools. But legislation to tackle student loan debt has been slower to make its way into law.</span></p>
<p>Student loan debt and college costs have already created another problem for the state: It&#8217;s one of the reasons<span style="font-weight: 400;"> officials think </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/03/31/that-really-wears-on-you-pay-challenges-of-poor-districts-pushing-virginia-teachers-out-of-the-classroom/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">people aren’t entering the teaching profession</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. That’s lead to a statewide teacher shortage (there were 900 unfilled teaching positions at the beginning of the last school year) and a specifically low number of non-white teachers entering the profession.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The State Council of Higher Education for Virginia recently </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/state-approves-new-teacher-education-programs-to-fight-shortage/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">approved several teacher education</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> programs at colleges that will cut down the amount of time, and money, it takes to become a teacher.</span></p>

<p>The board is going through its regular process of amending the <span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://www.doe.virginia.gov/boe/quality/" target="_blank">Standards of Quality</a>, or SOQs. SOQs provide guidelines for minimum resources in schools related to staffing, student achievement and graduation, accreditation and other areas.</span></p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/constitution/article8/section2" target="_blank">state Constitution</a>, only the General Assembly can revise the board&#8217;s standards of quality. It&#8217;s also up to lawmakers to &#8220;determine the manner in which funds are to be provided for the cost of maintaining an educational program meeting the prescribed standards of quality,&#8221; as well as deciding how costs should be split between the state and local governments.</p>
<p>Lawmakers could fund education according to the standards &#8212; though they haven&#8217;t in several years, said <span style="font-weight: 400;">Jim Livingston, president of the Virginia Education Association.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The boards’ proposed Standards of Quality are “foundational components of Virginia’s education program,” board documents stated. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adding a standard that addresses how much money a certain fund should get is a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">maneuver that puts pressure on lawmakers <a href="https://www.thecommonwealthinstitute.org/2018/07/12/state-k-12-funding-in-virginia-incremental-progress-and-opportunity-for-long-term-solutions/" target="_blank">who have been slow to restore education funding</a> to pre-recession levels, Livingston said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s really a way to force the hand of the General Assembly to say, ‘Look, you’ve been shortchanging K-12 for years and it’s time for you to step up,’” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The standards are revised every two years (which coincides with state budgets) and this round of changes better reflects what’s actually happening in localities, Livingston said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The General Assembly cut K-12 education funding during the recession and since then, many localities have had to pay for more staff and other items the state no longer covers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The board discussed the new standards and changes to existing ones this week and will make a decision on them in September.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In total, the board is considering changes that would cost just about a billion dollars per year if funded as presented. Here are some of the items up for consideration:</span></p>
<p><b>At-risk add-on funding</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The at-risk add on is money distributed for general use by school districts with high concentrations of students on free and reduced lunch. It’s allocated in the budget and can be used for anything a school deems necessary.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state has limited information on how school districts use at-risk add on money, board documents stated. After lawmakers approved a teacher pay raise this year, some school systems said they could use the at-risk add on money for the <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/01/16/some-school-districts-may-struggle-to-find-local-match-for-proposed-teacher-pay-raise/" target="_blank">local share of the pay raise.</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At a committee meeting this week, Department of Education staff suggested clarifying that the at-risk add on had to be used for staff unless 55 percent or more of the school&#8217;s population was on free or reduced lunch. Those schools could use additional money for support positions (like nurses) or hiring and retention incentives.</span></p>
<p>The proposal would cost $4.9 to $77.4 million more a year, depending on the proportion of at-risk students in a given school district.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If the General Assembly funds the at-risk add on as proposed, it frees up local dollars so those localities can use that money for other things like salary increases,&#8221; Livingston said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/02/25/no-short-road-to-redemption-budget-is-a-step-toward-racial-reconciliation-black-lawmakers-say/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> most recent General Assembly</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> session, lawmakers approved adding $25 million over two years for the at-risk add on fund. Gov. Ralph</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/12/11/with-a-positive-economic-outlook-northam-proposes-teacher-pay-raise-more-money-for-school-construction/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Northam had proposed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> putting $35 million more in the fund before the session began.</span></p>
<p><b>Class sizes</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: One budget item the Board of Education wants to move under the new at-risk add on standard is funding to keep classrooms at an optimal size.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Class size reduction money has been in the budget since the mid-1990s. The state currently pays for capping class sizes up to third grade at 19 to 24 students, depending on age and the percentage of students on free and reduced lunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The original proposal suggested extending class-size reduction measures up to sixth grade, for an annual cost of $213.8 million a year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The board has directed staff to consider cutting the class size reduction item (and some other proposals) and move that possible future funding under the at-risk add on to give school systems more freedom in deciding how to use money. </span></p>
<p><b>More money for certain teachers</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The other major standard change the board wanted to move under the at-risk add on was an effort to keep experienced teachers in high-poverty schools. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposal would make it standard practice to pay teachers with five or more years of experience $6,000-$12,000 extra a year if they </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">teach at a school with at least 70 percent of its students on free or reduced lunch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A higher percentage of students on free or reduced lunch would mean more additional pay. </span></p>
<p><b>Specialized student support personnel: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">A new standard would move nurses, school social workers and psychologists into a new staffing category to remove them from the state’s decade-old support staff cap.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cap limits how many school staff — custodians, nurses, social workers, psychologists and others — the state will pay for. Lawmakers put it in place during the recession. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposed standard for nurses, social workers and psychologists would consider four specialized student support positions per 1,000 students an adequate number. It would cost $100 million more per year, VDOE staff estimated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While the recommendation … would not specify ratios for each individual position, it would ensure that students across the commonwealth have access to student support services,” board documents stated. “This approach would provide school divisions with flexibility to determine how these positions should be filled based upon local conditions.”</span></p>
<p><b>Lifting the support staff cap</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The board also wants to reaffirm its 2016 recommendation to lift the support cap. It would be a $371 million </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">annual undertaking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond, asked the Senate Finance committee to consider lifting </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/richmond-area-senator-wants-to-restore-pre-recession-school-staffing-levels/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">all or some of the support cap earlier this year.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> She said at the time she didn’t expect lawmakers to do it all at once, so instead asked school divisions what was most important.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their response: nurses, social workers and psychologists, which the Board of Education has proposed moving out from under the cap.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The board included a number of previously approved standards in this year’s proposal, including its preference for having one guidance counselor for every 250 students in every school.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Robin Lind, a member of the Virginia Electoral Board Association and Goochland County Electoral Board, said he knows of at least one instance of a registrar only getting a portion of the promised increase.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“All of our lobbying efforts did not go through,” Lind said at a General Registrar/Electoral Board workgroup meeting this week. The workgroup was created in 2014 to study duties and pay for board members and registrars. Several registrars at the meeting said they had heard of similar cases.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year, the state approved a <a href="https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/get/budget/3929/" target="_blank">3% raise for some state employees</a>, including registrars, and an additional 3% specifically for registrars. Most other state employees got a 2.75 percent raise. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers also agreed to complete a study exploring the <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/02/28/general-registrars-will-get-higher-salaries-but-will-have-to-wait-on-a-new-pay-scale/" target="_blank">possibility of paying registrars like constitutional officers.</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Localities share the cost of paying registrars, who are technically state employees. The state is supposed to reimburse municipalities for registrars’ pay, which is based on population. Cities and counties can add more money to it, but that supplement has to be paid for with local funds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state has scaled back how much it reimburses localities for registrar pay, Lind said. The state reimburses localities about 70 percent of registrars’ mandated pay, according to two-year old compensation data the workgroup has collected. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lind thinks that’s part of the reason the approved raise isn’t showing up in registrars’ paychecks. Localities may be taking the additional state money and using it to make up the difference between how much the state reimburses and what localities pay for registrars&#8217; salaries, not adding it to the registrars&#8217; paychecks.</span></p>
<p>“If the state was reimbursing 100 percent, then I think the localities would say, ‘Sure, we’ll pass it on,’” he said.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s allowable, as long as the locality is paying the registrar the required amount set by the state.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s no way to know how many general registrars around the state could be missing out on their full raise because there’s little uniformity in how registrars are compensated outside of the statutory base pay, Lind said. The required contribution to the state retirement system, for example, may be reported as a local supplement, which means it&#8217;s not take-home pay.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The State Council of Higher Education of Virginia approved guidelines for the Passport program this week. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The program puts community college students through general education classes that will be accepted at almost every public university or college, cutting the amount of time the student has to spend at more expensive four-year schools.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?181+sum+SB631" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Siobhan Dunnavant</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, R- Henrico, and </span><a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?181+sum+HB919" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Chris Jones</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, R-Suffolk introduced legislation in 2018 to create the Passport and the Uniform Certificate of General Studies. The certificate requires twice as many classes as the Passport to cut out about a year of college for students. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The programs come amid heightened attention to the cost of Virginia&#8217;s public colleges and universities. In Norfolk Thursday, Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam <a href="https://pilotonline.com/news/local/education/higher-education/article_b733396a-a964-11e9-b912-fbdfc4a19bdb.html" target="_blank">said he will</a> roll out a plan for a &#8220;tuition for service&#8221; model for free community college. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And this year, state lawmakers struck a deal to offer state institutions of higher education more money <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/05/28/tuition-freezes-are-a-watershed-moment-for-college-affordability-advocates-say/" target="_blank">if they agree to freeze tuition</a>. A 2014 report from the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission called Virginia’s public institutions “among the nation’s most expensive for students.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also on Thursday, House Speaker Kirk Cox, R-Colonial Heights, said he would push to freeze tuition again when the legislature convenes in January. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/SpeakerCox/status/1151888794552942592?s=20" target="_blank">https://twitter.com/SpeakerCox/status/1151888794552942592?s=20</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Passport will offer roughly one semester of general education classes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SCHEV and Virginia Community College System staff still have to finalize some of the courses that are included in each program. Under Jones&#8217; and Dunnavant&#8217;s legislation, Passport and the Uniform Certificate have to be ready for enrollment by the 2020 school year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, one English course in the Passport program won’t count at James Madison University and the College of William and Mary, and one of the math classes in the programs won’t transfer to Christopher Newport University. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is a very significant step forward for transfer students in Virginia,” said Sharon Morrissey, chief academic officer for the Virginia Community College System. “The overall intention is that we&#8217;re trying to make transfer more affordable, more efficient and more equitable particularly for those first-generation college students who don’t have parents or people who are helping them navigate the very complex transfer process.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Community college students have a number of ways to transfer to four-year institutions.The </span><a href="http://jlarc.virginia.gov/pdfs/reports/Rpt495.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> counted nearly 300 different transfer agreements between community colleges and four-year institutions in 2017.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schools can create degree-specific agreements or agreements based on geography, like the </span><a href="https://tncc.edu/wm" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">one between William &amp; Mary and Thomas Nelson Community College.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The basic and most well-known transfer process requires a student to finish an associate degree at a community college and then enter a four-year institution as a junior, as long as they’ve maintained a certain grade point average. In theory, those students will have finished their general education requirements and are taking classes toward a specialized major. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But most students don’t pursue that route, and instead transfer to four-year colleges with credits that don’t always fulfill any prerequisites. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If they were just randomly taking courses and transferring before they get their associate degree, they had to look up every individual course to make sure it transferred,” said Joe DeFilippo, director of academic affairs and planning for SCHEV. Many students don&#8217;t do that or can&#8217;t find the right information to plan correctly, DeFilippo said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students who transfer from a community college to four-year institutions usually earn more credits when pursuing a bachelor’s degree, according to the JLARC study. But it takes transfer students an average of five years to finish a bachelor&#8217;s program, while non-transfer students usually take four years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Depending on what school a student goes to, that can be an additional $18,000 to $25,000 annual cost, Morrissey said.</span></p>
<p>In addition to the Passport and uniform certificate program, Morrissey said there has been regional collaboration between community colleges and four-year schools to lay out degree program-specific coursework for students, who tend to transfer to schools near the community college they attend.</p>
<p>For example, Morrissey said, J. Sargeant Reynolds Community College may create general education pathways that fulfill specific requirements for programs at Virginia Commonwealth University, the closest four-year college.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The State Council for Higher Education of Virginia approved William and Mary’s new program this week. The council must approve new degree programs at accredited institutions of higher education. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re excited to offer students a deeper engagement with Japanese culture, society, politics and business, and to give them the cultural knowledge and linguistic skills to become experts on Japan,&#8221; said Michael Cronin, program director for Japanese Studies and associate professor of modern languages at William &amp; Mary. &#8220;We certainly appreciate SCHEV’s recognition of the value and promise of this program.”</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students at the University of Virginia can pursue a Japanese major through the school&#8217;s interdisciplinary studies program, which allows students to design their own major. At UVA, students get a bachelor&#8217;s degree in interdisciplinary studies. At William &amp; Mary, students will get a bachelor&#8217;s degree in Japanese Studies that includes learning the language and culture.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. State Department considers Japanese one of the most difficult languages for native English speakers to learn, SCHEV wrote in <a href="https://www.schev.edu/docs/default-source/about-section/council-files/2019-council-meetings/july-council-files/agenda-book-(for-posting-on-sitefinity).pdf" target="_blank">agenda materials</a> about William &amp; Mary’s new program. But it’s an important language and culture to know &#8212; Japan is one of the world&#8217;s largest economies and one of the U.S’ “most important allies,” SCHEV wrote, summarizing <a href="https://www.state.gov/u-s-relations-with-japan/" target="_blank">information from the U.S. State Department.</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Japanese is considered one of the 10 most important languages to know in the business world and one of the most common languages used on the internet, staff noted.</span></p>
<p>Plus, there appears to be enough William &amp; Mary students interested in pursuing a Japanese major to meet <a href="https://www.schev.edu/docs/default-source/institution-section/GuidancePolicy/policies-and-guidelines/programproductivitypolicyrevisedoct2013.pdf" target="_blank">SCHEV&#8217;s policy on academic program viability.</a></p>
<p>Lower-level Japanese language courses have been among the most popular at the college, surpassing enrollment in Chinese classes (which is notable because William &amp; Mary already offers a Chinese Language and Culture major). And in a survey of of 73 students enrolled in Japanese language courses at the school this past spring semester, 52 percent said they would have declared a Japanese major if it had been available.</p>
<p>William &amp; Mary anticipates its first class of Japanese Studies majors will be 12 students in the 2023-4 academic year.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other degree programs waiting for SCHEV approval include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bachelor of Science in data science at William &amp; Mary</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Master of Science in athletic training at Radford University.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bachelor of Science in health sciences at Virginia Commonwealth University</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Doctorate in business; master’s of science in cybersecurity engineering; Master of Law in cyber, intelligence and national security; and master&#8217;s degree in climate science at George Mason University</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Master of Science in data science and analytics at Old Dominion University</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Master of Arts in media culture and technology; and master’s degree in urban design program at University of Virginia </span></li>

<p>The amount breaks the agency&#8217;s previous record of $606 million put toward education last year.</p>
<p>The Lottery&#8217;s profits came from $2.29 billion in sales, Lottery Director Kevin Hall said at a Lottery Board meeting Wednesday. The sales also broke the agency&#8217;s previous record of $2.1 billion last year.</p>
<p>Unclaimed prizes, which amounted to $6.5 million last fiscal year, are deposited into the Literary Fund. That provides resources for schools to finance capital projects, like building repairs.</p>
<p>The agency pays out retailers who sell Lottery games, funds its operating expenses and pays out prizes from annual sales. The leftover money, or profit, is used for state education funding.</p>
<p>“The Lottery uses responsible business principles to efficiently deliver these profits for its stakeholders—the people of Virginia and Virginia’s K-12 public schools,” Lottery Board Chairman Ferhan Hamid said in <a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/all-releases/2019/july/headline-841684-en.html" target="_blank">a statement</a>.</p>
<p>“Whether or not you choose to purchase lottery products, your local public schools still share in the benefits of this well-run business.”</p>
<p>Approximately 10 percent of Virginia’s education budget comes from the Lottery, <a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/all-releases/2019/july/headline-841684-en.html" target="_blank">according to a statement</a> from Gov. Ralph Northam.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Students and teachers in every part of our commonwealth continue to benefit from the Virginia Lottery’s record-high proceeds, and with an increase in the Lottery per Pupil Allocation, our school districts have more flexibility to use Lottery profits to meet their diverse needs,” </span>Northam said.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"> “With this funding we are not only supporting a variety of important programs in our public schools, we are also making critical investments in our young Virginians and expanding opportunities for them to succeed.”</p>

(Robert Zullo/ Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before the short special session on gun control earlier this week, hundreds of gun rights advocates poured into the city block around the capitol and legislative building. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They wore shirts and hats with the National Rifle Association’s logo and sported bright orange “Guns Save Lives” stickers. Some showed up with handguns in holsters. Others carried rifles slung over their shoulders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They filled House and Senate chambers, hallways and afternoon committee meetings. </span></p>
<p>And when Republicans abruptly voted to adjourn until November while the State Crime Commission studies proposed gun legislation, it was the Fairfax-based NRA that was the focus of Democrats&#8217; ire.</p>
<p>“The Republicans in this state are totally controlled — I mean 100 percent — controlled by the National Rifle Association. Anybody who doubts that, go take a look where the money is spent and go take a look at their votes,&#8221; Senate Minority Leader Dick Saslaw, D-Fairfax, told <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/gun-debate-hits-full-throttle-in-richmond-as-legislature-convenes/2019/07/09/caf20590-a1d4-11e9-bd56-eac6bb02d01d_story.html?utm_term=.765e1c16f861" target="_blank">The Washington Post.</a></p>
<p>Sen. Mamie Locke, D-Hampton, tweeted state Republicans are <a href="https://twitter.com/SenatorLocke/status/1148735062520848384" target="_blank">&#8220;bought and sold by the NRA&#8221;</a> once the session adjourned.</p>
<figure id="attachment_9956" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:300px;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-9956 size-medium" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/DSCF7448-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/DSCF7448-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/DSCF7448-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/DSCF7448-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/DSCF7448-696x464.jpg 696w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/DSCF7448-1068x712.jpg 1068w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/DSCF7448-630x420.jpg 630w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/DSCF7448-1920x1280.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Many rally attendees carried guns, which are allowed on Capitol Square and within the Capitol building itself with a concealed carry permit. (Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p>But the NRA&#8217;s money in Virginia doesn&#8217;t go very far. Instead, analysts and people who work in Virginia politics say the power of the NRA comes from the sheer number of voters who align themselves with the organization and show up at the polls and in front of lawmakers, especially in solid red districts where politicians&#8217; biggest fear is a primary challenge from the right.</p>
<p>“It’s their capacity to mobilize people at election time, ” said Bob Holsworth, a longtime Virginia political analyst. “It’s a better strategy to have the grassroots support than it is to pump dollars in.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The NRA has donated less than a million dollars total to state lawmakers since 1996, the earliest year available through the </span><a href="https://www.vpap.org/donors/137269-national-rifle-association/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Public Access Project.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The NRA has typically given to Republican political action and campaign committees in <a href="https://www.vpap.org/donors/137269-national-rifle-association/?start_year=all&amp;end_year=all" target="_blank">recent years, </a>according to the Virginia Public Access Project.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_9980" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:300px;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-9980" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/BecauseFU-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/BecauseFU-300x225.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/BecauseFU-768x576.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/BecauseFU-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/BecauseFU-80x60.jpg 80w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/BecauseFU-265x198.jpg 265w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/BecauseFU-696x522.jpg 696w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/BecauseFU-1068x801.jpg 1068w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/BecauseFU-560x420.jpg 560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/BecauseFU.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Two men watch demonstrations outside the Virginia Capitol Tuesday during a special session of the legislature called to consider gun control legislation.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By contrast, heavyweight utility Dominion Energy spent $11 million and tobacco giant Altria pumped $6 million into Virginia politics in the same time period. Both companies are some of the most prolific political donors in the state.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The National Rifle Association’s strength comes from our nearly 5 million members and their passion for our Second Amendment freedoms,” said Catherine Mortensen, spokesperson for the NRA. The organization doesn&#8217;t provide state membership counts, she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There have been some reports that the NRA’s membership is lower than it reports, based on tax documents or magazine subscriptions. Some estimate the organization has </span><a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2018/03/nra-membership-magazine-numbers-1/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">inflated its membership numbers by millions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Others estimate </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2018/02/26/nobody-knows-how-many-members-the-nra-has-but-its-tax-returns-offer-some-clues/?utm_term=.1079c1b0f026" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">membership is flattening out. </span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right now, Virginia NRA members are preparing for November’s General Assembly elections, Mortensen said. All 140 seats in the legislature are up for re-election and Republicans hold a small majority in both chambers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The NRA and two other pro-gun organizations, Gun Owners of America and the Virginia Citizens Defense League, are membership-based and send regular email, text and social media alerts about pending legislation or other political actions. The alerts often call on members to vote or show up on important days, like last week&#8217;s special session. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re very focused on grassroots and in fact, that’s kind of our bread and butter,” said Jordan Stein, spokesperson for the Virginia-based Gun Owners of America. “I think it’s more of a constitutional approach to let the voters hold their elected officials accountable.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Between 1997 and 2013, Gun Owners of America </span><a href="https://www.vpap.org/donors/127815-gun-owners-of-america/?start_year=all&amp;end_year=all" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">gave $21,000</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to Republican politicians and its own PAC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Citizens Defense League, another grassroots group that opposes stricter </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">gun laws, gave $91,000 to various Republican campaigns between 2002 and 2018.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We don’t have any billionaires laying around who want to contribute,” said Philip Van Cleave, president of the Virginia Citizens Defense League, mentioning Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun reform group funded by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. That organization has <a href="https://www.vpap.org/donors/229503-everytown-for-gun-safety/?start_year=all&amp;end_year=all" target="_blank">given $4.7 million</a> since 2013 to various Virginia Democratic campaigns, PACs and the state Democratic party.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We don’t have that kind of money to fight back but it’s not all about money, it’s about getting the right people elected. What we have is grassroots, we have people out there,&#8221; Van Cleave said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many gun owners are passionate about not changing Virginia’s gun laws and make that the deciding factor when voting, he said. People who want to tighten gun laws typically don’t vote like that, Van Cleave said.</span></p>
<h2><strong>&#8216;They want the A-rating &#8230; not the money&#8217;</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There can be intense political pressure that comes with voting against groups like the VCDL, Gun Owners of America and especially the NRA, Holsworth said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Inside the Republican Party, there’s a genuine sense that if the NRA is against you in a primary, that could be very troublesome for a candidate,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One way the NRA applies that pressure is with its grading system, which rates lawmakers on an A-F scale, like grades on a school project. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The NRA has rarely given any Republican in the state lower than a “C” grade in elections since 2009, according to available ratings. The organization doesn’t have old grades listed on its website, but Everytown for Gun Safety has a list dating back to 2009 for most politicians in the country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some grades aren’t available in </span><a href="https://everytown.org/nra-grades-archive/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everytown’s data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> because the candidate didn’t fill out the NRA’s questionnaire and didn’t have a voting record.</span></p>
<p>A perfect grade from the NRA was something Sen. Emmett Hanger, R-Augusta, touted during a primary against Tina Freitas, the wife of Del. Nick Freitas, R-Culpeper. Tina Freitas, who frequently posted campaign videos while<a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1990167754426248" target="_blank"> wearing a large revolver</a> on her hip, said Hanger wasn&#8217;t conservative enough on issues like abortion and guns. Hanger, brandishing his NRA grade, fended off the challenge.</p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p>&#8220;I have an A rating by the NRA and am proud to be endorsed by them consistently over the years,&#8221; Hanger wrote on <a href="https://www.emmetthanger.com/issues" target="_blank">his website.</a> &#8220;I am also proud to be co-chair of the Sportsman Caucus in the General Assembly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Those grades seem to be what drives some Republican lawmakers, said <span style="font-weight: 400;">Andrew Goddard, who has spent 12 years lobbying for stricter gun laws at the Capitol. His son was shot four times and survived the 2007 Virginia Tech massacre.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I came to the conclusion that their power or perceived power came from their ability to muster voters who are single-issue who will vote against somebody if they step out of line,” he said. “They want the A-rating from the NRA, not the money.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the past, Holsworth said, even prominent Democrats wanted the NRA’s approval. Notably, U.S. Sen. </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/06/us/virginia-nra-guns-northam.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mark Warner sought NRA support</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> during the 2001 gubernatorial race. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That has since changed and Democrats don’t seek a high rating from the NRA, diluting the influence the organization has outside of the Republican party, Holsworth said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’d like to think they have less (influence) because of their problems with </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/06/26/736255639/turmoil-at-the-nra-tv-channel-ends-lobbyist-resigns-a-new-hill-probe-begins" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">finance and corruption</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” Goddard said. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’d like to think that is going to weaken their situation.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>There have been inquiries into the NRA&#8217;s <a href="https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/452849-dc-ag-subpoenas-nra-financial-records-in-investigation" target="_blank">finances</a> and alleged<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/28/us/nra-russia-maria-butina-investigations.html" target="_blank"> ties to Russia</a>.</p>

<p>Clinton Jenkins, a Democrat challenging Del. Chris Jones, R-Suffolk, won a party nomination process but the local party chair responsible for submitting the paperwork to the state used the wrong email address to send it in.</p>
<p>It meant he wasn&#8217;t officially the Democratic nominee for the 76th District, which includes parts of Suffolk and Chesapeake.</p>
<p>Jenkins&#8217; paperwork made it to other officials though, including the local registrar, according to emails submitted to the Board of Elections.</p>
<p>The local committee put forth a &#8220;good effort&#8221; to get the paperwork in, Jenkins said at the meeting, flanked by party officials. He called the situation a &#8220;computer glitch.&#8221;</p>
<p>He&#8217;s not the first candidate this election cycle to have their paperwork mixed up.</p>
<p>The board allowed <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/board-of-elections-allows-kilgore-on-ballot/" target="_blank">Del. Terry Kilgore, R-Scott, on the ballot</a> as the official party nominee late last month after he submitted affidavits from local party officials that he won a party nomination. He thought his paperwork was mailed or faxed to the state, but it didn&#8217;t arrive in Richmond by nomination deadline.</p>
<p>At its emergency meeting on Thursday, the Board of Elections deferred a decision on Del. Nick Freitas, R-Culpeper, who didn&#8217;t submit two documents necessary to be on a ballot. One certifies he won a party nomination and the other is a <a href="https://www.elections.virginia.gov/media/formswarehouse/Campaign-Finance/2018/Candidates/SBE_501_6-rev7-18.pdf" target="_blank">general certification of a candidate.</a> It asks questions such as residency and criminal status and every candidate must complete it, regardless of whether they&#8217;re running for a party nomination.</p>
<p>The board will seek guidance from the Attorney General&#8217;s Office on Freitas&#8217; situation &#8220;expeditiously,&#8221; said chair Bob Brink.</p>
<p>Brink and fellow board member John O&#8217;Bannon aren&#8217;t strangers to the nomination process. Both were in the House of Delegates — Brink represented the Arlington area for 16 years and O&#8217;Bannon represented part of Henrico County for 16 years as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;This has been a very painful year for both parties,&#8221; O&#8217;Bannon said of the nomination snafus the <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/gov-northam-appoints-a-new-board-of-elections-while-considering-bill-to-change-membership/" target="_blank">new board</a> has dealt with in the last month.</p>
<p>&#8220;On that, I concur,&#8221; Brink said.</p>

</p><p style="font-weight: 400;">Huge crowds of advocates on both sides of the gun debate crammed into the Capitol on Tuesday, one heavily armed with rifles and pistols and the other wearing red T-shirts and ready with a string of chants.</p>
<p>Both left surprised when a special session to take up gun <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/the-8-bills-northam-wants-passed-in-the-special-session/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/the-8-bills-northam-wants-passed-in-the-special-session/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1562794935435000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEpRzvM-Zgac34IhKUKNcwOAgPP3Q" target="_blank">legislation</a> following the mass shooting in Virginia Beach concluded about 90 minutes after it began with no bills considered, heard or otherwise discussed.</p>
<h2 style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>An abrupt ending followed by a promised study</strong></h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">After a handful of speeches and a brief debate over the rules that would govern the session, Republican majorities in the House and the Senate voted to adjourn until Nov. 18 – two weeks after the General Election in which every House and Senate seat will be up for election.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats, who had pressed Republicans to hold floor votes on legislation, appeared caught off guard, but their attempts to protest the move were shut down in both chambers on procedural grounds.</p>
<figure id="attachment_9955" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="max-width:100%;width:5518px;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-9955" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/DSCF2081.jpg" alt="" width="5518" height="3679" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/DSCF2081.jpg 1920w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/DSCF2081-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/DSCF2081-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/DSCF2081-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/DSCF2081-696x464.jpg 696w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/DSCF2081-1068x712.jpg 1068w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/DSCF2081-630x420.jpg 630w" sizes="(max-width: 5518px) 100vw, 5518px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  House Speaker Kirk Cox, R-Colonial Heights, and Senate Majority Leader Tommy Norment, R-James City, talk to reporters Tuesday following the abrupt adjournment of the special session called by the governor on gun violence.

<p style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Did I hear correct that the date was Nov. 18?&#8221; Democratic Caucus Chair Charniele Herring, D-Alexandria asked on the floor.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">House Speaker Kirk Cox, R-Colonial Heights, and Senate Majority Leader Tommy Norment, R-James City County, told reporters at a joint news conference that all the legislation filed during the special session would be referred to the State Crime Commission, which has agreed to conduct “a systemic review of the events that occurred in Virginia Beach and proposed legislative changes to Virginia’s laws concerning firearms and public safety.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">They blamed Gov. Ralph Northam, who called the special session days after the Virginia Beach shooting, for not taking a more deliberate approach, citing the commission then-Gov. Tim Kaine established to develop recommendations after the 2007 mass shooting at Virginia Tech.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Because the governor failed to establish a blue ribbon commission, the Crime Commission will undertake this responsibility,” Norment said.</p>
<h2 style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>‘Shameful and disappointing’</strong></h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats were furious. House Minority Leader Eileen Filler-Corn, D-Fairfax, was “almost shaking,” <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/gun-debate-hits-full-throttle-in-richmond-as-legislature-convenes/2019/07/09/caf20590-a1d4-11e9-bd56-eac6bb02d01d_story.html?utm_term=.4242fa0e22bf" target="_blank">according to The Washington Post</a>, which reported her response as “shocked.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Ralph Northam issued a stern statement: “It is shameful and disappointing that Republicans in the General Assembly refuse to do their jobs, and take immediate action to save lives,” he said. “I expected better of them. Virginians expect better of them.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats dismissed the idea that longstanding legislative proposals for things like universal background checks, red flag laws and allowing local governments to ban guns in municipal buildings required a study.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">“The bills themselves are no longer in concept, they’re policy issues up and down,” said Northam’s secretary of public safety, Brian Moran, who served in the legislature for 13 years and was a member of the commission.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In his experience, the crime commission has helped lawmakers turn ideas into legislation by working on technical language. Most of the legislation proposed by the Democrats has already been through that process, Moran said. He pointed to the legislation to reinstate Virginia’s one-handgun-a-month rule, which was put into law in the early 1990s and repealed in 2012.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“The crime commission doesn’t need to study that,” Moran said.</p>
<h2 style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>GOP leader drops gun bill after caucus revolt</strong></h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The pro-gun side came in expecting a fight, particularly after catching wind of legislation <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/virginia-beach-republican-to-push-bill-allowing-municipalities-to-ban-guns-in-government-buildings/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/virginia-beach-republican-to-push-bill-allowing-municipalities-to-ban-guns-in-government-buildings/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1562794935436000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHj_JXSOduOHYZfTbKIcPeepG18lg" target="_blank">filed</a> by Norment that would have banned guns in municipal buildings around the state.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Citizens Defense League sent an email to its supporters just before 1 a.m. with the subject line: “Senator Tommy Norment stabs gun owners in the back!”</p>
<p>Philip Van Cleave, the group&#8217;s president, said the organization put major pressure on Norment.</p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p>&#8220;We sent about 6,000 people his way,&#8221; Van Cleave said.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">It all turned out to be a confusing charade that fell apart when the GOP whip in the Senate, Bill Stanley, R-Franklin, threatened to resign his leadership post over the proposal.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The caucus refused to accept Stanely’s resignation and Norment later said he had only filed the bill in an attempt to catch Democrats in a political trap. He noted that the way it was drafted would have blocked police officers from carrying guns in their stations.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“In this theater of politics, I had some Machiavellian thoughts,” said Norment, who has a <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/01/21/bi-partisan-support-for-15-minimum-wage-vanishes-and-a-political-ploy-appears-in-va-senate/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/01/21/bi-partisan-support-for-15-minimum-wage-vanishes-and-a-political-ploy-appears-in-va-senate/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1562794935436000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEhKyY9c9-kWMrO-xlGm8I_Q3Og-w" target="_blank">history</a> of voting for legislation he opposes to make political points. “I thought perhaps the administration might bite on that.”</p>
<h2 style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>A delegate touched by violence pushes back on good-guy theory</strong></h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In conversation after conversation, opponents of legislation limiting where guns can be carried cited the good-guy theory of violence prevention.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Gun-free zones equal murder zones,” said Brandon Howard, a Hopewell resident carrying a large rifle in front of the Capitol. “If you have a gun-free zone, the only way you have to defend yourselves is none. The only way you’re going to stop a person with a gun is with a gun.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Chris Hurst, D-Roanoke, pushed back hard on that narrative an emotional floor speech recalling the on-air murder of his girlfriend, WDBJ reporter Alison Parker, and her co-worker Adam Ward. He described a recent conversation with a gun advocate who told him that if he had been there or she had been armed it might not have happened.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“I had to cut him off,” Hurst said. “That &#8216;what if&#8217; has tormented me from the day I personally became impacted by gun violence. … What if I had been there. We hear these faux attempts at masculinity every time there’s an act of violence or a vigilante thinks he could be that marksman shot in a crisis. …</p>

Chris Hurst, D-Blacksburg, speaks on the House floor Tuesday. (Ned Oliver/ Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“The duty falls on us here in this body to protect the citizens of this commonwealth. To protect the citizens of this commonwealth. To shift the responsibility from teachers, clergy, lovers, fathers and mothers and put it all back on them is not the social contract I signed up for.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The speech drew loud applause from his fellow Democrats. In the gallery, a man wearing a shirt that read “Gun control is bullshit” responded by repeatedly shouting, “You’re full of baloney.”</p>
<h2 style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Analysts say Democrats may have left with upper hand</strong></h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Even though legislation didn’t go anywhere, Democrats still may have come out on top because the session was set up to be a win for Democrats no matter what happened, said Rachel Bitecofer, assistant director of the Wason Center for Public Policy at Christopher Newport University.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Either the Republicans come to the table and do something about gun control or they don’t and Democrats would have a really hot-ticket item they could go back and campaign on this fall in these competitive districts they’re hoping to win,” Bitecofer said.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">All 140 seats in the General Assembly as up for reelection in November.</p>
<figure id="attachment_9956" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="max-width:100%;width:5557px;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-9956" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/DSCF7448.jpg" alt="" width="5557" height="3705" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/DSCF7448.jpg 5557w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/DSCF7448-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/DSCF7448-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/DSCF7448-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/DSCF7448-696x464.jpg 696w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/DSCF7448-1068x712.jpg 1068w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/DSCF7448-630x420.jpg 630w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/DSCF7448-1920x1280.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 5557px) 100vw, 5557px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Many rally attendees carried guns, which are allowed on Capitol Square and within the Capitol building itself with a concealed carry permit. (Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Many Republican lawmakers are in safe red districts, lessening the importance of changing their stances against gun control. But those who are in more competitive districts — including many of the Republicans in Virginia Beach and Cox — needed to make some effort in the special session, Bitecofer said.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“They needed something alternative to focus on, they couldn’t come and kill all the gun control bills and go home,” she said. “You don’t want to come up (to Richmond) in the limelight and be obstructionist when the community’s hurting.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">She said most of the Republican’s proposed legislation is about guns, but isn’t necessarily gun control.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s something to talk about, but they’re going to get hammered by the Democratic opposition,” she said. “Their opponents will make their inaction a huge focus during campaigns.”</p>

Glenn Davis will carry legislation that would allow municipalities to ban guns in local government buildings, with some caveats.</p>
<p>Senate Majority Leader Tommy Norment, R-James City, went further, <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?192+sum+SB4013" target="_blank">introducing a bill</a> that would prohibit guns and other weapons &#8220;in any building owned or used by a locality for governmental purposes in the commonwealth,&#8221; a summary of the legislation reads. It&#8217;s one of <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?192+mbr+S26C" target="_blank">several substantive bills</a> on guns introduced for the session by Norment, who <a href="https://www.vagazette.com/news/va-vg-ebbins-norment-extended-magazines-0604-story.html" target="_blank">expressed some openness</a> to legislation on gun violence in the wake of the Virginia Beach <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/02/us/virginia-beach-shooting-sunday/index.html" target="_blank">municipal building massacre</a>.</p>
<p>Among Norment&#8217;s other proposals are legislation requiring <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?192+sum+SB4015" target="_blank">firearms safety education</a> in schools; expanding the<a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?192+sum+SB4020" target="_blank"> time frame</a> for offenses that disqualify a person for a concealed weapons permit; and <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?192+sum+SB4014" target="_blank">requiring courts</a> to report to the State Police for entry into a state database denied applications for concealed weapons permits.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam, who called the special session that begins Tuesday to push a raft of gun control legislation in the wake of the shooting, <a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/virginia/government-politics/gop-sen-norment-files-bill-to-ban-guns-in-local/article_c1fea0ba-df88-570d-b31b-fe96f1d2d957.html" target="_blank">told the Richmond Times-Dispatch</a> he was &#8220;pleased to see legislators coming to the table with serious gun violence prevention proposals — he hopes every legislator will have the chance to engage in honest debate and cast their vote.&#8221;</p>
<p>Davis&#8217; measure is similar to one of Northam&#8217;s <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/the-8-bills-northam-wants-passed-in-the-special-session/" target="_blank">priorities during the special session.</a></p>
<p>&#8220;Working to ensure the proper and safe use of firearms and protecting the rights conveyed by the Second Amendment do not have to be mutually exclusive,&#8221; Davis said in a release. &#8220;I believe that it is the obligation of those who value the latter to assure the former.&#8221;</p>
<p>Davis will present three pieces of legislation:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?192+sum+HB4007" target="_blank">Allowing localities</a> to ban guns in local government buildings as long as the locality includes additional security, such as metal detectors and security personnel at buildings&#8217; entrances.</li>
<li><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?192+sum+HB4012" target="_blank">Creating a mobile app</a> for students to access mental health and crisis intervention services and a tip line to report school safety concerns (<a href="https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/amendment/2018/1/HB30/Introduced/FR/420/1h/?fbclid=IwAR2i15ErVvlQayPTrYvAWZw7b6KmhPXZ_etoJPeUqahdgHnQvIHn3l6HAJw" target="_blank">a similar measure</a> in 2018 proposed by Del. Marcus Simon, D-Falls Church, failed).</li>
<li><a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?192+sum+HB4008" target="_blank">Eliminating</a> online video-training as an option for concealed-carry permits.</li>
</ul>
<p>Virginia Beach Democrat Del. Kelly Fowler floated the idea of introducing legislation allowing municipalities to make their own call on guns in local government buildings at a recent Virginia Beach City Council meeting. The council <a href="https://pilotonline.com/news/local/virginia-beach-mass-shooting/article_0e42193c-922d-11e9-9274-635035280582.html" target="_blank">deferred voting</a> in support of the measure.</p>
<figure id="attachment_9893" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:150px;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-9893" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/glenn-davis-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Del. Glenn R. Davis, R-Virginia Beach.</p></figure>
<p>Davis, a competitive shooter in high school, said the shooting in Virginia Beach was &#8220;a tragedy that has no answers and no legislation could have prevented.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No one believes that putting a sticker on the door will stop anyone committed to doing harm to others from carrying a weapon into that building,&#8221; Davis said <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQ_PFYqGLa4&amp;t=7s" target="_blank">in the video</a> with his announcement, adding that he considered the special session &#8220;ill-timed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why I believe this legislation creates a reasonable balance between a locality&#8217;s desire to control firearm access in their buildings and a citizen&#8217;s right to feel safe and protect themselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>Davis, like most of Virginia Beach&#8217;s Republican delegation, represents a district that has become more Democratic leaning in recent years.</p>
<p>In the 2016 presidential election, 49 percent of Davis&#8217; district voted for President Donald Trump. In the 2017 gubernatorial election, 52 percent of his district voted for Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam.</p>
<p>In 2018, 54 percent of his district voted for Democratic U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine.</p>
<p>He is being challenged by Democrat Karen Mallard, a teacher who challenged U.S. Rep. Elaine Luria for the party nomination to run against Scott Taylor in the 2018 congressional elections.</p>
<p><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?192+lst+ALL" target="_blank">A host of bills</a> have been filed or are expected to be introduced for the session, from mandatory minimums for gun crimes to restrictions on assault weapons and firearm magazine capacity, closing loopholes in background checks and creating extreme risk protection or &#8220;red flag&#8221; orders that can remove guns from people who pose a threat to themselves or others, among many others.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: <em>This post has been updated to reflect new legislation filed for the special session on guns that starts Tuesday.</em></p>

(Photo by Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the month after the mass shooting in Virginia Beach that killed 12 people and injured four others, lawmakers, candidates and activists have traveled around the state talking about the best way to curb gun violence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Ralph Northam held roundtable discussions. Moms Demand Action held listening events. And the National Rifle Association held members-only</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/they-want-our-state-virginia-republicans-and-nra-say-gun-control-is-just-the-start-of-upheaval/2019/07/02/7821f8bc-99c2-11e9-916d-9c61607d8190_story.html?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.cabbc4c62797" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> town halls with Republican lawmakers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> where policy conversations focused on mental health reform. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Tuesday, lawmakers will come back to Richmond to hash out the details of potential new gun laws, though it may be unlikely any will pass.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the Northam roundtable in Abingdon, Sen. Ben Chafin, R-Russell, gave a hint of what to expect when he promised Virginia Secretary of State Brian Moran he would  </span><a href="https://www.roanoke.com/news/politics/abingdon-crowd-rejects-governor-s-call-for-action-on-gun/article_089dd9ab-7671-548d-93e7-3ae37976474d.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“oppose every single thing you got.”</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans hold slim majorities in both chambers, giving the party the ability to block bills and determine content of the special session.</span></p>
<h2><b>Here’s what Northam wants</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Northam called the special session, his priorities were a list of legislative items that </span><a href="https://www.dailypress.com/news/politics/dp-nws-ga-gun-bills-20190116-story.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">died over a span</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of two days in committee or subcommittee meetings during the regular session. Little changed after his roundtable discussions. Some of the legislation for the special session has <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?192+lst+ALL" target="_blank">already been introduced</a>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Northam’s wish list includes universal background checks; a ban on assault weapons, which would include suppressors and bump stocks; an extreme risk protection or red flag law; reinstating Virginia’s one-handgun-a-month law; child access protection measures; required reporting of lost or stolen firearms and giving municipalities the power to regulate firearms in government buildings. </span></p>
<p><b>• The <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?192+sum+HB4003" target="_blank">red flag bill</a></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would allow judges or magistrates to bar people who appear to be in danger of hurting themselves or others from keeping or purchasing guns for 14 days. Law enforcement would hold any weapons the subject of the order owned. The order would have to be based on a history of violence and supported by an investigation by police. The subject could file a motion to dismiss the order at any point during those 14 days and the court could extend the order to six months.</span></p>
<p><b>•  Cities, counties and towns would be able decide</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> whether to regulate firearms <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?192+sum+SB4001" target="_blank">in local government buildings</a>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><b>• </b>In the last session, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+sum+SB1454" target="_blank">the legislation</a> to require </span><b>background checks for most gun transactions</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> included exemptions for a number of situations, including sales between family members or antique guns. Under current law, background checks are only required for transactions with federally licensed firearms dealers. Private sellers — including vendors at gun shows who aren’t federally licensed — have the option of conducting a background check through the state police, but it is not required.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><b>• </b>The </span><a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+ful+HB2492" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><b> to ban gun magazines that hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the past session defined an &#8220;assault firearm&#8221; as any gun that holds more than 10 rounds of ammunition. A separate </span><a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+sum+SB1008" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill would have banned bump stocks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. (A national <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/25/trump-administrations-bump-stock-ban-set-to-go-into-effect-tuesday.html" target="_blank">ban on bump stocks</a>, which were used in the Las Vegas massacre and enable semi-automatic weapons to increase their rate of fire, went into effect in March)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><b>• </b>The </span><b>one-handgun-a-month bill</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?192+sum+SB4002" target="_blank"> reinstates a 1993 law</a> championed by former Democratic Gov. Doug Wilder. Republican Gov. Bob McDonnell signed the repeal of the law in 2012. Since then,</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/mcauliffe-attempts-to-revive-virginias-one-gun-a-month-law/2017/03/27/fc07ec8c-1336-11e7-9e4f-09aa75d3ec57_story.html?utm_term=.dcd9d77ec119" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats have tried but failed to pass it again</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Under the failed proposal, anyone purchasing more than one gun a month could do so after getting an “enhanced background check.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><b>• Gun owners would be required to report a lost or stolen weapon within 24 hours</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of realizing it was gone. (Here&#8217;s a bill on the issue <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?181+sum+HB43" target="_blank">that failed</a> from the 2018 session). Law enforcement would report it to the National Crime Information Center. The legislation provided immunity for people who report the lost or stolen weapon if the weapon is used in a crime.</span></p>
<p><b>• Leaving a loaded gun around children under 18 would become a Class 6 felony</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+sum+SB1096" target="_blank"> according to a bill</a> filed in the past session— the lowest level felony punishable by one to five years in jail or some jail time with a $2,500 fine. Right now leaving a loaded gun around a child under 14 is a misdemeanor charge.</span></p>
<p><b>•</b> Del. Cia Price, D-Newport News, filed a bill Sunday that would allow <strong>localities to adopt regulations around possessing, storing, carrying and transporting guns. </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><b>• </b>One of Northam’s proposals wasn’t introduced in the regular session. Right now, only subjects of &#8220;family abuse&#8221; protective orders are prohibited from having a gun. Northam wants to <strong>block all subjects of protective orders from possessing firearms</strong>, which can include people accused of stalking, harassment and other non-physical intimidation or violence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Northam said at an event in Radford in late June that some of his preferred proposals wouldn&#8217;t have</span><a href="https://www.roanoke.com/news/nrv/northam-embraces-gun-debate-at-boys-state/article_453bf521-7b56-5945-93dc-cc55195c8ed3.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8220;necessarily prevented&#8221;</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the shooting in Virginia Beach. But his focus is also larger than mass shootings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the press conference announcing the special session, he </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/all-releases/2019/june/headline-840912-en.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">listed a number of </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">individual incidents that happened around the same time of the Virginia Beach shooting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is wrong that we now view these mass shootings as the new normal. In fact, it is wrong that we view gun violence in general as the new normal,” he said at the time.</span></p>
<h2><b>Here&#8217;s what Republicans want</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans have said they want to focus on mandatory minimum sentences for violations of existing gun laws.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">House and Senate Republicans are still finalizing legislative packages for the session. But one guiding principle for House Republicans will be protecting victims of gun violence, especially domestic violence victims, said Parker Slaybaugh, spokesman for House Speaker Kirk Cox, R-Colonial Heights.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans in both chambers are interested in reviving a bill that would have required</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/05/16/how-well-do-minimum-sentences-protect-victims-of-domestic-violence/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">a minimum 60-day sentence</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">for a person&#8217;s second domestic violence charge. The bill passed both chambers with bipartisan support, but Northam vetoed it and said he wouldn&#8217;t sign any mandatory minimum sentence laws because they disproportionately affect people of color.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead, Northam last week suggested expanding current Virginia law to ban anyone who is the subject of a protective order from possessing firearms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement after Northam announced the special session, Cox also reiterated his party&#8217;s &#8220;ongoing efforts to strengthen the mental and behavioral health system.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The National Rifle Association, the powerful pro-gun organization headquartered in Fairfax, has also said mental health is the real issue causing gun violence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“None of his gun control proposals will prevent criminals from accessing firearms and committing crimes, nor would they have prevented what happened in Virginia Beach,” Chris Kopacki, the Virginia state director for the NRA’s Institute for Legislative Action, said in a statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If the governor were serious about improving public safety he would address the underlying issues like our broken mental health system.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Mark Cole, R-Spotsylvania, filed the first two bills of the session Wednesday: </span><a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?192+sum+HB4001" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to codify a </span><a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/dc-v-heller/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Supreme Court decision</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that owning guns is an individual right and another to allow government employees, including municipal employees, with a </span><a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?192+sum+HB4002" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">concealed carry permit to have a weapon at work</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If the agency employs armed security or has law enforcement on site, it could prohibit employees from having a concealed weapon under Cole’s bill.</span></p>
<h2><strong>How does anything get resolved? </strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the governor triggered the special session, the General Assembly decides what direction it goes. Once lawmakers assemble, typically the first step is to get organized and get the legislators on task.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the first pieces of legislation typically taken up during special sessions are joint resolutions that broadly dictate what the lawmakers will focus on. During last year’s special session to finalize the budget during the Medicaid expansion debate, lawmakers</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?182+ful+HJ5002+pdf" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">agreed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> first to prioritize budget bills, though they gave themselves wiggle room for things like memorial resolutions, rules of procedure, the election of judges and appointments.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/mechelleh/status/1147928186073812995" target="_blank">https://twitter.com/mechelleh/status/1147928186073812995</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The joint resolution is sort of our road map,” said House Clerk Paul Nardo. “The legislation that should be introduced should be similar to what the purpose of the governor calling us into special session is.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But the legislative branch has the ability to do pretty much whatever it wants. He says he wants us to talk about gun violence, well one person’s gun violence is another person’s public safety, which can be interpreted a number of different ways.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s also possible lawmakers will go off their road map during this session. House Republicans have already renewed calls to hold </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/house-republicans-want-hearing-on-sexual-assault-allegations-against-justin-fairfax-during-special-session/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a bipartisan hearing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with the two women who have accused Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax of sexual assault.</span></p>
<h2><strong>How long will this take?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike regular sessions, which have to be concluded in either 45 or 60 days depending on the year, there’s not much structure around the timing of a special session. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because of that, if the session lasts a significant amount of time, each chamber might adjourn more often than usual while they wait for the other to complete its work. The joint resolution usually includes language requiring at least 48 hours’ notice before recessing or adjourning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are still two special sessions still open from 2018 — one for redistricting and one that was called for the budget and for judicial appointments. Lawmakers could opt to close the redistricting session, since the </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/06/17/supreme-court-rejects-republicans-appeal-in-gerrymandering-case/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Supreme Court made a decision in the case.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The session on judicial appointments could stay open for lawmakers to make a permanent appointment to the </span><a href="https://www.roanoke.com/news/virginia/circuit-court-judge-anita-filson-retires-after-years-on-the/article_248a0cc7-239f-58d3-9aa0-ab32fb35b76b.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rockbridge County Circuit Court.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Either way, those sessions will expire in 2020. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other than timing and some procedural differences, special sessions are identical to regular sessions. Cox will still refer bills to committees, bills still have to be read a third time and some will get killed and others will pass to the opposite chamber.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There will still be a</span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/constitution/article4/section6/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">veto session</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, when the General Assembly reconvenes on the sixth Wednesday after adjournment to reconsider bills that may have been altered or vetoed by the governor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the state</span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/constitution/article4/section13/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Constitution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, laws passed during the special session will become effective on the first day of the fourth month following the month of adjournment.</span></p>

Amanda Chase, R-Chesterfield. (Photo by Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>State Sen. Amanda Chase, R-Midlothian, posted a Fourth of July video on her Facebook page to respond to critics, who have called her out over comments made earlier this week about rape.</p>
<p>During an online back-and-forth with a constituent on Facebook, Chase had written that <a href="https://www.nbc12.com/2019/07/05/virginia-senator-faces-criticism-after-online-controversial-rape-comment/" target="_blank">people who are &#8220;naive and unprepared end up raped.&#8221;</a></p>
<p>The comment was part of an exchange under Chase&#8217;s <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Chase4Senate/posts/2438822486183213" target="_blank">Facebook post about</a> Richmond Mayor Levar Stoney&#8217;s <a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/local/city-of-richmond/in-symbolic-vote-richmond-council-approves-gun-ban-for-city/article_f5418327-4ab0-5fba-b09f-cb67fb40c857.html?fbclid=IwAR1bR136eUROJ43zw6ADL68vjIGMBpqtEgFnpRoL8hUb34MCgVuYcSVsCzQ" target="_blank">pre-emptive push to limit weapons</a> in city buildings and parks. She said the state hadn&#8217;t given the city permission to make such a decision. (Stoney would have to wait for the state to grant such authority to municipalities because of Virginia&#8217;s Dillon Rule).</p>
<p>A person commenting on the post asked Chase why it would be important to have a weapon in a public park. Chase responded that it was important for &#8220;law abiding citizens to be able to protect themselves&#8221; and that a park near her is deep in the woods. A different person asked why a wooded area would be so scary and accused Chase of being paranoid.</p>
<p>Chase replied: &#8220;It’s those who are naive and unprepared that end of (sic) raped. Sorry. But I’m not going to be a statistic.&#8221;</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" style="border: none; overflow: hidden;" src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FChase4Senate%2Fposts%2F2438822486183213&amp;width=500" width="500" height="253" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p>In 2017, the most recent full year available, there were 1,768 forcible or attempted rapes, according to the Attorney General&#8217;s <a href="https://rga.lis.virginia.gov/Published/2019/RD104/PDF" target="_blank">annual report on domestic and sexual violence.</a></p>
<p>About one-third of those cases involved a victim under the age of 18. Twenty-eight percent of the victims were females between 18 and 24 years old.</p>
<p>In Virginia, only people 18 or older can purchase and openly carry guns. Concealed-carry permit holders must be 21.</p>
<p>&#8220;Survivors are not ‘naïve and unprepared’ because they were raped and these statements continue to demonstrate that Senator Chase’s extreme ideas are out of touch with the views of her constituents,&#8221; Amanda Pohl, Chase&#8217;s Democratic challenger, said in a <a href="https://bluevirginia.us/2019/07/right-wing-republican-virginia-state-senator-amanda-chase-its-those-who-are-naive-and-unprepared-that-end-up-raped-democratic-nominee-amanda-pohl-rebuffs-sen-amanda-chase-its-those-who-are-naive-and-u" target="_blank">statement reported by BlueVirginia</a>, a political blog that originally reported the Facebook exchange.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=2939034459654314" target="_blank">video on Facebook that accompanied her statement</a> responding to the criticism, Chase said:</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a champion for life, I&#8217;m a champion for the unborn and for innocent life and I&#8217;m also a champion for our second amendment, which I believe protects innocent life. As a woman who jogs through public parks the ability to carry my firearm is important. And I was actually scorned on Facebook by these leftist trolls for actually exercising my second amendment right while I&#8217;m running through a public park.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It’s everyone’s 2nd Amendment Right to arm and protect themselves and their family,&#8221; she wrote. &#8220;I’m a champion for women, their right to protect themselves and their right to their opinion, even if I may not agree, but will not tolerate the bullying or chastising the rights of the Second Amendment.&#8221;</p>
<p>Chase, as her opponents were quick to point out, didn&#8217;t support the <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/07/25/only-one-more-state-needs-to-ratify-the-equal-rights-amendment-will-it-be-va/" target="_blank">Equal Rights Amendment</a> during the General Assembly session, which would have added explicit protection from sex-based discrimination to the U.S. Constitution.</p>
<p>And when Chase presented an alternative to the ERA,<a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/virginia/government-politics/general-assembly/sen-chase-wears-handgun-to-podium-to-present-bills-in/article_c047eb24-0136-5ee0-b848-63489e824dde.html" target="_blank"> </a>she wore her revolver in a holster to a committee meeting, and said, &#8220;sometimes it’s a deterrent for over-exuberant folks,&#8221; <a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/virginia/government-politics/general-assembly/sen-chase-wears-handgun-to-podium-to-present-bills-in/article_c047eb24-0136-5ee0-b848-63489e824dde.html" target="_blank">according to The Richmond Times-Dispatch.</a></p>
<p>&#8220;I think that it is very important that we protect ourselves as women and take advantage of exercising and using our second amendment right to protect ourselves and our families and our loved ones,&#8221; she said in Thursday night&#8217;s video, which ended with a campaign-like message.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s important that next Tuesday, we enter our special session (and) I want to reassure you that I will be there to protect your second amendment rights.&#8221;</p>

Ralph Northam, shown with Attorney General Mark Herring and Secretary of Public Safety Brian Moran, far right, in 2019. (Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>After several roundtables around the state, Gov. Ralph Northam&#8217;s legislative package for the special session to address gun violence remains mostly unchanged from the <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/06/04/northam-hopes-to-ratchet-up-pressure-on-gop-but-some-advocates-see-little-hope-for-special-session-on-gun-control/" target="_blank">plans he laid out just over a month ago.</a></p>
<p>After a <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/06/09/special-session-on-guns-could-test-virginia-beach-delegation/" target="_blank">shooting in Virginia Beach</a> left 12 dead and four injured, Northam called the legislature back to Richmond to tackle gun reform. Most of the legislation he referenced in the days following the shooting were proposals that failed during the regular session earlier this year.</p>
<p>Wednesday afternoon, he <a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/all-releases/2019/july/headline-841482-en.html" target="_blank">announced eight bills</a> he would support when the session starts on Tuesday. His legislative package includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Universal background checks</li>
<li>A ban on &#8220;dangerous&#8221; weapons, including high-capacity magazines, suppressors and bump stocks</li>
<li>Reinstating Virginia&#8217;s one-handgun-a-month rule</li>
<li>Requiring reporting lost and stolen firearms within 24 hours</li>
<li>An extreme risk protection, or red flag, law</li>
<li>Tougher penalties for allowing children under 18 to access to loaded firearms</li>
<li>Allowing municipalities to &#8220;enact any firearms ordinances that are stricter than state law&#8221;</li>
<li>Prohibiting anyone subject to a protective order from possessing firearms</li>
</ul>
<p>The only new proposal from Northam on the list is the last one.</p>
<p>Right now, only subjects of &#8220;family abuse&#8221; protective orders are prohibited from possessing firearms. Northam&#8217;s proposal is to block all subjects of protective orders from possession firearms, which can include people accused of stalking, harassment and other non-physical intimidation or violence.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unclear how that could be received by Republicans, who have said they&#8217;re prepared to come to session and discuss mandatory minimum sentences and mental health. That includes <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/05/16/how-well-do-minimum-sentences-protect-victims-of-domestic-violence/" target="_blank">a bill that failed during the regular session</a> that would have imposed a mandatory minimum sentence for people who commit a second act of domestic violence.</p>
<p>Northam vetoed the bill, saying he would reject any mandatory minimum sentence proposal to the end of his term because the practice disproportionately hurts people of color.</p>

Ralph Northam has issued an <a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/executive-actions/EO-35-Advancing-Equity-for-Small-,-Women-,-Minority-,-and-Service-Disabled-Veteran-owned-Businesses-in-State-Contracting.pdf" target="_blank">executive order to study how the state awards contracts to certain businesses.</a></p>
<p>“Small businesses are a vital economic engine for Virginia, making up 97 percent of all businesses, but we know there is work to do to ensure they have equal opportunity to grow and succeed in our Commonwealth,” Northam said <a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/all-releases/2019/july/headline-841467-en.html" target="_blank">in a release.</a></p>
<p>“With this Executive Order, we are strengthening our commitment to expanding small business participation in state contracting and achieving equity for our women- and minority-owned businesses.”</p>
<p>Northam&#8217;s order also includes small and service-disabled veteran businesses in the study, which will be completed by an outside party.</p>
<p>The order directs the Virginia Department of Small Business and Supplier Diversity, which certifies small businesses, to develop new outreach programs. It also requires cabinet secretaries to keep track of their institutions&#8217; spending with small businesses.</p>
<p>During the General Assembly session, Northam wanted to include just over $900,000 in the budget over the next two years to hire a firm to study the state&#8217;s procurement practices; create a new team of state employees to &#8220;strategically source small, woman-owned, and minority-owned participation on large dollar Commonwealth contracts&#8221;; and funding for programming specifically for women- and minority-owned businesses.</p>
<p>Republicans shot down the idea, saying the state office that currently works with those businesses is set for a major audit this year and it didn’t make sense to boost their funding or implement new programs until that work is complete.</p>
<p>&#8220;Virginia has a long history of racial inequality and disenfranchisement of minority communities,&#8221; Northam wrote in his order. &#8220;We have made some progress in the last six decades since the civil rights movement began, but not enough. Additionally, in June we celebrate the centennial anniversary of Congress passing the women’s right to vote. One hundred years later, however, women are more likely to live in poverty, economic gender inequality continues, and women are underrepresented in elected office, business, and the workforce.&#8221;</p>
<p>In 2009, the last time the state did a procurement disparity study, 2.82 percent of total state contracts were awarded to women- and minority-owned businesses.</p>
<p>The state contracts a number of different services including construction, architecture, engineering, professional services and goods and supplies.</p>

Terry Kilgore, R-Scott.</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Terry Kilgore, R-Scott, was the winner of a local party convention, which should have allowed him to be listed on the ballot as the official Republican nominee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there was a hiccup: Kilgore’s paperwork never made it to Richmond.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kilgore’s team thought it had been faxed, then thought maybe it had been mailed, lawyer Jeff Mitchell told the Board of Elections earlier this week. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mitchell, along with Kilgore’s twin brother, former Attorney General Jerry Kilgore, asked the Board of Elections to accept late party nomination paperwork so Terry Kilgore would be listed in the ballot as a Republican candidate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Otherwise, he’d had to run a write-in campaign.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mitchell provided the board with affidavits from several party officials and participants in the local nominating convention that said Kilgore was picked as the winner.</span></p>
<p>On Friday, the Board of Elections discussed the issue in a 30-minute closed session.</p>
<p>The board agreed to accept his paperwork and said Commissioner Chris Piper should come up with a policy, subject to the board&#8217;s approval, to handle &#8220;administrative errors with regard to accessing the ballot.&#8221;</p>
<p>The board on Friday also closed the book on the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/jun/23/virginia-gop-backs-scott-wyatt-over-chris-peace-ho/" target="_blank">long-running dispute</a> in the 97th House District over who the Republican nominee for the November election will be, signing off on the decision by party officials that Scott Wyatt, a member of the Hanover County Board of Supervisors, would be the GOP candidate, not the incumbent, Del. Chris Peace.</p>

<p>A plurality of respondents (43%) said they preferred Democrats to take control of the two chambers Republicans narrowly hold, but the number dropped nine points since VCU asked the same question last July. Republicans saw a smaller dip, with support for a GOP-controlled legislature dropping four points to 28 percent.</p>
<p>And the percentage of people unsure which party should take over increased 12 points to 29 percent.</p>
<p>“From the public&#8217;s prospective and a politician’s perspective, it’s up for grabs,” said Farrah Stone, who directed the poll.</p>
<p>All 140 seats in the General Assembly are up for re-election in November. Democrats need to gain two seats in the House of Delegates and the Senate for a majority. If successful, it would be the first time since 2012 Democrats have held a majority in the Senate and the first time since 2000 Democrats were the majority party in the House.</p>

Delegates voted Monday to pass legislation that will provide protections for residents evicted from assisted living facilities in Virginia. (Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury - Aug. 30, 2018)</p><p>One of the state&#8217;s most senior Republican delegates isn&#8217;t officially a party nominee for his re-election bid &#8212; yet.</p>
<p>At Tuesday night&#8217;s Board of Elections meeting, attorneys for Del. Terry Kilgore, R-Scott, asked that he be declared the Republican nominee for the 1st House of Delegates District even though his nomination paperwork from a local party convention never made it to the state Department of Elections.</p>
<p>It was thought Kilgore’s paperwork was faxed to the state, then it was assumed to be mailed. Either way, it didn’t make it to Richmond, lawyer Jeff Mitchell told the Board of Elections.</p>
<figure id="attachment_9684" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:195px;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-9684" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/terry_kilgore-195x300.jpg" alt="" width="195" height="300" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/terry_kilgore-195x300.jpg 195w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/terry_kilgore-274x420.jpg 274w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/terry_kilgore.jpg 417w" sizes="(max-width: 195px) 100vw, 195px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Del. Terry Kilgore, R-Scott.</p></figure>
<p>That means, Kilgore, who has been in the House for 25 years and is currently unopposed, isn&#8217;t officially the GOP nominee.</p>
<p>He could run a write-in campaign, which would make an already hectic campaign season for voters even more confusing, Mitchell said. The 1st District has several local races coming up in November, including heated sheriff&#8217;s competitions.</p>
<p>Mitchell and Terry&#8217;s twin brother, Jerry Kilgore, brought the board several affidavits from party officials who confirmed they had picked Terry Kilgore as the nominee. Jerry Kilgore, a former Virginia attorney general, told the board they had the authority to name his brother as the nominee even though the primary deadline was June 11.</p>
<p>Jerry Kilgore told the board it has allowed for extensions of candidates’ declaration and economic interest paperwork in the past.</p>
<p>He said not naming his brother as the nominee sets a dangerous precedent in situations where it’s clear a party has nominated someone.</p>
<p>“It would allow any rogue party chair to simply refuse to file the nomination certification of a particular candidate,” Jerry Kilgore said.</p>
<p>The board went into closed session Monday night to discuss nomination processes in the 1st and 97th House districts.</p>
<p>Bob Brink, chair of the Board of Elections, said they would seek guidance from the Office of the Attorney General on Kilgore&#8217;s situation by the end of the week.</p>
<p>The board didn&#8217;t discuss Hanover County&#8217;s 97th District, where Del. Chris Peace, R-Hanover, was challenged by Hanover Supervisor Scott Wyatt. There were two separate nominating events with two different winners and a GOP State Central Committee declared <a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/local/hanover/mechanicsville-local/rpv-wyatt-is-the-th-nominee/article_9f565920-96b4-11e9-aa5d-3b8c62524a53.html" target="_blank">Wyatt the winner last weekend.</a></p>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In an effort to combat Virginia’s teacher shortage, 15 Virginia colleges and universities will start new four-year teacher education degree programs this fall.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Board of Education approved the programs last week. The State Council for Higher Education of Virginia, which oversees public colleges and universities, approved the new programs at public institutions in May.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The College of William and Mary, University of Virginia, Virginia Tech and Virginia State, George Mason, James Madison, Old Dominion and Virginia Commonwealth universities are projected to produce 400 more teachers through 26 new bachelor degree programs. Ferrum, Randolph, Roanoke and Sweet Briar colleges; Liberty, Marymount and Shenandoah universities as well as the University of Lynchburg will roll out 27 additional programs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SCHEV didn’t have to approve the programs at the private schools. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Several of these new programs will address critical shortage areas, including elementary education, middle education, special education, mathematics and science,” Superintendent of Public Instruction James Lane said </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/all-releases/2019/june/headline-841231-en.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in a news release.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These additional teachers will make a big difference as the Virginia Department of Education works in partnership with local school divisions to ensure that every child in the commonwealth is taught by a fully qualified teacher.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">College students pursuing a teaching career get an undergraduate degree in the subject area they want to teach and then have to enter a graduate program to get an education degree. It can take, at a minimum, five years to complete, making it expensive and a deterrent to people becoming teachers, especially for potential teachers of color, according to a </span><a href="https://www.education.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/secretary-of-education/pdf/final-acts-report.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2017 study on teacher shortages</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and a</span><a href="https://www.education.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/secretary-of-education/pdf/final-tdvep-report.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 2016 study on teacher diversity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The cost of graduate education, and the more limited availability of financial aid, have made it difficult for students to afford to go into teaching, particularly as teacher salaries have been stagnating,” said Andrew Daire, Dean of the VCU School of Education, in </span><a href="https://www.news.vcu.edu/article/VCU_to_begin_offering_five_undergraduate_degrees_in_teaching" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a release from the university.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Teachers and superintendents have cited a number of reasons for leaving the profession, including pay and additional non-teaching responsibilities because of support staff shortages. Support staff includes positions like guidance counselors and nurses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the most recent school year, there were 3,139 college students enrolled in teacher education programs in public colleges and universities, </span><a href="http://research.schev.edu/enrollment/E52_Report.asp" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to SCHEV.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, there were </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/03/31/that-really-wears-on-you-pay-challenges-of-poor-districts-pushing-virginia-teachers-out-of-the-classroom/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">900 unfilled teaching positions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> across the state, Secretary of Education Atif Qarni said. The number of unfilled teaching positions in Virginia increased 40 percent from 2007 to 2017.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Eliminating the barrier of extra years of schooling traditionally required for teacher licensure will encourage more students to pursue teaching careers,” he said </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/all-releases/2019/june/headline-841231-en.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in a release.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “I am excited to see this increase in quality teachers impact the commonwealth’s students for years to come.”</span></p>

<p>The study should be finished by early fall, a news release from Prince William County said. The county is chipping in a $50,000 grant to help fund the study. The Claude Moore Foundation, a Fairfax-based organization that funds education initiatives, is contributing $200,000. The university will pay for the rest. A total cost hasn&#8217;t been determined yet.</p>
<p>Prince William County has seen &#8220;accelerated growth&#8221; in the health care industry, the county&#8217;s <a href="http://www.pwcecondev.org/prince-william-county-partners-george-mason-university-and-claude-moore-foundation-medical-school" target="_blank">release stated</a>, attributed in part to <a href="https://www.insidenova.com/news/business/prince_william/kaiser-permanente-moving-forward-with-woodbridge-hub/article_c1044e06-440c-11e9-8922-0b97941ccf64.html" target="_blank">Kaiser Permanente&#8217;s future hub </a>and ongoing additions to Sentara Northern Virginia Medical Center, both in Woodbridge.</p>
<p>“The benefits of a university-research based medical school here in Prince William County are profound,&#8221; said Corey Stewart, chairman of the Prince William Board of County Supervisors.</p>
<p>&#8220;It will not only increase educational opportunities and high-wage jobs for our residents, thereby further strengthening our talent pipeline, but it will be a significant move forward in leveraging the synergistic business opportunities that already exist here.”</p>
<p>If GMU decides to move forward on a medical school, it would become the seventh in the state and the first medical school in Northern Virginia. Shenandoah University, a private university in Winchester, <a href="https://www.su.edu/blog/2012/08/medical-school-feasibility-study-completed-and-submitted-to-shenandoah-university-board-of-trustees/" target="_blank">studied the possibility</a> of starting a medical school in 2012, but hasn&#8217;t launched one.</p>
<p>There are a number of considerations that make it an opportune time for GMU to consider a medical school option, said Bill Hazel, Mason&#8217;s senior adviser for strategic initiatives and former health and human resources secretary under Govs. Bob McDonnell and Terry McAuliffe.</p>
<p>There is a <a href="https://news.aamc.org/press-releases/article/workforce_report_shortage_04112018/" target="_blank">national</a> and <a href="https://wtkr.com/2019/04/12/virginia-ranked-29th-state-facing-doctor-shortage/" target="_blank">statewide shortage</a> of physicians, Hazel said.</p>
<p>Plus, Hazel said, GMU will apply for accreditation for the state&#8217;s first school of public health soon, which will strengthen a potential pipeline of students. And although the idea of a medical school at GMU has been discussed in the past, there generally seem to be more options now to funnel students into clinical and residency positions necessary to become a practicing doctor, he added.</p>
<p>An initial assessment by Mason estimated a first-year medical school class of 30-50 students and 50-70 faculty, according to the county&#8217;s news release.</p>
<p>The study will determine other numbers, including how much it would cost to launch a medical school and where that money could come from.</p>

<p>Bell called Fairfax&#8217;s push for investigations a &#8220;stunt.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If Lt. Gov. Fairfax wished to be investigated, he could simply present himself to Suffolk County (Massachusetts) officers for a recorded interview,&#8221; Bell wrote. &#8220;Alternately, he could agree to a hearing before the General Assembly.&#8221;</p>
<p>In response to the allegations, House Republicans said in February they planned to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/va-republicans-plan-hearings-into-sex-assault-allegations-against-lt-gov-justin-fairfax/2019/02/22/92eb5038-36b4-11e9-af5b-b51b7ff322e9_story.html?utm_term=.d767c82f0b98" target="_blank">invite both women</a> to the statehouse to testify. One of the women said she would only participate if it was a bipartisan process.</p>
<p>But Democrats cast doubt on the legislature&#8217;s authority to hold such a hearing and had concerns that it would become <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/va-republicans-plan-hearings-into-sex-assault-allegations-against-lt-gov-justin-fairfax/2019/02/22/92eb5038-36b4-11e9-af5b-b51b7ff322e9_story.html?utm_term=.e06deb7212b0" target="_blank">&#8220;political, partisan circus.&#8221;</a></p>
<p>&#8220;As you know, both women have stated that they will only participate in legislative hearings if the hearings are public and both Republicans and Democrats participate,&#8221; Bell wrote to Filler-Corn.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish to renew my offer for truly bipartisan hearings. The ranking Democrat on the Courts of Justice committee would serve as co-chair on any subcommittee that would be formed and the partisan make up would be exactly even. This means that no decision on subpoenas, procedural issues or scope of testimony would be made without bipartisan support.&#8221;</p>
<p>Filler-Corn wasn&#8217;t interested in Bell&#8217;s proposal, according to <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/response-to-chairman-bell-6.18.19.pdf" target="_blank">a letter she sent to him on Tuesday.</a></p>
<p>&#8220;We will not participate in House Republicans&#8217; political games, nor will we turn such serious allegations into a partisan sideshow,&#8221; she wrote.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since February, House Democrats have made multiple attempts to negotiate with House Republicans in a good faith, bipartisan effort. Each time, House Republicans have manipulated the situation into a political show, choosing to respond in press conferences and media statements rather than directly to us,&#8221; Filler-Corn wrote.</p>
<p>She said Republicans have no responded to a <a href="https://gallery.mailchimp.com/e8c66a6ccb254adb5e21e438b/files/69a63c49-183c-443b-8100-207864755afc/response_to_chairman_bell_3.31.pdf" target="_blank">March 31 letter</a> that laid out some of the caucus&#8217; concerns, including that such a hearing appears to have never been held by the House of Delegates and lawmakers may not be trained in conducting hearings related to criminal allegations.</p>
<p>In March, Filler-Corn said Democrats were &#8220;open to discussing the option of engaging an independent, third party entity to conduct a hearing while taking into consideration fairness and due process for all involved in a non-political, professional and safe environment in a manner that would not impede or compromise any possible ongoing investigation.&#8221;</p>
<p>UPDATE: A Fairfax spokeswoman <a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/virginia/government-politics/house-gop-suggests-hearing-on-fairfax-allegations-during-session-on/article_57737544-c20a-554a-ba70-29c846733ca2.html" target="_blank">told the Times-Dispatch</a> that a &#8220;Republican show trial during an election year is not an investigation that will reveal the truth,” calling the request an attempt to avoid the debate on gun control Gov. Ralph Northam has requested for the session.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.publicpolicypolling.com/" target="_blank">Public Policy Polling</a>, of Raleigh, N.C., on behalf<a href="https://www.bradyunited.org/about" target="_blank"> of Brady United</a>, a national organization that advocates for stricter gun control, asked 902 Virginians in key legislative districts about a number of gun control measures.</p>
<p>The respondent pool was divided among the districts of Speaker of the House Kirk Cox, R-Colonial Heights, Republican Sens. Tommy Norment of James City County and Bill DeSteph of Virginia Beach as well as Virginia Beach&#8217;s Senate District 7, which was previously held by Republican Sen. Frank Wagner, who decided not to run for re-election.</p>
<p>The first question, gauging support for a ban on semiautomatic assault rifles, like the guns used in the Sandy Hook Elementary, Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School and New Zealand mosque massacres, <a href="https://brady-static.s3.amazonaws.com/Download/VirginiaToplines2.pdf" target="_blank">found that</a> 62 percent supported such a ban, with 34 percent opposed and 4 percent unsure.</p>
<p>The poll also found that 63 percent of respondents (including half of gun owners surveyed) supported a ban on magazines that hold more than 10 rounds, like those used in the <a href="https://pilotonline.com/news/nation-world/national/article_da1d38fe-160c-5e12-9aa9-dc08c4b1563f.html" target="_blank">shooting in Virginia Beach on May 31</a> that was the deadliest in the country so far this year.</p>
<p><a href="https://brady-static.s3.amazonaws.com/Download/VirginiaResults.pdf" target="_blank">According to Brady&#8217;s poll</a>, 83 percent of respondents — including 73 percent of people who voted for President Donald Trump — also support &#8220;red flag&#8221; or extreme risk laws that would allow someone to ask a judge to temporarily suspend a person&#8217;s access to guns under certain circumstances.</p>
<p>The organization also highlighted key findings from certain districts, <a href="https://www.bradyunited.org/press-releases/with-special-session-on-horizon-new-polling-shows-virginians-want-action-on-gun-reform" target="_blank">like the 63 percent of respondents</a> in Cox&#8217;s district who told the organization they supported a localities&#8217; right to ban guns from public buildings. Among all the people polled, 67 percent favored that proposed legislation.</p>
<p>&#8220;<span id="m_6135161759845682916docs-internal-guid-2b150c72-7fff-dcea-91a4-44bf6c893c49">We have an epidemic of gun violence in Virginia, and regardless of party or political beliefs, voters want to see their elected officials take action, not sides,&#8221; Brady President Kris Brown said in a statement.</span></p>
<p><span id="m_6135161759845682916docs-internal-guid-2b150c72-7fff-dcea-91a4-44bf6c893c49">&#8220;When the special session convenes on July 9, Speaker Cox and Leader Norment have a choice &#8211; will they stand with their own communities and pass extreme risk laws and assault weapon bans into law? Or will they shun their own voters and retreat to the embrace of the gun lobby?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Democrats have quickly pivoted to rallying support for the special session and party leaders have planned events around the state to discuss gun violence.</p>
<p>On Friday, Attorney General Mark Herring joined a group of protesters outside the National Rifle Association&#8217;s headquarters in Fairfax to &#8220;raise awareness and support&#8221; for the session, according to a statement.</p>
<p>Secretary of Public Safety and Homeland Security Brian Moran, on behalf Northam&#8217;s administration, also began holding <a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/all-releases/2019/june/headline-841077-en.html" target="_blank">roundtable discussions</a> on the &#8220;gun violence emergency&#8221; on Thursday in Alexandria and was scheduled to hold an event Friday in Fairfax.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/all-releases/2019/june/headline-841077-en.html" target="_blank">events will continue</a> into next week with stops in Richmond, Fredericksburg and Abingdon.

<p>&#8220;Virginia&#8217;s open primary system creates the potential for candidates to make cross-party appeals or for members of one party to make mischief,&#8221; VPAP wrote in an email presenting the information.</p>
<p>Since Virginia doesn&#8217;t require voters to register with a political party, VPAP used voter information to find 128,113 currently registered voters who cast ballots in both Republican and Democratic primaries between June 2014 and June 2018. VPAP assigned voters to a party if they voted in a &#8220;majority of primaries for one party&#8221; and cross-voters were people who &#8220;voted once in a different party&#8217;s primary.&#8221;</p>
<p>The practice was more common in the 2015 primary season for General Assembly seats, according to VPAP&#8217;s analysis. Eight of the 10 primary races identified as having the most participation from members of the other party happened that year.</p>
<p>The other two races were congressional Republican primaries.</p>
<p>In the 2015 Democratic primary for House District 79, which includes parts of Portsmouth and Norfolk, VPAP calculated a 15.6 percent participation rate from Republican voters in the contest between now-Del. Steve Heretick and longtime lawmaker Johnny Joannou.</p>
<p>It was the highest participation rate of opposite-party voters in a primary VPAP identified between 2014 and 2018.</p>
<p>Joannou didn&#8217;t support Medicaid expansion when it came up under former Gov. Terry McAuliffe&#8217;s administration. <a href="https://pilotonline.com/news/government/politics/virginia/article_dbab69f6-5d65-5b4a-bdfb-15cc0d5c6715.html" target="_blank">Heretick did support expansion</a> and earned McAuliffe&#8217;s support in the primary.</p>
<p>The potential for voters casting ballots in opposite-party primaries is very real, especially in swing districts where a weak candidate could mean a win in the general election for the other party. Opposite parties may also consider one primary candidate an ally worth preserving in a district that&#8217;s unlikely to vote for a different party candidate.</p>
<p>In Tuesday&#8217;s primaries, there have already been accusations of cross-party voting in the heated race between Sen. Emmett Hanger, R-Augusta, and Tina Freitas, wife of Del. Nick Freitas, R-Culpeper, with <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/06/06/primary-tuesday-republicans-fight-over-abortion-and-guns-a-democrat-tries-for-an-aoc-style-upset-and-soros-pours-1m-into-prosecutors-races/" target="_blank">Freitas challenging Hanger for his stance on abortion and gun legislation.</a></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the end of the shooter’s rampage, <a href="https://pilotonline.com/news/local/crime/article_777b737e-83e3-11e9-b1d0-dff7ad725d5e.html" target="_blank">13 would be dead, including the gunman, and four more hospitalized. </a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I could not believe it,” Knight said. “I was a little bit beyond belief. I sat there and said, ‘What do I do? What do I do?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He delivered opening remarks at a 4-H show and sale near his farm in the southern part of the city because the city’s director of agriculture was at the Municipal Center, still on lockdown. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He encouraged attendees to pray.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re a very big city but we’re still a small community, we all help each other,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knight knew one of the victims, but declined to say which one. He’s visited the memorial residents created at the Municipal Center twice, he said. He and the three other Republican delegates from the city — Chris Stolle, Glenn Davis and Jason Miyares — skipped a House GOP retreat over the weekend. They wanted to stay close to home, Knight said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve tried to keep a low profile on this situation because we think now is a time for the victims and the families and friends and all the citizens of Virginia Beach to grieve,” he said.</span></p>

Barry Knight, R-Virginia Beach.</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Beach is the state&#8217;s most populous city and its delegation in Richmond generally prefers to stay out of political fights on controversial topics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Until now, when the deadliest mass shooting in the country so far this year, combined with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.apnews.com/a306318eeee349b2b2aeb0d20f103b8c" target="_blank">Gov. Ralph Northam&#8217;s call for a special legislative session next month</a> in its aftermath, thrusts the city into the heated gun control debate. Recent gun reform efforts have been thwarted in legislative committees by Republican majorities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It will test the area&#8217;s moderate Republicans, some of whom are hanging on to their seats in changing districts by a thread, and the whole delegation&#8217;s ability to respond to the shaken and grieving community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s hard to know how reactions to mass shootings affect voting behavior, said Quentin Kidd, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">political science professor at Christopher Newport University. But it’s likely the shooting will have the city’s state representatives considering how it could impact November, when all 140 seats in the General Assembly are up for re-election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You may see some posturing during this special session from the Virginia Beach delegation, especially those people who are in competitive races,” Kidd said. “You may see some posturing … from candidates who aren&#8217;t in the legislature yet but want to be and they&#8217;re thinking ahead to the fall. I think that becomes especially the case if nothing substantive comes out of the session.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far though, the Beach’s Republicans haven’t been thinking about politics, Knight said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think it’s entirely too soon right after the tragedy we had down here in Virginia Beach, where I live and lived all my life, for the governor to come in and politicize it to, in my opinion, detract from his other failings that happened in February,” said Knight, referring to Northam&#8217;s <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/02/02/in-his-own-words-northam-describes-moonwalking-in-blackface-denies-appearing-in-kkk-photo/" target="_blank">blackface scandal.</a> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t typically show but so much passion on things but I’ve got some passion on this because I’m so close to it.”</span></p>
<h2><strong>&#8216;I can&#8217;t do what my party wants&#8217;</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One hundred miles away in Richmond, Northam and state Democrats want to “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/virginia-gov-northam-calls-for-special-session-of-legislature-to-take-up-gun-control/2019/06/04/40efb24c-86d2-11e9-a870-b9c411dc4312_story.html?utm_term=.ff958ba1f10e" target="_blank">grieve and get to work</a>” on gun control issues. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Northam called for a special session four days after the shooting. He, Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax, Attorney General Mark Herring and Democrats from around the state implored Republican lawmakers to let gun legislation that failed during the regular session <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/06/04/northam-hopes-to-ratchet-up-pressure-on-gop-but-some-advocates-see-little-hope-for-special-session-on-gun-control/" target="_blank">go to a floor vote.</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Business as usual, with leadership shielding their members from taking tough votes by setting early morning hearings before small subcommittees won’t cut it,” Northam said in Richmond. “Virginians deserve leadership and they will be watching. The nation will be watching.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Republicans are coming to the special session begrudgingly, saying it’s still too soon to “politicize” a tragedy, as Speaker of the House </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/06/04/northam-hopes-to-ratchet-up-pressure-on-gop-but-some-advocates-see-little-hope-for-special-session-on-gun-control/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kirk Cox, R-Colonial Heights, put it </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">after the session was announced.</span></p>
<p>Cox said the GOP will instead push for stiffer penalties for gun crimes.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We should not detract from our period of grief by politicizing this tragedy with a debate on gun control,” Virginia Beach Republican Sen. Bill DeSteph said in a statement. “There is a proper time to act, and a proper time to mourn. Now is our time to grieve and care for the victims and their families. We are still planning funerals. That should be our focus.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DeSteph was one of the first lawmakers at the scene of the shooting. Since then, he has spent most of his days at the city’s emergency operations center, his staff said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knight said Virginia Beach’s Republican delegation agrees with Cox.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My citizens down here seem to think that we ought to criminalize the behavior,” he said, referring to his district, which includes the rural part of Virginia Beach. “It’s the people, it’s not the guns themselves. We criminalize people for traffic accidents, we don’t criminalize the vehicle.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats may be hoping Republicans will compromise on gun control legislation, Kidd said, but could also be prepared to turn an unproductive special session into a campaign issue to energize voters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The few Democrats that represent Virginia Beach — Dels. Cheryl Turpin and Kelly Fowler — have taken opposite approaches in preparation for the session. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both attended a rally Friday with activists from the Moms Demand Action and March for Our Lives organizations, which support stricter gun control.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There, Turpin reminded the small group of about a dozen — mostly high school students with March for Our Lives — that there were gun laws killed during the regular session that might have made a difference in the Virginia Beach shooting: a ban on high-capacity magazines and allowing localities to decide to ban weapons from government buildings.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_9340" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:273px;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-9340" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/turpin-273x300.jpg" alt="" width="273" height="300" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/turpin-273x300.jpg 273w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/turpin-382x420.jpg 382w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/turpin.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 273px) 100vw, 273px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Del. Cheryl Turpin, D-Virginia Beach.</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Showing up today is the first step,” said Turpin,<a href="https://www.dailypress.com/news/virginia/dp-nws-cheryl-turpin-7th-senate-district-election-20190325-story.html" target="_blank"> who is running</a> for the Senate seat left open by longtime Republican Sen. Frank Wagner.  &#8220;Showing up and putting pressure on my colleagues to do their jobs during the special session and vote to save lives are the next steps. If they do not, our final step will be to flip their seats in November.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fowler focused on allowing localities to make their own decisions on weapons bans in municipal buildings and said suppressors, which diminish the noise from gunshots, “need to be discussed.&#8221; Fowler personally thinks the devices should be banned, but said her husband, a Virginia Beach sheriff’s deputy has told her it is already difficult to get them legally. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia Beach, the shooter used a suppressor on his weapon, which made <a href="https://pilotonline.com/news/local/virginia-beach-mass-shooting/article_5f0bde4e-8660-11e9-b20e-9ff07af186a9.html" target="_blank">at least one person in the building at the time think the noise was coming from a nail gun.</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These people have to go back to work so that’s where my focus is,” Fowler said. “I’m not trying to avoid any of the gun policy issues … but I’m not going to turn it into other issues and I’m not going to talk about things that don’t relate to this situation.  I can’t do what I want, I can’t do what my party wants, I have to do what my constituents want.”</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_9342" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:300px;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-9342" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/fowler-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/fowler-300x300.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/fowler-150x150.jpg 150w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/fowler.jpg 464w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/fowler-420x420.jpg 420w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Del. Kelly Convirs-Fowler, D-Virginia Beach.</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Thursday, Turpin hosted an event for people to make cards for a remembrance wall. Northam visited the event and spoke to the gathering of about two dozen in a wine bar. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I would ask when is enough enough? How many more of these senseless tragedies do we have to experience before we as a society … say we need to do something,” Northam said. “It’s going to be important not only for you all, but your friends and your neighbors and anybody else that lives in Virginia to reach out to their delegates and senators.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few hours later, his tone was different at a <a href="https://pilotonline.com/news/local/virginia-beach-mass-shooting/article_2e79ec9c-888d-11e9-a7e5-d32f6afce9be.html" target="_blank">city-sponsored memorial service</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Grief is not an event, it is a process,” he said. “I once heard a very apt description that grief is like a series of waves. Those waves ebb and flow over time and sometimes they’re so powerful they can knock you down even months and years later. There will come a day when the investigations are done, when this tragedy is no longer front-page news, when many of us will be able to continue with our daily lives. But it won’t be done for those families. We need to continue to support them and be there for them.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is still a steady stream of visitors to a memorial at the city’s Municipal Center. Twelve crosses for each of the victims are tucked into mounds of flowers, teddy bears and other tokens of the victims: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a <a href="https://pilotonline.com/news/local/virginia-beach-mass-shooting/article_0d50819e-84a4-11e9-83a0-bf822e813e73.html" target="_blank">Pittsburgh Steelers’ Terrible Towel on Missy Langer’s cross</a>, a broken heart commemorating <a href="https://www.vbgov.com/news/pages/selected.aspx?release=4354&amp;title=statement+from+mary+lou+gayle%27s+children" target="_blank">Mary Lou Gayle’s commitment to her family</a> and painted seashells with each of the victims’ names.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nearby, a different municipal building is open for absentee primary voting. And across a parking lot from that one is Building 2, still blocked off by crime tape and monitored at each corner by police officers and cars.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volunteers from Pat Robertson’s Christian Broadcasting Network have set up near the memorial to provide water, snacks and prayer to visitors, who have come from as far as New Jersey. Volunteers said they would stay there until the community didn’t need them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They had no idea when that might be.</span></p>

<p>There have been two different winners from two nomination processes for the Republican candidate in that House of Delegates seat. In November, all of the General Assembly&#8217;s seats are up for a vote.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Virginia’s process is something of a free-for-all and that&#8217;s why there are so many fights over the process,&#8221; said Stephen Farnsworth, a political science professor at the University of Mary Washington. &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Individual candidates will prefer different nomination mechanisms because they think they will be more advantageous.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/virginia/government-politics/gop-committee-votes-to-scrap-convention-in-peace-wyatt-house/article_a9994c75-86b2-51ac-b21b-4478e8105cc6.html" target="_blank">local Republican committee in Hanover decided to cancel</a> a party convention in favor of a mass canvass, or firehouse primary.

<p>With primary day on Tuesday, it&#8217;s still unclear who the actual Republican nominee is in the 97th House District.</p>
<h2><strong>What are the options for picking a general election candidate?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In primary elections,voters choose which candidates will represent a political party on a general election ballot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year, primaries for state legislative races and some local offices will be held on or finished by Tuesday. There are 49 Republican primaries and 45 Democratic primaries in 73 different localities, according to the <a href="https://www.elections.virginia.gov/" target="_blank">Department of Elections</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In some races, there aren’t primaries at all because only one person from each party is interested in running.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If there is more than one person from a given party running, a local selection committee determines how a candidate for the general election will be chosen. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the past, incumbents were able to choose how parties would pick nominees, but that</span><a href="https://www.dailyprogress.com/newsvirginian/news/federal-judge-strikes-down-state-incumbent-protection-law/article_4d88a606-fd7d-11e7-9b8a-eb4b3b047f5f.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> law was struck down last year by a federal judge in Waynesboro</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is no rule barring candidates from telling committees their preferred nomination process.</span></p>
<p>Technically in Virginia, &#8220;primary&#8221; refers to a state-run election to determine the official party nominee for an office. The term is also used generally to refer to the various processes used to select a candidate.</p>
<p>Before anything, candidates have to qualify to be on a ballot, a process overseen by the <a href="https://www.elections.virginia.gov/candidatepac-info/becoming-a-candidate/" target="_blank">Department of Elections.</a></p>
<p>Requirements include being registered to vote, being a Virginia resident for at least a year preceding the election and submitting the appropriate paperwork, like getting the required number of signatures on nominating petitions to get on a ballot.</p>
<p>After that, local political party committees choose from a list of nominating procedures:</p>
<p><b>State-run election: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the most common primary selection method. The state operates an election like it would for other positions, but the ballot only includes the people running for a party nomination. Political parties don’t run the elections and voters don’t have to be registered with a political party to vote.</span></p>
<p>These are the most inclusive, said Shyam Raman, political director for the Democratic Party of Virginia. Plus, it gets voters in the habit of showing up to vote, saves the party money and keeps things as transparent as possible for voters since party-run processes can get confusing, Raman said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Generally speaking, incumbents like primaries,&#8221; Farnsworth said. &#8220;The turnout is going to be larger and that usually benefits people who have greater name recognition and can raise more money.&#8221;</p>
<p>The biggest difference between a primary and a general election is mostly the turnout, Farnsworth said.</p>
<p>&#8220;On average, you&#8217;re talking single-digit turnout,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p><b>Firehouse primary, mass canvass, unassembled caucus or party canvass:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> One of the most straightforward ways of picking a party nominee is through <a href="https://www.dailyprogress.com/news/state/th-district-voters-to-choose-gop-nominee-in-firehouse-primary/article_c50fa506-66f1-11e9-9384-5fe925b59e37.html" target="_blank">a firehouse primary</a>, which is run and funded by a political party. Firehouse primaries usually run all day at several different locations and a winner is determined by whoever gets the most votes whether it is a majority or not. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only the parties’ own candidates are on the ballot.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The Party Canvass is an easy-to-use method that facilitates large numbers of voters for nominations or elections,&#8221; the Republican Party of Virginia wrote in <a href="https://virginia.gop/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Handbook-for-Methods-of-Nomination-March-2015-F-1.pdf" target="_blank">a 2015 nominating guidebook.</a></p>
<p><b>Mass meetings or assembled caucus:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Mass meetings are like firehouse primaries that occur in one place in a shorter period of time. Anyone can vote in them, but parties can require voters to sign a statement of intent to support the party nominee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike firehouse primaries, a candidate has to get a true majority (more than 50 percent) of votes to be declared the winner. Voting can take place several times at a mass meeting until the majority is reached.</span></p>
<p><b>Convention:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Conventions look like mass meetings but use delegates and weighted voting to pick a winner. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Local party officers determine how many delegates each precinct in a given congressional or legislative district will vote based on the party’s share of votes in past elections.</span></p>
<p>Conventions tend to bring out the &#8220;most extreme voices&#8221; in a political party, Farnsworth said.</p>
<p>The Republican Party laid out the process of determining how many delegates vote at a party convention: Each vote for the Republican party in a district&#8217;s precincts is counted and the committee running the convention determines a ratio for the number of delegates, like one delegate for every 500 Republican votes in a precinct.</p>
<p>&#8220;The ratio may be adjusted to take into account the expected attendance or the maximum number of delegates that can be accommodated in the convention facility,&#8221; the handbook reads.</p>
<p>The Democratic Party has a similar process to determine which areas of a district voted more heavily Democratic and then divvy up delegate votes that way, Raman said.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voters will have to endure six more months of campaigning and return to the polls in November for the general election, which is when they pick between a Republican and Democrat candidate (in most cases). </span></p>

Ralph Northam established the Commission to Examine Racial Inequity in Virginia Law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The purpose of this commission is to review the Virginia Acts of Assembly, Code of Virginia and administrative regulations with the goal of identifying and making recommendations to address laws that were intended to or could have the effect of promoting or enabling racial discrimination or inequity,” Northam wrote in </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/executive-actions/EO-32-Establishment-of-the-Commission-to-Examine-Racial-Inequity-in-Virginia-Law.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the order.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Such laws have no place in Virginia or its law books.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s the latest in Northam&#8217;s  efforts to make amends for </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/02/01/northam-deeply-sorry-after-blackface-kkk-costume-photos-surface/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a racist photo found on his medical school yearbook</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> page. A </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/05/22/good-teeth-big-legs-and-a-bow-tie-inconclusive-report-details-chaos-in-northams-office-and-how-he-finally-decided-it-wasnt-him-in-blackface-photo/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recent report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Eastern Virginia Medical School said investigators couldn’t determine if Northam was in the photo of two people — one in a Ku Klux Klan costume and one in blackface. That didn&#8217;t stop Northam <a href="https://www.politifact.com/virginia/statements/2019/jun/04/ralph-northam/northam-wrongly-says-report-confirms-he-wasnt-raci/" target="_blank">from falsely claiming</a> that the investigation concluded he wasn&#8217;t in the photo, PolitiFact Virginia pointed out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Northam, a Democrat, has said he will dedicate his remaining term as governor to racial equity, which has meant addressing </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/05/16/how-well-do-minimum-sentences-protect-victims-of-domestic-violence/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">criminal justice reform</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/we-need-some-help-governors-office-will-hire-first-chief-equity-officer/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hiring new staff</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help identify areas of inequity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He made the announcement about the new commission in Norfolk at a ceremonial signing of legislation from </span><a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=191&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb2473" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Cia Price</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, D- Newport News, and </span><a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=191&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=sb1079" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Lionell Spruill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, D-Chesapeake, that requires “newsboys, shoe-shine boys, babysitters who work 10 or more hours per week, ushers, doormen, concession attendants and cashiers in theaters” be paid at least minimum wage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Northam</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/newsboys-shoe-shiners-and-doormen-will-now-have-to-be-paid-at-least-minimum-wage/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> officially signed the legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> into law in March.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spruill and Price said some of Virginia’s minimum wage exemptions applied to jobs often held by black people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The legislation removing the Jim Crow-era minimum wage exemptions is an example of how we must work to address inequitable laws,” Spruill said in </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/all-releases/2019/june/headline-840916-en.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a release.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “The goal of the commission is to identify other instances of historical discrimination.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Northam will be responsible for appointing all members of the commission. His order does not specify how many members there will be.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The commission has to issue an interim report with findings and recommendations no later than Nov. 15.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This commission will bring people with diverse expertise and backgrounds together to move Virginia forward,” said the chair of the Legislative Black Caucus, Del. Lamont Bagby, D-Henrico. “I look forward to supporting action items identified by the commission. I am confident that they will uncover opportunities that will positively impact every corner of the Commonwealth. We must remove these unjust laws from the books immediately.”</span></p>

Tim Kaine isn’t as quick to do the same.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They’re grappling with what they’re going to do and if and when it comes to the Senate, we’ll take it seriously but there are so many issues,” Kaine said Tuesday at a panel discussion on teacher retention in Petersburg. &#8220;I really am worried that the president is going to blunder us into a war we shouldn’t be in, in Iran.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Rep. Don Beyer, D-8th, said last week that the president should be impeached for several reasons, including obstruction of justice and tax fraud, </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/rep-don-beyer-is-first-member-of-congress-from-virginia-to-call-for-impeachment/2019/05/21/c3e716da-7c1a-11e9-a5b3-34f3edf1351e_story.html?utm_term=.33342e993588" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Washington Post reported.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyer also said Trump shows an “utter contempt for the Constitution from the moment he took office, but we are now faced with evidence of actions that strongly resemble high crimes and misdemeanors.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Kaine said right now, he is preoccupied with decisions Trump is making in the Middle East.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump has tightened sanctions on Iran in recent weeks and sent additional military resources to the region,</span><a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-trump-iran-north-korea-japan-20190527-story.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> stoking fear that the countries may be headed toward conflict.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Trump has said that’s not his intent.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">Every day I&#8217;m doing work on can we rewrite the <a href="https://www.acenet.edu/advocacy/Pages/Higher-Education-Act.aspx" target="_blank">Higher Ed Act</a>, can we stop the president from getting us into a war we shouldn&#8217;t be in? That&#8217;s what I need to be focusing on more than what should the House do,&#8221; Kaine said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine is also waiting to throw his support behind a Democratic challenger to Trump in 2020, unlike some of Virginia’s representatives in the U.S. House.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Rep </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/mceachin-endorses-biden-calls-him-best-chance-against-trump/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Donald McEachin, D-4th, endorsed Joe Biden</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> earlier this month and </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/i-would-love-to-turn-virginia-into-a-buttigieg-state/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyer endorsed Pete Buttigieg in April.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine isn’t ready to make a choice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t mind endorsing early, I’ve often endorsed early,” said the one-time vice presidential candidate. “I just don’t have yet the feeling in my gut like, ‘That is the person,’ so I’m paying attention to the debates and everything going on just like everybody is.”</span></p>

<p>Instead, the schools will get millions more in one-time funding from the state in exchange for leaving tuition alone as a part of deal with lawmakers that advocates hope is the first step on the road to reversing years of climbing higher education costs.</p>
<p>“This is $50 million that Virginians would’ve otherwise paid in tuition,” said James Toscano, president of Partners for College Affordability and Public Trust, a Washington D.C.-based nonprofit organization that pushes for more affordable college education around the country.</p>
<p>“This is really significant. It’s not the end, but it’s an important moment in the recent history of Virginia higher education.”</p>
<p>The General Assembly included $52.5 million in the state budget to encourage public colleges to keep tuition flat for in-state undergraduate students. If the governing bodies of the schools adopted a no-increase plan, the schools get more money.</p>
<p>Some students will still see an increase on their bills — the deal didn&#8217;t place additional limits on all mandatory fees colleges can charge. Most schools increased some fees between three and five percent, <a href="http://www.schev.edu/index/reports/schev-reports/2018-reports/2018-19-tuition-and-fees-report" target="_blank">on par with last year&#8217;s increases.</a></p>
<p>Some schools are going higher — the University of Mary Washington increased some fees 14 percent as part of a multi-year rate restructuring, which is<a href="https://www.boarddocs.com/va/umw/Board.nsf/files/BB4MUZ66BABE/$file/2019-20%20Budget%20Plan%20and%20Tuition%20%20Fees%20(v2).pdf" target="_blank"> a $556 annual increase for undergrads over last year.</a></p>
<p>Toscano, who is a former vice president of Tidewater Community College, said the tuition freeze is still a &#8220;watershed moment&#8221; that puts Virginia on track to tackle the next steps in college affordability. That could mean a number of policies, from reining in schools&#8217; spending to keeping the tuition freeze in place.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hopefully this year was not an exception, but rather a model for the future,&#8221; said Jared Calfee, executive director of <a href="https://www.virginia21.org/" target="_blank">Virginia21, an advocacy group</a> that focuses on issues related to young people in the state.</p>
<p>&#8220;Predictable and stable funding from the state will help keep tuition costs from rising, and adequately funding financial aid is absolutely critical to closing equity gaps and ensuring that low-income Virginians have equal access and opportunity to pursue and complete a post-secondary education.&#8221;</p>
<p>The State Council of Higher Education for Virginia<a href="http://www.schev.edu/index/reports/schev-reports/2018-reports/2018-19-tuition-and-fees-report" target="_blank"> says</a> undergraduate students at public institutions pay, on average, 55 percent of the cost of education in tuition and mandatory fees. The state&#8217;s share has fallen to 45 percent, &#8220;22 percentage points below the 67 percent outlined in the state’s cost-share policy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;SCHEV estimates that if the state share were aligned with the policy goal, tuition would be as much as $3,000 lower than current levels, or about 40 percent less,&#8221; the council says.</p>
<p>Del. Chris Jones, R-Suffolk, who serves as the chair of the House Appropriations committee, told the <a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/plus/tuition-is-staying-flat-at-every-virginia-college-next-year/article_40ba77dd-2d91-5e32-8ca5-c5d614fe3699.html" target="_blank">Richmond Times-Dispatch</a> he hopes the General Assembly can retain the tuition freeze in next year&#8217;s budget.</p>
<p>In addition to the freeze, lawmakers included $19 million in the final budget for state financial aid programs for low-income students and <a href="http://www.schev.edu/docs/default-source/tuition-aid-section/financial-aid/vtagfactsheet.pdf?sfvrsn=4" target="_blank">those who attend private schools.</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A 2014 <a href="http://jlarc.virginia.gov/pdfs/reports/Rpt461.pdf" target="_blank">report from the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission</a> said that while the state has decreased funding to public colleges and universities, tuition increases have more than made up for the cuts. The report also called Virginia&#8217;s public institutions &#8220;among the nation’s most expensive for students.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">JLARC found the average tuition revenue collected per student increased $4,177 (adjusted for inflation) between 1998 and 2012, exceeding the $2,831 decrease in state per-student funding in the same time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Between 2002 and 2012, tuition and fees at Virginia’s 15 public four-year colleges increased 122 percent, according to the report.</span></p>
<p>Increases have been particularly steep at William &amp; Mary in Williamsburg, which had a 128 percent increase in tuition in a decade, Toscano wrote in <a href="https://www.dailypress.com/news/opinion/local-voices/dp-edt-oped-toscano-1118-story.html" target="_blank">an op-ed in The Daily Press.</a></p>
<p>The General Assembly&#8217;s one-time tuition freeze plan means it will be the first time in nearly 20 years that in-state undergraduate students at Virginia&#8217;s public colleges haven&#8217;t seen a tuition increase, Toscano said.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> <a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/plus/tuition-is-staying-flat-at-every-virginia-college-next-year/article_40ba77dd-2d91-5e32-8ca5-c5d614fe3699.html" target="_blank">Six schools also froze tuition for out-of-state students </a> and t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">he community college system froze all student fees.</span></p>
<p>State funding increases will range from <span style="font-weight: 400;">$183,000 more for Richard Bland College near Petersburg to $8 million for the Virginia Community College System.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next step in addressing college affordability will require some work on colleges’ parts and might mean the state needs to impose conditions on state funding sent to colleges, Toscano said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like most state-funded bodies, money for public colleges and universities fell during the Great Recession, but spending on higher education has been on the rise for about five years, Toscano said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is a cop-out to blame state funding alone,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the JLARC report, tuition raises across the state were attributed to a number of factors beside decreases in state funding. The report cited increased spending on non-academic services, especially athletics and real estate and construction. The report estimated 56 percent of the increase in per-student cost between 2002 and 2012 has been for athletics, student housing, dining and security.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Toscano said that schools will need to be more disciplined when it comes to spending. The state could, if needed, limit what state money funds on campus, he said.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That is a complex, public policy that requires revenue set aside for stable higher education funding,&#8221; Toscano said. &#8220;It also requires institutional accountability that really has not been demanded up until this year.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Richmond-based, liberal-leaning think tank reported that this past school year was the first time since 2014 that more than half of all eligible schools participated in the Community Eligibility Provision, a federal program that reimburses schools and school systems with certain percentages of high-poverty students for providing free breakfast and lunch.</p>
<p>Virginia Superintendent of Public Instruction <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.doetest.virginia.gov%2Fadministrators%2Fsuperintendents_memos%2F2019%2F112-19.docx&amp;t=YzE3NzIxN2Q1NGU3ODI1YmIzZTYzNWRmOTM0MjVlNzNkZDlhZWYzOSxjanlHNU54aw%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3A8vL0Z9gSHNzVougY5zxdCg&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fthehalfsheet.org%2Fpost%2F185110391288%2Froom-for-improvement-opportunities-remain-to&amp;m=1" target="_blank">James Lane spelled out the requirements in a memo earlier this month.</a></p>
<p>To be eligible, a school district, one or more schools, or groups of schools in the division must participate in the National School Lunch Program and School Breakfast Program; must have 40 percent or more students eligible for free meals through Temporary Assistance to Needy Families, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance or other programs; agree to provide breakfast and lunch at no charge to all students; and cover any cost beyond the federal reimbursement rate.</p>
<p>This past school year, 420 Virginia schools participated, benefiting about 200,000 students. That amounts to 58 percent of eligible schools, up from 48 percent the year before.</p>
<p>But there are still more than 300 schools in the state eligible for the program that did not participate, affecting 150,000 students, the institute said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The rate of food insecurity among children presents a threat to the health and well-being of thousands of children within Virginia,&#8221; the institute wrote. &#8220;It&#8217;s vital that eligible schools participate in CEP to help make sure children facing hunger have access to regular, nutritious meals in their schools.&#8221;</p>
<p>Participation in the program &#8220;reduces the level of stigma faced by students who receive free or reduced-price lunch,&#8221; The Commonwealth Institute wrote in its analysis.</p>
<p>&#8220;Adopting CEP eliminates this distinction between students participating in FRPL and those who are not.&#8221;</p>
<p>It also makes things easier for school administrators, who no longer have to keep records ensuring that only students eligible for free and reduced lunch use the program, the institute noted.</p>

<p>Based on response rates to the 2010 census questionnaire, Norfolk, Hampton, Lynchburg, Richmond and Fairfax, Lee, New Kent and Chesterfield counties have the 10 hardest-to-count census tracts.</p>
<p>Response rates to the first mailed questionnaires in 2010 for those localities ranged from 33 percent for a part of Norfolk to 59 percent for a section of Chesterfield County.</p>
<p>CUNY considered any census tract with a response rate less than 73 percent to be hard to count. <a href="http://www.censushardtocountmaps2020.us/" target="_blank">According to its analysis</a>, 215 of the state&#8217;s 1,906 census tracts fell into that category.</p>
<p>Being a hard-to-count tract doesn&#8217;t mean people don&#8217;t get counted; it just measures how many people required outreach, usually in the form of a representative visiting to get a completed questionnaire.</p>
<p>&#8220;These areas and population groups are considered &#8216;hard to count&#8217; because the Census Bureau sends enumerators into the field to talk with each non-responding household one-by-one,&#8221; CUNY researchers wrote.</p>
<p>&#8220;This &#8216;non-response follow-up&#8217; component of the census can be difficult, time-consuming (and) costly (to the Bureau, and to taxpayers). And if these groups and their communities are not counted fairly &amp; accurately, they will be deprived of equal political representation and vital public and private resources.&#8221;</p>
<p>Traditionally, people of color, children under five years old, people who rent, single-parent households, immigrants, low-income people, people living in multi-family housing and people with limited English proficiency are hard to count, CUNY&#8217;s analysis said.</p>
<p>In its analysis, the center also considered how many people have reliable internet access, since this will be the first census conducted primarily online.</p>
<p>During 2013-17, 16.5 percent of Virginia&#8217;s households had either no internet access or dial-up only, according to the latest American Community Survey estimates.</p>
<p>Those are all factors considered by members of Gov. Ralph <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/04/11/without-outreach-funding-it-will-be-harder-to-count-virginias-children-immigrants-and-senior-citizens-in-2020/" target="_blank">Northam&#8217;s appointed Complete Count Commission</a>, which is working on outreach strategies ahead of the census.</p>
<p>CUNY, though, included another potential issue: 2,903 people did not receive a questionnaire at all because they they live in tracts that did not have &#8220;traditional addresses, had large numbers of seasonally vacant housing, or were otherwise rural or sparsely populated,&#8221; researchers wrote.</p>
<p>Kelly Thomasson, secretary of the commonwealth, said about a half a percent of Virginians (roughly 45,000 people) went uncounted in the 2010 census. She consulted the University of Virginia’s Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service to determine that number.</p>
<p>Getting an accurate count in the upcoming census will help determine Virginia&#8217;s share of $675 billion federal dollars, as well how many seats in the U.S. House of Representatives the state gets, guides how the state draws legislative districts and determines how many votes Virginia gets in the electoral college.</p>
<p>Northam included $1.5 million in his budget proposal to pay for census outreach. It didn&#8217;t make it into the final budget.</p>

(Photo by Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Susan Gray Eakin Page, a digital archives coordinator at the Library of Virginia, considers the painstaking process of making former Gov. Tim Kaine’s records accessible online “one of her babies.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine turned over more than 900 boxes of paper records and almost two million electronic records when he left office in 2010.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Library staff began reviewing emails and files and adding it to an online database for the public to access. When the first round of emails — 66,000 — went online in 2014, staff celebrated the achievement, saying Virginia was <a href="https://www.lva.virginia.gov/news/press/GovernorKaineEmails.pdf" target="_blank">one of the first state libraries</a> in the country to do something like that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But we found out not everyone found our baby as cute as we did,” Page said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Library of Virginia has slowly processed electronic gubernatorial records with reduced state money for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">eight years. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The library is primarily funded by the state, but the agency has lost more than 60 positions in the last decade because of decreases in funding, Librarian of Virginia Sandra Treadway said. The Library of Virginia currently gets $6.4 million a year from the state and operates a foundation to collect and manage donations</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers have put pressure on the library to work faster, but have shied away from giving</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the library funding it would need to do so. It&#8217;s not required for the Library of Virginia to process and post searchable <a href="http://www.virginiamemory.com/collections/kaine/" target="_blank">gubernatorial records online</a>; just to catalog and make them available to the public when the administration leaves office, which doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean any sort of searchable database.</span></p>
<p>The library said the records are exempt from the Freedom of Information Act while they are being cataloged, <a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/virginia/want-records-from-past-governors-get-ready-to-wait-virginia/article_41f2daad-a6b4-5f87-8676-826b82bbe207.html" target="_blank">effectively making them off limits</a> as the staff work through the backlog.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right now, the work of processing and adding electronic gubernatorial files to a digital archive is funded by federal grants and donated methods, like artificial intelligence, Page said during a presentation at the Library of Virginia Tuesday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A handful of staff members handle the entire project, Treadway said. Four archivists work on the effort part of the time and one person is dedicated fully to the project.</span></p>
<p>With more funding, archival staff could work at a pace more acceptable to lawmakers, Page said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We all want to do this faster, we all want to be done, it&#8217;s just not something we can do without resources,&#8221; she said. &#8220;People deserve access to these records and we want them to have access to these records.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The library is 62 percent done with 1.5 million Kaine administration emails. After his emails, they still have 1.8 million additional records, like photos, PDFs and word documents to review.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then, archivists have to get through roughly 10 million files from former Gov. Bob McDonnell and 12 million from former Gov. Terry McAuliffe. </span></p>
<p>Smartphones and other technology became more common during Kaine’s administration which explains the increase of electronic files between administrations, said Roger Christman, the senior state governors’ records archivist.</p>
<p>Staff is about halfway through Kaine&#8217;s 900 boxes of paper records and have scanned some of the documents into the digital archives. That&#8217;s taken longer than normal as well, Christman said, because of staff reductions at the library.</p>
<p><a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+sum+HB1702" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Todd Gilbert, R-Shenandoah</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=191&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=sb1703" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen.David Suetterlein, R-Roanoke</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, carried bills in the General Assembly this past session that would have required the library to make official documents from gubernatorial administrations accessible to the public within a year of receiving them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bills died in a conference committee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In the era of the internet and with technology being as advanced as it is today, Virginians are still being forced to wait 10 years to have access to official correspondence from past governors’ administrations,” Gilbert said in a statement when he introduced his bill.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When the Library of Virginia receives the correspondence, it should be put online and available without delay.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Library of Virginia said </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/proposed-bill-aims-to-shorten-library-of-virginias-records-cataloging-process/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">that would require more money</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for staffing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right now, the Library of Virginia manually reviews records for anything that should be redacted or that are not actually public according to the Freedom of Information Act. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After that, staff converts the records to a PDF file and loads them into the library’s digital archives system in a way that allows users to search the files.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The library is trying to make the process faster with help from Waterloo University in Canada, which has an artificial intelligence tool that helps sort through the documents. A human reviews the work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While this tool does reduce costs and time associated with redaction of protected information, it does not replace human interaction with records, and it is currently used by the library at a cost of two cents per file,”</span><a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+oth+HB1702F122+PDF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a fiscal analysis completed for Gilbert and Suetterlein’s legislation said.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In all, the library estimated it would need four new permanent archivists at a cost of $410,000 a year and $642,000 in one-time contractual services &#8220;associated with the end<br />
of the current administration in fiscal year 2022.&#8221; The four archivists would continue to work for the library to make sure work finished in the timeline laid out in Gilbert and Suetterlein&#8217;s proposals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To comply with the timing requirement, the library estimated it would need another $535,000 in one-time funding to clear the existing backlog of records.</span></p>
<p>“I wish there was an easy button we could push to put all the emails we received overnight up but unfortunately that doesn’t exist,” Page said. “If we were to do this much much faster, there would be a cost involved.”</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But we also hear people say, ‘But what if they run against each other, then maybe one won’t win the general election.’ We need to call that kind of thinking out.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Later in the same speech, Herring became the latest black woman who appears to be considering higher office.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She announced Saturday she would relaunch a leadership PAC she formed in 2015 when she became House Caucus chair.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lawyer from Northern Virginia also said she is “seriously considering” a run for attorney general in 2021.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recently, </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/05/07/after-executive-branchs-scandals-two-new-pacs-form-to-fill-the-fundraising-gap/" target="_blank"> Sen. Jennifer <span style="font-weight: 400;">McClellan, D-Richmond,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/va-del-carroll-foy-launches-pac-becoming-second-woman-to-signal-possible-statewide-run/2019/05/14/209baac4-75a1-11e9-b7ae-390de4259661_story.html?utm_term=.70bab9ef6e3e" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Jennifer Carroll Foy, D-Woodbridge,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> launched separate PACS to support Democratic candidates of color. Those PACs appear to be laying the groundwork for statewide runs.</span></p>
<p>Like Carroll Foy and McClellan and the governorship, Herring would be the first black woman to run for Attorney General; no woman of color has been nominated for statewide office by either party in the state&#8217;s history.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She the People is a national organization that supports women of color candidates, organizers and political advocates. Saturday’s event was held at a time of heightened focus on minority Virginians after a racist photo of two people — one in a Ku Klux Klan costume and another in blackface — was found on <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/02/02/in-his-own-words-northam-describes-moonwalking-in-blackface-denies-appearing-in-kkk-photo/" target="_blank">Gov. Ralph Northam’s medical school yearbook page.</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Days after the photo got attention, Stanford professor Vanessa Tyson said she was sexually assaulted by Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax. Another woman, Meredith Watson, made similar accusations within the same week. <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/fairfax-denies-metoo-allegation-in-3-a-m-statement/" target="_blank">He denied the claims</a> and implied the women made them up to sabotage his presumed ascension to governor if Northam was to resign.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, Attorney General Mark Herring, who would become governor if Northam and Fairfax couldn’t take the post, admitted to wearing blackface in college.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s an opportunity for us right here in Virginia to have the right people represented on the ballot, the right set of leaders who adhere to our values who want to govern with their full humanity in view, who don&#8217;t have skeletons in the closet and expect us to forgive acts of racism, to forgive accusations of sexual assault, to overlook that because they’re a member of a particular party,” She the People Founder Aimee Allison said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Women of color are not here to play, we have higher standards.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She the People is making stops in key swing states ahead of legislative races and the 2020 presidential election. Virginia was first on the list of stops, sandwiched between an all-women presidential forum the group held last month in Texas and future stops in Pennsylvania, Georgia, Arizona and Florida.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are only a handful of statehouse races around the country this year. With Republicans holding onto a slim majority in the legislature, Virginia will likely be of interest to national groups on both sides of the political spectrum.</span></p>
<p>Allison said Virginia is important for a number of policy reasons, the most pressing being abortion. <a href="https://thinkprogress.org/virginia-lawmaker-vows-georgia-style-abortion-ban-if-the-gop-controls-wins-the-upcoming-elections-94cfc51628f2/" target="_blank">Last week, Del. Bob Thomas, R-Stafford, said</a> if Republicans could secure the governor&#8217;s seat and legislative majority, the party would introduce a bill similar to one passed in Georgia that would ban abortion from the time a fetal heartbeat is detected. That can be as early as six weeks, when many women don&#8217;t know they&#8217;re pregnant, opponents of the law have said.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the sort of policy minority women voters could stop, if they&#8217;re politically engaged enough to vote or run for office, Allison said.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speakers at She the People&#8217;s event avoided rehashing the details of the executive branch scandals and recent abortion laws passed in other states, but made no bones that women of color would be the ones to right Virginia&#8217;s course when it comes to gender and racial inequity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In wide-ranging panel discussions with elected officials from Virginia, women discussed the importance of rallying minority voters and supporting minority candidates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is time that we take our seat at the table,” McClellan said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are a government by and for the people. What that means is that government is only as good as the people who participate, the people who show up to vote, the people who run for office, the people that show up in the walls of power advocating for things for our communities. We are more diverse than ever but we have a long way to go.”</span></p>

Ralph Northam dedicated the month of May to conversations about criminal justice reform, he vetoed a bill that would have required minimum sentencing for people charged with domestic violence crimes for the second time.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dels. Kathleen Murphy, D-Fairfax, and Todd Gilbert, R-Shenandoah, co-sponsored </span><a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+sum+HB2042" target="_blank">a bill</a> that would have required 60 days of jail time for someone who is convicted of an act of domestic violence within 10 years of being convicted of assault and battery against a family member.</p>
<p>Existing law says a person who commits assault and battery on a family member three times in 20 years would be guilty of the <a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title18.2/chapter1/section18.2-10/" target="_blank">lowest-level felony charge</a> in the state, punishable by up to one to five years in jail and a $2,500 fine.</p>
<p>Northam vetoed Murphy and Gilbert&#8217;s bill, saying legislation that creates minimum mandatory sentencing targets people of color. But data from the state shows in the case of domestic violence, punishment is handed down almost evenly among races when it&#8217;s handed down at all.</p>
<figure id="attachment_8520" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:300px;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-8520" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/2019-session-pohotos-76-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/2019-session-pohotos-76-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/2019-session-pohotos-76-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/2019-session-pohotos-76-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/2019-session-pohotos-76-696x464.jpg 696w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/2019-session-pohotos-76-1068x712.jpg 1068w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/2019-session-pohotos-76-630x420.jpg 630w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/2019-session-pohotos-76.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Gov. Ralph Northam speaks to the Commonwealth Transportation Board. (Photo by Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p>&#8220;We rely on our judges and juries to make sound sentencing decisions based on the circumstances of each individual case,&#8221; Northam wrote in <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+amd+HB2042AG" target="_blank">a veto statement.</a></p>
<p>&#8220;In making these decisions, judges and juries consider a number of factors before determining a sentence, and their sentence decisions are the result of intense deliberation.  Imposing mandatory minimum sentences eliminates this discretion and ties the hands of the individuals we have entrusted to make these important decisions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Republicans lambasted his decision shooting down the bipartisan bill, saying Northam was trying to make amends for <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/02/02/in-his-own-words-northam-describes-moonwalking-in-blackface-denies-appearing-in-kkk-photo/" target="_blank">a racist photo found on his medical school yearbook</a> at the expense of abuse victims.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Data do not indicate that mandatory minimum sentences keep our communities safer. Instead, mandatory minimums are disproportionately harming people and communities of color,” Northam wrote in <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/05/01/gov-northam-i-am-working-make-criminal-justice-system-fairer-communities-color/?utm_term=.a5ad6ee54092" target="_blank">a Washington Post editorial</a> the same day he announced the veto.</span></p>
<p>The veto kicked off his Second Chances month, which will &#8220;facilitate conversations and participate in events focused on criminal justice reform and reentry programming,&#8221; according to <a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/proclamations/proclamation/second-chance-month.html" target="_blank">a press release.</a></p>
<p>&#8220;My first reaction was that he was protecting himself and his legacy at the expense of protecting victims of chronic domestic violence and that was infuriating,&#8221; said Gilbert, House majority leader.</p>
<p>&#8220;My other thought when I saw the veto was that I think the governor should be aware that communities of color are deeply affected by chronic domestic abuse &#8230; there are lots of African American women who need this help and need this relief and he should have thought more about them than protecting his legacy.&#8221;</p>
<figure id="attachment_8496" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:300px;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-8496" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/2019-session-pohotos-52-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/2019-session-pohotos-52-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/2019-session-pohotos-52-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/2019-session-pohotos-52-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/2019-session-pohotos-52-696x464.jpg 696w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/2019-session-pohotos-52-1068x712.jpg 1068w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/2019-session-pohotos-52-630x420.jpg 630w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/2019-session-pohotos-52.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Republican House Majority Leader Todd Gilbert. (Photo by Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p>(According to <a href="http://www.vdh.virginia.gov/content/uploads/sites/18/2018/02/2015-FIPS-Annual-Report.pdf" target="_blank">the most recent Department of Health report</a> on family and intimate partner homicide, black Virginians are killed more often than other groups at the hands of a family member, caregiver or partner).</p>
<p>Gilbert said he and Murphy — who didn&#8217;t respond to requests for comment on the legislation — have worked on getting more strict punishment on the books for domestic violence charges for years. The Washington Post <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/with-two-vetoes-northam-swears-off-mandatory-sentencing-minimums/2019/05/01/4e1b5030-6c3c-11e9-8f44-e8d8bb1df986_story.html?utm_term=.f63e4251809d" target="_blank">reported</a> that Murphy told other lawmakers she was &#8220;heartbroken&#8221; over the governor&#8217;s veto.</p>
<p>&#8220;The issue with mandatory minimums is whether you&#8217;re taking away a judge&#8217;s discretion. And certainly that is true, but it may be that mandatory minimums grew up around far too lenient judges just slapping people on the wrist for repeat offenses and not really understanding what those repeat offenses lead to,&#8221; said Gilbert, who was a prosecutor for 15 years and worked on at least one case where repeated domestic violence led to a murder.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s waiting to see if he&#8217;ll introduce similar legislation next session.</p>
<p>&#8220;The issue is whether the governor is going to have satisfied his desire to use these bills to try and improve his image in some way with a certain constituency,&#8221; Gilbert said.</p>
<p>&#8220;At this point, we have no idea whether his veto pen will still be as active next year in trying to rebuild his legacy or not. I certainly don&#8217;t want to waste anybody&#8217;s time if he&#8217;s still going to be committed to rebuilding his image and protecting himself.&#8221;</p>
<h2><strong>&#8216;The scary time for victims&#8217;</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Domestic violence is one issue that bridges racial, socioeconomic and other divides, according to the <a href="https://rga.lis.virginia.gov/Published/2019/RD104/PDF" target="_blank">attorney general’s annual report on domestic violence.</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The attorney general’s office keeps track of domestic violence numbers in the state. It considers elder abuse, child abuse, stalking, dating violence, sexual abuse and trafficking in women and children as domestic violence. Several different charges fall into the category, including homicide and assault and battery.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most recent report, presented to lawmakers in January of this year, found there were 158 family or intimate partner homicides in 2016, the most recent year of data available. It was a 27 percent increase from the year before and made up 33 percent of all homicides in Virginia in 2016.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2017, law enforcement made 23,634 arrests for assault and battery against a family or household member. A “significant number of individuals were charged as repeat offenders,” the report stated. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twenty percent of those arrests resulted in convictions. There were 1,689 felonies charged for third offenses of assault and battery against a family member, which is supposed to result in automatic jail time under current law if committed within 20 years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of those 1,689 charges, there were 1,051 convictions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Sentencing Commission did a special report in relation to Murphy and Gilbert&#8217;s bill, since it would have potentially affected jail capacity around the state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fiscal year 2017, 1,513 people were sentenced for domestic assault and battery for a second time. In 52 percent of those cases, offenders got no jail time. In those cases, offenders can be fined or placed on probation instead.</span></p>
<p>The analysis also looked at race. Among white defendants, 52 percent didn’t get any jail time, 21 percent got less than 60 days and 26 percent got 60 days or more.</p>
<p>Fifty-three percent of black defendants didn’t get any jail time, according to the analysis. Nineteen percent got fewer than 60 days and 26 percent got 60 days or more.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That tracks with what Linda Ellis-Williams, director of programs for the YWCA of Central Virginia in Lynchburg, has seen in her 27-year career working with victims of domestic violence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sentencing varies widely depending on the judge, but she almost always sees jail time partially or fully suspended for perpetrators of domestic violence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s the scary time for victims. They’re so scared already to call the police or do anything because of the threats made toward them,” Ellis-Williams said. “When he gets out, is he going to be more upset because she testified and he got time in jail or something like that? So the consequences for her are real.”</span></p>
<h2><strong>Conviction, punishment often requires victims&#8217; help</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Professionals from around the state who work with victims of domestic violence </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are unsure of the best way to deal with perpetrators of domestic violence. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When jail sentences do happen in domestic abuse cases, the perpetrators&#8217; time behind bars gives victims time to leave the situation, but jail isn’t always a cure-all, according to organizations around the state that work with victims of domestic violence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m not one that says throw them in jail … because a part of me doesn’t think that really helps, but at this point in time, that’s all we really have,” Ellis-Williams said.  “We know repeat offenders sometimes kill. At least the victim stays safe if the perpetrator stays in jail. I’m not sure if jail is the answer, but there has to be some sort of consequence.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Sexual and Domestic Violence Action Alliance, which is cited in the Attorney General&#8217;s report on domestic violence, has opposed mandatory minimums for domestic violence charges since the mid-1990s, said Policy Director </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jonathan Yglesias.</span></p>
<p>“While we applaud legislators’ instincts to take crimes of domestic violence seriously and to seek victim safety, we do not believe that mandatory minimums are a real solution that protects victims of domestic violence<span style="font-weight: 400;">,” the group wrote in <a href="https://allianceinaction.org/2019/05/01/action-alliance-statement-on-governor-northams-veto-of-mandatory-minimum-sentencing-bills/" target="_blank">a blog post after Northam’s veto. </a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span>In fact, mandatory minimums are a costly and simplistic tool that serve to remove judicial discretion and disproportionately impact historically marginalized communities while providing little real safety for victims or true accountability for offenders of domestic violence<span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p>The group worries victims of domestic violence can be jailed as offenders if they retaliate against their abusers, Yglesias said. Plus, jail often isn’t a rehabilitative experience, he said. The group wrote <a href="https://www.richmond.com/opinion/their-opinion/jonathan-yglesias-and-ruth-micklem-column-how-mandatory-minimums-harm/article_b701ba6a-d1d6-53bd-9a61-b742bdaf1c84.html" target="_blank">an editorial in the Richmond Times-Dispatch</a> detailing other options for offenders.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oftentimes, abusers are violent because of another underlying problem, like substance abuse, mental illness or being a victim of past abuse, said Kristen Pine, chief programs officer at the YWCA of South Hampton Roads. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For people like that, jail might be the best option.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Some of the local jails do have effective, evidence-based treatments around cognitive behavioral therapy, so for some abusers … jail time may be great because they get some of that programming but not all jails have that,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For people being charged with domestic violence offenses the first time, judges will suspend jail time if the defendant agrees to go through a </span><a href="https://www.oag.state.va.us/14-initiatives/217-domestic-violence-batterer-intervention-programs" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Batterer Intervention Program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> run by state-approved groups with licensed therapists and counselors. Ellis-Williams sits on the board that helps run the program and considers them one of the state&#8217;s best options for convicted abusers.</span></p>
<p>Gilbert thinks jail for second-time offenders is more than fair. At that point, he said, offenders have had time to seek counseling, therapy or other help they need in part through those court-ordered intervention programs.</p>
<p>&#8220;For especially women who find themselves in a cycle of abuse &#8230; having that period of time of 60 days to perhaps find help or seek intervention or just be free from your abuser and their influence and oppression is an opportunity for people to actually break that cycle,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think 60 days in jail for what is effectively your third time in court for the same thing is onerous in any sense, in fact, it&#8217;s probably still quite generous.&#8221;</p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you or someone you know is experiencing domestic violence, contact the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Family Violence and Sexual Assault Hotline at 1-800-838-8238 for confidential help and referral information. </span></em></p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury) — Nov. 6, 2018.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Department of Elections will hire six new employees this summer, which should help address some of the problems identified in an audit last year, officials said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new positions, funded in the final state budget, represent the “single biggest infusion in new positions to the department as far back as I can remember,” said Chris Piper, commissioner of the Department of Elections. Piper worked in elections for eight years before becoming commissioner. </span></p>
<p>The budget allows for two new training positions, one administrative position, two list maintenance positions and a position to help with geographic information systems (which helps when assigning voters and drawing voting district lines).</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s a pretty exciting thing for all of us,” Piper said at a Board of Elections meeting Tuesday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In September, </span><a href="http://jlarc.virginia.gov/2018-elections.asp" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission cited</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the absence of a full-time staff member to maintain voter rolls and an overarching concern that local registrars don’t get enough guidance from the state on when to add or remove voters from lists.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite that,</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/09/10/study-finds-department-of-elections-fails-to-help-local-registrars-subject-to-political-influence/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the study said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the state&#8217;s voter list is &#8220;likely mostly accurate.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/02/12/lawmakers-budget-money-to-maintain-voter-rolls-fix-elections-system/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers proposed funding in the budget</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to address some of those issues. In the end, the </span><a href="https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/secretariat/2019/1/HB1700/Chapter/1/office-of-administration/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">budget provides $4.2 million more</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the Department of Elections for a total annual budget of $22 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The department plans to hire new employees by early July, Piper said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apartment List, a website that helps people find rental homes, <a href="https://www.apartmentlist.com/rentonomics/teachers-increasingly-struggle-with-housing-affordability/" target="_blank">analyzed the cost of housing as it relates to teachers’ incomes the country’s 50-largest metro areas</a>, which includes three of Virginia’s: Washington D.C.-Northern Virginia, Richmond and Hampton Roads.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While teaching has long been a comparatively low-paying profession, rapid increases in housing costs have exacerbated the struggle of teachers,&#8221; the analysis started. &#8220;While rates of housing cost burden among teachers are lower than the national average, they are higher than that of other Americans with college degrees, and in certain parts of the country — particularly the nation’s high cost coastal metros —  teachers are especially strained.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company looked at teachers whose salary supplies more than 50 percent of a household’s income.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The analysis considered that </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/teachers-pay-falls-behind-other-college-educated-worker-pay-new-study-finds/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">teachers tend to make less than their college-educated peers.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> According to Apartment List, teachers in the Richmond metro area make 27 percent less than college-educated peers; Hampton Roads teachers make 24 percent less than their college-educated peers and teachers in Northern Virginia make 32 percent less than their peers.</span></p>
<p>Virginia lawmakers have tried to correct for teachers&#8217; lagging salaries and approved a budget with money for <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/12/11/with-a-positive-economic-outlook-northam-proposes-teacher-pay-raise-more-money-for-school-construction/" target="_blank">teachers to get up to a 5 percent pay raise</a> over two years. Part of that raise had already been approved and it will require <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/01/16/some-school-districts-may-struggle-to-find-local-match-for-proposed-teacher-pay-raise/" target="_blank">localities to find matching funding.</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apartment List calculated how many people use 30 percent or more of their income toward rent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Richmond, 22 percent of teachers and 14 percent of non-teachers are cost-burdened; Twenty-six percent of teachers in Hampton Roads are cost-burdened compared to 18 percent of non-teachers; in D.C. and Northern Virginia, 28 percent of teachers are cost-burdened while 18 percent of non-teachers are.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nationally, Apartment List calculated about 20 percent of teachers are burdened by their housing costs. In 1990, the company reported, the cost burden rate for teachers was 15 percent </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">lower </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">than that of other college-educated workers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Apartment List, the D.C. metro area had one of the highest cost-burden rates in the country behind Miami, San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Nationally, one-in-five primary earner teachers are burdened by their housing costs, and in some of the nation’s most expensive housing markets, that figure is more than one-in-three,&#8221; the report concluded. &#8220;Widespread teacher strikes and rising attrition rates point to the difficulty of living comfortably on a teacher’s salary.&#8221;</p>

<p>But they also decided not to fully fund those positions in the state budget.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“July 1, 2019, there will be a new law in Virginia that improves the school counselor-to-student ratio and puts us on a real path to the recommendations of the (Board of Education) and the School Counselor Association. That is good news,&#8221; the Virginia Education Association <a href="https://www.veadailyreports.com/2019/05/school-counselor-legislation-another.html" target="_blank">wrote on its website.</a> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The bad news is that the budget language trumps the good, new law and requires far fewer counselors than our students need. As of July 1, the General Assembly is no longer fully funding the (Standards of Quality).&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&#8220;While we’re excited because this is the first time the standard has been updated in almost 30 years, we have such a long way to go,&#8221; said Kathy Burcher, the VEA&#8217;s director of government affairs. &#8220;The fact is the General Assembly has overrode SOQ language …  they truly rewrote the law in the budget; that&#8217;s a really bad precedent to set.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Standards of Quality include the required number of positions the state will fund, as well as things like teaching licensing requirements and class sizes. When it comes to staffing, anything not required by the standards are localities&#8217; financial responsibility. </span></p>
<p>Since 2016, the Board of Education has recommended one full-time counselor for every 250 students regardless of grade level. The standard comes from the<a href="https://www.schoolcounselor.org/administrators/role-of-the-school-counselor" target="_blank"> American School Counselor Association.</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Based on 2015 data, there was about one counselor for every 329 students in Virginia, according to</span><a href="http://www.doe.virginia.gov/boe/meetings/2019/work-session/04-apr/soq-proposals-041719.docx" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">a presentation the Board of Education</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> received this month. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state funds one full-time counselor per 500 elementary students; one full-time counselor per 400 middle-school students and one full-time counselor per 350 students in high schools.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Localities have been paying for additional counselors, Burcher said.</span></p>
<p>Lawmakers in both political parties wanted to boost the number of counselors in schools following recommendations from a <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/09/11/state-school-safety-panel-recommends-bullet-resistant-whiteboards-more-guidance-counselors-more-police/" target="_blank">special House of Delegates committee on school safety</a> formed after the Parkland, Florida school shooting.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The disagreement came in determining what those new staffing numbers should be, since the state has to put up the money for any more required schools staff.</span></p>
<p>Gov. Ralph Northam presented budget amendments in December that included $36 million over three years to increase the number of counselors the state would pay for in schools. It was predicated on a number of tax conformity and policy changes he anticipated the legislature would make, but the final plan was different and left less revenue than expected, Burcher said.</p>
<p>The House of Delegates&#8217; budget proposal retained Northam&#8217;s $36 million plan, while the Senate proposed a $12.1 million plan to provide a smaller increase in school counselors. The Senate&#8217;s proposal estimated the money could pay for 250 more counselors across the state.</p>
<p>Sen. Rosalyn Dance, D-Petersburg, carried legislation to implement Northam&#8217;s plan. It was signed into law in March and survived the reconvened session. Dance&#8217;s bill <span style="font-weight: 400;">requires one full-time school counselor per 375 elementary-school students; one full-time counselor per 325 middle-school students and one full-time counselor per 300 high-school students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Counselors play a critical function in schools as children sometimes struggle with difficult circumstances at home or in the classroom,” Dance said <a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/all-releases/2019/may/headline-840399-en.html" target="_blank">in a statement.</a> “I introduced this legislation to ensure that every child has the opportunity to get help from a counselor when when needed. This is an important step in meeting the needs of our students.” </span></p>
<p>But lawmakers included language in the budget that differs from Dance&#8217;s legislation, and the budget trumps her bill.</p>
<p>The approved budget allows state funding for one counselor for every 455 elementary-school students, one for every 370 middle-school students and one for every 325 high-school students.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That won&#8217;t change much for schools, said Brett Welch, a board member of the Virginia School Counselor Association. She works as a part-time elementary school counselor and district liaison for Henrico County.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it does add more pressure to counselors, who are now required </span><a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+sum+HB1729" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to spend 80 percent of their time counseling students</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While it’s absolutely a step in the right direction … it’s going to be difficult, if not impossible, to spend more time on counseling,” she said.</span></p>
<p>Burcher acknowledges that the budget language, while not ideal, is an improvement from the current standard. It also means, though, in the VEA&#8217;s view, that the state is no longer fully funding the SOQs, she said.</p>
<p>Up until this budget, the VEA considered all required staffing standards to be funded. While the Board of Education&#8217;s recommendations haven&#8217;t matched the approved SOQs for many years, the budget has, until now, provided the funding for what lawmakers have approved, Burcher said.</p>
<p>Northam can remove the language from the budget next year in his budget proposal and lawmakers will have the ability to amend it.</p>

<p>Del. David Bulova, D-Fairfax, introduced <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=191&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb2386" target="_blank">House Bill 2386</a> to create firm rules on when donors to public colleges and universities can be anonymous; what donor information isn&#8217;t subject to the FOIA law and requiring universities (not their fundraising foundations) to keep a document of any terms and conditions attached to donations, which would then make it subject to FOIA.</p>
<p>The bill was left in a House committee this year.</p>
<p>The idea came from an <a href="http://www.fairfaxtimes.com/articles/virginia-supreme-court-agrees-to-hear-gmu-transparency-lawsuit/article_6dd77f5e-57e5-11e9-a81d-2ba6c3299eb1.html" target="_blank">ongoing court case</a> between a group of George Mason University students and the school. The students wanted to see documents that detailed the Koch Foundation&#8217;s donations to the school&#8217;s foundation. The George Mason University Foundation, which accepts and manages donations for the school, denied the request, saying it was separate from the university and not subject to FOIA.</p>
<p>The Virginia Supreme Court took up the case.</p>
<p>GMU has since changed some of its own policies, Bulova said, which he used as a model in his legislation. But every school has a different process and there are no minimum requirements from the state.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once I threw that bill in, I was approached by a number of Virginia&#8217;s universities, not surprisingly, who all talked about or provided me information about their gift agreement policies,&#8221; Bulova said. &#8220;At least in principle, they agreed with what I was trying to accomplish, their concern was they wanted to make sure the language was right so as not to scare off potential donors.&#8221;</p>
<p>The advisory council will consider the best language for the bill. Bulova encouraged members not to wait until the court makes a decision, which could render some of the bill unnecessary.</p>
<p>Members didn&#8217;t have much to say on the bill during their quarterly meeting on Wednesday. Del. Glenn Davis, R-Virginia Beach, wanted clarification on whether individual donors to foundations would be disclosed under Bulova&#8217;s legislation. They wouldn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Elizabeth Hooper, director of state government affairs at Virginia Tech, told the FOIA Advisory Council donations &#8220;will never not have terms,&#8221; but that doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s sinister. Donors may give under conditions like specifying which department or program the money should go toward.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do have concerns that you shouldn&#8217;t be able to stay anonymous if the terms and conditions associated with that donor affects the academic decision-making process,&#8221; Bulova said. &#8220;People have the right to know who is making those decisions.&#8221;</p>

Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond.</p><p>Sen. Jennifer McClellan&#8217;s new political action committee isn&#8217;t for a gubernatorial run — at least not yet.</p>
<p>The Richmond Democrat launched Virginia United this week with the goal of helping capture the General Assembly.</p>
<p>She announced Tuesday morning in a news release that the PAC has already raised $50,000 to support <span style="font-weight: 400;">legislative and local candidates this November. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is the last chance to take the majority before we do redistricting, we’re closer than we’ve ever been before,” McClellan said in an interview. “In 2017, it came down to pulling a name out of a bowl and I don’t want to see that happen again. If we don’t do it now, how long is it going to be?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McClellan’s PAC rollout comes at a time when the state’s top Democrats, who traditionally raise money for legislative races, have reported paltry numbers because of various scandals: A photo with <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/02/02/in-his-own-words-northam-describes-moonwalking-in-blackface-denies-appearing-in-kkk-photo/" target="_blank">someone in blackface and a Ku Klux Klan robe was found on Gov. Ralph Northam&#8217;s</a> medical school yearbook page (he has said he&#8217;s not in the photo); Attorney General <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/02/06/attorney-general-mark-herring-says-he-wore-blackface-in-college/" target="_blank">Mark Herring admitted to wearing blackface</a> in college and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/fairfax-accuser-meredith-watson-calls-him-a-predator-in-first-televised-interview/2019/04/02/b7a6dab6-54c1-11e9-9136-f8e636f1f6df_story.html?utm_term=.86b97bdc9eb1" target="_blank">two women accused Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax</a> of sexual assault.</span></p>
<p>There has been growing speculation McClellan might run for governor in 2021, especially after the accusations against Fairfax surfaced. Before that, he was in line to become governor if Northam stepped down and McClellan appeared to be a shoo-in candidate for lieutenant governor.</p>
<p>Rachel Bitecofer, a professor of political science and assistant director of the Wason Center for Public Policy at Christopher Newport University, sees the PAC as a sign that McClellan is interested in a gubernatorial run, given the avenue it provides to build name recognition and support among fellow Democrats.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a real indication that she&#8217;s definitely eyeing that gubernatorial bid for me,&#8221; Bitecofer said.</p>
<p>Fairfax, once seen as a potential Democratic front-runner, is no longer viable and Herring is vulnerable, said Bitecofer, who is predicting a large Democratic gubernatorial field in 2021 that could include a return by former Gov. Terry McAuliffe. He opted not to run for president<a href="https://www.apnews.com/64cda559df5d4510bff9a9ee269ba0f0" target="_blank"> but has demurred about whether he might run for governor again.</a></p>
<p>If McClellan did run for governor and won, she&#8217;d be the first woman to hold that position.</p>
<p>But Virginia United is not necessarily McClellan&#8217;s future gubernatorial PAC, McClellan said.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;My number one priority is winning the majority and then using that majority in 2020 to get some of the things that I and other Democrats have been trying to do for over a decade,&#8221; she said. &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond that, I&#8217;m thinking about how and where I can best serve the commonwealth. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;ll make a decision on that after we get the majority and get our work done.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McClellan said the scandals in the executive branch were one consideration in choosing to launch Virginia United now, but her focus is on winning a majority to pass bills that have been blocked in the legislature for years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Time will tell how much they’ll be able to do, but if I’m being honest, I think the party came to rely too heavily on the top three guys, or whoever the highest ranking Democrat was,” she said. ”It’s like any muscle, if we don’t exercise it, it gets weaker and we’re so close and there’s so much at stake, we need every cylinder firing at full throttle.”</span></p>
<p>Tram Nguyen, the co-executive director at New Virginia Majority, Del. Cia Price, D-Newport News, and Alexsis Rodgers, communications director for the Virginia League for Planned Parenthood also felt compelled to respond after February&#8217;s scandals and formed the Rising Power PAC.</p>
<p>&#8220;In these moments of deep political crises, we see character we haven&#8217;t seen before and we saw a lack of leadership,&#8221; Rodgers said. &#8220;There&#8217;s only so long that you can really be outraged until you say, &#8216;What are you going to do, what&#8217;s the path forward?'&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In the midst of Virginia burning down … there’s this hope… and women of color can lead the way forward,” she said.</span></p>
<p>Rising Power launched last week and has about 50 supporters so far, Rodgers said. The group is still finalizing board procedures.</p>
<p>&#8220;The PAC is led by &amp; supports (women of color) leaders committed to defending our rights, promoting dignity, and dismantling racial inequity,&#8221; Del. Jennifer Carroll Foy, D-Woodbridge, <a href="https://twitter.com/JCarrollFoy" target="_blank">tweeted Sunday</a> while asking people to donate.</p>
<p>McClellan and Rodgers listed similar policy focuses for each PAC education funding; school disciplinary reform so students don&#8217;t end up in legal trouble for issues in the classroom; expanding and protecting access to health care, including reproductive health; anti-discrimination legislation in housing and employment and solar energy initiatives.</p>
<p>Virginia United and Rising Power will also support local races. McClellan said policy-making doesn&#8217;t stop at the state level: Criminal justice reform, for example, can be carried out by local commonwealth&#8217;s attorneys, she said.</p>
<p>Rising Power wants to support candidates who are &#8220;very qualified but running against insurmountable odds, financially,&#8221; Rodgers said.</p>
<p>&#8220;How do we make sure women of color, when they run, are well-qualified and committed to progressive values, they don&#8217;t get so beat on the money race?&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>McClellan said she&#8217;s noticed increased interest in black women candidates, especially since Stacey Abrams <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/stacey-abrams-lost-the-georgia-governors-raise-but-her-star-is-rising/2019/02/02/1c3f4b74-2737-11e9-ad53-824486280311_story.html?utm_term=.c88295e4d7a0" target="_blank">lost Georgia&#8217;s gubernatorial race by 55,000 votes, </a>in part, some analysts said, <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/11/7/18071438/midterm-election-results-voting-rights-georgia-florida" target="_blank">because of voter suppression.</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is something that&#8217;s been building for a long time,&#8221; McClellan said of the new PACs. &#8220;We have seen informal support systems building up for years and I think this was just a way to formalize that.&#8221;</span></p>

(Virginia Lottery) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A new interpretation of a federal law by the U.S. Department of Justice could mean some nationwide games offered by the Virginia Lottery would have to stop, cutting off about 15 percent of the agency’s annual sales.</span></p>
<p>The Virginia Lottery is following legal proceedings &#8220;very closely&#8221; related to the opinion, said spokesperson John Hagerty, but has not filed its own lawsuit against the federal government.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The DOJ issued an opinion in late 2018 about the Wire Act, which was passed in 1961 to curb gambling operations that funded organized crime. Federal officials now say the law is “not uniformly limited to gambling on sporting events or contests,” and prohibitions in it apply to lottery games played among states, like the Mega Millions game.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2010, New York and Illinois wanted clarification on whether its lottery agencies could use the internet and out-of-state processors to sell lottery tickets to people living in their states. The Department of Justice at the time </span><a href="https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/olc/opinions/2011/09/31/state-lotteries-opinion_0.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said the Wire Act didn’t apply to lottery games.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new opinion reverses that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While the Wire Act is not a model of artful drafting, we conclude that the words of the statute are sufficiently clear and that all but one of its prohibitions sweep beyond sports gambling,” </span><a href="https://www.justice.gov/olc/file/1121531/download" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the opinion states.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The New Hampshire Lottery Commission </span><a href="https://www.governor.nh.gov/news-media/press-2019/documents/20190215-wire-act-barr-complaint.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sued over</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the ruling. The state, like Virginia, is also part of several multi-jurisdictional groups that sell tickets for larger lottery games, like Powerball and Mega Millions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The recent opinion could make it illegal to operate any lottery game, since much of the infrastructure for lottery games — companies that create the tickets or handle the randomization aspect — are national companies, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">New Hampshire officials wrote in the complaint.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, the</span><a href="https://www.unionleader.com/news/courts/feds-move-to-dismiss-nh-lottery-suit-admit-wire-act/article_299488ec-1ad8-52b8-b7dc-7953b4ffeb26.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> federal government asked a judge to dismiss New Hampshire’s lawsuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> because the 2018 opinion was not meant to target lotteries or lottery vendor, a claim disputed by states and lottery agencies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A judge later ruled </span><a href="https://www.nhpr.org/post/judge-says-nh-lottery-commission-suit-may-proceed-odds-success-unknown#stream/0" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the lawsuit could proceed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> while the DOJ reviews the most recent opinion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Lottery signed on to </span><a href="https://www.michigan.gov/documents/ag/Amicus_Michigan_Bureau_of_State_Lottery_in_Support_of_Plaintiff..__648890_7.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an amicus brief in the case with six other state lottery agencies</span></a>,<span style="font-weight: 400;"> five states and the District of Columbia. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attorney General Mark Herring</span><a href="https://ago.wv.gov/Documents/03-21-2019%20Letter%20to%20AG%20Barr.PDF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> also signed on to a letter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with 24 other attorneys general asking U.S. Attorney General William Barr for a meeting to discuss what a change in the Wire Act’s interpretation would mean.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“State-run and multi-state lotteries are a consistent source of state revenue, representing many billions of dollars in annual funding used to fund vital state services such as schools and other educational initiatives, services for senior citizens, and infrastructure projects,&#8221; the attorneys general wrote to Barr.  “In light of these concerns, we ask for time to meet with you in the coming weeks to confirm that the department does not intend to enforce this law against state lotteries and their associated vendors.”</span></p>
<p>In the brief filed by lottery agencies around the country, Michigan officials estimated the 47 government-operated lotteries brought in a combined $80 billion in revenue in 2017. In New Hampshire&#8217;s complaints, attorneys said the 45 states that offer multi-jurisdictional games made a combined $7.8 billion in 2017.</p>
<p>&#8220;The lotteries are now faced with choosing between permanently losing millions of dollars in funding for vital public services or potentially facing criminal liability,&#8221; Michigan lottery officials wrote in the brief Virginia signed on to.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia uses five out-of-state vendors for its games, according to Hagerty, the lottery spokesman. Last fiscal year, 12 percent of the agency’s $2.1 billion in sales were from three multi-state games Virginia offers.</span></p>
<p><a href="file:///C:/Users/Mechelle/Downloads/FinancialReportFY18.pdf">Last year in Virginia,</a> the Cash4Life game made $15.2 million; the Powerball game brought in $130.78 million and MegaMillions made $110.39 million.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to know exactly how much those games&#8217; sales ended up going toward public education. Lottery proceeds go toward K-12 education in Virginia, which is the money left after paying commissions to retailers who carry the games, the agency&#8217;s operating costs and prizes.</p>
<p>A decision in the New Hampshire case is expected by early June.</p>

Ralph Northam. (Ned Oliver/ Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia will look for its first chief equity, diversity and inclusion officer to guide Gov. Ralph Northam through his remaining time in office.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Northam’s Chief of Staff Clark Mercer told the Virginia Asian Advisory Board Thursday that the administration intends to post a listing for the job soon. It will be one of a handful of similar state-level positions in the country.</span></p>
<p>The job&#8217;s description — sent to members of the General Assembly on Friday — includes the responsibility to &#8220;develop a sustainable framework for the continued promotion of inclusive practices across Virginia state government (and) to develop a measurable, strategic plan to identify and address systemic inequities in formal and informal policies and practices within Virginia government.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the jobs of the future senior-level staff member in the governor’s office will be to help Northam determine the best ways to tackle racial inequity — an area he has a renewed focus on since a photo with blackface and a Ku Klux Klan costume was found on his <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/02/02/in-his-own-words-northam-describes-moonwalking-in-blackface-denies-appearing-in-kkk-photo/" target="_blank">medical school yearbook page</a>. (Northam denied being in that photo but admitted to another instance of wearing blackface).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Obviously February was a difficult month for the governor and his family, his administration, all the folks that serve his administration on boards and Virginians in general,” Mercer told the Asian Advisory Board. “It was also quite an eye-opener for the governor in terms of stepping back and listening and learning. The governor has a lot of listening and learning to do.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new position is fully funded through the end of Northam’s term with money already allocated to the governor’s office, Mercer said. For it to become a permanent position that outlasts Northam, the General Assembly would need to codify it with legislation defining the position and then funding it through the budget.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mercer said the future official will have a role in ensuring the state has diverse hiring and retention practices and help facilitate conversations between state agencies and departments to address inequities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If we’re going to be out talking about the importance of diversity and inclusion, we need to practice that in our business practices,” Mercer said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said the governor, a Democrat, has worked on issues of inequity for a long time, but efforts have usually been “thwarted by the majority.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recently, the administration has prioritized looking at procurement practices around small, women and minority-owned businesses. Northam suggested </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/about-that-veto-session-i-81-funding-restoring-drivers-licenses-for-people-who-owe-court-fines-census-funding-and-more/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">budget amendments during the reconvened General Assembly</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> session to make sure more of those businesses got state contracts. Republican lawmakers preferred to wait until an audit of the state department that handles those contracts was completed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maternal mortality rates among women of color specifically has also become a focus for Northam, Mercer said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The General Assembly passed </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/general-assembly-passes-legislation-ordering-review-of-maternal-mortality/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a bill from Republican Del. Roxann Robinson</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Chesterfield charging the Department of Health with reviewing the rate of pregnancy-related deaths in Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Otherwise, Mercer said on Thursday, the new diversity officer would help the administration identify other areas that need attention.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We don’t have all the answers and we need some help,” he said.</span></p>

<p>“The governor would like to have an off-cycle review of our history and civic curriculum, what we’re teaching, making sure its accurate,” said Clark Mercer, Northam’s chief of staff. “We recognize it&#8217;s an issue and one we’re going to tackle.”</p>
<p>Mercer told the Virginia Asian Advisory Board Thursday that the governor has heard in recent months that there&#8217;s a need to take a look at what students are learning in history classes, especially when it comes to African American history. Northam made public reference to it during <a href="https://www.godanriver.com/news/local/governor-holds-roundtable-with-african-american-leaders-in-danville/article_05c38260-4b69-11e9-98f3-e3a3bb5d5d12.html" target="_blank">a community meeting in Danville.</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Curriculum standards, and subsequently, Standards of Learning and textbooks are reviewed and adopted every seven years for school subjects. History was last reviewed in 2015, meaning the subject wasn’t due for another review until 2022. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/05/01/virginia-explained-how-virginias-history-textbooks-are-vetted/" target="_blank">The Mercury recently reported</a> on how textbooks, adopted to reflect curriculum standards, can fall short in providing full, nuanced historical accounts, according to some state officials.</p>
<p>Northam was aware of concerns about the history curriculum before his <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/02/02/in-his-own-words-northam-describes-moonwalking-in-blackface-denies-appearing-in-kkk-photo/" target="_blank">blackface photo scandal</a>, Mercer said, but he began hearing it more as he&#8217;s held roundtable discussions and meets one-on-one with people to discuss racial inequity.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s timely work, Mercer said, regardless of the photo. The<span style="font-weight: 400;"> state is coming up on the 400th anniversary of the first slaves coming to Virginia, which happened in Fort Monroe, a decommissioned army base that the state now owns. </span></p>
<p>“Everyone talks about Jamestown, Yorktown. They arrived at Point Comfort, which is modern-day Hampton,” Mercer said, referring to the slaves. “The commonwealth owns a piece of property, that within 100 yards, the first slaves arrived and slaves were freed and, I would offer, not many children going through K-12 know that history.”</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Northam recently sent <a href="https://pilotonline.com/news/local/article_bad0699a-6296-11e9-ada3-3733fd0d85d0.html" target="_blank">a letter to the Fort Monroe Authority Board of Trustees</a> asking it to remove an archway dedicated to Jefferson Davis at the entrance of the Jefferson Davis Memorial Park. The board unanimously agreed to take steps to do so.</span></p>

Ralph Northam has said he's concerned students were learning incorrect information about African American history — part of the reason he formed a commission to evaluate the state's Standards of Learning and local curricula. (Mechelle Hankerson/ Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a Houghton Mifflin Harcourt textbook allowed for use in Virginia high school classrooms, the 1965 Watts riots in Los Angeles were a burst of violence brought on by black Americans’ frustration about discrimination.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But that’s not the whole story: Before the riots broke out, there was <a href="https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-watts-riots-explainer-20150715-htmlstory.html" target="_blank">a violent confrontation between police and onlookers during an arrest of a black driver and his relatives</a>, noted Shawn Utsey, director of the African American Studies Department at Virginia Commonwealth University.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_8123" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:300px;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-8123 size-medium" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/watts-1-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/watts-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/watts-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/watts-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/watts-1-696x464.jpg 696w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/watts-1-1068x712.jpg 1068w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/watts-1-630x420.jpg 630w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/watts-1.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  An excerpt from a Houghton Mifflin Harcourt textbook describing the 1965 Watts riots (Mechelle Hankerson/The Mercury)</p></figure>
<p>&#8220;The Watts story leaves out the major precipitating event — police brutality during an arrest,&#8221; Utsey said in an email after reviewing the excerpt. &#8220;It makes it sound like violence just erupted out of thin air. I think the description is problematic in that it leaves out the context for the violence and fails to mention the violence that sparked the violent reaction.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Throughout Virginia’s approved history textbooks are mischaracterizations and missing information about major events in African American (and other groups&#8217;) history, state officials and educators say. The state’s Standards of Learning, which are supposed to be reflected in the books, make only passing references to African Americans, some scholars said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s become an issue for Gov. Ralph Northam, who says he is on his own journey to better understand racial history and how it still affects the state in the wake of his blackface scandal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Northam’s racial reconciliation efforts have included private meetings with black community leaders, cancelled speaking engagements at historically black colleges and universities and a list of legislative priorities he’s tried to support through his vetoes and approvals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At <a href="https://www.godanriver.com/news/local/governor-holds-roundtable-with-african-american-leaders-in-danville/article_05c38260-4b69-11e9-98f3-e3a3bb5d5d12.html" target="_blank">a community meeting in Danville</a>, Northam said that he’s noticed information students are being taught about African American history is “inadequate and often times inaccurate,” the Danville Register &amp; Bee reported.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s curriculum often skips over major events in black history and leaves out some information, said Ofirah Yheskel, the governor’s press secretary.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At an event hosted by the American Civil War Museum last month, Secretary of Education Atif Qarni agreed that Virginia’s history education guidelines are lacking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It really doesn’t give our children a sense that our nation has a complicated history,” Qarni said. “We don’t give a full contextual understanding.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That bears out in Virginia’s approved textbooks, which wasn’t Northam’s focus, but were at the center of a controversy in 2010 for including incorrect information <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2010/10/20/130693482/va-textbook-claims-blacks-fought-for-south-in-civil-war-source-the-internet" target="_blank">about slaves’ involvement in the Civil War.</a> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Part of a high-quality education is ensuring students and teachers can have meaningful conversations about race, equity and our history,” spokeswoman Alena Yarmosky said in an email. “The governor is considering a wide range of avenues to support these conversations in our classrooms.”</span></p>
<p>SOLs are revised once every seven years and the state hopes to be more thorough when making changes, Qarni said in an interview. He used to teach middle-school history and said there weren&#8217;t many opportunities in the classroom to examine experiences of minority groups and for students to connect historic and current events.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to make sure that when the next revision is occurring, it&#8217;s inclusive and makes sure all the varying perspectives are present,&#8221; he said.</p>
<h2><b>What’s missing?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two ways the state manages what students learn in the classroom are the <a href="http://www.doe.virginia.gov/testing/sol/standards_docs/" target="_blank">Standards of Learning</a>, Virginia&#8217;s expectations for what students should learn in different subject areas throughout their careers, and which textbooks are approved for use.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">William &amp; Mary history professor and parent Carol Sheriff <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/10/19/AR2010101907974.html?hpid=topnews" target="_blank">found a number of concerning passages</a> in her daughter’s fourth-grade history textbook in 2010, which prompted Virginia to create a new textbook adoption and revision process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sheriff took particular issue with a passage that claimed thousands of slaves fought alongside Gen. Thomas &#8220;Stonewall&#8221; Jackson in the Confederate army. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“To my knowledge, not a single piece of peer-reviewed scholarship contends that blacks served in such large numbers as soldiers (rather than laborers) in the Confederate army or that Stonewall Jackson commanded black soldiers (rather than black laborers),” <a href="http://muse.jhu.edu/article/477349" target="_blank">she wrote in a Civil War research journal.</a></span></p>
<p>The passage was in a book by Five Ponds, a Connecticut-based company. <span style="font-weight: 400;">The Board of Education temporarily removed Five Ponds’ books from its list of approved books in 2010. The books were corrected and new editions remain on the list of approved textbooks for use in kindergarten to fourth grade. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://pilotonline.com/news/local/education/article_630f49c8-0cf3-57c2-b7ab-b63e6a53e2bc.html" target="_blank">Out of the 2010 controversy</a> came new rules for textbook adoption: <span style="font-weight: 400;">Publishers are required to show proof they consulted a content expert while writing; the company is responsible for the price of fixing errors and providing corrected books and they must submit a corrective action plan to the state to prove they’ve addressed problems identified by reviewers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since those rules were put into place, only Five Ponds has been required to submit a <a href="http://www.doe.virginia.gov/instruction/textbooks/review_process/corrective_action_plans/five_ponds_press/cap_submission.pdf" target="_blank">corrective plan</a> to the state. Reviewers pointed out a range of issues in the books, like making it seem only the Lakota tribe lived in the American plains and glossing over the details of the Emancipation Proclamation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company responded to many of the issues raised by reviewers by saying it would be fixed in future editions or that the SOLs didn’t require such information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With a review process that apparently values correlation with the Standards of Learning curriculum above accuracy, the department indirectly influences not only what gets into textbooks but what does not,” Sheriff wrote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s difficult to know how much incomplete or inaccurate information is included in textbooks approved for use in the state. Virginia </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">allows people to submit concerns about inaccurate information in textbooks via email and allows public comment on the material during the process of adding titles to approved lists.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since 2015, when the state began updating social studies and history SOLs and adopting textbooks to match those, the Department of Education received 13 emails about textbooks and the adoption process, according to information received in response to a Freedom of Information Act request filed by The Mercury.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Four of those emails were feedback on textbooks; three of those focused on books the respondents liked. There were three requests to provide a list of approved textbooks; two emails seeking information for college research projects; two solicitations from publishers to adopt their books; a question about why some math textbooks were removed from the state-approved list and one asking if teachers can require students to purchase books.</span></p>
<h2><b>History of textbooks</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia doesn’t write its own textbooks. The state Board of Education last attempted that in the 1950s in the throes of the massive rmovement, <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/CWH-article-on-Textbooks.pdf" target="_blank">Sheriff found in her research</a><a href="http://muse.jhu.edu/article/477349" target="_blank">.</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 1950, the General Assembly created the Virginia History and Government Textbook Commission to write three history books for use in public schools. That group came out of an earlier legislative study commission from 1948 that formed at a time when former Democratic governor and U.S. Sen. Harry Byrd, an ardent segregationist, led state politics. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If the textbook commission couldn’t find a textbook that adequately detailed Virginia’s history, the group was tasked with creating one. Commission members, appointed by Gov. John S. Battle, worked with out-of-state publishers to create the book, but retained the right to request revisions, Sheriff found.<br />
</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Natalie Blanton, a member of the Textbook Commission, later candidly reminded her fellow members that the commission had been &#8216;appointed as a protest so to speak,&#8217; against &#8216;a left wing, new deal philosophy of life and government,&#8217;” Sheriff wrote.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was an exhausting process that caused friction between commission members, the authors and publishers. Commission members wanted the book to be factual, but also capture the “Virginia Spirit,” which was never explicitly defined, and downplay the role of race in the state’s history, especially when it came to the Civil War era.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Members of the commission frequently told the authors to emphasize that Virginia was within her rights when she seceded,” Sheriff wrote. “Most emphatically, the commissioners warned from the project’s outset that the authors &#8216;should not give the impression that slavery was the cause of the war.’”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Commission members also took special care to not offend African Americans, Sheriff wrote, “eager to avoid stirring up further controversy amid the crisis over desegregation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Both black and white children would use these same textbooks, after all, even if they used them in separate schools.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Commission members nixed words like “mammy” (“colored people” object to that word, one member said) and took issue with the phrase “the whites,&#8221; according to Sheriff&#8217;s research.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Civil War wasn&#8217;t the only area in which commissioners wanted to downplay race in the state’s history. One commission member wanted to avoid reminding black children of “their low-vaulted past,” and instead highlight positive black role models, especially those who were slaves and obeyed their masters, Sheriff wrote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The commission did prioritize accuracy in some instances. In one example, a commission member preferred to say slaves were imported, not immigrated. “They were property, bought and sold,” another clarified.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the books were done, they caused immediate backlash. The Virginian-Pilot in Norfolk published a three-part series about reactions to the books and quoted the author of the books saying it was a “method of indoctrination.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By 1972, under the direction of Republican Gov. Linwood Holton, father of current Board of Education member Anne Holton, the state began to decommission those books, though they stayed in some Virginia classrooms until the late 1970s.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since then, the Board of Education has distanced itself from textbook writing and has, in turn, adopted what Sheriff considers a “laissez-faire review process.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Textbooks are not the only resource available for teachers. School districts can locally approve additional books for use in the classroom, and teachers can pull in their own materials, said Meg Huebeck, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">director of instruction at the University of Virginia Center for Politics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But that requires time and expertise teachers may not have, Huebeck said. Her department at UVA helps teachers by providing some of those resources for free. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The textbook isn’t the end-all, be-all of education anymore,” Huebeck said. “If you’re going to have a textbook and you want to say you have to have them, then they better be accurate.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Huebeck reviewed the Five Ponds books in 2010, she noted things she said were “subconscious” choices by the publisher, like only showing photos of white children on pages describing what a good citizen is.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stephanie Arduini, education coordinator at the American Civil War Museum in Richmond, said history from perspectives other than white people is documented, but rarely told. It’s one of the reasons the<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/richmonds-new-civil-war-museum-aims-to-shatter-conventional-views-of-the-conflict/2019/04/26/f0b7e7ce-6785-11e9-a1b6-b29b90efa879_story.html?utm_term=.8d6938cbe13f" target="_blank"> recently reopened museum</a> focuses on educating visitors about the primary cause of the Civil War, which was slavery later disguised as states’ rights, she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We can’t deal with the current issues well until we deal with the history,” she said. “We can’t get right with ourselves if we can’t get the history right.”</span></p>

<p>The event is one way to accomplish Gov. Ralph Northam’s goal of expanding voting access, said Deputy Commissioner Jessica Bowman.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s important that every Virginian that&#8217;s eligible to vote can vote,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Bowman got the idea for the expo from the Virginia Beach registrar’s office, which held a similar event last summer during National Disability Voter Registration Week in July. Bowman said she wanted to hold the state event before the June primaries.</p>
<p>More than 200 people attended the expo in Henrico County, which featured modified machines from vendors who are approved to provide equipment for elections in the state. It included a machine that allows people to vote by sound as well as machines that limit how much mobility a voter needs to cast their vote.</p>
<p>Vendors allowed attendees to use the machines to cast mock ballots and receive &#8220;I voted&#8221; stickers. Groups that provide services to people disabilities came from as far as Hampton and Fredericksburg for the event.</p>
<p>In addition to the machines, the Department of Election provided information on how to register to vote, get an absentee ballot and become a poll worker during elections.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no way to know how many voters in the state might have a disability, since the state doesn&#8217;t collect that information when people register to vote, Bowman said.</p>

<p>But, Gov. Ralph Northam said on Monday, not enough people know that&#8217;s happening.</p>
<p>He introduced the <a href="http://www.virginiaisforlearners.virginia.gov/" target="_blank">&#8220;Virginia is for Learners&#8221; marketing campaign</a> this week, which will include a website and other outreach to keep students, teachers and businesses informed of state education policy changes. It will also provide strategies to implement those changes.</p>
<p>“Virginia has always led the way on thoughtful and modern innovations to connect students with the skills and knowledge they need to thrive after graduation,” said James Lane, Virginia superintendent of public instruction. “Virginia is for Learners is about recognizing our responsibility to adapt to a changing economy and make sure that every student has the knowledge, skills and experience to build a successful life after graduation.”</p>
<p>The campaign will focus on changes to allow for deeper learning in schools; new high school graduation requirements; the state&#8217;s changes to Standards of Learning testing; early childhood education efforts; new accreditation standards for schools and a section Northam&#8217;s office called, &#8220;maximizing the potential of all students,&#8221; in <a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/all-releases/2019/april/headline-840329-en.html" target="_blank">a press release</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Education is one of our most effective ways of making good on the promise of equal opportunity for all people no matter who they are or where they live,&#8221; Northam said during Monday&#8217;s press conference. &#8220;When we do it right, a quality education can empower and equip people to make a better life for themselves, their family and their community. Education is the most powerful tool we have to turn the tide against generational poverty, systemic racism and other ills that hold too many of our fellow Virginians back.&#8221;</p>
<p>Part of the initiative will be explaining why those changes are so important, Northam said.</p>
<p>&#8220;So many of our other goals as an administration and a commonwealth can only be achieved if we have a strong education system,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>“On behalf of the Virginia Board of Education, I am proud of the ongoing work that state, local and private partners have undertaken to better ensure our education system prepares students from every corner of our state for success in the modern workforce,” Board of Education President Daniel Gecker said in a press release.</p>
<p>“Virginia is for Learners is a strong platform to highlight the important revisions the Board made to the Standards of Accreditation that focus on continuous improvement for all students and the persistent equity work of the Board, the Department and our public schools across the Commonwealth.”</p>

<p>The Washington D.C.-based liberal-leaning think tank found that teachers in every state make less than their similarly-educated peers. Virginia was third from the bottom on the list, behind Washington and Arizona, where teachers make 31.6 and 32.6 percent, respectively, less than others.</p>
<p>&#8220;Providing teachers with a decent middle-class living commensurate with other professionals with similar education is not simply a matter of fairness,&#8221; the EPI report states. &#8220;Effective teachers are the most important school-based determinant of student educational performance. To promote children’s success in school, schools must retain credentialed teachers and ensure that teaching remains an attractive career option for college-bound students. Pay is an important component of retention and recruitment.&#8221;</p>
<p>The report acknowledges that states had to cut funding to public schools during the 2008 recession, but went on to say &#8220;the Great Recession can’t be blamed for the erosion in teacher pay.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The erosion of teacher weekly wages relative to weekly wages of other college graduates in the last couple of years — and in fact since 2008 — reflects state policy decisions rather than the result of revenue challenges brought on by the Great Recession,&#8221; the report stated.</p>
<p>It said Virginia, along with Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Kansas and Oklahoma, had, through tax cuts or other policy decisions since 2008, started collecting less tax revenue relative to their full capacity to generate revenue.</p>
<p>&#8220;Reduced spending for K–12 schools and the corresponding cutbacks in teacher salaries were conscious policy choices and were frequently done to accommodate tax cuts for corporations and the rich as well as an ideological commitment to smaller government,&#8221; the report states.</p>
<p>This year, lawmakers passed a budget that included money for <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/12/11/with-a-positive-economic-outlook-northam-proposes-teacher-pay-raise-more-money-for-school-construction/" target="_blank">teachers to get up to a 5 percent pay raise</a> over two years. Part of that raise had already been approved and it will require <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/01/16/some-school-districts-may-struggle-to-find-local-match-for-proposed-teacher-pay-raise/" target="_blank">localities to find matching local funding.</a></p>
<p>The change will still put Virginia&#8217;s average teacher pay well below the national average.</p>
<p>Del. Schuyler VanValkenburg, D-Henrico, is a teacher and <a href="https://twitter.com/VVforDelegate/status/1121385142843523072" target="_blank">tweeted</a> that that kind of pay discrepancy affects the overall quality of schools.</p>
<p>&#8220;Retaining/recruiting good teachers is impossible when there is this kind of disparity,&#8221; he tweeted.</p>
<p>The number of unfilled teaching positions in Virginia increased 40 percent from 2007 to 2017 and is a “crisis” specifically in high-poverty school divisions, according to a <a href="https://www.education.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/secretary-of-education/pdf/final-acts-report.pdf" target="_blank">2017 report from the Advisory Committee on Teacher Shortages.</a></p>

<p>March is typically a strong sales month, but a $768 million jackpot in the Mega Millions game likely helped in the ad-free month, said spokesperson John Hagerty. The Lottery has suspended TV and radio advertisement before in March, but this year was the first time it was for all 31 days.</p>
<p>March also had the highest scratcher sales in the Lottery&#8217;s history, said Deborah Courtney, director of finance for the Lottery.</p>
<p>The agency usually spends about $1.5 million a month on advertising, a &#8220;very fluid&#8221; figure since campaigns can cross months or years, Hagerty said.</p>
<p>Existing advertisements, like billboards, remained for the month. The Lottery didn&#8217;t purchase any new TV or radio spots.</p>
<p>More sales means more funding for K-12 <a href="https://www.valottery.com/en/playingmatters/givingback" target="_blank">public education</a>. At the end of March, the Lottery was posting higher-than-projected profits, which go to Virginia schools.</p>
<p>The Lottery had about $500 million in profits at the end of March, which is what is has left over after operating costs and paying out prizes. It puts this fiscal year on track to have the biggest profit the agency has seen in several years, Courtney told the Lottery Board Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Lottery most recently saw a dip in <a href="https://valottery.com/playingmatters/givingback" target="_blank">its sales</a> between 2016 and 2017, when it fell from $2 billion to $1.9 billion. Education proceeds in those years fell from $588 to $558 million.</p>
<p>In the 2018 fiscal year, the Lottery made $2.1 billion in sales. About half of that was used to pay out winners, $121 million to compensate retailers who carry Lottery games and $105 million for operating costs. The agency was able to put $606.2 million toward public education and gave $14.1 million to the Literary Fund.</p>
<p>From the $500 million the Lottery has already made this fiscal year (which started last summer), $435 million is allocated for <a href="https://valottery.com/playingmatters/givingback" target="_blank">the proceeds fund</a>, which distributes money directly to local school districts. The fiscal year ends in June, meaning that number could increase.</p>
<p>Out of the $500 million in current profits, Courtney said about $5 million in unclaimed prizes is earmarked for the <a href="https://valottery.com/playingmatters/givingback" target="_blank">Literary Fund</a>, which is used for school capital costs, including new buildings and technology.</p>
<p>May tends to be another popular month for lottery games, Courtney said. The agency could also get a bump from a mobile app it plans to launch that will allow customers to purchase and play games from their smartphones.</p>

<p>Del. Danica Roem, D-Manassas, reported $68,875 in small donations, the most of any General Assembly candidate. (VPAP&#8217;s analysis includes all candidates running in 2019 who had raised at least $5,000 through March 31.) That was about 25 percent of Roem&#8217;s total fundraising.</p>

<p>Most of the candidates collecting tens of thousands of dollars in small donations were Democrats, but some Republicans did the same: John Avoli, a Republican running in a primary for the 20th House District near Staunton, had $20,750 worth of small donations; Tim Hugo in Fairfax had $19,319 in small donations and Hanover&#8217;s Chris Peace had $16,999 worth of small donations.</p>
<p>Following Roem, Democrat Shelly Simonds (who lost to Del.

(Ryan M. Kelly/ For the Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite state budget language that remains in place and could cripple the program, the State Air Pollution Control Board approved a new carbon rule Friday that links Virginia to a network of carbon-trading states.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have full authority to move forward at this point,” said David Paylor, director of the Department of Environmental Quality. “The governor is considering all options.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Ralph Northam has until May 3 to veto budget language that <a href="https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/item/2019/1/HB1700/Enrolled/4/4-5.11/" target="_blank">prohibits the use</a> of state money to join the <a href="https://www.rggi.org/" target="_blank">Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative</a> or spend proceeds from RGGI <a href="https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/item/2019/1/HB1700/Enrolled/4/4-2.02/" target="_blank">without legislative approval.</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s unclear what Northam might do. His office did not provide details and only said he still has time to take action on legislation, including the budget.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think if the budget language stays, then it’s pens down,” Cindy Berndt, head of regulatory affairs for DEQ, told the board, which went into closed session over lunch to get legal advice. After some public comment, the board approved the amended </span>rule 5-2<span style="font-weight: 400;"> with language to make a swift comeback if the budget stops the immediate linking to RGGI.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Air board member Roy Hoagland said he thinks the carbon rule is a good first step in dealing with the effects of global warming, but he still thinks the state could have made it stronger.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think it’s far past time for Virginia to get serious about regulating carbon dioxide,” he said. “Climate change and sea level rise is going to smack us harder than we could ever imagine.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chairman Richard Langford and member William Ferguson voted against approving the rule. Neither of their concerns were related to the board’s authority to make the rule.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I”m not against the reductions,” Langford said. “But I just think we’re going to get them anyway. … Coal is going away whether we have RGGI or don’t have RGGI.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Linking to RGGI is the major crux of the carbon rule approved by the air board. The multi-state market-based program allows nine states to buy and sell carbon allowances to support renewable energy investments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under Virginia’s rule, power plants that run off fossil fuels and generate more than 25 megawatts of power are required to hold a carbon allowance for each ton of carbon dioxide to be released. Allowances are to be issued by the state based off electrical generation capacity. Then the plants consign those allowances to the RGGI auction to get revenue and use the RGGI market to purchase any additional allowances required.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That would allow Virginia, as a state, to cap emissions at 28 million tons in 2020. That’s the same amount that would happen outside of RGGI, according to Mike Dowd, director of the DEQ&#8217;s air division.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cap would decrease three percent each year until 2030, when carbon emissions would be just under 20 million tons, DEQ estimated. The number of allowances issued will also fall. That requires power plants to either cut emissions or purchase more allowances.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the General Assembly session, Republican Del. Charles Poindexter, R-Franklin, tried to</span><a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+sum+HB2611" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> limit the ability of administrative bodies in the state — like the air board — to join RGGI</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Northam vetoed that bill and another by Poindexter that would have prevented Virginia from joining the Transportation and Climate Initiative, another regional entity seeking to curb transportation emissions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These tools include the ability to adopt regulations, rules and guidance that mitigate the impacts of climate change by reducing carbon pollution in the commonwealth,” Northam said in a statement when he vetoed the RGGI bill. “In addition, allowing energy producers to comply with regulation through credit trading would lessen costs to producers and consumers while generating revenue that could be spent to make Virginia more resilient to extreme weather events, sea level rise and flooding.”</span></p>

(Virginia Department of Environmental Quality presentation, October 2018)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two items that remain in the budget, though, restrict the use of state funds for RGGI and spending any money that comes from the program without General Assembly approval.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DEQ staff couldn’t find a way to write the carbon rule around the budget language and instead included a provision that would allow the RGGI program to begin as soon as the language is lifted, should it be codified.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In the event the allocation of conditional allowances by the department as required … has not occurred by Jan. 1, 2020, the program will be considered to be operating and effective as of the calendar year following the date on which the department allocates the conditional allowances as it corresponds to the schedule of (the rule),” the provision states.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It allows immediate implementation of RGGI without a new board approval process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If the budget language goes into effect, we hope it would be removed in the next session and we would be able to integrate into the RGGI program immediately without going into a prolonged administrative, regulatory process,” Dowd said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The department probably wouldn’t allocate RGGI allowances until the state was able to join the network since they wouldn’t be able to enforce the limits, Dowd said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Poindexter attended the board meeting to encourage members to vote against the rule. He called the board&#8217;s decision a &#8220;political move&#8221; that circumvents the appropriate approval process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I do feel the aggravated parties across the board — from legislature to business to individuals — would have the right to sue if you take this action,” he told the board. Attorney General Mark Herring<a href="https://www.dailyprogress.com/herring-says-pollution-board-can-regulate-carbon-emissions/article_aa354593-6752-5876-824c-8062fabca03e.html" target="_blank"> has opined</a> that the board has the authority to adopt the rule. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Taking action, to me, at this point in time, is a little bit contrary to majority views of what the law says. I understand the passion, I understand the hard work that people put into this proposal and I understand where they’re coming from. It’s really not an argument about climate change, it is an argument about law and peoples’ representatives and how we do business in Virginia.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">RGGI participation would be a tax on businesses, which would cause the state to lose its business-friendly reputation, Poindexter said. And, he said, it’s hard to know the measurable results of joining a network like RGGI in the context of global warming.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I see nothing in the proposal that tells me how much the temperature is going to stay the same or go down,” he said.</span></p>
<p>Secretary of Natural Resources Matthew Strickler said in a press release that joining RGGI will protect public health, safety and the economy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today’s historic vote sets the Commonwealth on a path to slow global warming, and signals to clean energy businesses that Virginia is poised for a significant expansion of solar and wind power,&#8221; Strickler said in the release.</p>
<p>Environmental groups also applauded the rule, which makes Virginia the first state in the South to cap carbon.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today’s vote is historic and takes us in the right direction in the fight to address climate change, protect public health, and to accelerate our transition to a clean energy economy,&#8221; said Mike Town, executive director of the Virginia League of Conservation Voters.</p>
<p>Several other groups called the rule ambitious and historic and pressured Northam to quickly veto the budget lines that could stop Virginia&#8217;s membership.</p>
<p>“We now reiterate our calls on Gov. Northam to veto the harmful budget language passed by the House of Delegates that attempts to prevent this important rule from moving forward,&#8221; Town said. &#8220;Virginians elected Northam to do the right thing for clean air and climate action; he has that opportunity in front of him and we expect him to follow through.”</p>

<p>&#8220;President Trump must drastically reverse course in order to prevent another BP Deepwater Horizon-like disaster,&#8221; said Diane Hoskins, campaign director at Oceana, an international conservation group.</p>
<p>&#8220;We should not be expanding dirty and dangerous offshore drilling to new areas when there’s overwhelming bipartisan opposition. We should be strengthening safety, not further weakening the few safety measures currently in place. Coastal communities and our environment cannot afford another environmental catastrophe, which is where we are headed under President Trump’s proposals. It’s time for President Trump to stand with coastal communities, not the oil and gas industry.”</p>
<p>The report comes about <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/11/30/federal-permits-issued-for-atlantic-seismic-testing-including-along-virginia-coast/" target="_blank">four months after the federal government began issuing permits</a> for seismic testing off the coast of Virginia and other Atlantic states. <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/virginia-signs-on-to-lawsuit-challenging-seismic-testing-decision/" target="_blank">Virginia and several other states have since sued</a> to stop the testing, which is a precursor to offshore drilling.</p>
<p>Proponents say it could create a new economy and have often cited safeguards put in place by industry and the government in the wake of the disastrous explosion, which killed 11 workers. The subsequent spill went on for months as BP and federal officials were unable to cap the spewing well 5,000 feet below the surface of the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
<p>The Trump administration has moved to roll back some of the safety regulations put in place after the disaster, the worst spill in the history of marine oil drilling operations, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.</p>
<p>Mike Watson, a former member of the Virginia House of Delegates and Virginia chair of Explore Offshore, a coalition promoting offshore energy development, brushed aside concerns about changing restrictions <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/04/14/rookie-va-lawmaker-will-be-loud-in-fight-against-trumps-drilling-plans/" target="_blank">in a previous interview with a Mercury reporter.</a></p>
<p>Oceana&#8217;s report says the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, which monitors offshore drilling projects, relies too heavily on standards written by the industry; grants too many exemptions and is understaffed.</p>
<p>The report also stated there could be unreported or under-reported fatalities, injuries and spills in the offshore industry.</p>
<p>“Less safety and more drilling is a recipe for disaster,” Hoskins said in a statement.</p>
<p>Opponents of offshore drilling, who come from both political parties along Virginia&#8217;s coast, have said the practice threatens the tourism and military economy of Hampton Roads. Virginia Beach, the state&#8217;s largest city, brings in about $1.4 billion in tourism revenue every year. Norfolk Naval Station is the largest naval base in the world, and Virginia&#8217;s coast is home to thousands of fishermen who supply the state with seafood.</p>
