Solar power growth is expected to help some parts of the country meet electric demand this summer. (Robert Zullo/ States Newsroom)</p><p>With some parts of the country <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/texas-power-demand-break-may-record-heat-wave-friday-2024-05-23/" target="_blank">already</a> facing <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/science/environment/extreme-heat-hits-texas-florida-early-new-records-rcna153460" target="_blank">heat waves</a>, the organization in charge of setting reliability standards for the American electric grid is warning that a scorching summer could lead to a shortage of power generation in some regions.</p>
<p>The warning comes as the <a href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/monthly-report/global/202403#:~:text=The%20January%E2%80%93March%20global%20surface,rank%20in%20the%20top%20five." target="_blank">National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration </a>says there’s a 99% chance that 2024 will rank among the five warmest years on record and 55% chance it will be the hottest on record.</p>
<p>Overall, though, the analysis by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation painted a rosier picture than <a href="https://missouriindependent.com/2023/05/18/with-summer-coming-fast-regulator-issues-electric-reliability-warning/" target="_blank">last year’s report,</a> in part because of a surge in solar power development.</p>
<p>The nation has enough energy supply to handle normal peak demand, called “load” in the electric industry, largely because of 25 gigawatts of new solar power capacity — at full capacity that’s the rough equivalent maximum output of 25 large fossil or nuclear power plants. (The number of homes that can be powered from one gigawatt of solar<a href="https://www.seia.org/initiatives/whats-megawatt" target="_blank"> can vary widely </a>across the country). But the new panels have helped move some areas from what NERC calls “elevated risk” of power shortfalls in last year’s analysis  to “normal risk” this year.</p>
<p>“Resource additions are providing needed capacity to keep up with rising peak demand in most areas,” Mark Olson, the organization’s manager of reliability assessments, told the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Thursday. New power transfer agreements, growth in demand response programs, which incentivize customers to reduce power usage during times of grid stress, and delayed power plant retirements “are also contributing to an overall improved resource outlook for the upcoming summer,” <a href="https://www.nerc.com/pa/RAPA/ra/Reliability%20Assessments%20DL/NERC_SRA_2024.pdf" target="_blank">NERC says</a>.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">A solar surge</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>A separate FERC staff presentation said solar will make up 10% of overall national electric generation capacity by the end of this summer, with natural gas providing 42%, coal providing 14% and wind power at 13%.</p>
<p>Solar power is growing fast across the country, with the U.S. hitting five million total solar installations (most of them residential), per the <a href="https://www.seia.org/5M" target="_blank">Solar Energy Industries Association</a>. Reaching that milestone took 50 years, but the industry group projects that hitting 10 million solar installations will only take six years. Solar power for the first time accounted for more than half of new electric generation capacity added in 2023, the group noted. The U.S. Energy Information Administration<a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=61424#:~:text=We%20expect%20a%20record%20addition,installation%20in%20the%20United%20States." target="_blank"> expects “a record addition”</a> of new utility-scale solar power this year, with about 36.4 gigawatts projected to be installed. More than half of that new capacity is planned for Texas, California and Florida.The <a href="https://www.primergygemini.com/project-overview" target="_blank">Gemini facility </a>scheduled to begin operation this year near Las Vegas, with a planned solar capacity of nearly 700 megawatts and battery storage capacity of up to 380 megawatts, is expected to become the nation’s largest solar project. Battery storage is also growing rapidly, with more than 14 gigawatts expected to be added this year, according to the EIA. Batteries complement solar generation well, since solar’s peak production<a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/solar/solar-integration-solar-energy-and-storage-basics" target="_blank"> doesn’t generally line up with peak demand </a>on the grid, which happens later in the day. Batteries allow excess solar power to be banked for when it’s needed.</p>
<p>But a changing power mix also comes with new challenges and risks, NERC warned.</p>
<p>In his presentation to FERC, Olson said that while the overall summer electric reliability outlook has improved, some regions are seeing what he described as growing risks during extreme weather.</p>
<p>“Shortages could occur when demand is high and solar, wind or hydro output are low,” he said.</p>
<p>Those regions include parts of the Midwest and South in the grid area managed by the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, New England, Texas, much of the Southwest and California. Grid operators, though, are becoming<a href="https://minnesotareformer.com/2024/05/10/in-some-parts-of-the-u-s-the-grid-of-the-future-might-be-closer-than-you-think/" target="_blank"> increasingly adept </a>at planning and running electric grids with large amounts of intermittent resources.</p>
<p>“It’s refreshing to finally get the recognition that renewables can help with reliability,” said Simon Mahan, executive director of the Southern Renewable Energy Association.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Shifting seasons and climate change</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>While most of the country has historically been “summer-peaking,” meaning regions hit their highest demand for electricity during the summer months, some areas are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/05/business/energy-environment/winter-electric-grid-summer.html" target="_blank">increasingly</a> seeing<a href="https://www.tva.com/newsroom/press-releases/tva-system-breaks-records-during-bitter-cold#:~:text=Highest%20recorded%20peak%20in%20TVA,17." target="_blank"> demand spike in winter</a>, a trend that is expected to <a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/annual-peak-loads-are-shifting-to-winter-aceee-report-details-how-utilitie/598861/" target="_blank">continue</a> as result of heating electrification, other decarbonization policies and more extreme, protracted cold weather events. Indeed, the majority of recent electric grid failures have been during severe winter weather, such as <a href="https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2023/11/20/a-year-after-devastating-winter-storm-power-plant-problems-still-likely-in-extreme-weather/" target="_blank">Winter Storm Elliott in 2022</a>, which caused blackouts in several southern states and <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/series/winter-storm-power-outage/" target="_blank">Uri in 2021</a>, which caused a catastrophic collapse of the Texas electric grid that caused<a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/01/02/texas-winter-storm-final-death-toll-246/" target="_blank"> an estimated 246 deaths</a>.</p>
<p>But summer heat still poses risks, NERC says, contributing to both high demand and power plant outages, such as at natural gas power plants.</p>
<p>“Last summer brought record temperatures, extended heat waves and wildfires to large parts of North America,” the organization said. And though energy emergency alerts were few and no electricity supply interruptions happened as a result of insufficient power resources, grid operators “faced significant challenges and drew upon procedures and protocols to obtain all available resources, manage system demand and ensure that energy is delivered over the transmission network to meet the system demand.” Utilities and state and local officials in many areas also “used mechanisms and public appeals to lower customer demand during periods of strained supplies,” NERC added.</p>
<p>Christy Walsh, a senior attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council’s Sustainable FERC Project, said the reliability reports show how climate change is central to the pressures facing the electric grid.</p>
<p>“And it needs to be at the center of our solutions too,” she said in a statement to States Newsroom. “Earlier and more intense hurricanes brought on by increasing sea temperatures are a new and noteworthy concern, and this underscores the need for more large-scale transmission and connections between regions. Most of the new additions were wind, solar and storage, and last summer especially we saw just how crucial these resources can be during extreme heat events. We need to make sure we have a grid that can withstand the weather and move resources around during times of stress.”</p>

		<p class="newsroomBlockQuote ">This rule cannot come fast enough. There is an urgent need to act to ensure the reliability and the affordability of our grid.</p>

		<div class="newsroomBlockQuoteAuthorContainer">
		<p style="font-size:13px"><b>– FERC Chairman Willie Phillips</b></p>
	</div>
	</div>

	
<p>FERC Chairman Willie Phillips said an aging grid, increasing severe weather, demand growth from new manufacturing, data centers and increasing electrification as well as a changing generation mix all threaten reliability at a time when construction of the high voltage transmission lines that help get power to where it’s needed has slumped to a record low.</p>
<p>“This rule cannot come fast enough. There is an urgent need to act to ensure the reliability and the affordability of our grid,” Phillips said. “We simply will not be able to address these converging challenges and continue to supply the reliable, abundant and affordable power the American people depend on without taking a clear-eyed, long term, forward-looking approach to transmission planning.”</p>
<p>But Commissioner Mark Christie, a conservative former Virginia utility commissioner, vehemently dissented to the rule, calling it “a pretext to enact a sweeping policy agenda that Congress never passed” and one that will “facilitate a massive transfer of wealth from consumers to for-profit special interests.”</p>
<p>Christie has<a href="https://elibrary.ferc.gov/eLibrary/filelist?accession_number=20240325-4000&amp;optimized=false" target="_blank"> long opposed</a> transmission cost allocation schemes that he claimed would force customers in some states to pay for the pro-renewable policies of their neighbors. “I was perfectly prepared to vote for this final rule if it were a bipartisan compromise, if it preserved the state role that everyone sitting up here voted for two years ago,” he said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The genie and the bottle</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.ferc.gov/media/e1-rm21-17-000" target="_blank">The sprawling rule</a> requires transmission operators to conduct transmission planning at least every five years, looking out along a 20-year horizon using “best available data to develop well-informed projections” of needs, according to a staff presentation. To identify those transmission needs, providers need to consider state laws and regulations, utility planning documents, fuel cost trends, power plant retirements, requests from developers looking to connect to the grid as well as “policy goals and corporate commitments.” They also must consider “<a href="https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2023/08/28/federal-state-regulators-prod-utilities-to-consider-technology-for-grid-upgrade/" target="_blank">grid-enhancing technologies,”</a> a suite of potentially cost-saving tools common in other countries that have been slow to take root in the U.S., despite years of prodding from advocates, as well as identifying opportunities to upgrade existing lines their capabilities, called “right-sizing.”</p>
<p>Transmission providers, including utilities and the <a href="https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2022/10/10/amid-a-massive-american-clean-energy-shift-grid-operators-play-catch-up-2/" target="_blank">organizations</a> that manage the grid in much of the country, are also required to use a list of <a href="https://www.ferc.gov/news-events/news/staff-presentation-building-future-through-electric-regional-transmission-planning" target="_blank">seven economic and reliability benefits </a>as they evaluate and select long-term regional transmission projects as well as establish an evaluation process with transparent selection criteria that are not “unduly discriminatory or preferential, aim to ensure that more efficient or cost-effective long-term regional transmission facilities are selected and seek to maximize benefits accounting for costs over time without over-building transmission facilities.”</p>
<p>Christie criticized those “mandated inputs” and said states have no ability to consent to those criteria.</p>
<p>A major big problem FERC is trying to fix is that even as construction of large transmission projects has <a href="https://coloradonewsline.com/2023/12/13/building-transmission-takes-forever/" target="_blank">nearly ground to a halt</a>, utilities in many parts of the countries are on a<a href="https://missouriindependent.com/2022/11/22/as-utilities-spend-billions-on-transmission-support-builds-for-independent-monitoring/" target="_blank"> building spree</a> of smaller — potentially duplicative and inefficient — projects that are easier to get approved and paid for, increasing customer bills.</p>
<p>“The absence of this type of regional transmission planning is resulting in piecemeal transmission expansion that addresses relatively near-term transmission needs,” the staff presentation reads. “The status quo approach results in transmission providers investing in relatively inefficient or less cost-effective transmission infrastructure, with the costs ultimately recovered through commission-jurisdictional rates. This dynamic results in, among other things, transmission customers paying more than is necessary or appropriate to meet their transmission needs, and customers missing out on benefits that outweigh their costs, which results in less efficient or cost-effective transmission investments.”</p>

<p>For example, proponents of the new rule point to hundreds of millions of dollars in transmission costs that will result from the closure of a <a href="https://www.marylandmatters.org/2024/02/05/clean-power-advocates-eye-grid-operators-planning-reforms-warily/" target="_blank">Maryland power plant</a> in the region overseen by PJM Interconnection, the nation’s largest grid operator, as an example of poor planning.</p>
<p>“It is hard to imagine the region could not have found a more cost- effective solution had it begun planning for that retirement along with other anticipated shifts further ahead of time,” said Democratic Commissioner Allison Clements, who took Christie to task over his dissent. She said he was pushing the commission to take a “fraught voyage” to decide which public policies are appropriate for creating transmission demands.</p>
<p>“All transmission needs are inherently influenced by state policies of all stripes,” she said. “The truth is that enormous sums of money are going to be spent on transmission investment regardless of whether or not it’s done within the framework of this new rule.”</p>
<p>She argued that the new rule will protect customers from the pricey, fits-and-starts transmission buildout happening in much of the nation now.</p>
<p>“Not everything is about politics,” she said. “It is not the commission’s job to try and force the genie that is the energy transition back in the bottle. It is our legal responsibility to protect consumers in light of whatever is going on in the world around us.”</p>
<p>Neil Chatterjee, a Republican former FERC chairman,<a href="https://twitter.com/FERChatterjee/status/1790098089098846296" target="_blank"> posted on X</a> that he would have voted for the rule if he was still on the commission.</p>
<p>“Today’s @ferc rule was voted out 2-1 but that does NOT mean it’s a partisan rule making,” he wrote. “Had I authored this rule as chair would it have looked exactly like this? Of course not. But it would have been in the range. Regulatory rule making is hard.”</p>

Organizations ranging from the <a href="https://acore.org/news/ferc-issues-final-regional-transmission-planning-and-cost-allocation-rule/?utm_campaign=Transmission&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-80N5mXcpV3vEUHjl6hoXy_XI5_cpQtyB5KnDzeflisBgcwdITOHCNZu-bTR3TN_O_Jvu4IyBRmHHLGiPmkWvo3gLgxU-xmkc2NcbagauAb61KHJXs&amp;_hsmi=306843031&amp;utm_content=306843031&amp;utm_source=hs_email" target="_blank">American Council on Renewable Energy</a> and the National Audubon Society to the <a href="https://conservativeenergynetwork.org/news/?utm_campaign=Transmission&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_1rQQdYYOizrIqyuo34lCo8yahdTMlz3VuMIH5NP_6YTVEtM9rIg2Ky4yGAIXiFUNDB2tNQxLeGXqUbcQIK28Deq4qURS9X38uYyCQT02szl2DBvs&amp;_hsmi=306843031&amp;utm_content=306843031&amp;utm_source=hs_email" target="_blank">Conservative Energy Network</a> and <a href="https://www.cleanenergygrid.org/press-releases-2/?utm_campaign=Transmission&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8ZHl2nW-kunJudYZlbo-XX0mv2u6Ujp-iWqSVevd0nk2VJH6kKPMsLkm_BWzUQctxxNRl0YR2GaXzPHj6qmis0b5L0qUa9VmK0v8AoxtNgRjH4Rx0&amp;_hsmi=306843031&amp;utm_content=306843031&amp;utm_source=hs_email" target="_blank">Americans for a Clean Energy Grid</a> issued statements applauding the order.</p>
<p>Some renewable power organizations had privately wondered whether a drive for a unanimous vote might produce a more watered-down rule to get Christie onboard. That might have left states with big renewable power goals paying for all the transmission costs necessary to accommodate them, as <a href="https://newjerseymonitor.com/2022/10/04/for-offshore-wind-aspirations-to-become-reality-transmission-hurdles-must-be-cleared/" target="_blank">New Jersey is doing </a>for its planned offshore wind buildout, even though that power generation could mean cheaper, cleaner electricity for its neighbors, also, along with other benefits.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Energy has found a <a href="https://www.energy.gov/gdo/national-transmission-needs-study?utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-87QU8YqFv9xcAyOHZVS-sp3iCbsHKDR_5h_zLH4wKfm25SroYRAHMZELmQY8pTW0riWsIgDJFWPRhw9jZLfl7W_kYxfw&amp;_hsmi=306833321&amp;utm_content=306833321&amp;utm_source=hs_email" target="_blank">“pressing need” </a>for new transmission infrastructure across the country to alleviate congestion and improve reliability. Grid congestion costs electric customers billions of dollars a year, according to<a href="https://blog.advancedenergyunited.org/transmission_congestion_costs_2023?utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_bMFftSiURiKzKlPsJ7PMP5n6hsSynWWvEs4CnaAPdU1MPGokA7GX5W8boul-Hz25jcHDyBc9-wyA8Q86fFpCiwcQgig&amp;_hsmi=306833321&amp;utm_content=306833321&amp;utm_source=hs_email" target="_blank"> some reports</a>. And because of the more <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/FP_20200113_renewables_land_use_local_opposition_gross.pdf" target="_blank">diffuse </a>nature of renewable power, getting it from where it’s produced to where it’s needed, <a href="https://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/2021-11/Why-Does-Wind-Energy-Get-Wasted.pdf" target="_blank">as in the vast amount of wind power in the Great Plains</a>, can require large, multi-state transmission lines.</p>
<p>“Families and businesses are paying the price for utilities’ and grid operators’ failure to address our critical electricity infrastructure needs,” said Heather O’Neill, president and CEO at national clean power business association Advanced Energy United. “Building more multi-state transmission lines unclogs the traffic jams on America’s electricity superhighways and unlocks our ability to keep up with our growing energy needs.”</p>
<p>Justin Vickers, a senior attorney for the Sierra Club, said the rule appears to be firmly within FERC’s jurisdiction, despite Christie’s concerns to the contrary.</p>
<p>“I think the commission is on very strong footing here,” he said. “This is a way of maximizing the benefits of living in a big country. We can send power around the country. It increases reliability and it lowers price. That’s the benefit of having a big grid. .. Let’s take advantage of it.”</p>
<p>The Edison Electric Institute, which represents investor-owned utilities, said it was “disappointed” that FERC declined to include a “right of first refusal” policy for some transmission projects, which would have given their members first crack at some of the lines. The organization also said the rule lacked “regional flexibilities for evaluating project benefits.”</p>
<p>“A one-size-fits-all approach does not work, as different regions have different needs and different states have different policies,” said Phil Moeller, an executive vice president at the institute.</p>

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Thursday released a sweeping set of rules aimed at cutting air, water and land pollution from fossil fuel-fired power plants. (Robert Zullo/States Newsroom)</p><p>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Thursday released a sweeping set of rules aimed at cutting air, water and land pollution from fossil fuel-fired power plants.</p>
<p>Environmental and clean energy groups celebrated <a href="https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/biden-harris-administration-finalizes-suite-standards-reduce-pollution-fossil-fuel" target="_blank">the announcement</a> as long overdue, particularly for coal-burning power plants, which have saddled hundreds of communities across the country with dirty air and hundreds of millions of tons of toxic coal ash waste. The ash has <a href="https://e360.yale.edu/features/coal-ash-united-states-epa-rule" target="_blank">leached a host of toxins</a> — including arsenic, mercury, lead, cadmium, radium and other pollutants — into ground and surface water.</p>
<p>“Today is the culmination of years of advocacy for common-sense safeguards that will have a direct impact on communities long forced to suffer in the shadow of the dirtiest power plants in the country,” said Ben Jealous, executive director of the Sierra Club, one of the nation’s oldest and largest environmental organizations. “It is also a major step forward in our movement’s fight to decarbonize the electric sector and help avoid the worst impacts of climate change.”</p>
<p>But some electric industry and pro-coal organizations blasted the rules as a threat to jobs and electric reliability at a time when power demands are <a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/electricity-load-growing-twice-as-fast-as-expected-Grid-Strategies-report/702366/" target="_blank">surging</a>. They also criticized the rule’s reliance on largely unproven carbon capture technologies.</p>
<p>America’s Power, a trade organization for the nation’s fleet of about 400 coal power plants across 42 states, called the number of new rules “unprecedented,” singling out the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/stationary-sources-air-pollution/greenhouse-gas-standards-and-guidelines-fossil-fuel-fired-power" target="_blank">new emissions standards</a> that will force existing coal plants to cut their carbon emissions by 90% by the 2032 if they intend to keep running past 2039. Michelle Bloodworth, the group’s president and CEO, called the rule “an extreme and unlawful overreach that endangers America’s supply of dependable and affordable electricity.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘This forces that’</h4>

	
<p>Many experts expect the regulations to be litigated, particularly the carbon rule, since the last time the EPA tried to restrict carbon emissions from power plants, a group of states led by <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/20-1530_n758.pdf" target="_blank">West Virginia</a> mounted a successful legal challenge that went to the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>
<p>But Julie McNamara, deputy policy director with the Union of Concerned Scientists, said the agency took great pains to conform the rule to the legal constraints outlined by the court.</p>
<p>“This rule is specifically responsive to that Supreme Court decision,” she said. “Which doesn’t mean that it won’t go to the courts but this is so carefully hewn to that decision that it should be robust.”</p>

    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What&#8217;s happening in Virginia</h4>

	
<p>The Virginia Clean Economy Act, passed in 2020, requires the state’s electric grid to decarbonize by 2045 by transitioning to renewable energy sources and retiring fossil fuel generation sources.</p>
<p>Dominion Energy last year deactivated the last two coal units at its Chesterfield Power Station, once the largest fossil-fuel power plant in Virginia. It now wants to build a <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/03/15/democratic-legislators-oppose-dominions-proposed-chesterfield-natural-gas-plant/">1,000 megawatt natural gas power plant</a>, sited next to now-closed coal plant.</p>
</div>
	</div>
	
<p>The four rules EPA released Thursday mainly target coal-fired power plants.</p>
<p>“By developing these standards in a clear, transparent, inclusive manner, EPA is cutting pollution while ensuring that power companies can make smart investments and continue to deliver reliable electricity for all Americans,” EPA Administrator Michael S. Regan said.</p>
<p>In some ways, they attach a framework to a sea change in electric generation that is already well under way, McNamara said.</p>
<p>Coal accounted for jus<a href="https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=427&amp;t=3" target="_blank">t 16% of U.S. electric generation</a> in 2023, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. In 1990, by comparison, <a href="https://www.epa.gov/power-sector/power-sector-evolution#:~:text=of%20interactive%20chart-,Fleet%20Turnover,older%20plants%20chose%20to%20retire." target="_blank">it comprised</a> more than 54% of power generation. However, some states are more reliant on coal power than others.</p>
<p>In 2021, the most coal-dependent states were West Virginia, Missouri, Wyoming and Kentucky, <a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=54919" target="_blank">per a 2022 report by the EIA</a>.</p>
<p>“This rulemaking adds structure to that transition,” McNamara said. “For those who have chosen not to assess the future use of their coal plants, this forces that.”</p>
<p>Heather O’Neill, president and CEO of the clean energy trade group Advanced Energy United, said the new regulations are a chance for utilities to embrace cheaper, cleaner and more reliable options for the electric grid.</p>
<p>“Instead of looking to build new gas plants or prolong the life of old coal plants, utilities should be taking advantage of the cheaper, cleaner, and more trusty tools in the toolbox,” she said.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The carbon rule </h4>

	
<p>In 2009, the EPA concluded that greenhouse gas emissions “endanger our nation’s public health and welfare,” the agency wrote, adding that since that time, “the evidence of the harms posed by GHG emissions has only grown and Americans experience the destructive and worsening effects of climate change every day.”</p>
<p>The new <a href="https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2024-04/cps-111-fact-sheet-overview.pdf" target="_blank">carbon emissions regulation</a> will apply to existing coal plants and new natural gas plants. Coal plants that plan to operate beyond 2039 will have to capture 90% of their carbon emissions by 2032. New gas plants are split into three categories based on their <a href="https://www.eia.gov/tools/glossary/index.php?id=Capacity_factor" target="_blank">capacity factor</a>, a measure of how much electricity is generated over a period of time relative to the maximum amount it could have produced. The plants that run the most (more than 40% capacity factor) will have to capture 90% of their carbon emissions by 2032. Existing gas plants will be regulated under a forthcoming rule that “more comprehensively addresses GHG emissions from this portion of the fleet,” the agency said.</p>
<p>Michelle Solomon, a senior policy analyst for Energy Innovation, an energy and climate policy think tank, predicts that most coal plants will close rather than install the costly technology to capture carbon emissions.</p>
<p>“Climate goals aside, the public health impacts of the rules in securing the retirement of coal fired power plants is so important,” she said. Coal power in the U.S. has been increasingly pressured by cheaper gas and renewable generation and mounting environmental restrictions, but some grid operators have still been <a href="https://www.marylandmatters.org/2024/02/05/clean-power-advocates-eye-grid-operators-planning-reforms-warily/" target="_blank">caught flat-footed</a> by the pace of coal plant closures.</p>
<p>“I think the role of this rule, to provide that certainty about where we’re going, is so crucial to get the entities that have control over the rate of the transition to start to take action here,” she said. But the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association’s CEO, Jim Matheson, <a href="https://www.electric.coop/epa-unlawful-power-plant-rules-jeopardize-reliable-electricity" target="_blank">called</a> the rules “unlawful, unrealistic and unachievable” noting that it relies on technology “that is not ready for prime time.”</p>
<p>And Todd Snitchler, president and CEO of the Electric Power Supply Association, a trade group for competitive power suppliers, called the rule “a painful example of aspirational policy outpacing physical and operational realities” because of its reliance on unproven carbon capture and hydrogen blending technologies to cut emissions.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">A beefed up Mercury and Air Toxic Standards rule</h4>

	
<p>The EPA called the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/stationary-sources-air-pollution/mercury-and-air-toxics-standards" target="_blank">revision to the Mercury and Air Toxic Standards</a> “the most significant update since MATS was first issued in February 2012.” It predicted the rule would cut emissions of mercury and other air pollutants like nickel, arsenic, lead, soot, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and others. It cuts the mercury limit by 70% for power plants fired by lignite coal, which is the lowest grade of coal and <a href="https://blogs.edf.org/climate411/2024/04/12/we-need-to-close-a-mercury-pollution-loophole-for-lignite-coal-plants/#:~:text=Not%20only%20does%20burning%20lignite,even%20greater%20amounts%20of%20pollution." target="_blank">one of the dirtiest</a> to burn for power generation.</p>
<p>For all coal plants, the emissions limit for toxic metals is reduced by 67%. The EPA says the rule will result in major cuts in releases of mercury and other hazardous metals, fine particulate matter, nitrogen oxides and carbon dioxide.  The agency projects “$300 million in health benefits,” including reducing risks of heart attacks, cancer and developmental delays in children and $130 million in climate benefits.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Stronger wastewater discharge limits for power plants</h4>

	
<p>Coal fired power plants use huge volumes of water, and when the wastewater is returned to lakes, rivers and streams it can be laden with mercury, arsenic and other metals as well as bromide, chloride and other pollution and contaminate drinking water and harm aquatic life.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.epa.gov/eg/steam-electric-power-generating-effluent-guidelines-2024-final-rule" target="_blank">new rule</a> is projected to cut about 670 million pounds of pollutants discharged in wastewater from coal plants per year. Plants that will cease coal combustion over the next decade can abide by less stringent rules.</p>
<p>“Power plants for far too long have been able to get away with treating our waterways like an open sewer,” said Thomas Cmar, a senior attorney at Earthjustice, a nonprofit environmental law organization, during a briefing on the new rules earlier this week.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Closing a coal ash loophole </h4>

	
<p>Coal ash, what’s left after coal has been burned for power generation, is one the nation’s largest waste streams. The 2015 EPA <a href="https://www.epa.gov/coalash/coal-ash-rule#summary" target="_blank">Coal Combustion Residuals</a> rule were the first federal regulations for coal ash. But that rule left about half of the ash sitting at power plant sites and other locations — much of it in unlined disposal pits — unregulated because it did not apply to so-called “legacy impoundments” that were not being used to accept new ash.</p>
<p>“We’re going to see a long-awaited crackdown on coal ash pollution from America’s coal plants, and it’ll be a huge win for America’s health and water resources,” said Lisa Evans, a senior attorney with Earthjustice. “They are all likely leaking toxic chemicals like arsenic into groundwater and most contain levels of <a href="https://stateline.org/2024/01/01/environmental-groups-want-stronger-rules-for-use-of-coal-ash-fill-after-epa-reveals-new-risks/" target="_blank">radioactivity</a> that can be dangerous to human health.”</p>
<p>Groundwater monitoring data shows that the vast majority of ash ponds at coal plants are contaminating groundwater, said Abel Russ, a senior attorney with the Environmental Integrity Project. But under the old rule, Russ said, facilities could dodge cleanup requirements by blaming contamination on older ash dumps not covered by the regulation.</p>
<p>“This is a huge loophole,” Russ said. “You can’t restore groundwater quality if you’re only addressing half of the coal ash sources on site.”</p>
<p>However, several attorneys on the Earthjustice briefing said the new rules, which will require monitoring at clean up and hundreds of more ash sites, will only be as good as the enforcement.</p>
<p>“It’s meaningful only if these utilities obey the law. Unfortunately to date, many of them have not,” said Frank Holleman, a senior attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center.</p>

<p>The companies point to spiking electric demand, driven by data centers, new manufacturing facilities, increasing transportation electrification and other sources.</p>
<p>Georgia Power’s CEO said new businesses are creating a thirst for new power at <a href="https://www.georgiapower.com/company/news-center/2023-articles/georgia-power-2023-integrated-resource-plan-update-supports-georgia-extraordinary-economic-growth.html" target="_blank">“both a record scale and velocity</a>.” <a href="https://www.wral.com/story/rise-in-carolinas-electric-usage-8-times-higher-than-predicted-in-2022-duke-energy-says/21261828/" target="_blank">Duke</a> and <a href="https://www.tva.com/newsroom/press-releases/tva-plans-to-invest--15-billion-over-the-next-three-years-to-meet-region-s-growth" target="_blank">TVA</a> both cited “tremendous” economic and population growth in their service areas.</p>

<p>”What we really want is for policymakers to ask good questions,” said Eric Gimon, a senior fellow at Energy Innovation, and one of the authors of the brief for utility regulators, in an interview with States Newsroom.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘Less risky alternatives’</h4>

<p>After about 15 years of stagnation, U.S. electric demand is growing. <a href="https://gridstrategiesllc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/National-Load-Growth-Report-2023.pdf" target="_blank">A December report</a> by an electric sector consulting firm noted that the utilities and regional transmission organizations that run the North American electric grid had almost doubled growth projections. At the same time, transmission line construction <a href="https://kleinmanenergy.upenn.edu/podcast/americas-electric-power-transmission-crisis/" target="_blank">has nearly ground to a halt</a> and there’s limited ability to move power between regions as the generation mix increasingly shifts to renewables and batteries in many parts of the country.</p>
<p>That’s been coupled with a growing dependence on natural gas power plants, which have <a href="https://www.iea.org/commentaries/natural-gas-is-now-stronger-than-ever-in-the-united-states-power-sector" target="_blank">taken the role</a> coal used to play in the nation’s power mix but which have also <a href="https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2023/11/20/a-year-after-devastating-winter-storm-power-plant-problems-still-likely-in-extreme-weather/" target="_blank">failed in large numbers</a> during recent severe weather.</p>
<p>Gimon said gas plants are often treated as a magic bullet solution to resource adequacy — an electric industry term for having enough power to meet peak demand. If the vision of the utilities pushing for lots of new gas power comes to pass, one of two things will happen, Gimon contends.</p>
<p>“Either they don’t get used very much,” he said, and thus become a <a href="https://pubs.naruc.org/pub/D41DAF2A-9425-50CD-C1E2-70B694AAC1A4#:~:text=The%20U%20.,end%20of%20its%20useful%20life%20." target="_blank">stranded asset</a> customers are stuck paying for anyway. “Or they get used a lot and they’re busting through their climate goals and <a href="https://kansasreflector.com/2023/05/14/epa-again-proposes-power-plant-carbon-rules/#:~:text=By%3A%20Robert%20Zullo%20%2D%20May%2014%2C%202023%2011%3A11%20am&amp;text=EPA%20says%20its%20new%20rule,of%20137%20million%20passenger%20vehicles." target="_blank">EPA regulations</a>.” In a <a href="https://www.nrdc.org/bio/jackson-morris/southeast-crossroads-bad-gas-bet-or-clean-energy-boon" target="_blank">post Thursday,</a> two Natural Resources Defense Council staffers warned that the huge planned Southeastern gas buildout will jeopardize emission reduction targets and hike electric costs, “leaving customers on the hook for potentially expensive, dirty and ultimately stranded assets that may or may not be usable for their typical, carbon-intensive lifespans.”</p>
<p>Gimon and one of his co-authors, Mike O’Boyle, Energy Innovation’s senior director for electricity, also pointed out that gas plants can’t always be counted on when they’re needed most. In the region run by PJM, the nation’s largest grid operator, gas plants accounted for <a href="https://www.pjm.com/-/media/library/reports-notices/special-reports/2023/20230717-winter-storm-elliott-event-analysis-and-recommendation-report.ashx" target="_blank">70%</a> of the power plant outages it suffered during <a href="https://www.ferc.gov/news-events/news/ferc-nerc-release-final-report-lessons-winter-storm-elliott" target="_blank">Winter Storm Elliott</a> in December 2022.</p>
<p>“We’re not talking about a capacity resource that is dependable for 100% of its nameplate capacity during a winter peak either,” O’Boyle said. “I think regulators’ jobs are to help ensure that utility investments are prudent and part of that means have they considered more affordable alternatives and less risky alternatives.”</p>
<p>Sarah Durdaller, a spokesperson for the Edison Electric Institute, which represents investor-owned utilities like Dominion Energy, Southern Company and Duke Energy, said its member companies “are committed to delivering reliable, affordable and resilient clean energy to their customers.”</p>
<p>Durdaller said carbon emissions from the power sector are at their lowest point in almost 50 years, despite electricity generation doubling in that time frame. Natural gas power, she said, “is an essential partner for deploying renewables and maintaining grid reliability.”</p>
<p>As far as the thousands of megawatts of gas plants companies are proposing, she said that utility plans “always evolve as new technologies emerge, as costs decline, as demand forecasts change and as new policies are fully implemented.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘Better solutions’</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>One aspect for policymakers to consider is the reliability of the demand projections themselves.</p>
<p>“Utilities consistently over forecast,” said Gudrun Thompson, a senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center, which has been tracking southeastern utilities’ gas plant proposals. “I would not be surprised if that is happening now.”</p>
<p>Transparency is also a concern, she added, noting that a single data center project could be in negotiations with multiple utilities and get counted by all of them in their load projections.</p>
<p>In 2007, the U.S. Energy Information Administration predicted 1.5% annual growth in electric demand, which would have been a 21% increase over 15 years. It never materialized, mostly because of energy efficiency programs, federal and local building codes and appliance standards and voluntary industry efforts, the Energy Innovation report says.</p>
<p>“Efficiency was a primary cause of flat demand after 2008 and could be a major factor in</p>
<p>mitigating the pressure that new demand growth puts on the electrical grid,” the report notes.</p>
<p>Coming electric load increases aren’t illusory but the report’s authors argue that “better near-term and long-term solutions exist and should be deployed first.”</p>
<p>For example, Gimon said, battery storage is growing by leaps and bounds in <a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/energy-storage/texas-will-add-more-grid-batteries-than-any-other-state-in-2024" target="_blank">Texas</a> and <a href="https://www.energy.ca.gov/news/2023-10/california-sees-unprecedented-growth-energy-storage-key-component-states-clean" target="_blank">California</a>, and it’s already playing a <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2023/09/12/texas-power-grid-batteries/" target="_blank">growing role</a> in helping to meet peak demand. However, in their planning some Southeastern utilities are treating battery storage “like it’s some new technology from Mars,” Gimon said.</p>
<p>The Energy Innovation report’s other recommendations include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Taking advantage of existing locations with power infrastructure onsite to build renewable power and battery storage, skipping the <a href="https://missouriindependent.com/2024/03/19/new-scorecard-rates-nations-grid-managers-on-connecting-renewables/" target="_blank">long wait times</a> to connect to the grid plaguing many new power projects across the country. The Rocky Mountain Institute, a green energy nonprofit, calls it “<a href="https://rmi.org/how-utility-regulators-can-unlock-12-7-billion-in-annual-savings-for-customers/#:~:text=We%20call%20this%20project%20development,without%20requiring%20any%20transmission%20upgrades." target="_blank">clean repowering”</a> and says there’s 250 gigawatts (the rough equivalent of 250 large power plants) of new renewable potential at former fossil sites <a href="https://rmi.org/insight/clean-repowering/" target="_blank">scattered across the country</a> that could be harnessed to create billions in savings and cleaner power generation.</li>
<li>Look to meet large customer demands with onsite power, such as solar panels, and take better advantage of demand response programs, which enroll large customers who voluntarily agree to reduce power consumption in exchange for savings. Many of those customers include <a href="https://georgiarecorder.com/2023/05/07/in-the-southeast-where-big-utilities-rule-calls-for-a-real-power-market-persist/" target="_blank">large corporations that have their own carbon reduction targets</a>. Shaving that large customer demand could avoid some or all new peak gas capacity, the report says. “The utilities’ responses to load growth are coming into conflict with the explicit goals of their own customers who are driving that load growth,” O’Boyle said.</li>
<li>Improve how the existing electric system is used by implementing <a href="https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2023/08/28/federal-state-regulators-prod-utilities-to-consider-technology-for-grid-upgrade/" target="_blank">grid-enhancing technologies</a> like dynamic line ratings, power flow controllers and other systems. They’re common in other countries but have been slow to take root in many parts of the U.S. where utilities make the most money by building the most expensive solution they can get approved, not necessarily the one that’s most cost-effective for customers. “The fact is any data center is hooking into a system,” Gimon said. “That system is remarkably underutilized.”</li>
<li>Improve regional connections, particularly in the Southeast, which is <a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/ferc-western-resource-adequacy-wrap-power-pool-capacity/642592/" target="_blank">fast becoming</a> one of the few remaining parts of the country without any real regional wholesale electric market. In 2022, Southeastern utilities created the Southeast Energy Exchange Market, but it’s been criticized as a market in name only, since the volume of actual trades has failed to amount to much. “Research from Energy Innovation and Vibrant Clean Energy found that sharing capacity between non-RTO states in the Southeast would yield more than $10 billion in cost savings annually, revealing a region replete with spare capacity if utilities can figure out how to share it,” the report says.</li>
</ul>
<p>It will fall to state utility regulators and policymakers to gauge how desperately their residents actually need all the new gas power being proposed and whether there are cheaper ways to meet climbing demand.</p>
<p>Adding more rooftop solar, energy efficiency programs and residential batteries, known as distributed resources, which can be aggregated into what’s known as a <a href="https://michiganadvance.com/2024/04/11/valuable-and-largely-overlooked-interest-in-virtual-power-plants-grows/" target="_blank">virtual power plant</a>, might mean lower electric sales, the report noted.</p>
<p>“In some states, the electric utility is also the gas utility and can benefit from rate-basing new gas infrastructure. These circumstances create incentives that can skew utility decisions toward well-worn solutions like gas plants and typically disincentivize regional coordination,” the report says. “Ultimately, policymakers need to demand more from their utilities and be skeptical of the ‘usual suspect’ solutions.”</p>
<p>Thompson, the SELC attorney, called the amount of new gas southern utilities are proposing “staggering.” The organization estimates that if all the new gas plants proposed get built, it will eclipse the amount of coal generation southern utilities plan to retire over the next 15 years by roughly 8 gigawatts. Regulators, she said, need to “look very hard at the load growth projections and take a hard look at choices that the utilities are making,” including pending EPA carbon regulations that could require expensive carbon capture technology or co-firing with hydrogen and whether the plants will require new pipeline infrastructure. “If all of these plants get approved and built we’re just not going to achieve the carbon reductions that we need to be on a path to averting the worst effects of climate change.”</p>

(Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)</p><p>Just about every week, Shawn Grant, who works for Salt Lake City-based Rocky Mountain Power, gets an inquiry from another utility looking for information about the company’s Wattsmart battery program.</p>
<p>“We want to do something. … How did you guys do it?’” Grant, the company’s customer innovation manager, says he’s often asked. “We’re always fielding those questions.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rockymountainpower.net/content/dam/pcorp/documents/en/rockymountainpower/savings-energy-choices/wattsmart-batteries/RMP_BatteryStorageProgram_customer_FINAL.pdf" target="_blank">The program</a> pays customers with solar who opt to install battery storage systems for the ability to use that stored electricity to help balance flows on the electric grid.</p>
<p>For customers, the benefits come in the form of lower electric bills and backup power in case of an outage. For Rocky Mountain Power, which has 1.2 million customers in Utah, Wyoming and Idaho, the program allows the company to harness the collective power stored in those distributed batteries to shave electric demand when it spikes rather than calling for more generation from a traditional power plant, among other uses.</p>
<p>“We’re using every battery every day to reduce demand on the grid,” Grant said.</p>
<p>The concept is known as a <a href="https://www.energy.gov/lpo/virtual-power-plants" target="_blank">virtual power plant</a>, and grid operators, utilities, state regulators and lawmakers across the country are increasingly exploring the possibilities. They are seen as a cost-effective way to aid an electric grid that in many parts of the country is increasingly embattled by power plant retirements as well as difficulties building new, cleaner generation and the transmission lines they need — all at a time when huge projected electric demand increases loom.</p>
<p>“We’re now in this load-growth era,” said Robin Dutta, acting executive director at the Chesapeake Solar and Storage Association, a solar and storage industry group focused on Maryland, Virginia and Washington, D.C. “When you’re mitigating peak demand growth at the source, that’s perhaps the most cost effective way to modernize the grid.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘Faster, better, cheaper’</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Nearly 800,000 American homes installed a new solar or solar and energy storage system in 2023, according to the <a href="https://www.seia.org/blog/leading-charge-top-5-solar-states-2023" target="_blank">Solar Energy Industry Association</a>. That growth set a record, with about 6.8 gigawatts installed, a <a href="https://www.seia.org/us-solar-market-insight" target="_blank">12% increase</a> from 2022. Electric vehicles, another potential grid resource as a store of energy, also <a href="https://www.coxautoinc.com/market-insights/q4-2023-ev-sales/" target="_blank">broke a sales record</a> last year, despite<a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/02/07/1227707306/ev-electric-vehicles-sales-2024" target="_blank"> consumer uptake being slower </a>than some expected.</p>
<p>“These are devices that people are buying anyway because they’re faster, better, cheaper and virtual power plants allows everybody to leverage these devices while putting some money back in the pockets of people that bought the thing in the first place,”said Brian Turner, a director at Advanced Energy United, a clean energy trade group</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Energy found in a <a href="https://liftoff.energy.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/20230911-Pathways-to-Commercial-Liftoff-Virtual-Power-Plants_update.pdf" target="_blank">report</a> last year that large-scale deployment of virtual power plants “could help address demand increases and rising peaks at lower cost than conventional resources, reducing the energy costs for Americans — one in six of whom are already behind on electricity bills.”</p>
<p>They’re not a new concept, the DOE noted, adding that most existing virtual power plants are so-called demand response programs. In Virginia, for example, the commonwealth for years <a href="https://www.energy.virginia.gov/energy-efficiency/demand-response.shtml" target="_blank">has run a program</a> that enrolls hundreds of public facilities (airports, universities, K-12 schools, municipal buildings, water treatment plants and others) that agree to reduce or shift their electric demand to relieve strain on the grid. The DOE report says deploying 80 to 160 gigawatts of virtual power plants by 2030 could save about $10 billion in annual grid costs and would “direct grid spending back to electricity consumers.” At that scale, virtual power plants could meet between 10 and 20% of peak electric demand. The Rocky Mountain Institute, a research nonprofit focused on sustainability, called virtual power plants “a valuable and largely overlooked resource for advancing key grid objectives,” including reliability, affordability, decarbonization and electrification, among others.</p>
<p>However, many states are starting to take notice of the potential:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maryland’s legislature just passed a <a href="https://mgaleg.maryland.gov/2024RS/fnotes/bil_0006/hb1256.pdf" target="_blank">bill</a> that, among other provisions, requires utilities to create a pilot program to compensate owners of distributed energy resources like solar and battery storage for services they provide to the grid. “Ratepayers and consumers who invest in clean energy systems should see financial benefits when they provide meaningful grid services,” said Del. David Fraser-Hidalgo, a Democrat from Montgomery County who carried the House version of the bill. “Our DRIVE Act does just that; pairing battery storage with renewable generation will help Maryland achieve its clean energy goals, reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and mitigate the negative impacts of climate change.”</li>
<li>Michigan, afflicted by <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DTj_bhle3FZ2maaGbrGi16_0Mf4cg1fL/view" target="_blank">expensive electric prices</a> and <a href="https://www.citizensutilityboard.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Electric-Utility-Performance-Report-Second-Edition-final.pdf" target="_blank">high outage</a> rates, has pending legislation, <a href="https://michiganadvance.com/2023/08/25/michigan-dems-rally-around-bills-aimed-at-increasing-access-to-solar-energy/" target="_blank">part of a package</a> of pro-solar bills, that would create a virtual power plant program.</li>
<li>In North Carolina, the state’s Utilities Commission has approved a Duke Energy pilot, called the<a href="https://www.duke-energy.com/Home/Products/PowerPair" target="_blank"> </a><a href="https://news.duke-energy.com/releases/duke-energy-to-implement-new-powerpair-pilot-program-for-pairing-home-solar-installations-with-battery-energy-storage" target="_blank">PowerPair program</a>, that it had directed the company to propose that will give customers incentives to install solar and storage. One group of customers will turn over control of the batteries to the utility and the other will participate in a test of <a href="https://news.duke-energy.com/releases/duke-energy-carolinas-receives-approval-for-new-rates-in-north-carolina-implements-new-programs-to-help-customers" target="_blank">“time-of-use rates</a>,” which aim to shift customers’ usage to periods of lower demand, like running a dishwasher overnight, <a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/duke-energy-virtual-power-plant-vpp-PowerPair-selc-battery-solar/705812/" target="_blank">Utility Dive reported</a>.</li>
<li>In the summer of 2022, the New England Independent System Operator, which manages the electric grid for Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Connecticut, became the first such organization to use a virtual power plant, <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/northeast-embraces-first-of-a-kind-virtual-power-plant/" target="_blank">Politico’s E&amp;E News reported</a>. Sunrun, one of the nation’s largest solar installers, said it linked an estimated 5,000 small solar and battery systems to share 1.8 gigawatt hours of energy. In the summer of 2022, during a heat wave that sent temperatures soaring across New England states, residential and other non-utility solar installations reduced demand on the system by about 4,000 megawatts.</li>
<li>The Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission announced in February that it was seeking comment on proposed rules related to use of distributed energy resources and virtual power plants. “Distributed resources provide the possibility for those who were traditionally consumers to play an active role in ensuring electric reliability and resiliency for themselves and their neighbors, and often in a less expensive way than traditional large generation that requires delivery infrastructure,” the commission’s chair and vice chair <a href="https://www.puc.pa.gov/press-release/2024/puc-seeks-comment-on-proposed-rulemaking-related-to-use-of-distributed-energy-resources-and-virtual-power-plants-02222024" target="_blank">said in a joint statement</a>.</li>
<li>Arizona Public Service, the largest electric utility in the state, counts 75,000 smart residential thermostats in its <a href="https://www.aps.com/en/About/Our-Company/Clean-Energy" target="_blank">Cool Reward program</a>, which provided nearly 110 megawatts of capacity during the summer of 2022.</li>
<li>A Colorado utility regulator <a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/colorado-xcel-50-MW-virtual-power-plant-vpp-prosumer-tariff/706721/" target="_blank">is pushing </a>for Xcel Energy to get a 50 megawatt virtual power plant up and running by the end of 2024, Utility Dive reported. The company, the state’s largest utility, already has a program called <a href="https://www.xcelenergy.com/staticfiles/xe-responsive/Environment/Renewable%20Energy/23-04-510_CO-RenewableBattery_is_P02.pdf" target="_blank">Renewable Battery Connect </a>that allows it to discharge participating customers’ batteries during peak periods in exchange for financial incentives.</li>
<li>In November, Puget Sound Energy, Washington’s largest utility, and AutoGrid, a California software company that provides distributed energy management systems, <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/autogrid-and-puget-sound-energy-combat-climate-change-with-virtual-power-plants-301985139.html" target="_blank">announced </a>that they were expanding their partnership to develop a virtual power plant. “PSE’s VPP will reduce costs and help maintain reliable energy supply to its more than 1 million residential and business customers. Additionally, the VPP solution allows participating customers to receive monetary incentives for sharing assets with the grid and/or curtailing usage, something that’s financially beneficial for the community as well as helping the utility efficiently manage increasing electricity demand,” the companies said in a news release.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Why it matters</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Experts who study and run the nation’s electric grid are worried about the pace of the energy transition. Old coal and gas plant retirements <a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/pjm-coal-gas-power-plant-risk-retirement-market-monitor/710518/#:~:text=Power%20plant%20owners%20have%20said,2026%2C%20according%20to%20Monitoring%20Analytics" target="_blank">are accelerating</a>, driven by economics, state clean energy policies and utilities’ own decarbonization goals. At the same time, massive backlogs in the <a href="https://missouriindependent.com/2024/03/19/new-scorecard-rates-nations-grid-managers-on-connecting-renewables/" target="_blank">queues to connect </a>new power resources — overwhelmingly wind, solar and battery projects — in the regional transmission organizations that run the grid in much of the country mean big delays in replacing that retiring power generation. And after roughly <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/us-electricity-demand-flat-since-2007" target="_blank">a decade of flat electric demand</a>, load growth is projected by many experts to <a href="https://gridstrategiesllc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/National-Load-Growth-Report-2023.pdf" target="_blank">explode</a> as a result of transportation, industrial and home heating electrification, as well as a surge in data center development, among other factors. Throw in the fact that the construction of new transmission lines, essential to get excess power to where it might be urgently needed, has also stagnated and a problematic picture emerges.</p>
<p>“Most utilities in the country are planning on pretty significant load growth,” said Turner from Advanced Energy United. ”They could plan to build a new peaker plant or they could plan to ‘build’ VPPs.”</p>
<p>That’s where utility incentives come into play.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, Turner said, utilities that operate transmission and distribution systems are more friendly to the idea. Companies that also own their own generation,  – and make a sizable chunk of their income from guaranteed profits on building new plants – , might not like the idea of a program that erodes the business case for a pricey new facility.</p>
<p>“That’s why we have utility commissions,” Turner said. “They exist to say to the utility that virtual power plants are a cheaper option for the ratepayer and therefore you should implement it.”</p>
<p>However, even companies that might have resisted the idea are facing such dire electric-demand growth scenarios that virtual power plants may be attractive ways to get more flexibility out of the grid more quickly than building new generation.</p>
<p>“This is a way to get the capacity online faster and oftentimes cheaper,” Turner said. “Meeting that load growth is a real challenge in a lot of places.”</p>

(Robert Zullo/States Newsroom)</p><p>After a string of scandals and amid rising bills, lawmakers in statehouses across the country have been pushing legislation to curb utilities spending ratepayer money on lobbying, expert testimony in rate cases, goodwill advertising, charitable giving, trade association membership and other costs.</p>
<p>At least a dozen states have considered bills to limit how gas, water and electric utilities can spend customers’ money, according to a <a href="https://energyandpolicy.org/tracking-states-getting-politics-out-of-utility-bills/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tracker maintained by the Energy and Policy Institute</a>, a watchdog group funded by environmental and climate-focused foundations that concentrates on utilities and fossil fuel interests.</p>
<p>Another, Louisiana, has <a href="https://lpscpubvalence.lpsc.louisiana.gov/portal/PSC/DocumentDetails?documentId=165819" target="_blank" rel="noopener">opened a proceeding </a>at its public service commission to investigate use of ratepayer cash on trade association dues, “activities meant to influence the outcome of any local, state, or federal legislation,” advertising expenses and other costs.</p>
<p>Michigan <a href="https://michiganadvance.com/2024/02/23/lawmakers-band-together-with-newly-formed-coalition-to-ban-political-contributions-from-utilities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">joined the party</a> last week with the introduction of legislation to ban utility political spending. In states like Illinois, the push has been joined by groups like the <a href="https://www.citizensutilityboard.org/blog/2024/02/15/joint-release-aarp-il-cub-call-for-legislation-to-prohibit-utilities-from-charging-customers-millions-for-self-serving-pr-campaigns-rate-hike-legal-fees/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AARP and the Citizens Utility Board</a>, a state watchdog group, which said the legislation would “stop electric, gas and water utilities from charging us for a long list of expenses they rack up trying to raise our rates and further increase their political power.”</p>
<p>Three states  – <a href="https://www.mainelegislature.org/LawMakerWeb/summary.asp?ID=280085561" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maine</a>, <a href="https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/sb23-291#:~:text=Section%201%20of%20the%20act,long%2Dterm%20rate%20of%20inflation." target="_blank" rel="noopener">Colorado</a> and <a href="https://www.cga.ct.gov/asp/CGABillStatus/cgabillstatus.asp?selBillType=Bill&amp;bill_num=SB7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Connecticut</a> – have already signed similar bills into law. The legislation comes as natural gas bills <a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=60722" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have fallen</a> but average residential electric prices in the U.S. <a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/steo/data/browser/#/?v=21&amp;f=A&amp;s=&amp;start=2019&amp;end=2023&amp;id=&amp;maptype=0&amp;ctype=linechart&amp;linechart=ESRCU_NEC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">climbed</a> from 13.66 cents per kilowatt hour in 2021 to 15.93 cents per kilowatt hour in 2023, per the U.S. Energy Information Administration. That would mean a monthly bill going from $136.60 in 2021 to $159.30 in 2023 for a house that uses 1,000 kilowatt hours per month.</p>
<p>“It absolutely is a growing trend,” said Matt Kasper, the Energy and Policy Institute’s deputy director. “There’s a lot of eyes on the industry, how it’s operating.”</p>
<p>The institute published <a href="https://energyandpolicy.org/utility-political-machines/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a report</a> last year that scrutinized how electric and gas utilities use ratepayer money to “fund political machines that push legislation, curry favor with regulators and alter the outcomes of elections, sometimes even breaking laws in the process.”</p>
<p>Some of the lowlights include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2024/02/12/ex-first-energy-executives-ohio-utility-regulator-charged-by-state-in-bailout-and-bribery-scandal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A massive bribery scandal </a>in Ohio involving FirstEnergy, a utility holding company that  paid nearly $61 million in bribes to the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdoh/pr/former-ohio-house-speaker-sentenced-20-years-prison-leading-racketeering-conspiracy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ohio house speaker’s political organization</a> in exchange for a nuclear plant bailout worth $1 billion to the company. A U.S. attorney called it “one of the largest public corruption conspiracies in Ohio history.”</li>
<li>In Illinois, the state’s largest electric utility, Commonwealth Edison, or ComEd, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndil/pr/former-commonwealth-edison-executives-and-associates-found-guilty-conspiring-influence" target="_blank" rel="noopener">showered the state House speaker’s allies</a> with <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndil/pr/commonwealth-edison-agrees-pay-200-million-resolve-federal-criminal-investigation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jobs, contracts and payments</a> to grease the wheels for the company’s legislation. Three ex-lobbyists and a former CEO of the company <a href="https://capitolnewsillinois.com/NEWS/updated-comed-four-found-guilty-on-all-counts-in-bribery-trial-tied-to-ex-speaker-madigan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">were convicted by a federal jury last yea</a>r for their roles in the scheme. The speaker’s trial <a href="https://abc7chicago.com/michael-madigan-fraud-charges-trial-chicago-federal-bribery-case/14267275/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is scheduled</a> for later this year.</li>
<li>Florida Power &amp; Light, one of the largest utilities in the nation, is<a href="https://www.tampabay.com/news/florida-politics/2022/07/29/tampa-congresswoman-kathy-castor-asks-feds-to-investigate-fpl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> facing calls</a> for a federal investigation over <a href="https://www.integrityflorida.org/2022/12/05/ghost-candidates-how-they-manipulate-and-sometimes-steal-florida-elections/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">accusations of using political consultants </a>to back “ghost candidates” in legislative races to draw votes away from candidates it opposed. It also took over a news website as “part of an elaborate, off-the-books political strategy to advocate for rate hikes, agitate for legislative favors, slam political opponents and eliminate anything  … (that) might undermine its near monopoly on selling power in the Sunshine State,” <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/article263757423.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Miami Herald reported</a>. That’s not to mention accusations of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jun/24/a-florida-power-company-didnt-like-a-journalists-commentary-its-consultants-had-him-followed" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hiring private investigators</a> to follow a newspaper columnist who was critical of the company.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other examples of questionable spending abound. In 2018, South Carolina lawmakers were flooded with bogus emails encouraging them to support Virginia utility giant Dominion Energy’s <a href="https://newsadvance.com/work_it_lynchburg/article_cf25644a-ea4e-568d-bc75-5c54090b9d5f.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">takeover of SCANA Corp</a>., a company struggling under the weight of a failed nuclear project. <a href="https://www.wistv.com/story/37544338/dominion-energy-addresses-fake-emails-on-scana-merger/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dominion denied</a> having anything to do with the fake emails, which were sent by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a group that was then supported by Dominion. (The company is no longer <a href="https://consumerenergyalliance.org/about/our-members/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">listed as a CEA member</a>.)</p>
<p>Consumer Energy Alliance was also involved in a 2016 campaign to support a natural gas pipeline running through Ohio that involved sending 347 letters to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission using the names of locals — more than a dozen of whom signed affidavits denying they signed the letters —  including “an Ohio man who has been dead since 1998,” <a href="https://www.cleveland.com/metro/2016/09/nexus_pipeline_opponents_urge_us_postal_service_to_investigate_lobbying_group_photos.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Plain Dealer reported</a>.</p>
<p>In Louisiana, <a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/new-orleans-fines-entergy-5m-over-actors-paid-to-support-gas-plant/541144/#:~:text=Entergy%20hired%20public%20relations%20firm,knew%20or%20should%20have%20known.%E2%80%9D" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Entergy was fined $5 million</a> by the New Orleans City Council after actors hired by a public relations firm working for the utility showed up at public hearings to support a proposed power plant.</p>
<p>Arizona Public Service, which has 1.4 million electric customers in the state, <a href="https://azmirror.com/2019/09/03/taking-stock-aps-election-spending-don-brandt-millions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spent $10 million in 2014</a> that was funneled to dark money groups to help elect its preferred members of the State Corporation Commission, which regulates utilities. That spending wasn’t revealed <a href="https://azmirror.com/2019/04/01/aps-docs-reveal-it-funded-2014-dark-money-effort-supporting-commissioners-son/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">until 2019</a>, when the company complied with a subpoena to release documents.</p>
<p>“Utilities are often using their ratepayer-funded political machines to slow the nation’s urgently-needed transition away from fossil fuels and toward clean energy,” the Energy &amp; Policy Institute wrote. “Working hand-in-hand with their trade associations, the Edison Electric Institute and American Gas Association, utilities continue to fight tooth-and-nail against policies that enable the adoption of essential technologies like rooftop solar power, energy efficiency and building electrification.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘The appetite is there’</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>However, bills to curb utility influence spending can face an uphill fight, demonstrating the stronghold that the companies can have on state governments.</p>

<p>In Virginia, for example, <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/02/13/in-virginias-democratic-legislature-campaign-finance-reform-bills-languish-without-votes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">another round of legislative attempts</a> to prevent candidates from accepting donations from public service companies like Dominion Energy, the state’s largest electric utility and long the <a href="https://www.vpap.org/money/top-donors/?year=all" target="_blank" rel="noopener">biggest corporate donor</a> in Virginia politics, died in House and Senate committees. Both houses are controlled by Democrats.</p>
<p>“Time will tell what will happen,” Del. Josh Cole, a Democrat who was carrying the House version of the legislation,told the Virginia Mercury.  “The appetite is definitely there for it.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ferc.gov/news-events/news/ferc-seeks-comment-recovery-reporting-industry-dues-expenses" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A separate proceeding</a> at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has been looking into the “rate recovery, reporting and accounting treatment of industry association dues and certain civic, political and related expenses.”</p>
<p>The Edison Electric Institute, which represents investor-owned electric utilities and is one of the trade groups affected by some of the state-level legislation, said electric customers benefit when its member companies “have a seat at the table,” adding that they are among the most regulated businesses in the nation.</p>
<p>“We engage on their behalf through lobbying, advocacy and regulatory proceedings as part of our work to ensure that electricity customers have the affordable, reliable and resilient clean energy they want and need. Engaging in discussions with policymakers and regulators is essential to achieving these outcomes,” EEI spokeswoman Sarah Durdaller said in a statement. “We bring unique expertise and insights on how policy proposals will affect business operations, the cost for capital, and, ultimately, our customers. … There are strict laws in place already to ensure that lobbying activities are always funded by shareholders not customers.”</p>
<p>The American Gas Association, which represents natural gas utilities, did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>On Monday, across the street from the Washington, D.C., hotel where the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners was holding its winter policy meeting, a group of climate justice organizations held a rally to call attention to energy company influence, taking aim at corporate sponsorship of the event and a lack of progress on renewable power.</p>
<p>“When we see events like this where utility execs fund gatherings and hobnob with regulators …  we need to speak out,” said Sukrit Mishra, DC program director at Solar United Neighbors, a nonprofit that helps communities form solar co-ops. He voiced support for state legislative efforts as well as<a href="https://castor.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=404261#:~:text=TAMPA%2C%20FL%20%E2%80%93%20U.S.%20Rep.,and%20undermine%20the%20public%20interest." target="_blank" rel="noopener"> federal legislation</a> introduced by U.S. Rep. Kathy Castor, a Florida Democrat, to prevent utility companies from using ratepayer dollars to fund political activities.</p>
<p>“The public is ready to hold utilities accountable. We need regulators to do the same.”</p>

(Sarah Vogelsong / Virginia Mercury) </p><p>Last year, Maryland state lawmaker Lorig Charkoudian was on her own when she filed <a href="https://www.marylandmatters.org/2023/03/24/first-in-the-nation-bill-seeks-to-shed-light-on-utility-deliberations-and-shadow-government/" target="_blank">legislation</a> seeking to force her state’s utilities to reveal votes at the grid operator that coordinates the flow of electricity for 65 million people in the Eastern U.S.</p>
<p>Her bill passed the House but stalled in the upper chamber.</p>
<p>This year, though, <a href="https://mgaleg.maryland.gov/mgawebsite/Legislation/Details/hb0505?ys=2024rs" target="_blank">her legislation</a> is back, with backup: a Senate companion in Maryland and similar measures filed by lawmakers in <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB109" target="_blank">Virginia</a>, <a href="https://ilga.gov/legislation/BillStatus.asp?DocTypeID=HB&amp;DocNum=4747&amp;GAID=17&amp;SessionID=112&amp;LegID=152427" target="_blank">Illinois</a> and <a href="https://www.wvlegislature.gov/Bill_Status/bills_history.cfm?INPUT=5101&amp;year=2024&amp;sessiontype=RS" target="_blank">West Virginia</a>. Another bill is expected to come in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>“It’s a movement,” Charkoudian, a Democratic delegate from Montgomery County in the Washington, D.C. area, said with a chuckle.</p>
<p>The bills broadly seek to force electric utilities to file with state regulators a record of their votes at <a href="https://www.pjm.com/" target="_blank">PJM,</a> the nation’s largest regional transmission organization. But it’s something of an uphill fight. The utilities that hold sway at PJM have battled the proposals, Charkoudian said, and trying to get her colleagues up to speed on the complex inner workings of the organization and the electric grid can be a tall order.</p>
<p>The bills are focused on lower-level <a href="https://www.pjm.com/committees-and-groups/committees" target="_blank">committee</a> votes by PJM’s member utilities that affect policies that set electric market rules, dictate how new generation resources like wind, solar and storage can participate, and govern transmission planning, among other issues.</p>
<p>“PJM is kind of an obscure thing for your average everyday person,” she said.</p>
<p>“There’s all these little pieces that eventually go into some of these big structural outcomes,” Charkoudian said. “The people who are making the rules are the ones who are benefiting. This gives us a chance to start to take a look at what kinds of votes they are taking.”</p>
<p>The decisions also make a difference on electric bills.</p>
<p>“In West Virginia, people’s electric rates have gone up faster than any other state,” said Del. Evan Hansen, D-Monongalia. “We need our electric utilities to explain how their secret votes at PJM are in the public interest.”</p>
<p>Many states in PJM, along with the utilities that operate in the organization, <a href="https://www.pjm.com/-/media/committees-groups/task-forces/capstf/2022/20220628/item-05---local-government-presentation-to-pjm-capstf.ashx" target="_blank">are pursuing aggressive clean energy goals</a>. And what happens at those committee meetings can help or hinder those efforts, the National Caucus of Environmental Legislators said in a <a href="https://www.ncelenviro.org/articles/legislators-in-pjm-region-join-together-to-push-for-greater-transparency/" target="_blank">news release</a>.</p>
<p>“The decisions made by PJM have enormous impact on Virginia’s transition to clean energy,” said Virginia state Del. Rip Sullivan, a Democrat from Fairfax County.</p>
<p>So far, the bills have been pushed by Democratic lawmakers, but Ava Gallo, climate and energy program manager with the National Caucus of Environmental Legislators, said transparency should have bipartisan appeal.</p>
<p>“I think everyone can get on the same page that we should have reliable and affordable electricity no matter where you are on the political spectrum,” she said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘A black box of voting information’</h4>

	 </strong></p>
<p>PJM spokesman Jeff Shields said the organization’s &#8220;stakeholder process and the various stakeholder meetings referenced are open to the media and public, with agendas and minutes posted on our website.”</p>
<p>That’s technically true, “if you jump through hoops,” said Clara Summers, who leads the PJM-focused Consumers for a Better Grid campaign for the Illinois-based Citizens Utility Board, a consumer advocacy organization.</p>

<p>But if you can’t make it to the Philadelphia area, where PJM is headquartered, you’ve got to <a href="https://www.pjm.com/Forms/Registration/Meeting-Registration.aspx" target="_blank">register for an account</a> with PJM to join meetings virtually. And if you do that, you can learn the outcome of the vote, but not who voted for what.  For example, in 2022, PJM proposed a process that would have created a price freeze if electricity costs spiked too high, <a href="https://www.marylandmatters.org/2023/03/24/first-in-the-nation-bill-seeks-to-shed-light-on-utility-deliberations-and-shadow-government/" target="_blank">Maryland Matters reported</a>, but it died in a committee and there was no record of how utilities voted.</p>
<p>“It’s really a black box of voting information,” Summers said. “In an ideal world PJM would do this on its own and make all its votes public.”</p>
<p>She added that affiliates of big utility holding companies get their own votes at lower-level committee meetings and can often outvote other parties, like state consumer advocates.</p>
<p>“One holding company can impact which proposals get voted to advance,” Summers said. “<a href="https://www.aep.com/about/businesses/opcos" target="_blank">AEP</a> and <a href="https://firstenergycorp.com/about/utilities.html" target="_blank">FirstEnergy</a> have more affiliate votes than all the consumer advocate offices combined.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The public interest</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>A key portion of the legislation being introduced in the states is that utilities also explain how their votes are in the public interest.</p>
<p>Charkoudian, the Maryland lawmaker, noted that PJM’s <a href="https://www.marylandmatters.org/2024/02/05/clean-power-advocates-eye-grid-operators-planning-reforms-warily/" target="_blank">recent approval</a> of nearly $800 million in transmission projects needed to compensate for the retirement of a Maryland coal power plant is a “perfect storm” argument for more transparency at the organization. She criticized PJM for a lack of planning, a failure to consider any alternatives and a sluggish interconnection queue – <a href="https://newjerseymonitor.com/2023/05/19/sluggish-pace-of-interconnection-might-jeopardize-states-renewable-goals-report-says/" target="_blank">the process</a> for connecting new power plants to the grid.</p>
<p>That process, <a href="https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2023/07/30/federal-regulators-approve-new-rules-to-ease-power-connection-backlogs/" target="_blank">despite reforms</a>, is still limiting the ability of new, mostly renewable power resources to come online, Charkoudian and <a href="https://energynews.us/2023/09/22/outdated-grid-practices-could-prevent-virginia-from-hitting-future-clean-energy-targets/" target="_blank">other critics</a> say.</p>
<p>“All of these barriers,” she said. “And lo and behold, <a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/maryland-officials-press-ferc-to-reject-pjm-directive-to-exelon-for-785m-i/694203/" target="_blank">Exelon has to build $800 million</a> of transmission as quickly as possible. … Those are the people in the room. Those who are going to benefit financially are the ones voting on them.”</p>
<p>In a statement, Exelon, the Chicago-based parent company of six electric utilities with 10 million customers across Delaware, Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and the District of Columbia, said PJM’s current process “is intentionally structured to support consensus building and mutual gains,” adding that it is open to the public and provides “ample opportunities” for anyone interested to take part.</p>
<p>“We look forward to engaging with the sponsors to discuss other ways to provide the additional transparency that they are seeking,” the company said of the legislation.</p>
<p>To a large extent, Charkoudian and others proponents say, the bills are an attempt to uncover whether utilities are voicing support for cleaner energy with state officials but undermining those goals at PJM.</p>
<p>“The amount of time the utilities have spent trying to kill this bill and circumvent this bill makes me really want to know what’s going on,” Charkoudian said. “It doesn’t seem like you would fight it so hard if you weren’t trying to hide something.”</p>

Such storage is already being done in the UK and Germany. Here are storage tanks at the Dragon Liquefied Natural Gas plant in Wales. (Polly Thomas/Getty Images)</p><p>As the U.S. electric power system has become more reliant on natural gas plants, it’s also become more vulnerable to gas system failures.</p>
<p>During Winter Storm Elliott in 2022, about 18% of the anticipated power supply in the portion of the grid that serves the entire eastern half of the United States, called the Eastern Interconnection, was offline. Of the power plants that failed to perform, 47% were natural-gas fired, according to a <a href="https://www.ferc.gov/news-events/news/ferc-nerc-release-final-report-lessons-winter-storm-elliott" target="_blank">joint inquiry</a> by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the North American Electric Reliability Corporation.</p>
<p>Natural gas fuel problems accounted for 20% of all generation outages, the report noted.</p>
<p>However, in an era when building new gas pipelines, along with other infrastructure, has proven increasingly fraught, some utilities see a solution to gas shortages: adding liquified natural gas storage onsite.</p>
<p>Virginia utility giant Dominion Energy is <a href="https://elibrary.ferc.gov/eLibrary/filelist?accession_number=20231116-3059&amp;optimized=false" target="_blank">proposing to add</a> liquefied natural gas storage to serve two large power plants it operates near Emporia in southern Virginia. And in South Dakota, <a href="https://www.wdayradionow.com/news/local-news/63024-cost-reliability-drive-otter-tail-power-company%E2%80%99s-15-year-resource-plan" target="_blank">Otter Tail Power Company</a> is planning to add gas storage at its Astoria combustion turbine plant in Deuel County. A spokesman for Duke Energy, a large North Carolina-based utility company that was forced to <a href="https://ncnewsline.com/2023/01/04/several-crises-malfunctions-at-duke-energy-led-to-rolling-blackouts-on-christmas-eve-utility-officials-tell-state-regulators/" target="_blank">cut power</a> to customers during Elliott last year, said it is “exploring all on-site storage options, including LNG and other alternative fuel storage technologies for future use.” <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/tepper/news/stories/2021/june/new-england-natural-gas-constraints.html" target="_blank">A 2021 study</a> by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University found that storing gas onsite could also yield benefits for electric customers in New England, where gas supply is tight.</p>
<p>Some pro-renewable energy analysts, though, are wary about the costs and impacts of adding new gas infrastructure at a time when cutting emissions to mitigate climate change is becoming ever more pressing. There are also safety and environmental concerns.<strong> </strong></p>
<h4>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed"> ‘Ensuring access to fuel’</h4>

	</h4>
<p>Having backup fuel on site is common at many natural gas power plants, though the go-to option is typically <a href="https://www.eia.gov/tools/glossary/index.php?id=Distillate%20fuel%20oil#:~:text=Distillate%20fuel%20oil%3A%20A%20general,diesel%20fuels%20and%20fuel%20oils." target="_blank">a distillate fuel oil</a> (like diesel), said Michael Caravaggio, director of research and development at the Electric Power Research Institute, an independent nonprofit research organization. The main advantage is ease of storage and management over a long period of time, whereas liquefied natural gas needs to be kept at extremely low temperatures (about <a href="https://portal.ct.gov/PURA/Gas-Pipeline-Safety/What-is-LNG." target="_blank">-260 degrees Fahrenheit</a>). That means that adding LNG storage involves either liquefying pipeline gas onsite or transporting LNG in for storage in specialized tanks.</p>
<p>“That’s a lot of infrastructure for backup fuel,” Caravaggio said. “The vast majority of the U.S. would likely pencil out with diesel and distillate oil as the onsite backup, and that’s what we see currently.”</p>
<p>But Bill Swanson, manager of supply operations and planning for Otter Tail Power Company, which has about 133,000 customers in Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota, said adding LNG at the company’s <a href="https://www.otpco.com/AstoriaStation" target="_blank">245-megawatt Astoria</a> plant made the most economic sense. Winter Storm Uri in 2021, which sent gas production plummeting, and Elliott last year prompted the company to pursue LNG backup fuel.</p>
<p>“During Winter Storm Elliott we had a situation where we couldn’t get gas out of the pipeline,” he said.</p>
<p>The company explored fuel oil but found it would require modifications to the gas turbine. Burning the oil, he added, also reduces the output of the plant more than 10% and increases emissions.</p>
<p>“On an evaluated cost basis, LNG was lower cost,” Swanson said, though when asked he said the total cost of the gas storage project is not public. If Otter Tail had to liquefy the gas onsite instead of trucking it in from a nearby facility, “economics might flow back to fuel oil,” he added.</p>

<p>Jeremy Slayton, a spokesman for Richmond-headquartered Dominion Energy, said Elliott, Uri and the <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/attack-colonial-pipeline-what-weve-learned-what-weve-done-over-past-two-years#:~:text=On%20May%207%2C%202021%2C%20a,get%20their%20kids%20to%20school." target="_blank">Colonial Pipeline cyberattack in 2021</a> all underscored the need for backup fuel.</p>
<p>The company is proposing to add a 25 million gallon LNG storage facility that will enable its two large combined cycle plants at Brunswick and Greensville to run at full bore for up to four days each. Those plants alone generate enough electricity to power 700,000 of its 2.6 million Virginia customers’ homes.</p>
<p>A cost estimate for the project was not available, Slayton said.</p>
<p>“We are in the process of finalizing the project design, specifications and cost estimates,” he said.</p>
<p>Whether other electric ratepayers elsewhere across the country will be asked to pick up the tab for natural gas storage is unclear. Scott Fiedler, a spokesman for the Tennessee Valley Authority, which is the largest public power company in the U.S. and operates 17 natural gas power plant sites across its <a href="https://www.tva.com/energy/our-power-system" target="_blank">footprint</a>, said the authority is not considering adding onsite liquefied natural gas storage at current or future plants. Fiedler cited cost, supply chain issues, regulatory and permitting challenges and safety as considerations.</p>
<p>Since 2011, LNG plant operators have reported 39 incidents to the U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, an agency spokesperson told States Newsroom. Eight of those “indicate the released commodity ignited,” the spokesperson said. A 2022 <a href="https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/sites/phmsa.dot.gov/files/2023-02/PHMSA-FERC-USCG%20Feb%2011%202023%20Freeport%20Information%20Session%20Presentation%20%28002%29_0.pdf" target="_blank">fire and explosion</a> at the Freeport LNG import and export facility on Quintana Island, Texas, was attributed to testing and operating procedure failures, human error and fatigue, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/freeport-lng-provides-no-timeline-texas-export-plant-restart-2022-11-15/" target="_blank">Reuters</a> reported. In North Carolina, where Dominion is building another large LNG storage facility designed to serve gas customers, the facility is expected to <a href="https://ncnewsline.com/2023/11/03/dominion-plans-large-liquified-natural-gas-facility-in-person-county-near-rougemont/" target="_blank">emit 65,579 tons</a> of greenhouse gases a year, among other pollutants. Similar storage projects intended to serve gas customers have been built or are being developed in <a href="https://nmpoliticalreport.com/news/gas-company-official-argues-lng-storage-facility-necessary-for-reliability/?utm_medium=email" target="_blank">New Mexico</a> and <a href="https://www.we-energies.com/company/liquefied-natural-gas-projects" target="_blank">Wisconsin</a>.</p>
<p>Sarah Durdaller, a spokeswoman for the Edison Electric Institute, a trade group for investor-owned utilities, said the organization does not track individual projects but added that gas storage is valuable.</p>
<p>“Natural gas is a partner to reliability and clean energy. It’s helping accelerate the clean energy transition by allowing our member companies to integrate more renewables into the energy grid while ensuring resilience and reliability,” she said. “Storage, both onsite at power plants and regional hubs, along with other redundancies ensure natural gas is available when customers and the energy grid need it most.”</p>
<p>Todd Snitchler, president and CEO of the Electric Power Supply Association, which represents competitive power producers, said their membership is “constantly evaluating the options available to ensure reliable operation of their assets, including ensuring access to fuel.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘Not the answer’ </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Yet at a time when urgent action is needed to mitigate the <a href="https://www.noaa.gov/news/2023-was-worlds-warmest-year-on-record-by-far#:~:text=Earth's%20average%20land%20and%20ocean,0.15%20of%20a%20degree%20C)." target="_blank">effects of climate change</a>, investing more money in natural gas infrastructure doesn’t make sense, said Mark Specht and Paul Arbaje, energy analysts at the Union of Concerned Scientists who authored <a href="https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/gas-malfunction" target="_blank">a report</a> released Jan. 9 on the failures of gas power plants during five severe winter storms over the past 13 years.</p>
<p>“More gas infrastructure is not the answer. Utilities should be instead focused on diversifying and reducing their reliance on gas,” Arbaje said in an interview with States Newsroom, noting that the U.S. Energy Information Administration is predicting that battery storage installations will <a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=61202" target="_blank">nearly double</a> in 2024.</p>
<p>Specht noted that about 70% of gas plant failures in the storms they studied were caused by freezing equipment and other problems unrelated to fuel availability.</p>
<p>“That picture would not change if you have onsite gas storage,” he said. “One of the conclusions from our report is they really should have someone regulating the reliability of the gas system. That might be a more sensible solution.”</p>

(Sarah Vogelsong/Virginia Mercury)</p><div id="modal-ready">
<p>Nearly a year ago, a Christmas weekend storm blasted across the country, forcing utilities to cut electricity to hundreds of thousands of people in parts of the southeastern U.S. after temperatures plunged, demand spiked, large numbers of power plants failed and natural gas supply was strained.</p>
<p>As the anniversary approaches of <a href="https://missouriindependent.com/2023/01/03/as-another-winter-storm-strains-the-electric-grid-its-time-to-fix-transmission-experts-say/" target="_blank">Winter Storm Elliott</a>, a pair of reports released last week reveal how much worse the situation almost became and the continued vulnerability of the U.S. energy grid to frigid weather.</p>
<p>“The power plants that we had last year are the same ones we have this year,” said Simon Mahan, executive director of the Southern Renewable Energy Association, a trade group. “Sure there might be some window dressing weatherization efforts that have gone on but there’s no real way to determine if that’s going to be good enough going into this year.”</p>
<p>A<a href="https://www.nerc.com/news/Pages/FERC,-NERC-Release-Elliott-Report.aspx#:~:text=FERC%2C%2DNERC%2DRelease%2DElliott%2DReport&amp;text=The%20167%2Dpage%20report%20recommends,for%20U.S.%20natural%20gas%20infrastructure." target="_blank"> joint inquiry</a> into Elliott by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the North American Electric Reliability Corporation also illustrated that, despite the blackouts, a larger catastrophe for the New York City area was barely averted, and the grid serving the entire eastern half of the U.S., called the <a href="https://www.energy.gov/oe/learn-more-about-interconnections" target="_blank">Eastern Interconnection</a>, was also at risk. Among many other recommendations, it calls for congressional and state legislative action to create reliability rules for natural gas infrastructure to ensure it functions in cold weather</p>
<p>“The report highlights what I’ve called for before: Someone must have authority to establish and enforce gas reliability standards,” said FERC Chairman Willie Phillips.</p>
<p>The other report, NERC’s<a href="https://www.nerc.com/pa/RAPA/ra/Reliability%20Assessments%20DL/NERC_WRA_2023.pdf" target="_blank"> winter reliability assessment</a>, found that about two-thirds of the country this winter remains at “an elevated risk” of insufficient energy supplies to meet demand in severe conditions.</p>
<p>“Industry cold weather preparations are on a positive trend but generators and fuel supplies in warmer zones are still likely to have performance issues in freezing temperatures,” read a NERC presentation to reporters last week.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘A real world of hurt’</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Mahan, who was living in Texas during Winter Storm Uri in 2021, when millions of people endured blackouts lasting days and an <a href="https://www.kvue.com/article/news/local/winter-storm-uri-report-deaths-texas-austin/269-bb023e53-5b35-492c-9baf-270c32a79cbd#:~:text=AUSTIN%2C%20Texas%20%E2%80%94%20The%20Texas%20Department,a%20result%20of%20the%20storm." target="_blank">estimated 246 people</a> died, said Elliott posed a similar threat to the entire eastern U.S.</p>
<p>“We were way closer than what a lot of folks realize and too close to have basically done nothing about it in the last year,” he said. “I’m always at a loss to explain to folks how close things were and how dangerous it was because I don’t know if there’s enough adjectives to describe it.”</p>
<p>Gas pressure dropped so low in the system serving parts of New York that had Con Edison, the gas provider, not taken emergency actions and the frigid temperatures abated, the system was close to a “complete loss” that would have taken months to bring back online, the joint report says.</p>
<p>Jim Robb, NERC’s president and CEO, said at a FERC technical conference on Nov. 9 that New York City dodged a disaster that would have “far exceeded” the 2003 summer blackout, <a href="https://www.energy.gov/oe/august-2003-blackout#:~:text=August%2014%20and%2015%2C%202003,50%20million%20customers%20were%20impacted." target="_blank">the largest power outage in U.S. history</a>.</p>
<p>“Had that cold front persisted one more day we would have been in a real world of hurt in the Northeast,” Robb said.</p>
<p>In North Carolina, Duke Energy’s struggles <a href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/us-eastern-electric-grid-narrowly-dodged-collapse-during-storm-1.1865385" target="_blank">also risked</a> a broader grid collapse, with frequency dropping over the weekend.</p>
<p>“Ultimately on the morning of Dec. 24, grid operators maintained frequency by reducing electricity demand, including by shedding over 5,400 MW of firm load, leaving hundreds of thousands of customers without electricity to heat homes for several hours during the extreme cold weather conditions,” the report says.</p>

<p>The joint inquiry noted that Elliott was the fifth event in the past 11 years in which cold weather forced power plant outages that jeopardized the bigger grid. All told, more than 1,700 power generating units saw 3,565 unplanned outages, <a href="https://www.eia.gov/tools/glossary/index.php?id=derate#:~:text=derate,%2C%20operational%2C%20or%20reliability%20considerations." target="_blank">derates</a> (a loss of generating capacity) or failures to start. Including power plants that were already offline before the storm, about 18% of the anticipated power supply in the U.S. portion of the Eastern Interconnection was unavailable during the worst part of the storm.</p>
<p>As the electric grid has become more reliant on natural gas power plants (which provided about <a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/steo/report/BTL/2023/02-genmix/article.php" target="_blank">40% of power generation in 2022</a>,) it’s also become more vulnerable to gas system failures. And freezing weather makes it harder to get gas to power plants just when it’s needed most.</p>
<p>“These recurring failures make clear that America’s natural gas infrastructure and electric grid continue to be severely challenged during extreme cold weather events, repeatedly jeopardizing reliability during life-threatening conditions, even when technology exists to protect the vulnerable components,” the report says, noting the primary causes of unplanned generation outages as “freezing issues, fuel issues and mechanical/electrical issues.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The push to winterize</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>New cold weather reliability standards developed by NERC after a 2018 cold snap for power plants became effective April 1. They included new requirements to maintain and implement cold weather preparedness plans for freeze protection, annual inspection and maintenance rules and training requirements, among others. But after Uri in 2021 demonstrated a clear need for stronger standards, FERC approved <a href="https://newjerseymonitor.com/2023/02/23/after-a-series-of-winter-storms-regulators-approve-new-standards-for-power-plants/" target="_blank">new rules</a> earlier this year, though it told NERC to revise some of the applicability criteria. In October, NERC’s board adopted two new reliability standards for extreme cold weather.</p>
<p>“It is a complex challenge,” said John Moura, NERC’s director of reliability assessment and performance analysis. He noted that the electric system was built around summer peaking, though in recent years winter reliability has emerged as the major concern, mostly because of the rise of gas plants.</p>

<p>The development of standards has been slow, he acknowledged, but because it’s a collaborative “stakeholder” process at NERC, they’re created in concert with industry, less litigated and more likely to stick, Moura said.</p>
<p>“While it might take a long time, the end product is extremely valuable and something everyone gets behind,” he said. “Yes, it’s taken some time but we think we’re getting to that final answer.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">In the meantime </h4>

<p>The Tennessee Valley Authority, which was created in 1933 and had to impose rolling blackouts during Elliott for the first time in its history, <a href="https://www.tva.com/newsroom/articles/preparing-for-winter" target="_blank">says it has</a> “undertaken a massive effort” since the storm to make winterization upgrades on its generation fleet at a cost of about $8 million.</p>
<p>“Mother Nature may hit us hard again this winter, but we have done the hard work — the necessary work — to ensure that we can safely and reliably provide power to our 10 million customers across the valley,” said Allen Clare, a TVA vice president. Louisville Gas &amp; Electric/Kentucky Utilities, which was also forced to cut power to customers during the storm, said it “is looking at potential process improvements, such as public messaging and projects at plants to minimize valve freezing and other cold weather impact,” per the joint report.</p>
<p>Duke Energy, which initiated blackouts that affected about 500,000 customers in the Carolinas, faces an inquiry by regulators in both states. South Carolina’s Office of Regulatory Staff <a href="https://ors.sc.gov/news/2023-08/inspection-and-examination-report-winter-storm-elliott-filed-sc-public-service" target="_blank">found</a> numerous “areas for improvement” in the company’s cold weather preparations, noting that Duke significantly underestimated demand, failed to make supply planning adjustments and update forecast estimates, experienced plant and software failures and had problems communicating effectively with customers. An inquiry into cold weather reliability of gas, water, wastewater and electric systems that was initiated <a href="https://starw1.ncuc.gov/NCUC/PSC/DocketDetails.aspx?DocketId=fb5956a1-6079-4942-9431-2b0a740fe7e4" target="_blank">in 2022</a> by the North Carolina Utilities Commission remains open.</p>
<p>In a statement to a <a href="https://www.foxcarolina.com/2023/09/01/duke-energy-errors-equipment-failures-found-during-rolling-outages-report-says/" target="_blank">South Carolina news station</a>, Duke, which agreed to a corrective action plan and said it has competed the majority of the 101 action items identified, added that it “learned from that historic day and continue to use what we’ve learned from this regional event to help deal with unusual and severe weather in the future.”</p>

(Sarah Vogelsong/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p>The nation’s largest grid operator, PJM, which coordinates the flow of electricity for all or parts of 13 states and the District of Columbia, was not forced to resort to rolling blackouts during Elliott. But it alarmed electric grid experts when it begged customers in its region to conserve electricity, since it was known to <a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/pjm-over-forecasting-costs-consumers-up-to-44b-for-unneeded-energy-capaci/574264/" target="_blank">have a huge surplus</a> of generation capacity.</p>
<p>In the wake of the storm, PJM <a href="https://insidelines.pjm.com/pjm-files-changes-to-capacity-market-to-promote-reliability/" target="_blank">is asking FERC</a> to approve changes to its capacity market, which is intended to make sure there’s enough electric supply at critical times by providing extra payments to generators who commit to being available when demand spikes. PJM says they’re “designed to support reliability of the electric grid now and in the future amid increasingly extreme weather and a changing generation fleet.” The reforms are intended to better reflect actual risk of outages by generation type (such as common failures by natural gas plants), get more accurate accreditation of power sources to better assess their value to the grid and “improve generator testing, including operational and seasonal requirements.”</p>
<p>The proposed changes are a mixed bag, according to Tom Rutigliano, a senior advocate with the Natural Resources Defense Council’s Sustainable FERC project who focuses on PJM. He called reforms that more accurately take into account gas plants’ reliability risks a good step but criticized a plan to reduce penalties for generators that are paid to be available when called upon but fail to deliver.</p>
<p>“They’re betting that the savings from cost cutting will be more than the penalties they might have to pay,” <a href="https://www.nrdc.org/bio/tom-rutigliano/pjms-capacity-market-reforms-almost-not-quite" target="_blank">Rutigliano wrote</a>. “Reducing penalties is a direct message to power plant owners that they should spend less on preventative maintenance and preparation for emergencies.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘The rhythm of it all’</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>In an interview, Rutigliano said the fresh memory of Elliott in the minds of grid operators, power plant operators and utilities could be enough to instill vigilance in the event of severe weather this winter.</p>
<p>“If the past is any indicator, you have these freeze-offs and big problems that largely come down to negligence,” he said. That’s followed by a period of heightened awareness with lots of “sub rosa” actions that grid managers, utilities and other power system operators can employ to tighten up, he said. Unfortunately though, that tends to slacken after a few years, he added.</p>
<p>“That seems to be the rhythm of it all,” Rutigliano said. “I’d be less worried this winter because cold weather performance is on every power plant owner&#8217;s mind.”</p>
<p>Mahan, of the Southern Renewable Energy Association, said getting state utility commissions to better vet winterization efforts, improving power demand forecasting, diversifying generation resources, building more transmission to better link regions and getting new power sources like wind, solar and storage connected to the grid all have a role to play in protecting reliability.</p>
<p>“There’s no silver bullet,” he said. “With something like this, having a multi-pronged approach is the way to prepare for the future. … When you go into the woods you want to have a Swiss army knife.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Getting gas right </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>In the long run though, major regulators like NERC and FERC agree, toughening winterization standards and congressional action on improving the reliability of the gas system and forcing better coordination with the electric power industry are necessary.</p>
<p>“The electric utility network is highly dependent upon the uninterrupted performance of the gas production and delivery network,” <a href="https://www.naesb.org/pdf4/geh_final_report_072823.pdf" target="_blank">a report</a> issued by the North American Energy Standards Board issued in July says. “Without the latter, the former cannot meet its own performance requirements.” When the gas system fails to deliver for power generation, the results can be catastrophic, the authors wrote.</p>
<p>“During Uri, gas needed for power generation vanished during periods of peak winter demand for both gas and electricity, tragically resulting in excess of 240 lives lost and economic damage estimated as high as $130 billion,” the report says.</p>
<p>The board made 20 recommendations. Some had broad support by both the electric and gas sectors, such as more state encouragement of demand response programs (which can cut electric and gas demand when supply is insufficient), aligning industry scheduling timelines and changing strategies for “unit commitment,” which refers to deciding when and which power generating units will start and shut down.</p>
<p>Others, however, like timely reporting of natural gas pipeline website data and encouraging states to “consider the development of weatherization guidelines appropriate for their region/jurisdiction” were generally widely supported by the electric industry but drew more opposition from the gas sector.</p>
<p>“As much as we are heartened by the strong support for some recommendations, the divergence of support between the two sectors on others is profoundly disturbing,” the report says. “It reflects a fundamental lack of agreement regarding the lessons learned from these past two winters and the challenges ahead in ensuring that outages no longer occur owing to a failure between these two systems. … We did not regard any of our 20 recommendations to be so burdensome or so profoundly altering that they would engender strong opposition.”</p>

Because there was plenty of both last week for the fledgling U.S. offshore wind industry.</p>
<p>On Halloween, the Biden administration <a href="https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/biden-harris-administration-approves-largest-offshore-wind-project-nation" target="_blank">announced</a> that the nation’s largest planned offshore wind development, Dominion Energy’s 2,600 megawatt Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project, received its last major federal approval.</p>
<p>The same day, however, Danish wind giant Ørsted pulled the plug on a pair of projects (<a href="https://us.orsted.com/news-archive/2023/10/orsted-ceases-development-of-ocean-wind-1-and-ocean-wind-2" target="_blank">Ocean Wind 1 and 2</a>) that were planned off the coast of New Jersey, citing climbing interest rates, inflation and “supply chain bottlenecks.” The news touched off a <a href="https://newjerseymonitor.com/2023/11/01/gov-murphy-democrats-stick-with-offshore-wind-despite-end-of-major-windfarm-projects/" target="_blank">firestorm</a> in <a href="https://twitter.com/GovMurphy/status/1719525102419611734?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet" target="_blank">New Jersey</a>, which has set some of the most aggressive offshore wind goals in the country and gone to considerable lengths to <a href="https://newhampshirebulletin.com/2023/01/27/offshore-wind-will-need-major-investments-in-transmission-supply-chain-reports-say/" target="_blank">plan</a> the transmission upgrades needed to bring all that power ashore.</p>
<p>The same financial headwinds have many U.S.offshore wind developers looking to <a href="https://commonwealthbeacon.org/energy/new-york-rejects-bid-to-renegotiate-offshore-wind-contracts/" target="_blank">renegotiate deals</a> as the costs of their projects climb. And it’s casting some doubt on whether states and the Biden administration will be able to hit their offshore wind targets on time.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">A ‘sharp increase’ in costs</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>John Murray, a senior research analyst at S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights, said the afflicted projects secured deals to purchase their power between 2019 and 2022, noting that during that period there were lower financing and capital expenditure costs.</p>
<p>“The sharp increase in inflation (starting in 2021), due to increased demand, has led to price rises in raw materials (such as steel, copper and aluminum) that are essential to the construction of wind turbines. Labor costs for engineers, construction and manufacturing workers have also risen significantly. Developers have been reporting project cost increases anywhere from 10-50%,” Murray said.</p>
<p>Virginia and 10 other states across the country, mostly along the Eastern Seaboard, have set their own aggressive targets for offshore wind development, according <a href="https://cleanpower.org/news/new-clean-power-quarterly-report-q3-2023/" target="_blank">to a report</a> issued Nov. 1  by the American Clean Power Association. Other states, everywhere from <a href="https://energynews.us/2023/08/23/delaware-eyes-its-first-offshore-wind-target-but-trouble-looms/" target="_blank">Delaware</a> and <a href="https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/sc-house-passes-bill-to-explore-offshore-wind-opportunities-68771103" target="_blank">South Carolina</a> to <a href="https://stateline.org/2023/05/23/offshore-wind-in-the-midwest-some-great-lakes-leaders-think-so/" target="_blank">those touching the Great Lakes</a>, are also exploring encouraging offshore wind development. And the Biden administration has set a goal of 30 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2030, the rough equivalent of more than 30 large power plants.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for S&amp;P Global, a financial and industry data firm, said it is “downwardly revising” its estimates of offshore wind development by 2030 in a coming report “due to recent industry announcements.” The current outlook anticipates 22 gigawatts by 2030.</p>
<p>The industry’s woes have hardly been a secret. At an industry conference in Boston this summer, there was <a href="https://rhodeislandcurrent.com/2023/07/13/budding-u-s-offshore-wind-industry-facing-rough-seas/" target="_blank">plenty of gloom</a> to go around and the same complaints about inflation, rising labor and materials costs and permitting delays. But even so, the decision by Ørsted came as a surprise to New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy — <a href="https://www.nj.gov/governor/news/news/562023/approved/20231031a.shtml" target="_blank">who said</a> that “as recently as several weeks ago, the company made public statements regarding the viability and progress of Ocean Wind 1” — and spread concern across the industry.</p>
<p>Sam Salustro, a vice president at the Oceantic Network, a trade group <a href="https://www.windpowermonthly.com/article/1845848/bnow-rebrands-oceantic-network-reflect-broader-renewables-agenda#:~:text=US%2Dbased%20trade%20body%20the,floating%20solar%20and%20green%20hyrdrogen." target="_blank">formerly known as</a> the Business Network for Offshore Wind, said he was “extremely disappointed to hear of Ørsted’s decision,” though he added the cancellations were triggered by “financial difficulties experienced across the industry which serves as a reminder of the hard work we need to do building a supporting supply chain.”</p>
<p>Jason Ryan, a spokesperson for the American Clean Power Association, said Halloween was a “day of highs and lows for the U.S. offshore wind industry.&#8221; He noted that despite the termination of the New Jersey projects, work is going forward on <a href="https://www.vineyardwind.com/vineyardwind-1" target="_blank">Vineyard Wind 1</a>, a development off the coast of Massachusetts by Avangrid Renewables, as well as <a href="https://southforkwind.com/" target="_blank">South Fork Wind</a>, a partnership between Ørsted and Eversource, a New England utility company, off the coast of Long Island in addition to the Virginia project receiving federal approval. Though it canceled the New Jersey projects, Ørsted also said it would move ahead on <a href="https://revolution-wind.com/" target="_blank">Revolution Wind,</a> a 704 megawatt joint venture with Eversource planned to deliver power to Rhode Island and Connecticut.</p>
<p>“While the news out of New Jersey is a disappointment, our industry continues to show its resilience and the path ahead for the clean energy transition remains promising,” Ryan said. “The news is also a reminder that we need strong partnerships with government and stakeholders, now more than ever.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Virginia project moves ahead </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Bucking the industry trends, though, Dominion Energy says its nearly $10 billion Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project is on time and on budget. Jeremy Slayton, a company spokesperson, said the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management’s record of decision, the 2,600 megawatt, 176-turbine project’s “last major permitting milestone,” will allow some onshore construction to start. It’s scheduled to be finished by 2026.</p>
<p>“You can look to our project and see that offshore wind is moving along very well here in Virginia under our regulated process,” Slayton said.</p>
<p>Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind is different from many of the other projects in the Northeast in that Dominion holds the federal offshore wind lease and is spearheading the project itself — although <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+SB1477" target="_blank">legislation</a> passed by the state’s General Assembly this year allows it to “establish an offshore wind affiliate … for the purpose of securing a noncontrolling equity financing partner for the project.”</p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="NCKOtbOmjK"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/12/15/regulators-approve-offshore-wind-settlement/">Virginia regulators approve offshore wind settlement</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Slayton said that because the project, <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/09/24/four-things-to-know-about-dominions-massive-wind-farm-proposal/" target="_blank">proposed</a> in 2019, had to be approved by the utility regulators at the State Corporation Commission, the company had to secure its major contractors, production slots, prices and other costs early.</p>
<p>“We locked in those costs before supply chain issues, before interest rates went up,” Slayton said.</p>
<p>However, there was some wrangling in the state between utility regulators, ratepayer advocates and the utility over ratepayer protections. The project was ultimately <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/12/15/regulators-approve-offshore-wind-settlement/" target="_blank">approved by </a>the utility commission last year with what Will Cleveland, an attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center, said are important protections to shield electric customers.</p>
<p>“In a project like this there are two fundamental types of risk. One is construction risk, where the project ultimately costs a lot more or a lot more time to build than originally estimated,” Cleveland said. “The other risk is operational risk, where the project does not perform nearly as well as promised.”</p>
<p>Ratepayer advocates had initially sought a performance guarantee, but after negotiations that also included the <a href="https://www.oag.state.va.us/media-center/news-releases/2484-october-28-2022-attorney-general-miyares-announces-historic-agreement-to-secure-offshore-wind-project-with-unprecedented-protections-for-consumers" target="_blank">state’s attorney general</a>, the company agreed to a construction guarantee that means if cost overruns exceed certain thresholds, “the shareholders will have to pick up the tab,” Cleveland said.</p>
<p>“They locked in a lot of their supply contracts at fixed prices a while ago. By doing so Dominion insulated itself and its shareholders from a lot of these cost increases these developers are seeing,” he said. “They felt better able to manage the construction cost than the operational risk.”</p>
<p>However, Cleveland said traditional power purchase agreements, which are how most offshore wind developers have sought to make money from the power produced, are generally lower risk for customers.</p>
<p>“If you’re going to go the utility-ownership model, it’s imperative the utility regulator has the power to protect customers from the risk of that model, and the Virginia commission did it right this time,” he said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Getting ‘back on track’</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Murray, the S&amp;P analyst, said the current “state of flux” in offshore wind is “something that is not uncommon for a new industry.”</p>
<p>Utility companies in some cases have <a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/avangrid-orsted-eversource-ppa-offshore-wind-development/688470/" target="_blank">terminated</a> existing power purchase agreements at the request of wind developers and in others have <a href="https://rhodeislandcurrent.com/2023/07/19/rhode-island-energy-says-no-to-sole-proposal-for-more-offshore-wind/" target="_blank">refused to go into contracts</a> deemed too costly. <a href="https://www.reutersevents.com/renewables/wind/cost-crunch-prompts-mass-rethink-us-offshore-wind-contracts" target="_blank">According to Reuters,</a> by mid-September developers of at least 10 East Coast projects were seeking new power purchase agreements. Just last month, New York’s Public Service Commission <a href="https://documents.dps.ny.gov/public/MatterManagement/MatterFilingItem.aspx?FilingSeq=314376&amp;MatterSeq=48235" target="_blank">rejected</a> a bid by wind developers to <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/10/12/new-york-rejects-offshore-wind-onshore-renewable-request-for-bigger-payments-00121231" target="_blank">renegotiate deals</a> with the state</p>
<p>Despite the Ørsted cancellations, Murray noted that New York’s <a href="https://renewablesnow.com/news/new-york-picks-4-gw-of-winners-in-3rd-offshore-wind-solicitation-837646/" target="_blank">latest solicitation</a> for offshore wind power, in which the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority picked three new offshore wind projects totaling 4,032 megawatts, shows that “developers are still keen on moving forward.” Murray added that the federal government is trying to speed up offshore wind permitting and New York is “showing the way forward” by considering stepping up the pace of its solicitation process.</p>
<p>“Although New York denied petitions to renegotiate offtake contract prices, speeding up the solicitation process signals that New York state regulators acknowledge the industry’s pricing concerns and wants to help developers get their project economics back on track as soon as possible,” Murray said.</p>

(Robert Zullo/States Newsroom)</p><div id="modal-ready">
<p>Electric customers have fallen into a “regulatory gap” that’s allowed billions of dollars of transmission construction to happen without oversight of need, prudence or cost effectiveness, according to a complaint filed with federal regulators by the Office of the Ohio Consumers’ Counsel.</p>
<p>And though the <a href="https://elibrary.ferc.gov/eLibrary/filelist?accession_number=20230928-5134&amp;optimized=false" target="_blank">complaint</a> to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission was made on behalf of Ohio ratepayers, the same concern exists across much of the nation, so much so that the commission itself <a href="https://www.nevadacurrent.com/2022/11/25/as-utilities-spend-billions-on-transmission-support-builds-for-independent-monitoring/" target="_blank">has weighed</a> whether more monitoring of transmission spending is necessary.</p>
<p>FERC has broad authority over <a href="https://www.ferc.gov/what-ferc-does#:~:text=As%20part%20of%20that%20responsibility,for%20resale%20in%20interstate%20commerce" target="_blank">electric transmission</a>, but utilities are taking advantage of what critics call an inadequate regulatory regime and spending billions of dollars across the country on smaller lines, replacements for old wires or new projects that fall below the threshold for federal or state review as to whether they’re actually needed or make financial sense.</p>
<p>“Pretty much in every state there’s going to be some subset of transmission that’s not going to be subject to some regulatory scrutiny,” said Nick Guidi, a senior attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center who focuses on transmission planning and other electric grid issues.</p>
<p>The scrutiny on utility charges for transmission construction comes as state lawmakers from around the country, including four from Virginia, press FERC to set a new and stronger regional transmission rule that would expand the use of renewable energy.</p>
<p>“The headlines from this summer of drought, floods, storms, and extreme heat have threatened grid instability constantly; however, the grid has beaten the odds time and time again due to the widespread adoption of renewable energy,” more than 200 state lawmakers in the National Council of Environmental Legislators <a href="https://www.ncelenviro.org/app/uploads/2023/10/State-Legislative-Sign-On-Letter-on-FERC-Transmission-Rule.pdf" target="_blank">wrote to FERC commissioners last week</a>. “In order for this trend to continue, it is critical that the power from renewable energy has the means to reach the areas that need it the most. So far, transmission build out has been woefully unprepared to meet that need.”</p>
<p>“This is not only a clean energy issue, but an economic one as well,” the lawmakers wrote. “In the Eastern US alone, expanding and modernizing the transmission grid would unleash up to $7.8 trillion in investment and generate more than 6 million net new jobs, primarily in rural areas. Expanded transmission is also critical for increasing reliability of the grid, something we hear from our constituents daily.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Formula rates</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Often what utilities make on those projects are set through FERC <a href="https://www.ferc.gov/formula-rates-electric-transmission-proceedings-key-concepts-and-how-participate" target="_blank">“formula rates</a>,” which, instead of relying on a contested rate case to establish the utility’s cost of service for transmission, allows the companies to file information with FERC in various categories — including rate of return, operations and maintenance, depreciation, taxes and other factors — that is used to calculate what they’re able to charge customers.</p>
<p>“Formula rates are a vehicle for avoiding burdens of proof and limiting protests. The commission’s default presumption that all transmission expenditures are prudent allows utility costs to flow through to consumers’ bills without scrutiny,” wrote Ari Peskoe, director of Harvard University’s Electricity Law Initiative, in <a href="https://elibrary.ferc.gov/eLibrary/filelist?accession_number=20220916-5192&amp;optimized=false" target="_blank">comments</a> filed with FERC last year. The rules, Peskoe said in an interview, “push utilities to invest locally because that’s where you can get the easy money.”</p>
<p>Andrew French, a member of the Kansas Corporation Commission, <a href="https://kansasreflector.com/2022/11/20/as-utilities-spend-billions-on-transmission-support-builds-for-independent-monitoring/" target="_blank">said last year</a> that transmission costs on an average Kansas electric customer’s bill had gone from $4 a month about a decade ago to $20 in 2022, a situation that “screams out for more oversight.” In North Carolina, a state regulator told FERC officials last year, state regulatory review is only triggered for lines 161 kilovolts or larger, which leads to lots of construction of smaller lines that his office doesn’t find out about until “<a href="https://www.nevadacurrent.com/2022/11/25/as-utilities-spend-billions-on-transmission-support-builds-for-independent-monitoring/" target="_blank">it shows up in rates</a>.”</p>
<p>At 16.42 cents per kilowatt hour, <a href="https://www.eia.gov/state/rankings/?sid=OH#series/31" target="_blank">Ohio ranked 18th </a>in the nation (highest to lowest) for residential retail electric prices as of June 2023, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. That was up from <a href="https://www.eia.gov/electricity/state/Ohio/" target="_blank">9.76 cents per kilowatt hour</a> in 2021, when the state ranked 32nd. Transmission and distribution costs are only a portion of that, but they have led to “significant increases” in customers’ bills, the consumers’ counsel said in its complaint, filed Sept. 28. However, a spokesman for the office said it does not have “comprehensive data on how the transmission and distribution charges (as a percentage of total electric rates) on individual customer bills have increased over time.”</p>
<p>The consumer advocate&#8217;s complaint says that more than 85% of utilities’ proposed new transmission spending was for “supplemental projects,” meaning local projects that are not subject to need, prudence or cost effectiveness review by the state’s Public Utilities’ Commission, its Power Siting Board, or PJM, which is the <a href="https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2022/10/10/amid-a-massive-american-clean-energy-shift-grid-operators-play-catch-up-2/" target="_blank">regional grid operator</a> for Ohio as well as Virginia.</p>
<p>“Instead, these PJM governing documents assume that state regulatory authorities will adequately protect consumers regarding the need, prudence and cost of supplemental projects,” the complaint says. “That assumption is misplaced.”</p>
<p>The Ohio Power Siting Board is responsible for overseeing environmental effects, reviewing potential alternative locations and the need for some electric facilities, but that authority is limited to transmission facilities rated at 100 kilovolts and above and it does not review any projects for cost effectiveness, the consumers’ counsel says. The Public Utilities Commission of Ohio “likewise has declined to review the need, prudence and cost-effectiveness of these planned local transmission facilities in Ohio, despite OCC requesting it to do so,” the complaint notes.</p>
<p>Tammy Ridout, a spokesperson for American Electric Power, one of the utility companies named in the filing, said the company is reviewing the complaint. AEP Ohio has more than 1.5 million customers in the state.</p>
<p>“We’re committed to transparent transmission planning as we work to provide reliable, affordable service to customers,” Ridout said. She added that PJM’s existing process for planning so-called supplemental projects “is one of the most robust and transparent processes in the nation” and a similar framework is being proposed for other regions by FERC in a <a href="https://www.ferc.gov/explainer-transmission-notice-proposed-rulemaking#:~:text=To%20better%20allocate%20the%20costs,the%20regional%20transmission%20planning%20process." target="_blank">new rule</a> the agency is working on dealing with transmission planning and cost allocation.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.aep.com/news/releases/read/8685/AEP-Shares-Updates-on-Strategic-Initiatives-Highlights-Planned-Capital-Investments-in-Renewables-and-Energy-Grid" target="_blank">news release</a> last year, AEP said it plans to spend $26 billion between 2023 and 2027 on transmission and distribution operations “to continue building a modern, efficient, reliable and resilient energy grid.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Ferreting out ‘gold-plating’</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Jeff Shields, a PJM spokesman, said FERC “has made it clear that certain asset management activities, such as end-of-life decisions that do not expand the transmission system, are specific to the individual transmission owners.” For those supplemental projects, he said the organization has “successfully worked with stakeholders to enhance the transparency of planning” and incorporated them into PJM’s bigger regional planning efforts.</p>
<p>The Consumers’ Counsel wants FERC to put in a “backstop” to protect Ohio electric customers by changing the rules (called a “tariff”) that govern PJM.</p>
<p>“By this mechanism, FERC would review the need, prudence and cost-effectiveness of local transmission projects in Ohio,” the complaint says. “Any utility gold-plating … should be ferreted out by regulators.”</p>
<p>The Edison Electric Institute, an association for investor-owned utilities, projected that its members <a href="https://www.eei.org/-/media/Project/EEI/Documents/Issues-and-Policy/Finance-And-Tax/bar_cap_ex.pdf?la=en&amp;hash=3D08D74D12F1CCA51EE89256F53EBABEEAAF4673" target="_blank">would spend</a> about $87.8 billion on transmission and distribution this year. Given that, and how much work is needed to upgrade an aging grid to bolster reliability and accommodate the transition to more renewable power, it’s crucial to make sure ratepayers aren’t being subjected to “gold-plating,” meaning overspending on capital projects to boost profit margins, Guidi said.</p>
<p>“It makes rates go up but it also makes utilities a lot of money. It’s important that it’s carefully policed,” Guidi said. “Otherwise utilities are going to make a lot of money at the expense of ratepayers without a lot of appreciable gain.”</p>
<p>The Ohio Consumers’ Counsel also encouraged FERC to appoint an independent transmission monitor to review “planning, need, prudence and cost-effectiveness of local transmission projects for consumers in Ohio.” Independent monitoring has been <a href="https://www.nevadacurrent.com/2022/11/25/as-utilities-spend-billions-on-transmission-support-builds-for-independent-monitoring/" target="_blank">part of discussions</a> between FERC commissioners and state regulators, many of whom say they often lack the expertise and authority to vet utilities’ local transmission spending.</p>
<p>The Ohio agency also wants FERC to bar Ohio utilities from using formula rates for transmission, preferring that Ohio transmission utilities get prior FERC approval “for all local transmission projects at or exceeding a set cost threshold.”</p>
<p>“FERC needs to step in now and halt the harm to Ohio consumers,” the complaint says.</p>
<p>What the commission might do is unclear.</p>
<p>The commissioners could dismiss the complaint by finding that the consumers’ counsel hasn’t made the case that the rates resulting from the lack of transmission oversight are unjust and unreasonable, said Guidi, the SELC attorney. Or it could “kick the can down the road,” he said, and examine the issue as part of a bigger proceeding</p>
<p>The agency is grappling with several transmission issues, including its <a href="https://www.ferc.gov/news-events/news/ferc-issues-transmission-nopr-addressing-planning-cost-allocation" target="_blank">draft rule</a> on transmission planning and cost allocation. On Oct. 4, more than 230 state legislators from 43 states <a href="https://www.ncelenviro.org/app/uploads/2023/10/State-Legislative-Sign-On-Letter-on-FERC-Transmission-Rule.pdf" target="_blank">sent a letter</a> to FERC asking the commission to finalize and strengthen that rule.</p>
<p>The Ohio complaint, Peskoe said, is more evidence of a broken system for transmission development oversight.</p>
<p>“FERC already has reams of evidence that its rules fail to protect consumers and incentivize utilities to rebuild last century’s transmission network,” he said. “FERC is, first and foremost, a utility regulator that is supposed to prevent monopolists from abusing their local market power.”</p>

(Sarah Vogelsong / Virginia Mercury) </p><div id="modal-ready">
<p>The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on Thursday finalized long-awaited new rules intended to reform how power generation projects get connected to the electric grid, seen as a major step in smoothing the path for thousands of mostly renewable power projects currently waiting to plug in.</p>
<p>“This rule will ensure that our country’s vast generation resources are able to interconnect to the transmission system in a reliable, efficient, transparent and timely manner,” FERC Chairman Willie Phillips said, adding that there are 2,000 gigawatts of power projects stuck in interconnection queues across the nation. “We have as much generation waiting to be connected to the grid as double the amount of generation currently on the grid.”</p>
<p>Those projects, mostly wind, solar and battery storage plants, have been stuck in massive backlogs while grid managers conduct interconnection studies needed to gauge how bringing them online would affect the broader system and determine whether any upgrades are needed.</p>
<p>“We have wait times of over five years. The average project needed today won’t even begin construction until 2028,” Phillips said.</p>
<p>Existing processes were set up at a time when there were relatively few new power plants (generally gas fired) coming online and there was plenty of excess transmission line capacity, said Ari Peskoe, director of the Electricity Law Initiative at Harvard Law School. Now, the vast majority of the projects in the queue are renewables that are generally more numerous and diffuse and smaller in output. And there are many areas where transmission is constrained.</p>

<p>The resulting delays are <a href="https://newjerseymonitor.com/2023/05/19/sluggish-pace-of-interconnection-might-jeopardize-states-renewable-goals-report-says/" target="_blank">imperiling</a> states’ renewable power goals, causing projects to wither on the vine as developers confront rising costs and supply chain problems and depriving local economies of jobs, not to mention the carbon-free electricity they promise to deliver, critics contend.</p>

<p>FERC’s new rule requires transmission providers to use “cluster” studies that allow for studying numerous proposed projects at once rather than individually in a “first-come, first-served” fashion. A cluster approach that is redone each year also is better able to adapt when interconnection customers who are higher up in the queue drop out, reducing the need for “<a href="https://www.ferc.gov/news-events/news/staff-presentation-improvements-generator-interconnection-procedures-and" target="_blank">cascading restudies</a>,” FERC staff said. At the same time, the rule requires increased financial commitments for interconnection customers to enter and remain in the queue, meet more stringent site control requirements and imposes penalties on customers who withdraw from the queue.</p>
<p>“These reforms will discourage speculative, commercially non-viable interconnection requests and allow transmission providers to focus on processing interconnection requests that have a greater chance of reaching commercial operation,” FERC staff wrote.</p>

<p>For transmission providers, which can be big, regional entities called <a href="https://www.epa.gov/green-power-markets/power-market-structure" target="_blank">regional transmission organizations or independent system operators,</a> or individual utilities depending on the part of the country, there are also firm study deadlines and penalties if they are not met, and uniform modeling standards.</p>
<p>And, among other components, another major piece pushes more adoption of technological advances into the interconnection process, such as allowing more than one generation facility to co-locate on a shared site behind a single interconnection point and share an interconnection request. There’s also a requirement that transmission providers model battery storage resources in the way they are actually used rather than unlikely worst-case scenarios and require evaluation of a suite of options called <a href="https://inl.gov/national-security/grid-enhancing-technologies/" target="_blank">“grid-enhancing technologies”</a> that can save money and time.</p>
<p>“It’s fair,” said Commissioner Allison Clements. “The final rule requires everyone to do their part to address the cause of interconnection backlogs.”</p>
<p>Though renewable energy industry representatives and clean power proponents called the reforms a good start, they say the rule, <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/07/05/2022-13470/improvements-to-generator-interconnection-procedures-and-agreements" target="_blank">first proposed</a> last summer, will leave many problems the energy transition <a href="https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2022/10/10/amid-a-massive-american-clean-energy-shift-grid-operators-play-catch-up-2/" target="_blank">has presented</a> for grid managers and regulators unresolved.</p>
<p>“The bigger picture issues of why we don’t have enough transmission in this country are not going to be solved through this rule,” Peskoe said.</p>
<p>John Moore, director of the Sustainable FERC Project at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said the rule “will raise the floor on action, but the ceiling will depend on grid operators taking leadership and increasing the capability and capacity of the grid. The devil will be in the details.”</p>
<p>Roughly two-thirds of American electric customers live in an area where electric flow is managed by a regional transmission organization (RTO) or an independent system operator (ISO), who also run <a href="https://www.epa.gov/green-power-markets/power-market-structure" target="_blank">power markets</a>. In the rest of the country, the grid is run by utilities that are typically vertically integrated (meaning they’re responsible for generating, transmitting and distributing electricity to their customers) who do their own transmission planning. The new rule will apply to both types of regimes, which will have to submit filings to FERC explaining how they’ll comply, Peskoe said. Several RTOs have already been implementing their own queue reform, however.</p>
<p>“We need to fashion this in a way that moves the ball but doesn’t get in the way of what they’re already doing,” Commissioner Mark Christie, a former Virginia utility regulator, said.</p>

<p>The Midcontinent Independent System Operator, or MISO, which coordinates electric flow for a region of the central U.S. and Gulf Coast that includes all or part of 15 states, proposed a <a href="https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/solar/utility-integration/miso-proposes-to-reform-the-generator-interconnection-queue-again/#gref" target="_blank">series of reforms</a> that includes increased interconnection payments and penalties for withdrawal.</p>
<p>“Changes are needed to better manage the number of speculative requests in future queue cycles, which will reduce processing time and ensure more certain and timely study results,” a MISO spokesman said.</p>
<p>PJM, the largest U.S. regional transmission organization, also began a transition to a new interconnection process <a href="https://insidelines.pjm.com/transition-to-new-interconnection-process-begins-july-10/" target="_blank">this month</a>.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://acore.org/renewable-energy-projects-trapped-in-pjms-interconnection-queue-would-create-thousands-of-new-jobs-billions-in-capital-investment/" target="_blank">report</a> released last month that looked just at PJM, the American Council on Renewable Energy, a nonprofit working to accelerate the transition to renewable energy, found that if PJM was approving projects at the same pace as it did from 2011 to 2016, the 34 gigawatts of renewable power in its queue would be operating within the next four years. That would mean thousands of jobs and about $33 billion in investment for the PJM region, which includes 65 million people in all or parts of 13 states and the District of Columbia. Virginia, Illinois, Ohio and Indiana were the biggest potential beneficiaries.</p>
<p>In interviews, several grid experts said fixing transmission planning and making upgrades is equally, if not more, important than interconnection reforms for getting large amounts of new resources connected to the grid quickly.</p>
<p>“If a transmission provider says ‘Congratulations, you’ve got your agreement, this is going to take six plus years before you can interconnect,’ that’s going to be fatal to a lot of projects,” said Jason Burwen, vice president of policy and strategy at GridStor, an Oregon company that has 2 gigawatts of battery storage projects under development.</p>
<p>Peskoe noted that much of the nation’s transmission planning is being driven by individual projects’ interconnection process, which he called a “piecemeal, inefficient way to go about building an interstate transmission system.”</p>
<p>Several other experts compared it to building a highway system one lane at a time.</p>
<p>FERC is working on another proposed rule on regional transmission planning and cost allocation that it will finalize “in the months ahead,” Phillips said.</p>
<p>“Together, this interconnection queue reform, with long term and regional planning — we will have the greatest transmission reforms in a generation to come out of FERC,” he added. “This is a good day.”</p>

(Robert Zullo)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In February of 2018 I was staring down 38, with one child about to turn three, another about to be born and a mortgage on a small place in the Maymont neighborhood of Richmond.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My employer, the Richmond Times-Dispatch, had just</span><a href="https://www.nbc12.com/story/37556497/times-dispatch-announces-layoffs-increases-newspaper-prices/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> laid off </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">a bunch of people in another round of cuts. I’d seen buyouts, layoffs and pay cuts at almost all of the papers I’d worked at, and for the first time I was seriously thinking about leaving journalism. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Luckily, another option presented itself. My wife forwarded a listing for a start-up operation that wanted to launch a Virginia outlet and was seeking an editor. A few months later, I accepted the job. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The name came first.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Mercury” was originally on a list of 10 names, mostly from old-style newspaper nameplates, that were considered for the new publication, and it was the only domain name we could get free and clear at the time. Though I came to love it, my original favorites were the Virginia Way (maybe too inside baseball in retrospect) and the Virginia Monitor. Many people assumed our name was an homage to the brief, colorful run of the</span><a href="https://m.styleweekly.com/richmond/mercury-rising/Content?oid=19065973" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Richmond Mercury,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> but it was pure coincidence. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then I needed a staff. By the time I took the job, I had a little more than two months to hire reporters, find office space, set up phone and internet service, buy computers, office supplies and furniture (more on what happens when you give reporters a role in picking their chairs later) and start stacking stories and columns before our July 17 launch date. The compressed timeline and the fact that I was already sitting within a few feet of two people I knew I wanted to bring with me immediately made the first two hires easy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I first met Ned Oliver when I was a city hall reporter for the Times-Dispatch and he was doing the same for Style Weekly. He’d infuriate me with his ability to dodge many of the lengthy city council committee, planning and zoning and other meetings I suffered through on a weekly basis and still manage to turn compelling, fun and quirky stories in the pages of the alt-weekly that drew more buzz (even in my own newsroom!) than the straight news stuff I was churning out daily. The RTD had the good sense to bring him aboard a few years later, and I asked him to join the Mercury because he was (and remains) an extremely talented and creative journalist who often had a different eye on the news than mine. Plus he could also take photos and we had no budget for a staff photographer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But he wasn’t the first person I contacted. That was another RTD reporter, Katie O’Connor, who sat one cubicle away from me and was doing a stellar job covering the failings of Virginia’s health care and social services systems. Her work fit my vision for the Mercury to a T. I reckoned that despite the erosion of the Capitol press corps, there were still lots of people covering the day-to-day misadventures of the governor’s office and the legislature. What was lacking were the longer-form, explanatory stories about the deeply entrenched problems in state government, like her story on the perpetual legislative battles over </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/01/08/the-story-behind-the-certificate-of-need-what-it-is-why-it-exists-and-why-it-has-been-a-thorn-in-virginias-side-for-decades/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">medical facility COPN</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">s, which, call me crazy, epitomized what I wanted the Mercury to be.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the third job we did cast a wider net. After reaching out to people in Virginia press circles, I was put in touch with Mechelle Hankerson, an up-and-coming reporter at the Virginian-Pilot who had graduated from Virginia Commonwealth University a few years earlier. She brought a fresh take to our capitol coverage, helped make our little newsroom in the Iron-Front Building on East Main Street a fun place to be and was crucial in finding our footing covering state education issues like teacher pay,</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/08/26/decades-after-brown-decision-virginia-is-still-grappling-with-school-segregation/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> school segregation </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">and history instruction. Her coverage of the </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/07/30/bigfoots-like-sex-too-what-congressional-candidate-denver-riggleman-wrote-about-sasquatch/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">great Bigfoot erotica debate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the 5th Congressional District race in 2018 will always have a place in my irreverent newsman’s heart. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About that furniture: The office came with matching desks that I bought from the previous tenant at a steep discount (Ned never forgave me for them). I was able to score a few other pieces free from the vast furniture graveyard in the basement of the building. But my new news team would not brook cheap desk chairs. Fine, I thought. How much could adjustable office chairs cost? A lot, it turned out. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being on a budget, that sent us on a quest that ended with a group excursion to a vast used office furniture place in South Richmond that looked like it might also house some long-forgotten bodies. But they had a set of chairs that were almost new, (barely) affordable and, more importantly, up to Ned’s exacting standards. It was a fun little adventure and, I think, when we first really started to come together as a team. I went along with similar bouts of what may seem excessive egalitarianism in our office supply choices (even a coat rack purchase came via committee) and coverage debates because I wanted the staff to be really personally invested in the Mercury and doing work they thought was important. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">None of the original Mercury cast, </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/07/25/leaving-virginia-again/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">including me</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, remain. They all won awards for their work though, including some of Virginia journalism’s top honors, and have gone on to great new things, as you should hope your employees will if they have to leave. The new crew, led by Sarah Vogelsong — who was brought on as a freelancer in the early days before we were able to hire her full time — are still knocking them dead on a daily basis.</span><b> </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We laughed. We argued. We experimented, not always successfully, as we sought to find our tone, niche and audience over my four years with the Mercury. It was the time of my life, and I’m grateful to everyone who toiled for us, read us, donated to us and helped us contribute something new to Virginia journalism. </span></p>

<p>Though they only make up a fraction of cars and trucks on the road now, many projections — from <a href="https://www.goldmansachs.com/intelligence/pages/electric-vehicles-are-forecast-to-be-half-of-global-car-sales-by-2035.html" target="_blank">Wall Street firms</a>, trade groups and<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/30/auto-executives-say-more-than-half-of-us-car-sales-will-be-evs-by-2030-kpmg-survey-shows.html" target="_blank"> automakers themselves</a> — predict an imminent surge in electric vehicles over the next decade.</p>
<p>S&amp;P Global <a href="https://www.spglobal.com/mobility/en/research-analysis/ev-chargers-how-many-do-we-need.html" target="_blank">estimates</a> that the nearly 2 million electric vehicles on U.S. roads today will grow to more than 28 million by 2030, when they’ll comprise 40% of all new cars and trucks sold.</p>
<p>The Edison Electric Institute, which represents investor-owned electric utilities, <a href="https://www.eei.org/en/news/news/all/eei-projects-26-million-electric-vehicles-will-be-on-us-roads-in-2030" target="_blank">arrived at a similar forecast</a> last year, even before the passage of the federal Inflation Reduction Act, which contained <a href="https://afdc.energy.gov/laws/electric-vehicles-for-tax-credit" target="_blank">big incentives</a> to spur electric vehicle adoption.</p>
<p>That means tens of thousands of additional public charging stations will be needed to be built across the country.</p>
<p>But there’s a big debate taking place at state capitols across the country about who should take the lead role in building them — electric utilities or private businesses?</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘That’s what retailers are there for’</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The Charge Ahead Partnership, composed of big fuel retailers, grocery chains, convenience stores, gas stations and other businesses exploring installing vehicle chargers, argues that private businesses, particularly those that have been selling fuel to motorists for years and are already located in optimal spots to serve drivers, are best suited to making the switch to electric chargers. And they say they’ll have a tough time competing with monopoly electric utilities who can build charging infrastructure on the back of their ratepayers.</p>
<p>“The utilities are actively laying the groundwork to extend their monopoly into this new business field,” said Ryan McKinnon, a spokesman for the partnership. “If you’re going to be driving an EV you’re going to want a reliable network of charging stations. … You really want entities to provide this that are good at selling things to people. That’s what retailers are there for.”</p>
<p>McKinnon pointed to recent legislation in <a href="https://www.oklahoman.com/story/news/politics/government/2023/06/07/oklahoma-legislature-governor-kevin-stitt-signs-electric-vehicle-charging-stations-bill/70293676007/" target="_blank">Oklahoma</a>, <a href="https://georgiarecorder.com/brief/georgia-lawmakers-send-new-electric-vehicle-charging-tax-plan-to-governor/" target="_blank">Georgia</a> and<a href="https://www.fox26houston.com/news/new-bill-to-ensure-texas-has-a-free-market-for-electric-vehicle-ev-charging" target="_blank"> Texas </a>that imposes limits on utilities using ratepayer money for charging networks. In Georgia, for example, <a href="https://legiscan.com/GA/text/SB146/id/2762604" target="_blank">legislation</a> passed this year restricts utility ownership of charging stations to a single program that allows the dominant electric utility in the state, Georgia Power, to provide chargers in remote and rural areas, with private retailers offered a right of first refusal.</p>
<p>“This will ensure ratepayer funds only subsidize EV charging operations in areas where private industry cannot operate,” the Charge Ahead Partnership said <a href="https://www.chargeaheadpartnership.com/sites/default/files/2023-05/CAP%20press%20release%20on%20Georgia%20EV%20Charging%20Legislation.pdf" target="_blank">in a news release</a> last month.</p>
<p>But other states, like <a href="https://minnesotareformer.com/2022/09/28/gas-station-owners-charging-companies-oppose-xcel-energys-electric-vehicle-charging-plan/" target="_blank">Minnesota</a> and <a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/xcel-energy-electric-vehicle-fast-charging-stations-battery-storage-colorado/651237/" target="_blank">Colorado</a>, have taken or are considering steps in the other direction. Proposed budget language that would allow utilities to bill ratepayers for electric vehicle charging infrastructure has also come <a href="https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2023/04/28/manufacturers-consumers-blast-plan-to-make-ratepayers-subsidize-charging-stations/" target="_blank">under fire in Ohio</a>.</p>
<p>And in Florida, the nation’s largest utility, Florida Power &amp; Light, is <a href="https://www.marketplace.org/2022/08/10/florida-builds-more-charging-stations-encourage-electric-vehicle-adoption/" target="_blank">building hundreds of chargers</a> over the objection of critics like former Jacksonville Mayor John Peyton, president of GATE Petroleum, which owns gas stations and convenience stores in Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas. Peyton argued in a <a href="https://www.jacksonville.com/story/opinion/columns/guest/2023/04/09/state-must-level-the-playing-field-for-owners-of-ev-charging-networks/70077416007/" target="_blank">Florida Times-Union column</a> that “no private business would sink $100,000 or more to install EV chargers with the knowledge that some of the state’s most powerful monopolies can undercut them, using your ratepayer funds.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">An ‘all-of-the-above approach’ </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Some proponents argue, however, that there could be a place for utility-owned charging, since electric vehicles have long posed a chicken-and-egg problem. Mass adoption isn’t likely until drivers are comfortable they can always find a charger. And companies aren’t likely to build chargers until there’s a critical mass of electric vehicles to help them recoup their investment plus a profit.</p>
<p>Katherine Stainken, vice president of policy at the Electrification Coalition, a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization pushing for the widespread adoption of electric vehicles, said there’s too much variation across states and markets to foreclose options like utility ownership. She characterized the debate over who should own charging networks as the “growing pains” of a nascent industry.</p>
<p>“We support kind of an all-of-the-above approach,” she said. “There’s a lot of different factors here.”</p>
<p>Stainken added that for-profit companies might not be able to meet the needs of, for example, low-income apartment complexes, or instances in which no host comes forward to site a charging station through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program, which is making <a href="https://sourcenm.com/2022/11/14/amid-a-major-federal-investment-in-electric-cars-its-time-for-states-to-step-up-advocates-say/" target="_blank">billions of federal dollars</a> available to states to boost charging infrastructure.</p>

<p>“If there are some areas where there is no site host coming forward, and the utility is the only one … I don’t think we would want to say ‘Forget it,’” she said.</p>
<p>The Edison Electric Institute likewise said the coming surge in electric vehicles requires an “all-hands-on-deck approach.”</p>
<p>“No one is preventing private-sector stakeholders from investing in EV charging today, and the idea that some stakeholders are trying to prevent electric companies from building EV charging infrastructure is senseless,” said Kellen Schefter, the institute’s senior director of electric transportation. “Electric companies are well-positioned to make targeted and strategic investments in EV charging infrastructure that will benefit the broader community and accelerate EV adoption. America’s electric companies have proven expertise and decades of experience in deploying and maintaining electric infrastructure that is safe, affordable and reliable.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Charging on demand</h4>

<p>Beyond who builds and owns the chargers, however, there are other thorny issues to untangle.</p>
<p>One of the most pressing, according to Angela Holland, president of the Georgia Association of Convenience Stores, which supported the new Georgia law limiting utility ownership of chargers, is how much private businesses who install chargers pay for electricity.</p>
<p>“One of the other things we’ve asked is for our utility friends to come up with an EV charging rate,” Holland said. “You can’t go to market with a product and not know whether or not you’re going to make money on it.”</p>
<p>In neighboring Alabama, Alabama Power, which like Georgia Power is part of Southern Company, offers <a href="https://afdc.energy.gov/laws/12642" target="_blank">a special rate</a> for commercial and industrial customers for public electric vehicle charging stations. Electric usage for charging is metered separately from other uses at the location.</p>
<p>That’s crucial because in many utility billing frameworks, commercial and industrial customers often pay a <a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/t-d/pubs/htmlpubs/htm00712373/index.htm#:~:text=Demand%20charges%20represent%20the%20high,usually%2015%20or%2030%20minutes." target="_blank">demand charge</a> based on the maximum amount of electricity they use at one time, usually measured as an interval of 15 or 30 minutes. The charge is meant to compensate an electric company for maintaining the generation and transmission capacity to meet that peak demand, even though it won’t be used all the time.</p>
<p>“Demand charges are intended to help (electric service providers) keep power systems appropriately sized, efficient and more affordable for all consumers,” says a<a href="https://www.naseo.org/data/sites/1/documents/publications/Demand%20Charges%20and%20EV%20Charging%20-%20Final.pdf" target="_blank"> 2021 report </a>spearheaded by the National Association of State Energy Officials that looked at demand charges and electric vehicle charging in Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming.</p>
<p>Electric vehicle charging infrastructure, though, “has relatively unique power demands, with high power capacity required for fast charging, but relatively small amounts of energy consumed per charge,” the report said, noting that demand charges “are one element that may prevent (direct current fast-charging) station hosts from earning a profit from EV charging services.”</p>
<p>The town of Derry, New Hampshire, <a href="https://www.eagletribune.com/news/new_hampshire/derry-pulls-plug-on-electric-car-charging-stations/article_637c090e-fc94-563e-bb31-9a4844686a1a.html" target="_blank">pulled the plug</a> on its four free municipal parking lot electric charging stations in 2021 after its utility instituted demand charges and caused the price to spike, <a href="https://www.puc.nh.gov/Regulatory/Docketbk/2020/20-170/MOTIONS-OBJECTIONS/20-170_2021-05-21_DERRY_PETITION_INTERVENTION.PDF" target="_blank">officials wrote</a> to the state utilities commission.</p>
<p>McKinnon, the Charge Ahead Partnership spokesman, gave the example of a business that installs a 150 kilowatt charger with four ports, the minimum standard for the federal government’s NEVI program.</p>
<p>“You’re not going to have a ton of usage immediately. But as soon as one person uses it they are probably going to set the new peak usage for the month,” he said. “We’re not advocating for any specific rate. … We’re just saying let’s pick a fair rate.” Low usage and big demand charges, he added, “kills the financial incentive” for businesses to install chargers.</p>

(Sarah Vogelsong/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Obama administration’s 2015 Clean Power Plan — intended to cut carbon emissions from power plants — was </span><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/20-1530_n758.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">struck down</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the U.S. Supreme Court. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Trump administration’s much-criticized replacement, the </span><a href="https://www.epa.gov/stationary-sources-air-pollution/affordable-clean-energy-rule" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Affordable Clean Energy rule</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, derided as a “</span><a href="https://statepowerproject.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/american-lung-assn-v.-epa-dc-cir.-no.-19-1140-per-curiam-decision.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tortured series of misreadings</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” of the U.S. Clean Air Act, was also tossed by a federal court.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the Biden administration’s Environmental Protection Agency is back at bat with a </span><a href="https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-proposes-new-carbon-pollution-standards-fossil-fuel-fired-power-plants-tackle" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">new proposed rule</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to regulate fossil fuel power plant carbon dioxide, which is responsible for about </span><a href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a quarter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">EPA says its new rule, released Thursday, is based on “cost-effective and available control technologies” and will avoid as much as 617 million metric tons of CO2 emissions through 2042, the equivalent of reducing the annual emissions of 137 million passenger vehicles. The agency claims it will also prevent hundreds of premature deaths and hospital visits and thousands of asthma attacks, and relieve the burden of </span><a href="https://www.epa.gov/power-sector/power-plants-and-neighboring-communities" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">environmental justice communities disproportionately afflicted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by power plant pollution. In 2022 alone, the electric power sector accounted for about </span><a href="https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=77&amp;t=11#:~:text=How%20much%20of%20U.S.%20carbon,of%20about%204%2C964%20(MMmt)." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1.5 billion metric tons </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">of CO2 emissions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rule strengthens standards for new fossil fuel plants (mostly natural gas) and establishes emissions guidelines for states to follow in limiting carbon pollution from existing fossil fuel plants, which can be coal, gas or oil-fired.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“EPA’s proposal relies on proven, readily available technologies to limit carbon pollution and seizes the momentum already underway in the power sector to move toward a cleaner future,” EPA Administrator Michael Regan said in a statement. “Alongside historic investment taking place across America in clean energy manufacturing and deployment, these proposals will help deliver tremendous benefits to the American people — cutting climate pollution and other harmful pollutants, protecting people’s health and driving American innovation.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, some power plant operators warn it could imperil electric reliability by accelerating power plant closures before enough cleaner resources are ready. And some environmentalists say technologies the rule cites — </span><a href="https://www.iea.org/fuels-and-technologies/carbon-capture-utilisation-and-storage" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">carbon capture and storage</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and co-firing natural gas plants with clean burning </span><a href="https://missouriindependent.com/2022/10/24/states-are-vying-for-money-to-start-hydrogen-hubs-what-are-they/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hydrogen</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — are far from proven at the scale that will be required.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Others say the </span><a href="https://www.nrdc.org/bio/lissa-lynch/epa-tackles-power-plants-carbon-pollution" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rule could be improved</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by setting lower thresholds for applicability (as proposed it only applies to the largest and most frequently used gas plants).</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Reliability and sustainability </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Electric Power Supply Association, a trade group that represents competitive power generators, warned that the rule could intensify potential future electric reliability challenges. Indeed, </span><a href="https://www.energy.senate.gov/services/files/1D618EDD-7CED-4BC5-8F09-C8F0668FE608" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">some regulators</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> fear that the increasing pace of power plant retirements, combined with increasing electrification in transportation and other sectors and the difficulty of getting new, primarily renewable resources </span><a href="https://newjerseymonitor.com/2023/02/16/across-the-country-a-big-backlash-to-new-renewables-is-mounting/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sited</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and connected to the grid, could </span><a href="https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2023/03/16/the-nations-biggest-electric-capacity-market-needs-fixing-critics-say/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">create shortfalls</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in electric supply in the near future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Once again, aspirational policy is getting ahead of operational reality,” EPSA President and CEO Todd Snitchler said in a statement. ”If finalized, these aggressive rules will undoubtedly drive up energy costs and lead to a substantial number of power plant retirements when experts have warned that we are already facing a reliability crisis due to accelerated retirements of dispatchable resources.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Edison Electric Institute, which represents investor-owned electric utilities that provide electric service to more than 235 million people in all 50 states, was more measured. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Just as we do with any rulemaking, we will assess EPA’s proposed new regulations through the lens of whether they align with our priorities and support our ability to provide customers with the reliable clean energy they need at an affordable cost,” Edison CEO Tom Kuhn said. Kuhn said carbon emissions from the power sector are as low as they were in 1984 despite electric use climbing 73% over the past four decades.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Priorities for electric companies in the final rule, expected to go into effect sometime next year, are for compliance deadlines to align with “existing transition plans” and “recognition of the critical role existing and new natural gas generation plays,” Kuhn said. The utility industry also wants “a range of compliance flexibilities” that include hydrogen and carbon capture and storage “when they are commercially available at scale and cost.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several environmental and renewable energy industry groups celebrated the proposed rule.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Power plants have been allowed to pump deadly carbon dioxide pollution into the air we breathe, threatening our communities and our future, with nearly no federal limits – until now. Today’s proposal marks a significant step forward, and we’re pleased to see the Biden administration continue to address climate pollution in a serious way,” said Ben Jealous, executive director of the Sierra Club.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The American Council on Renewable Energy called it “an important step forward” that comes as the threat posed by climate change becomes increasingly severe. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is clear that we need a regulatory framework for reducing carbon emissions to complement the helpful incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act if we are to achieve our climate targets,” ACORE said.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘Putting forward their very best foot’</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But can the rule survive another expected legal challenge?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Patrick Morrisey, the Republican attorney general of West Virginia who </span><a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/securities-law/west-virginia-ag-seizes-on-esg-wars-with-eye-on-higher-office" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sued the EPA over the Obama-era Clean Power Plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, was quick to challenge the legitimacy of the new proposed rule. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Based upon what we currently know about this proposal, it is not going to be upheld, and it just seems designed to scare more coal-fired power plants into retirement — the goal of the Biden administration,” Morrisey said in a </span><a href="https://mailchi.mp/c6d86e4bb8c5/wva-ag-issues-statement-following-epa-release-of-proposed-rule-on-power-plants" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">statement Thursday</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “That tactic is unacceptable, and this rule appears to utterly fly in the face of the rule of law. The U.S. Supreme Court has placed significant limits on what the EPA can do — we plan on ensuring that those limits are upheld, and we expect that we would once again prevail in court against this out-of-control agency.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Julie McNamara, a deputy policy director at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said the legal issue has never been whether EPA has the authority to regulate carbon emissions but rather how that power is exercised. With the Clean Power Plan, the Supreme Court </span><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/20-1530_n758.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ruled</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the agency overreached, finding that it </span><a href="https://www.nrdc.org/stories/supreme-courts-epa-ruling-explained?gclid=Cj0KCQjwpPKiBhDvARIsACn-gzAui_XwW5EnvbN1_timn5zJl1-ZLTBp67r5SKqWvMXj7-Od_9ChzfQaAjnlEALw_wcB" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">could not direct power plants</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to shift from fossil fuels to cleaner sources like wind and solar. Rather, it held the EPA could set emissions limits by determining the “best system of emission reduction” for existing sources at that facility, but could not force a change in generation source. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new rule, she said, is more narrowly focused and tailored to the confines of the Supreme Court ruling.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“EPA has been incredibly thoughtful about this and are putting forward their very best foot to try to have a defensible rule,” McNamara said. “It’s a certainty these will go to the courts but it&#8217;s not a certainty that the courts will take it up.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McNamara said that when the rule becomes finalized next year, it will be up to states to submit plans for compliance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s up to the states to say what is the most cost effective and forward looking approach to achieving these emissions reductions,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brian Murray, director of Duke University’s Nicholas Institute for Energy, Environment and Sustainability, said the rule builds on the array of clean energy incentives in last year’s </span><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/cleanenergy/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inflation Reduction Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Putting a regulation on top of that means that the regulation itself is more economically achievable because of the subsidies,” he said. “The IRA is doing a lot of the heavy lifting for the reductions that are being sought by the administration.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joining with many states’, utilities’ and corporations’ own decarbonization goals, the rule adds a lot of momentum that might be tough to derail.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You take all these together and everything is walking in the same direction,” Murray said. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Carbon capture questions</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wenonah Hauter, executive director of Food &amp; Water Watch, a nonprofit focused on environmental activism, </span><a href="https://www.foodandwaterwatch.org/2023/05/11/epas-carbon-capture-rules-wont-work/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">called carbon capture</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “a fossil fuel industry propaganda scheme” that’s wasted billions of dollars and produced “a series of spectacular failures.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An </span><a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R44902" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">October report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the Congressional Research Service said the U.S. Department of Energy has funded carbon capture research and development since “at least 1997” and that Congress has provided $9.2 billion since 2010 in annual appropriations for the DOE&#8217;s Fossil Energy and Carbon Management Research, Development, Demonstration, and Deployment program. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2021 </span><a href="https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2021-12/FECM%20Infrastructure%20Factsheet.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bipartisan infrastructure law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> included billions more for carbon capture facilities. Most existing carbon capture projects use the CO2 to enhance oil production in aging oil wells. The first and only U.S. power plant capturing carbon in large quantities was the </span><a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/biggest-ccs-failure-clouds-supreme-court-ruling/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Petra Nova project </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">in Texas, though carbon capture was suspended in 2020, the report says.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There is broad agreement that costs for constructing and operating (carbon capture and storage) would need to decrease before the technologies could be widely deployed. In the view of many proponents, greater CCS deployment is fundamental to reduce CO2 emissions,” the report says. “In contrast, some stakeholders do not support CCS as a mitigation option, citing concerns with continued fossil fuel combustion and the uncertainties of long-term underground CO2 storage.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andres Restrepo, a senior attorney with the Sierra Club, said the expansion of fossil fuel plants is “incompatible with a livable future” but noted that because of the Supreme Court’s ruling in the West Virginia v. EPA case, blending natural gas with hydrogen for power production and carbon capture “form the basis for the strongest possible standards that the EPA can legally propose.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The EPA’s own projections show that many more power plants are likely to retire rather than install carbon capture, he added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We also believe the standards are likely to help deter some of the expected build-out of new gas plants in the first place,” Restrepo said. “Therefore, these standards are much more likely to reduce climate emissions and improve public health than simply maintaining the status quo.&#8221;</span></p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than a dozen environmental groups are suing the federal Environmental Protection Agency over its failure to set water pollution limits for some industrial contaminants as well as its reluctance to update decades-old standards for others, arguing that the agency’s inaction amounts to a “free pass to pollute” for hundreds of chemical and fertilizer plants, oil refineries, plastics manufacturers and other industrial facilities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s completely unacceptable that EPA has, for decades, ignored the law and failed to require modern wastewater pollution controls for oil refineries and petrochemical and plastics plants,” said Jen Duggan, deputy director of the Environmental Integrity Project, a nonprofit focused on environmental law enforcement that coordinated the lawsuit by 13 environmental groups.  “We expect EPA to do its job and protect America’s waterways and public health as required by the Clean Water Act.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The EPA did not immediately comment on the lawsuit. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://environmentalintegrity.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Lawsuit-over-petrochemical-water-pollution-4.11.23.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lawsuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, filed April 11, centers on the </span><a href="https://www.epa.gov/laws-regulations/summary-clean-water-act" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clean Water Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the landmark Nixon-era legislation that regulated the discharge of pollutants into waters of the United States. In a </span><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aDLg0OAmpvtUCTj_PEKxqq04_JuuxWrN/view?usp=share_link" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">letter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the agency advising that the lawsuit was being filed, the Environmental Integrity Project noted that the act requires EPA to establish pollution limits based on the best available treatment methods and then review the limits yearly and every five years “to keep pace with advances in technologies to reduce — and ultimately eliminate — water pollution from industrial sources.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, for 40 of the 59 industries subject to the pollution limits, the standards were “last updated 30 or more years ago, and 17 of those date back to the 1970s,” the EIP says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These point-source categories are large sources of water pollution, dumping billions of gallons of wastewater into our rivers, streams and lakes each year,” the group said, noting that EPA standards in many cases “do not limit discharges of nutrient pollution or toxics like benzene, mercury, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), selenium, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), and heavy metals.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The suit alleges that the EPA’s decision not to update the regulations is “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion or otherwise not in accordance with law” under the federal Administrative Procedure Act.</span></p>

<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">By the numbers </h4>

	</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Organic chemical and plastics plants</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>:</strong> An estimated 609 facilities across the U.S. make plastic resins, synthetic fibers like polyester and rayon, and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), among other chemicals and “discharge millions of pounds of pollution per year, including benzene, nitrogen and lead,” the EIP said. Plus, plastic pellets called “</span><a href="https://carnegiemnh.org/whats-a-nurdle/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">nurdles</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” also escape in stormwater or wastewater. Guidelines haven’t been updated since 1993.</span>&nbsp;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Plastics molding and forming</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>:</strong> There are about 120 such plants that discharge into U.S. waterways, but EPA has not revised technology-based effluent limits for the sector since 1984. Pollution includes phthalates, PFAS, nitrogen, </span><a href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2016-09/documents/n-n-dimethylformamide.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">N-N-Dimethylformamide</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and microplastics.</span>&nbsp;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Fertilizer: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Per EPA estimates, 59 chemical fertilizer plants discharged nearly 90 million pounds of pollution into waterways in 2019. Pollutants include nitrogen, selenium, chromium, zinc, iron, nickel, cadmium, cyanide and lead. Guidelines have not been updated since 1986.</span>&nbsp;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Nonferrous metals:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Manufacturing of metals not including iron and steel contributed 100 million pounds of pollution in 2019, per EPA estimates. Control guidelines have not been updated since 1990.</span>&nbsp;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Inorganic chemicals:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> These facilities are some of the largest industrial sources of toxic pollution in the U.S., the EIP says. Nearly 230 plants dumped about 2 billion pounds of pollution into American waterways in 2019. EPA limits have not been updated since 1984.</span></span>&nbsp;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Pesticides</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: There are 31 plants discharging pollutants, including benzene, cyanide, nitrogen and the ingredients that actually kill insects. Guidelines have not been updated since 1998. </span></li>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About half of all the river and stream miles and lake acreage in the U.S. fail to meet water quality standards because of pollution, “which means half the country’s assessed waterways do not support intended uses like aquatic life and drinking water,&#8221; the EIP says. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Duggan said if the EPA required, for example, the modern treatment controls that are standard for municipal sewage plants that discharge into the Chesapeake Bay — like denitrification, which removes nitrates and nitrite compounds that can lead to</span> <a href="https://www.epa.gov/nutrientpollution/issue#:~:text=Too%20much%20nitrogen%20and%20phosphorus%20in%20the%20water%20causes%20algae,aquatic%20life%20need%20to%20survive." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">large algal blooms</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — water pollution could be cut significantly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eighty-one oil refineries across the U.S. discharged nearly 16 million pounds of nitrogen pollution into streams, rivers, lakes and bays in 2021, the group says. Carbon and mechanical filtration technologies could also be used to remove heavy metals like lead, arsenic, selenium and PFAS, the “forever chemicals” that </span><a href="https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/pfas/health-effects/index.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have been linked</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to potential increased cancer risk and a host of other health problems. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“EPA simply cannot fulfill its mandate of setting increasingly protective, technology-based pollution limits for these and other industrial categories if EPA does not regularly review whether existing limits reflect best available technology and other recent technology,” the EIP wrote in its letter. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tightening restrictions would affect about 1,185 plants across seven industrial categories, the EIP said. Some of the biggest polluters are oil refineries and ammonia nitrogen fertilizer plants, many of them concentrated along the Gulf Coast. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But during a news conference announcing the lawsuit, representatives from environmental groups said the problem stretches from the slew of chemical plants and refineries along the banks of the Mississippi River (dubbed </span><a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/welcome-to-cancer-alley-where-toxic-air-is-about-to-get-worse" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Cancer Alley</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">”) in southern Louisiana to Newark, New Jersey’s </span><a href="https://www.njpbs.org/blog-post/toxic-new-jersey-ironbound-area/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“chemical corridor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” to the shores of Lake Michigan and to the San Francisco Bay, with many others in between. They noted that pollution tends to fall heaviest on poor and minority communities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For decades the EPA has let these dirty industries pollute our rivers and bays instead of making them keep pace with advances in technologies that tackle water pollution, as the Clean Water Act demands,” said Hannah Connor, the environmental health deputy director at the Center for Biological Diversity, a nonprofit focused on protecting endangered species. “Forcing people and wildlife like endangered Atlantic sturgeon to bear the weight of toxic water pollution while industries rake in record profits isn’t just morally wrong, it’s also legally indefensible. EPA needs to bring pollution standards into the 21st century.”</span></p>

(Bruce Bennett / Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. offshore wind power industry is in its infancy, with just a handful of turbines installed along the Atlantic coast.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But they’re already being blamed for the deaths of whales that have washed up on beaches in New Jersey, New York, Virginia and elsewhere. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Fox News story </span><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/third-dead-whale-found-miles-offshore-wind-farm" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">on Feb. 13</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> made strenuous attempts to link a dead right whale to Dominion Energy’s Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project, which currently consists of two small test turbines about 27 miles off the coast of Virginia Beach. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was among a string of </span><a href="https://time.com/6254785/whale-deaths-offshore-wind-power/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">articles</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from </span><a href="https://www.capecodtimes.com/story/news/environment/2023/02/18/whale-deaths-and-offshore-wind-power-disinformation-explained/69914732007/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">local</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and national outlets on wind development and dead whales over the past several months that also saw a call for an offshore wind moratorium by </span><a href="https://whyy.org/articles/new-jersey-mayors-moratorium-offshore-wind-activity-whale-deaths/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">30 mayors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of coastal New Jersey towns. The backlash comes as states and the federal government increasingly set aggressive offshore wind energy targets and as the industry tries to </span><a href="https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2023/01/28/offshore-wind-will-need-major-investments-in-transmission-supply-chain-reports-say/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">develop supply chains and solve transmission problems</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, according to several federal agencies and scientists, there’s no connection between offshore wind development and what the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration calls an “</span><a href="https://noaa.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=f9eef8e52fc84144b1bfc84e931ba54c" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">unusual mortality event</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” that’s been afflicting whales up and down the East Coast, from Maine to Florida, since 2016, before the vast majority of Atlantic coast wind development began. At the time, the only U.S. wind project in operation was the five-turbine </span><a href="https://us.orsted.com/renewable-energy-solutions/offshore-wind/block-island-wind-farm" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Block Island Wind Farm</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> off the coast of Rhode Island. As of 2022, though, </span><a href="https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2022-09/offshore-wind-market-report-2022-v2.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">at least 20 projects</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> were in various stages of development </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“At this point, there is no evidence to support speculation that noise resulting from wind development-related site characterization surveys could potentially cause mortality of whales, and no specific links between recent large whale mortalities and currently ongoing surveys,” NOAA said in </span><a href="https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/new-england-mid-atlantic/marine-life-distress/frequent-questions-offshore-wind-and-whales" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a statement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We will continue to gather data to help us determine the cause of death for these mortality events. We will also continue to explore how sound, vessel and other human activities in the marine environment impact whales and other marine mammals.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, the Marine Mammal Commission, an independent federal agency tasked with protecting whales, dolphins and other marine mammals by overseeing science, policy and management actions, said there had been 16 humpback whale strandings this winter, noting that 10 or more humpback whales have been stranded every year since 2016, with a high of 34 in 2017. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Despite several reports in the media, there is no evidence to link these strandings to offshore wind energy development,” the </span><a href="https://www.mmc.gov/wp-content/uploads/Update-on-Strandings-of-Large-Whales-along-the-East-Coast-2.21.2023.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">commission said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andy Read, a marine biology professor at Duke University and a member of the Marine Mammal Commission, said the biggest threat to humpback and severely endangered North Atlantic right whales, of which fewer than 350 remain in existence, are ships and fishing gear. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t see offshore wind as a particularly acute threat at this time,” he said, noting that about 40% of dead whales show evidence of being hit by a ship or getting tangled in fishing gear. “We know what the big threats to large whales are in the coastal areas of the Atlantic. … They’re ship strikes and entanglement in fishing gear and we shouldn’t lose our focus on those two big threats.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Read said that in the case of humpback whales, a combination of growing numbers and cleaner waters means they’re </span><a href="https://www.ny1.com/nyc/brooklyn/human-interest/2022/09/30/whale-population-rapidly-growing-off-brooklyn-coast" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">coming back to areas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> previously abandoned because of pollution and the ravages of the whaling industry.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are seeing more whales in places we didn’t see them before,” he said. “That’s a function of populations growing.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He added that younger whales often prefer to stay in the busy ship lanes of the mid-Atlantic during the winter, comparing them to kids playing on a highway.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Younger animals feed in the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay where they’re really vulnerable to ship strikes,” he said.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, which oversees ocean energy extraction and manages federal offshore wind leases, requires that wind survey vessels, which use acoustic equipment to map the ocean floor, establish “exclusion zones” around the ships, meaning they must be clear of marine mammals or sea turtles for a length of time before the gear can be used. It also requires ships to use independent observers to watch for whales and other marine mammals to minimize the risk of a collision. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And BOEM says the technology used in the offshore wind industry’s </span><a href="https://www.boem.gov/sites/default/files/renewable-energy-program/Day-1-High-Resolution-Geophysical-Surveys.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">high-resolution geophysical surveys</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is much less powerful than the seismic airguns that have been employed for decades by offshore companies to look for oil and gas deposits beneath the seafloor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Overall, the sound sources used here are generally expected to be much lower in impact than seismic air guns,” said Erica Staaterman, a bioacoustician at BOEM’s Center for Marine Acoustics, during a </span><a href="https://www.noaa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-01/Transcript-011823-NOAA-Fisheries-Media-Teleconference-East-Coast-whale-strandings-508.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">press call in January</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “There’s no evidence that any of these sound sources used in HRG surveys are attributed to any of these kind of impacts to baleen whales.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The American Clean Power Association, a trade group of renewable energy companies, said offshore wind work at the moment amounts to a tiny sliver of the vessel traffic along the busy ports of the East Coast. The association blamed “groups opposed to clean energy projects” for spreading “baseless information that has been debunked by scientists and experts.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed, </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/28/nyregion/east-coast-whale-deaths.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">news outlets</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have linked some of the </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/02/25/1159025632/dead-whales-east-coast-misinformation-offshore-wind" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">organizations clamoring</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to halt wind development for the whales’ sake to </span><a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/trump-adviser-involved-in-vineyard-wind-opposition/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">conservative opponents</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of renewable energy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s unfortunate that so much misinformation is obscuring the facts of what’s really happening off the shores of the East Coast. We have always worked alongside the environmental community to protect marine life and follow rigorous standards when developing projects,” the association said in a statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for the right whale that washed up in Virginia, a necropsy that came out just two days after the Fox article </span><a href="https://www.wavy.com/news/local-news/virginia-beach/north-atlantic-right-whale-necropsy-reveals-cause-of-death/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">revealed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the whale appeared to have died of a vessel strike. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While these whale deaths are tragic, they are not related to Dominion Energy’s Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind activities,” said Jeremy Slayton, a company spokesman. “There are currently only three offshore wind vessels operating off Virginia’s coast and they were in port between Feb. 6 and Feb. 13.”</span></p>

(Robert Zullo / States Newsroom)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BUCYRUS, Ohio — In four terms as a county elected official in northern Ohio, it was the most contentious issue Doug Weisenauer had ever seen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state legislature had </span><a href="https://farmoffice.osu.edu/blog-tags/senate-bill-52" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">newly empowered</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> county governments to drastically restrict wind and solar power development, a process formerly overseen by the Ohio Power Siting Board, and the meetings of the three-member governing body for Crawford County (population 41,754) suddenly started becoming a lot more animated. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As soon as Senate Bill 52 passed, the anti-wind people, they started converging on our weekly commissioners’ meetings and demanding that we do something,” said Weisenauer, a Republican, like the other two members of Crawford County Commission. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apex Clean Energy, a Virginia company, had been signing leases with locals for a proposed 300-megawatt wind farm, called </span><a href="https://www.honeycreekwindpower.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Honey Creek</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but Weisenauer was skeptical it would ever get built, saying in an interview he’d seen more than half a dozen would-be wind projects come and go. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, the commissioners voted 2-1 last year, with Weisenauer the lone no vote, for a 10-year ban on wind development. The commission’s decision was </span><a href="https://crawfordcountyohioboe.gov/wp-content/uploads/Official-Summary-Report-11-8-2022.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">overwhelmingly</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> upheld by county voters in a referendum last fall. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I said all along I am not telling people what they can and can’t do on their property,” Weisenauer said. “It got ugly. Our families have been split, friendships broken. It was bad for our community.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crawford County, of course, is far from an isolated case. Across the country — from </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/02/25/virginias-biggest-proposed-solar-project-is-also-among-the-most-contentious-local-land-use-fights/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">suburban Virginia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.mlive.com/public-interest/2022/11/voters-defeat-michigan-wind-energy-project-toss-supportive-officials.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rural Michigan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.tullahomanews.com/news/local/franklin-county-gives-solar-the-cold-shoulder/article_f98f81d4-c594-11ec-9807-c74d371901d6.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">southern Tennessee</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the sugar cane fields of </span><a href="https://www.theadvocate.com/baton_rouge/news/environment/officials-in-rural-louisiana-grapple-with-going-solar-as-utilities-industry-drive-demand/article_5a4b55da-fee2-11ec-bcdd-d3d60294bc67.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Louisiana</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the coasts of </span><a href="https://www.maine.gov/governor/mills/news/governor-mills-signs-legislation-prohibiting-offshore-wind-projects-state-waters-2021-07-08" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maine</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.app.com/story/news/local/land-environment/2022/12/08/nj-offshore-wind-projects-face-pushback-hearings-planned-for-december/69708849007/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">New Jersey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the</span><a href="https://www.nevadacurrent.com/2020/11/30/moapa-valley-residents-fear-solar-plant-will-disrupt-access-andkill-tourism/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> deserts of Nevada</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — new renewable energy development has drawn heated opposition that has birthed, in many cases, bans, moratoriums and other </span><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/kentucky-counties-cities-increasingly-adopting-ordinances-regulate-solar-energy-projects" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">restrictions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With states, corporations, utilities and the federal government setting aggressive renewable energy goals, as well as </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/01/17/inflation-reduction-act-offers-big-incentives-for-tax-exempt-organizations-to-invest-in-renewable-energy/#:~:text=The%20IRA%2C%20which%20established%20tax,to%20monetize%20applicable%20tax%20credits." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">big tax incentives</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> such as in last year’s Inflation Reduction Act, wind and solar developers have been pushing projects that are igniting fierce battles over property rights, loss of farmland, climate change, aesthetics, the merits of renewable power and a host of other concerns. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And those debates are often happening in a miasma of misinformation and skewed by political polarization. However, some who have seen the backlash to renewable development up close and personal also say developers need to do a better job of being upfront with communities and convincing them of the benefits of their projects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ve seen it getting worse and worse over the past four years. There’s a huge level of distrust,” said Tony Zartman, a former Paulding County, Ohio, elected official who now works for the </span><a href="https://conservativeenergynetwork.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conservative Energy Network</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which promotes market-based policies at all levels of government to promote a clean energy transition. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘We’re seeing so much opposition’</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a report updated last year, the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia Law School </span><a href="https://scholarship.law.columbia.edu/sabin_climate_change/186/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">found</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that “in nearly every state, local governments have enacted policies to block or restrict renewable energy facilities and local opposition has resulted in the delay or cancellation of particular projects.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not including what it called “reasonable regulations,” the 2022 edition of the report found 121 local policies (up 17.5% from 2021) that block or restrict renewable energy and 204 contested renewable energy facilities (up 23.6%). </span></p>

<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Renewable siting debates in Virginia</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>In Virginia, local debates over renewables have centered on solar. The 2020 Virginia Clean Economy Act, a roadmap for decarbonizing the state&#8217;s electric grid by midcentury, calls for the state&#8217;s largest electric utilities to put forward plans for the development of over 16 gigawatts of solar and onshore wind energy by 2035. Wind development has centered on offshore plans by Dominion Energy, with only one major onshore project, Apex Clean Energy&#8217;s Rocky Forge project in Botetourt County, facing years of local resistance as it moves through the planning process.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This report demonstrates that ‘not in my backyard’ and other objections to renewable energy occur throughout the country and can delay or impede project development,” the report says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In August, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory </span><a href="https://www.nrel.gov/news/program/2022/nrel-releases-comprehensive-databases-of-local-ordinances-for-siting-wind-solar-energy-projects.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">released</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a pair of datasets on local wind and solar energy zoning laws and ordinances. There were nearly 2,000 wind energy ordinances and almost 1,000 for solar energy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The significant uncertainty created by difficulties in siting and permitting may make it more difficult for developers to sign contracts with buyers and/or obtain financing at a reasonable cost of capital,” said José Zayas, executive director of policy and programs at the American Council on Renewable Energy, a nonprofit pushing to transition the economy to renewable power.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">J.R. Tolbert, vice president of strategy and partnerships at Advanced Energy United, a trade association representing wind and solar developers, as well as energy efficiency, battery storage companies and other businesses, said local opposition is becoming a major obstacle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The siting issue in and of itself is an issue that is really important for us to address,” he said. “If we’re unable to site projects, then we’re unable to interconnect projects and we’re unable to deliver that energy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Decarbonizing the U.S. electric grid, which accounted for about a </span><a href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">quarter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of U.S. carbon emissions in 2020, not to mention the rest of the U.S. economy, will require vast new solar, wind and other resources, many experts agree. Doing so by 2035, the </span><a href="https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/biden-harris-administration-accelerate-reviews-clean-energy-proposals-public-lands" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden administration’s goal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, will require “rapid and sustained growth in installations of solar and wind generation capacity” that amounts to “more than four times the current annual deployment levels for each technology,” </span><a href="https://www.nrel.gov/news/program/2022/exploring-the-big-challenge-ahead-insights-on-the-path-to-a-net-zero-power-sector-by-2035.html#" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">per another report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in August by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My guess is that we’re going to need a lot of renewables built on public lands further west, just because we’re seeing so much opposition growing up, especially sort of the middle of the country that’s already very dense on wind,” said Rich Powell, CEO of</span><a href="https://clearpath.org/about-us/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Clear Path</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a nonprofit policy group working to curb carbon emissions, during a </span><a href="https://acore-org.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_Y7k2ZL1RQFKH0mgLYlC0Iw" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">panel discussion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the state of the electric grid since the deadly 2021 winter storm Uri.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘Many more peoples’ backyards’</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indiana is emblematic of some of those tensions. The state is simultaneously home to a solar project that’s one of the </span><a href="https://www.wndu.com/2022/11/04/largest-solar-farm-nation-headed-pulaski-county/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">nation’s largest</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220114005072/en/Indiana-Governor-Acknowledges-Doral-LLC%E2%80%99s-1.5-Billion-Mammoth-Solar-Project-During-the-2022-State-of-the-State-Address" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lauded</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb but also, increasingly, county regulations that restrict or outright prohibit wind and solar projects, per the </span><a href="https://www.indystar.com/story/news/environment/2022/03/01/indiana-solar-energy-wind-power-lawmakers-try-again-pass-statewide-standard-sb-411-senate-bill/6570555001/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indianapolis Star</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve got more than 120 renewable energy projects underway in Indiana,” said Dave Arland, a spokesman for </span><a href="https://www.hoosiersforrenewables.com/about" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hoosiers for Renewables</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “Some have faced opposition, and some have not. But obviously the trend — from our standpoint — is positive.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Part of the reason behind the growth in opposition is the nature of wind and solar power itself. Rather than a traditional coal, gas or nuclear power plant that might only be seen by a handful of neighbors, solar developments and wind turbines are more spread out and invite more NIMBY-style complaints.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Plenty of people don’t have a strong opinion about wind and solar in the abstract,” said Ben Inskeep, program director at the Citizens Action Coalition, an Indiana consumer and environmental advocacy group. “It’s literally in many more peoples’ backyards.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s also an ideological bent to some of the opposition, said Kerwin Olson, the coalition’s executive director, who’s spent years working on energy policy in Indiana. “The direction of discourse really pivoted when we elected President Obama,” he said. “You were a socialist if you supported wind and solar.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though Zartman, the Republican former county commissioner from Ohio, acknowledged that some of the loudest pushback comes from conservatives, he said he sees a “mix” of motivation in opponents, including major resistance to changes to the skyline. (Some renewable projects even in </span><a href="https://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/2021-4-fall/feature/nimby-threat-renewable-energy" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">famously liberal areas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have sparked major opposition.)</span><b> </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I haven’t seen anywhere on a deed that it tells you you have control over your horizon and your view,” he said. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘It does have downsides’</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bob Sostakowski, who’s lived in Crawford County, Ohio, for more than two decades and joined the local anti-wind effort after he became aware of proposed projects popping up in his and neighboring communities, said there’s more than aesthetics at stake. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I had no opinion one way or another on wind until this,” Sostakowski, 48, said. “There’s an obvious and very provable negative impact on property values and people&#8217;s standard of living.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both Sostakowski and Kimberly Groth, 42, who lives in neighboring Seneca County and was heavily involved in the effort to defeat wind projects there and in Crawford, said it’s not reasonable to expect people in agricultural areas to put up with commercial wind farms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“People want quality of life and people move to rural areas because of the peacefulness of it. When you introduce industrial-scale wind over tens of thousands of acres, you’re interrupting that quality of life,” Groth said. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think we’ve heard for 20 to 30 years now about renewable energy and there’s just this assumption that it’s good and that it’s going to save us. So I think for me personally the more I looked into it, the more I realized it does have downsides. … Every form of energy has these pros and cons.” </span></p>

(Robert Zullo / States Newsroom)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sostakowski rejected the notion that farmers and landowners should have the right to lease their property to big wind developers whether or not their neighbors agree.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There is a big distinction between commercial farming and agriculture and the heavy industrial production of electricity,” he said. “At no point in our history has it been OK for people to do whatever they want.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sostakowski added that when he was a kid, a bald eagle sighting was so rare, his parents would pull the family car over to catch a glimpse of one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Decades later, the fact that a wind project can get a </span><a href="https://www.perc.org/2022/08/02/the-case-for-tradeable-permits-in-dead-birds/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“take permit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” for eagles or other protected birds that run into the blades is “unfathomable,” he said, for an intermittent energy generation source that takes up lots of space. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What a horrendous and irresponsible waste of resources, our manpower, our tax dollars and our wildlife,” he said.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘It’s no inconvenience’</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Matthew Eisenson, a fellow at the Renewable Energy Legal Defense Initiative at Columbia’s Sabin Center for Climate Change Law, said many of the debates over local renewable energy siting take on similar contours. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In almost every one of these contested projects people talk about visual impacts,” Eisenson said. “Second most common is impact to property values. A lot of people cite impacts to health which are spurious.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Autism. Livestock harm. Soil and water contamination. Sleep deprivation. Illness. Interference with emergency medical flights. Former President Donald Trump famously (and falsely) said </span><a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/437096-trump-claims-noise-from-windmills-causes-cancer/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wind turbines cause cancer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of those </span><a href="https://www.crawfordantiwind.com/facts" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">dire consequences</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/03/28/1086790531/renewable-energy-projects-wind-energy-solar-energy-climate-change-misinformation" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> crop up in debates about wind and solar siting and populate the Facebook pages and websites that pop up to oppose renewable development. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether “</span><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/06/wind-turbine-syndrome/530694/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wind Farm Syndrome</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” really exists or is a </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/mar/15/windfarm-sickness-spread-word-australia" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">psychosomatic condition</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> created by </span><a href="https://theconversation.com/wind-turbines-dont-make-you-feel-sick-or-healthy-but-spin-can-20845" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fear</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of turbines themselves has been debated for </span><a href="https://nymag.com/news/features/wind-turbines-2013-9/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">years</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-after-study-shows-wind-turbine-syndrome-is-a-myth-including-this-latest-one" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Numerous studies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, including an </span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016041202100043X#s0060" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">inquiry</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> funded by the Finnish government on inaudible “infrasound,” have found no evidence turbines cause any health effects.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s not to say that there are no impacts from wind and solar. Utility-scale solar takes up a lot of land, requiring anywhere from 5 to 10 acres per megawatt.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mike Brady, 69, a farmer from Paulding County, Ohio, has 11 turbines on his 3,000 acres, where he grows corn and soybeans. The first became operational 12 years ago. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A turbine takes up maybe three-quarters of an acre,” he said. “You just farm right around them. It’s a little inconvenient but for the price you’re getting paid it’s no inconvenience.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He says there is occasional “</span><a href="https://windexchange.energy.gov/projects/shadow-flicker" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">shadow flicker</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” (the effect of the sun shining through the turning turbine blades) and some noise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There is flicker at my house. It’ll maybe last five minutes. It just depends on the wind and the angle of the sun. We pull our drapes,” he said. “You’ll hear a noise at like 4 a.m. if you go outside because there’s no other noise. … You can hear a hum out of them. But it doesn’t keep you awake.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once, a turbine blade broke, which made “quite a noise,” he said, and birds do get hit occasionally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They have done bird studies around a couple of my turbines,” he said. “They find one or two birds a year. Of course they assume that they hit the turbine.”</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/BlueCreek_wind_farm-scaled.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-34448" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/BlueCreek_wind_farm-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1710" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/BlueCreek_wind_farm-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/BlueCreek_wind_farm-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/BlueCreek_wind_farm-1024x684.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/BlueCreek_wind_farm-768x513.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/BlueCreek_wind_farm-1536x1026.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/BlueCreek_wind_farm-2048x1368.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But both Brady and Zartman, the former Paulding County commissioner, said the turbines have been a windfall for rural Paulding’s local school and government coffers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As a county, we were virtually bankrupt,” Zartman said. Paulding, entirely reliant on agriculture and with a population of about 19,000 as of 2021, had been hit hard by the recession that began in 2007. There was some resistance to hosting turbines, which he described as coming from out of state, but it never got much traction, he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The anti group was telling everybody that our large commercial dairy farms would quit producing milk because of the noise and the flicker effect from the turbines. They told us all of our children would be autistic,” he said. “They never really got a firm foothold in our community.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By 2019, wind development, then at 188 turbines, was pumping about $2.5 million in payments in lieu of taxes into the county budget, a local news outlet </span><a href="https://spectrumnews1.com/oh/columbus/news/2019/06/27/wind-farms-providing-millions-for-paulding-county" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“All the school districts struggled with money. Now they’re doing quite well,” Brady said. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘It’s our land’</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When part of their 300 acres of farmland in rural Seneca County, Ohio, was leased for a potential wind project, Anne Fry, a retired local teacher, and her husband were looking forward to the additional financial security a lease payment would provide, but also the influx of cash the project was expected to bring in for the local school system. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“At first we were excited,” Fry said in an interview. “I was naive about so many things.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She got a rude awakening at an early meeting on the project.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I thought, ‘I can’t wait to see if there’s going to be a turbine on our land,&#8217;” she said. “It was packed. I saw people, they were so angry they were shaking. They were furious. … They said it was all done in the dark of night, it was secretive. &#8230; I didn’t think anybody cared.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, Seneca County commissioners voted in </span><a href="https://advertiser-tribune.com/news/355495/comms-restrict-county-from-future-wind-and-solar-projects/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">November of 2021</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to ban large wind and solar projects in all unincorporated areas of the county. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s our land. And if we want to grow corn, soybeans, or put green energy on our land, why is it someone else’s choice, who might live on a postage stamp-size lot, to tell us what we can and cannot do with our land?” Fry said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed, hosting renewable development has become an attractive option for struggling farmers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Per the </span><a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/chart-gallery/gallery/chart-detail/?chartId=58268" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Department of Agriculture</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the number of U.S farms has fallen from a peak of 6.8 million in 1935 to about 2 million in 2021, down from 2.2 million in 2007. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Farmers have been under financial pressure from the pandemic, a trade war with China (the </span><a href="https://www.fas.usda.gov/data/china-evolving-demand-world-s-largest-agricultural-import-market" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">world’s largest</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> agricultural importer), severe weather events, depressed prices and rising costs of production like fuel, fertilizer, equipment and other inputs, said Andrew Walmsley, senior director of government affairs for the American Farm Bureau Federation, which has 6 million members nationwide. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Against that backdrop, leasing acreage for wind and solar can be a lifeline to financial stability.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s a great predicament to be in if you want to diversify income,” Walmsley said. “It also creates challenges in a lot of rural communities.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many farmers lease some or all of the land they farm, and others are looking to buy more ground to take advantage of economies of scale. Siting renewable energy on prime farmland increases the cost of doing that, Walmsley noted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When that acreage is lost, that drives up the cost across the community. That&#8217;s the biggest rub,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dave Crum, 78, who lives in Crawford County and has a lease for what was going to be Apex’s Honey Creek project, said he was also surprised by the degree of resistance, including the landslide vote that upheld the commissioners’ wind ban.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I can’t understand the difference between renting your land for crop land and renting your land for a wind turbine,” he said. “It’s baffling when you have things that you think will help the community and they don’t let it happen.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sitting at his dining room table on a frigid February morning, he compared the resistance to stories his grandfather, a local elected official, told him about people who cut down utility poles during </span><a href="https://www.electric.coop/our-organization/history#:~:text=Rural%20Electrification%20Administration,Rural%20Electrification%20Administration%20(REA)." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rural electrification</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m not sour grapes. They voted to do that. Make sure you understand what you did,”  he said. “Crawford County’s a very conservative place. Sometimes it kicks them in the butt.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Honey Creek, in addition to payments to hundreds of local landowners and neighbors, would have provided up to $2.7 million per year in new revenue for local schools, county services and township governments in Crawford, about $80 million over the life of the project, according to Apex Clean Energy.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We were very disappointed in the result of the vote, which embodies a dangerous and precedent-setting expansion of government authority over local property rights,” said Brian O’Shea, a spokesman for the company. “The result restricted and effectively seized the individual land rights of more than 500 Crawford County farmers and landowners, who lost the ability to decide what they wanted to do with their own property.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an email, Larry Schmidt, a Crawford commissioner who voted for the wind ban, said “very little dialogue took place between the anti-wind groups and the developers, making it difficult to have a conversation with a differing viewpoint.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schmidt said he supported the wind ban to give locals a vote on the project.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I favored this option because the developer indicated that they would challenge our decision by ballot,” Schmidt said, adding that he “pondered and prayed over this a lot” before making up his mind.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I do feel we may be missing out on economic gains, however we are more densely populated and the voters have spoken and voted overwhelmingly against,” he said. “And we work for them.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Selling communities on the merits</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tolbert, the vice president of strategy and partnerships at Advanced Energy United, the trade group, says renewable energy companies need to build a “bigger tent” to help sell communities on the merits of projects. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We need to make this as an industry about workforce development, putting people to work, delivering money that can come into your community to help pay for schools, fire and EMS and for all the programs communities need,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developers also want regulatory certainty, he said, calling for more states to follow </span><a href="https://www.myjournalcourier.com/news/article/local-boards-losing-control-siting-illinois-17754277.php" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Illinois’ lead</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in setting statewide standards for wind and solar siting, an end run around the type of local opposition that has </span><a href="https://pantagraph.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/new-illinois-state-energy-project-standards-welcomed-by-some-resisted-by-others/article_936c9518-a96e-11ed-bb60-a70a4975919d.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">snarled projects</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> even in deep blue states. It can be politically tough, however, to water down or strip away local land use control, as lawmakers in neighboring Indiana found out when similar legislation setting statewide standards for wind and solar siting </span><a href="https://www.indystar.com/story/news/environment/2021/04/15/indiana-general-assembly-kills-bill-wind-solar-energy-standards/7222252002/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">failed in 2021</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Voluntary standards </span><a href="https://www.indianaenvironmentalreporter.org/posts/voluntary-approach-to-renewable-energy-siting-passes-indiana-senate" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">passed last year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Zayas, with ACORE, pointed to New York, which created an</span><a href="https://ores.ny.gov/about-us" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Office of Renewable Energy Siting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to consolidate environmental review and permitting of major facilities into a single process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The reality is oftentimes what happens is a developer gets into the process, invests hundreds of thousands or millions in the process and a county can at the last moment change the rules on them,” Tolbert said. “That’s a process that isn’t fair.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, developers can also do more to build trust in communities. Zartman said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They have a community in their target area for quite a while but then they start going out to try to get leases. They really don’t tell anyone openly that this is what they&#8217;re thinking until they’ve got quite a bit of the land leased,” he said. “By then they’ve invested oodles of money but they haven’t done anything to try to help public opinion.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both Sostakowski and Groth, the Ohio wind opponents, said a lack of advance notice from wind developers helped galvanize opposition. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“By the time the community feeling on this becomes apparent the leases are already signed,” Groth said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zartman said renewable companies need to sell communities on the benefits of projects “before you come in and try to steamroll your way” to approval.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How do you get community support if that’s how you start?” he said. “I understand what they’re thinking but as a former public official it’s a lot easier for me to be on board with a project if I’m part of the original planning process.” </span></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong / Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A federal task force wrestled with the costs and benefits of better shielding the nation’s tens of thousands of electric substations from a growing number of attacks, like a neo-Nazi plot the FBI says it foiled earlier </span><a href="https://www.marylandmatters.org/2023/02/06/fbi-arrested-two-including-neo-nazi-leader-who-planned-potentially-catastrophic-attack-on-maryland-power-grid/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this month in Maryland</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, another that knocked out power to thousands</span><a href="https://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/2022/12/05/destruction-of-moore-county-substations-carry-steep-penalties-especially-if-linked-to-domestic-terrorism/#sthash.Fla9WfPi.dpbs" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in North Carolina</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in December and more in the</span><a href="https://oregoncapitalchronicle.com/2023/02/06/oregon-lawmakers-aim-to-address-domestic-terrorism-and-paramilitary-activity/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Pacific Northwest</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These events correspond with an increase in extremism in our country,” said Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Chairman Willie Phillips during a Wednesday meeting of a federal-state </span><a href="https://www.ferc.gov/TFSOET" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">task force</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on electric transmission. Phillips cited </span><a href="https://extremism.gwu.edu/sites/g/files/zaxdzs2191/f/CriticalInfrastructureTargeting09072022.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> released last year by the Program on Extremism at George Washington University that found that between 2016 and 2022, “white supremacist plots targeting energy systems dramatically increased in frequency,” with 13 people arrested and charged in federal court during that span, most of them in the past two years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In December, FERC </span><a href="https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2022/12/22/after-substation-shooting-federal-regulator-orders-review-of-security-standards/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ordered a review</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of security standards at electric transmission facilities and control centers. That review, to be completed by the </span><a href="https://www.nerc.com/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">North American Electric Reliability Corporation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which sets and enforces reliability standards for the bulk power system in the U.S., Canada and part of Mexico, is due in April.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But at the task force meeting, NERC President and CEO James Robb said there are more than 50,000 high-voltage substations dispersed across the country and that regulators will have to make difficult decisions about which ones most need additional security.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s a tremendous amount of infrastructure to protect,” he told the task force, a mix of FERC commissioners and state utility regulators. “It’s not as simple as ‘we should just protect everything.’ Your ratepayers that you’re responsible for probably wouldn’t like that answer.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Robb said the vast majority of “physical security events,” including vandalism, theft of copper wires and other components and shooting attacks, don’t result in any impact to the grid. Only about 5% do, though the bad news is the attacks are increasing, with extremist groups posting instructions for disabling critical infrastructure on the “</span><a href="https://sopa.tulane.edu/blog/everything-you-should-know-about-dark-web" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">dark web</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Puesh Kumar, director of the U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Cybersecurity, Energy Security and Emergency Response, said that in 2022 there were 163 events categorized as “physical” incidents involving electric infrastructure, including vandalism and sabotage, up from 92 in 2021. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The majority of incidents, there isn’t a lot of good information on what caused it,” he told the task force. “When these events do occur they tend to be pretty localized.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Existing regulations, which came about after a 2014 </span><a href="https://www.cpuc.ca.gov/-/media/cpuc-website/divisions/safety-policy-division/reports/r1506009--physical-security-executive-summary.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sniper attack </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">on a California electric substation, only apply to facilities that, if they were knocked out or damaged, could create hazards for the larger grid, like </span><a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/what-causes-cascading-power-grid-failures" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cascading outages</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many substations, like the ones targeted in Moore County, North Carolina, don’t meet that threshold, but damaging them can still result in a loss of power for thousands.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The consequence we’re protecting against is the cascading event that would (affect) millions of customers, not thousands,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As NERC works through its report, he suggested state regulators open dialogues with utilities about security costs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You have to weigh the customer impact of this … relative to your cost to defend against it,” he said. “A substation in a very rural part of the country will have different vulnerabilities than one in downtown Manhattan.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dan Scripps, a task force member and chair of the Michigan Public Service Commission, said he wasn’t “entirely convinced” that there shouldn’t be some baseline security requirements, such as fencing, regardless of where a facility is located.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He added that it’s difficult “from an optics and public responsiveness position” to have to explain to utility customers that there are no minimum standards in place for many facilities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s definitely work to be done,” Robb said. “There could be room here for a minimum threshold of protection.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Robb added that states are free to impose their own security requirements.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You can always go further,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FERC Commissioner Mark Christie, a former Virginia utility regulator, suggested states should work with utilities to develop a “hierarchy” of the most crucial facilities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You can’t harden every substation in the country,” he said. “The costs would be astronomical.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kumar noted that beefing up physical security is one approach to the problem, but so is making the power system more resilient by improving electric transmission and exploring more distributed generation and </span><a href="https://www.nrel.gov/grid/microgrids.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">microgrids </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">with battery storage that are less dependent on the larger power system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think we have an opportunity but we need to be balanced,” Phillips said, recalling a conversation with his personal trainer. “You can pay me now or you can pay the doctor later.”</span></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The deadly winter storm, christened Elliott by the Weather Channel, that tore through much of the United States over the Christmas weekend placed a huge strain on the American electric grid, pushing it past the breaking point in some places.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frigid temperatures, in some places </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brianbushard/2022/12/24/winter-storm-elliott-heres-which-cities-set-record-low-temperatures-so-far/?sh=4ac325fb33b0" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">setting records</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, drove a surge in electric demand while also causing big problems for gas, coal and other power plants that took electric generation offline just when it was needed most. That forced some southeastern utilities to cut power to thousands of people on a rotating basis and led grid operators to </span><a href="https://twitter.com/pjminterconnect/status/1606761678426832898?s=20&amp;t=2Wzc6NDbC9K13aikdQt8gg" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">urge customers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to conserve power. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Supply and demand for electricity have to exactly balance in real time,” said Michael Goggin, a longtime electric industry analyst and vice president at Grid Strategies, a consulting firm focused on clean energy integration. “If not, in a matter of seconds the grid can collapse.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the North American Electric Reliability Corporation announced Wednesday that they will open a</span><a href="https://www.nerc.com/news/Pages/FERC,-NERC-to-Open-Joint-Inquiry-into-Winter-Storm-Elliott.aspx" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> joint investigation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> into the power system’s performance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There will be multiple lessons learned from last week’s polar vortex that will inform future winter preparations,” said Jim Robb, president and CEO of NERC, the nonprofit regulator that sets and enforces reliability standards for the bulk power system in the U.S. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This storm underscores the increasing frequency of significant extreme weather events (the fifth major winter event in the last 11 years) and underscores the need for the electric sector to change its planning scenarios and preparations for extreme events.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But for some experts, a major lesson from the storm is already plain, and it&#8217;s the same as learned in past severe winter weather: The U.S. grid needs to be better connected to enable power to be moved easily to where it’s needed in moments of crisis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Although this was a massive event that ultimately affected huge parts of the country, there were geographic elements to it,” said Ari Peskoe, director of the Electricity Law Initiative at Harvard Law School. “The attention belongs on the transmission system.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The storm</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">John Moore, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service, said the storm was unusual in several aspects, including the rapid drop in temperatures triggered by a blast of arctic air pushing down from Canada far into the American South, the rapid strengthening called “</span><a href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/bombogenesis.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bombogenesis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” and the heft of the pressure behind the system, which he said set a record in Edmonton, Canada.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s a very broad system and it’s a lot of impacts associated with it. … The cold air with this one was a little bit stronger than we usually see this time of year,” Moore said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The storm caused temperatures to drop 37 degrees in one hour at Denver International Airport and set temperature records in Wyoming and Montana, according to preliminary data.  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As it moved east, it caused a deadly blizzard in the Buffalo area that claimed at least </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/weather-buffalo-natural-disasters-new-york-city-storms-6cb9f31599be5f698a927fa971fcf019" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">40 lives</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and wreaked havoc on the electric grid. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There were likely other records set across the South and East Coast,” Moore said.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Outages</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though </span><a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/millions-without-power-as-winter-storm-batters-u-s-with-blizzards-freezing-rain" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hundreds of thousands</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of homes and businesses were left without power because of normal storm calamities such as downed power lines, many other customers in the Carolinas and the Tennessee Valley Authority service territory, which includes most of Tennessee and parts of Kentucky, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Virginia and North Carolina, saw outages because of the strain struggling power plants and surging demand placed on the grid.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What we saw was concerning,” said Goggin, who was monitoring data from many of the major </span><a href="https://arkansasadvocate.com/2022/09/26/amid-a-massive-american-clean-energy-shift-grid-operators-play-catch-up/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">regional transmission organizations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> hit by the storm. “You saw very high unplanned or forced outages of power plants of many types but primarily fossil.” The extreme cold also shut down many </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-24/storm-elliott-latest-us-natural-gas-output-plunges" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">natural gas production wells</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, he said, which limited pipeline supplies that feed power plants. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve seen a number of events like this where the extreme cold disrupts the gas system, which then cascades to the power system,” he said. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Tennessee Valley Authority</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Dec. 23, with demand climbing past 33,000 megawatts (its normal December demand is around 24,000) the TVA for the first time in its 90-year history instituted load shedding — temporary controlled outages — and urged customers to conserve electricity. The service interruptions ended on Dec. 24, with the TVA saying it had supplied more power over the previous 24 hours than ever before to meet an all-time peak winter demand. POWER magazine </span><a href="https://www.powermag.com/arctic-blast-roiling-reliability-in-tva-miso-spp-pjm/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">also quoted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a TVA spokesperson saying that a “limited number” of power plants in TVA’s territory “did not operate as expected during this event resulting in a loss of generation.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We at TVA take full responsibility for the impact we had on our customers,” the authority said in a </span><a href="https://www.tva.com/newsroom/press-releases/tva-accepts-responsibility-starts-full-review" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dec. 28 statement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “We are conducting a thorough review of what occurred and why. We are committed to sharing these lessons learned and — more importantly — the corrective actions we take in the weeks ahead to ensure we are prepared to manage significant events in the future.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an email to States Newsroom Thursday, a TVA spokesperson could not say how many customers were affected nor provide any information on why power plants weren’t able to perform, citing the ongoing review. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the Memphis area, where Memphis Light, Gas and Water is the TVA’s </span><a href="https://www.localmemphis.com/article/news/local/mlgw-tva-utility-light-gas-water-memphis-midsouth/522-8dc09855-2efc-475d-bb39-ddabfebf76e7" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">largest customer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, more than 30,000 customers were affected, local station WMC-TV </span><a href="https://www.actionnews5.com/2022/12/24/rolling-blackouts-reinstituted-thousands-mlgw-customers-without-power/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The Chattanooga Free Press </span><a href="https://www.timesfreepress.com/news/2022/dec/24/power-outages-tfp/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported on Christmas Eve</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the TVA had lost about 6,000 megawatts of generation the day before at coal and gas plants.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Until the review is completed over the next few weeks, any discussion on individual plants would be inappropriate because it would just be speculation on our part,” TVA spokesman Scott Fiedler told States Newsroom. “As the wholesale power provider, we instruct our 153 local power companies to reduce load. They implement the process to limit the impact to their customers. We expect customers were affected by 15-30 minutes in a rolling fashion as LPCs implemented curtailments.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Duke Energy</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Duke Energy, one of the nation’s largest utility companies, was forced to cut power to about 500,000 of its customers in North Carolina and South Carolina on Dec. 24, with the last seeing power restored by about 6 p.m., spokesman Jeff Brooks said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We made this difficult decision to protect the electric grid and reliability on our system, and to avoid a potential longer or broader outage to customers,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another Duke Energy spokesman </span><a href="https://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/2022/12/09/reliability-watchdog-warns-of-potential-electric-shortfalls-this-winter/#sthash.BtyAWOBF.dpbs" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">told States Newsroom</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in November, in response to a report by NERC that its service territory might be vulnerable to electric outages in the event of extreme winter weather, that the company was “ready to meet the energy needs of our customers every day, regardless of weather.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brooks said the company is still examining generation performance during the storm and assembling information for regulators and couldn’t provide more details on what type of power plants failed to perform. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was a combination of generation on our system that was either reduced or unavailable that evening, coupled with the inability to import additional electricity from out of state (which is something we can typically do to add to our native generation) that resulted in the need to initiate temporary outages,” Brooks said, noting that solar wasn’t a factor because it was dark when the outages were initiated. As of 2021, wind, solar and hydroelectric power </span><a href="https://news.duke-energy.com/releases/clean-generation-remains-duke-energys-focus-as-it-plans-to-triple-renewable-energy-this-decade" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">made up</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> just 7% of Duke’s company-owned output.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We did believe that we had adequate generation going into Friday evening to meet the forecasted demand for electricity,” Brooks said. “That demand ultimately came in higher than we forecast.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">PJM </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Faced with plunging temperatures, surging power demand and some power plants struggling to perform, PJM, the nation’s largest grid operator, </span><a href="https://www.pjm.com/-/media/about-pjm/newsroom/2022-releases/20221223-news-release-w1-statement-call-for-conservation.ashx" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">issued a call </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">for customers to conserve energy a day before Christmas Eve. The call came as a surprise for electric industry experts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a </span><a href="https://www.nerc.com/pa/RAPA/ra/Reliability%20Assessments%20DL/NERC_WRA_2022.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">winter reliability assessment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, NERC said that PJM — which coordinates the movement of electricity for 65 million people in all or parts of Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia — “expects no resource problems over the entire 2022-23 winter peak season because installed capacity is almost three times the reserve requirement.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But a big portion of that excess electric generation capacity was struggling to produce power, said Michael Bryson, PJM’s senior vice president of system operations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We saw pretty significant generation outage data coming in, failing to start or tripping offline, far exceeding our ability to keep up,” Bryson said. In its </span><a href="https://www.pjm.com/-/media/documents/ferc/orders/2022/20221224-pjm-202c-doe-order.ashx" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">request</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the Department of Energy for a temporary waiver of environmental rules for generation units, PJM said its peak load, or electric demand, exceeded 135,000 megawatts on Dec. 23, while about 45,000 megawatts of generation were out or underperforming. (</span><a href="http://learn.pjm.com/-/media/about-pjm/newsroom/fact-sheets/power-in-balance-fact-sheet.ashx#:~:text=PJM%20controls%20the%20operation%20of,in%20usage%20from%20demand%20resources." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PJM lists </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">about 185,000 megawatts of total generation capacity)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bryson said in an interview that the performance problems affected coal, gas and nuclear plants. Wind, which makes up the majority of renewable energy in PJM’s generation mix (though it is </span><a href="https://pjm.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">dwarfed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by coal, gas and nuclear) performed well during the storm, Bryson said. He said he had not had the chance to review how solar energy fared during the event. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ll be working through those issues unit by unit over the next week,” he said, adding that power plants that failed to meet their performance criteria risk financial penalties. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to participating in the NERC-FERC inquiry, “we’re going to kick off a pretty comprehensive lessons-learned session ourselves,” Bryson said, including examining the organization’s own extreme cold electric load forecasting. He said PJM’s forecast was low by about 7 to 10% on Dec. 23.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Creating a grid ‘bigger than the weather’</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Peskoe, the director of the Electricity Law Initiative at Harvard, and Goggin, the energy consulting firm executive, both said that too often in the aftermath of major storms that stress the power grid, one form of generation comes under fire. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Extreme weather like this does affect all generation sources,” Goggin said, though he said it appeared that renewables, which don’t need coal piles that can freeze or pipelines that can be curtailed by cold, largely fared well during the storm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the real task for the people in charge of the nation’s electric grid is to grow a transmission system that’s “bigger than the weather,” as Goggin put it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When you do that, it allows you to bring in power from areas that are less affected,” he said. “Having a large grid that allows you to move power around as events like this unfold provides a lot of value.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goggin said he monitored data from the regional transmission organizations affected by the storm, including the Southwest Power Pool and MISO (Midcontinent Independent System Operator), neither of which had to resort to rolling outages, and noticed that wind electric prices in those markets plunged to very low or even negative levels. That means there wasn’t enough transmission capacity to get the large amount of electricity the turbines were producing to where it was needed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That power would have been extremely valuable in locations farther east, but it couldn’t get out of the wind-producing areas,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simon Mahan, executive director of the Southern Renewable Energy Association, a trade group for large renewable energy and energy storage companies, said the storm showed how critical interconnection between regions is for reliability and how vulnerable parts of the southern electric grid are to severe winter weather like the </span><a href="https://www.ferc.gov/news-events/news/final-report-february-2021-freeze-underscores-winterization-recommendations" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">catastrophic grid collapse</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Texas saw in 2021. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Being connected with our neighbors is exceptionally important,” he said. “If we weren’t connected with MISO and PJM, things would have been a disaster. … Winter Storm Elliott is kind of that storm that showed that the rest of the Southeast is vulnerable like Texas was.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mahan noted that the storm raised transparency issues as well, with real-time data on generation and load coming in from areas controlled by regional transmission organizations like PJM and MISO but not so much from areas controlled by the TVA or monopoly utilities like those owned by Duke in the Carolinas and Southern Company in Alabama and Georgia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s very easy to see where there are problems. But in the Southeast, because there’s so little transparency, it’s hard to see,” he said. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">A proposal to streamline transmission planning</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The storm came as FERC is weighing a </span><a href="https://www.ferc.gov/news-events/news/ferc-issues-transmission-nopr-addressing-planning-cost-allocation" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">major proposed rule</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on streamlining regional electric transmission planning and cost allocation as well as taking into account broader benefits. And it comes less than a month after a </span><a href="https://cms.ferc.gov/media/day-1-establishing-interregional-transfer-capability-transmission-planning-cost-allocation" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FERC-led meeting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on potentially requiring a minimum amount of interregional electric transfer capability — electricity that can be moved between regional transmission systems —  for public utility transmission providers. Supporters described it as an “insurance policy” in the event of grid crises like extreme weather. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One thing that I hope is explored as people try to dissect what happened is what would the value have been of interregional transfer capability during this event,” Peskoe said.</span></p>

		<p class="newsroomBlockQuote ">Given the likelihood of future extreme weather events and related generation shortfalls, many stakeholders have been asking us to do something.</p>

		<div class="newsroomBlockQuoteAuthorContainer">
		<p style="font-size:13px"><b>– FERC Commissioner Willie Phillips</b></p>
	</div>
	</div>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FERC Commissioner Willie Phillips at the meeting said better transfer capability can improve reliability and resilience, lower costs for customers by allowing them to access cheaper electricity and accommodate more renewable power. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Given the likelihood of future extreme weather events and related generation shortfalls, many stakeholders have been asking us to do something,” Phillips said. “Both Winter Storm Uri and the 2014 polar vortex, these events have shown that greater interregional transfer capability has a significant reliability benefit.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not everyone was a fan of the idea, though. Tricia Pridemore, chair of the Georgia Public Service Commission, which regulates utilities, said states like Georgia that are not part of regional transmission organizations don’t need a new transfer requirement, citing the state’s utility planning process and cooperation with other southeastern utilities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our bottom-up approach maintains reliability and does not put upward pressure on rates by constructing unnecessary or duplicative transmission assets,” she said. “Georgia is better for maintaining a safe, reliable affordable system all while not being told to do so from a top-down governance structure.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the federal Energy Information Administration, Georgia is </span><a href="https://www.eia.gov/state/rankings/?sid=GA#series/31" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">one of the more</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> expensive states in the South in terms of average residential retail electric price, and Pridemore’s commission just approved a </span><a href="https://georgiarecorder.com/2022/12/20/georgia-power-customers-will-foot-1-8b-rate-hike-tab-after-state-regulators-ok-three-year-plan/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">big rate hike</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the state’s dominant utility, Georgia Power. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The reality is during the storm and this past week after the storm, Southern Company and Georgia have really relied on imports from MISO and a significant amount of power from Canada that has been brought into MISO,” Mahan said. “It’s pretty incredible how Canada is helping keep the power on in places like Atlanta.” </span></p>

(Justin Sullivan / Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Less than two weeks after gunfire </span><a href="https://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/2022/12/05/destruction-of-moore-county-substations-carry-steep-penalties-especially-if-linked-to-domestic-terrorism/#sthash.dMxxzOXD.dpbs" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">damaged </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">two Duke Energy substations in Moore County, N.C., knocking out power to about 45,000 people, federal regulators ordered a review of security standards at electric transmission facilities and control centers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission last Thursday ordered the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC), which sets and enforces reliability standards for the bulk power system in the U.S., Canada and part of Mexico, to review existing “physical security” rules for the components of the power system. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The order, which requires NERC to deliver within 120 days its report on the effectiveness and applicability of current standards and whether improvements are necessary, comes amid reports of similar attacks at other sites across the country. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this year, three men in Ohio </span><a href="https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2022/02/24/three-men-plead-guilty-to-plotting-a-white-supremacist-attack-on-power-grid/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pleaded guilty</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to planning an attack on electric substations as part of a white supremacist plot. In November, shots were fired at an American Electric Power substation near Centerburg, Ohio, knocking out power, </span><a href="https://www.knoxpages.com/news/authorities-discuss-shots-fired-at-centerburg-substation-that-led-to-power-outage/article_c1fbc59a-7005-11ed-bb7a-43652d401e3b.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a local news outlet</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reported. The FBI is also investigating a string of attacks at substations that happened in Washington and Oregon, per </span><a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/law-justice/pse-substations-among-five-attacked-in-pacific-northwest-in-november/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Seattle Times</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It reminds us that we need to take physical security into account just as we do cybersecurity,” FERC Chairman Richard Glick said last week at the commission meeting, cautioning that the motives for the Moore County attack and some similar incidents elsewhere remain murky and under investigation by local and state law enforcement. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But in the meantime I think it’s a good idea and this is a good step of trying to reassess our existing physical security standards and whether changes need to be made.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2014, following a </span><a href="https://www.cpuc.ca.gov/-/media/cpuc-website/divisions/safety-policy-division/reports/r1506009--physical-security-executive-summary.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sniper attack</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the year before on a Pacific Gas and Electric substation in California, FERC approved a physical security reliability standard for owners of electric transmission facilities. The standard requires utilities and other transmission owners to conduct regular risk assessments on transmission stations and substations “that, if rendered inoperable or damaged, could result in instability, uncontrolled separation or </span><a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/what-causes-cascading-power-grid-failures#toggle-gdpr" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cascading</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> within an interconnection,” Mark Hegerle, director of FERC’s Division of Operation and Planning Standards, told the commission. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That means facilities that could create hazards for the larger grid if they are knocked out, a risk not posed by the North Carolina outages, said Rachel Sherrard, a spokeswoman for NERC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The assets in North Carolina were not individually deemed critical to the grid and the recent attack did not create an uncontrolled or cascading outage, which is what the standards are designed to protect from,” she said. “However, this does raise the question of the need to review an event that impacts several non-critical assets that collectively can have impact beyond any single asset failure.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Substations </span><a href="https://www.osha.gov/etools/electric-power/illustrated-glossary/sub-station#accordion-72238-collapse1" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">serve a variety of purposes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, including stepping down voltage from the transmission system that transports electricity across long distances to the distribution wires that bring into homes and businesses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asked if the shootings had made Duke re-examine how it protects substations, a spokeswoman said the company wouldn’t discuss specific security measures. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have multiple layers of security across our system that allow us to monitor and protect critical infrastructure,” the spokeswoman, Logan Kureczka, wrote in an email. “As the largest grid operator in the country, our responsibility to protect the power grid is paramount, and our security evolves as threats do.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement earlier this month, the Electricity Subsector Coordinating Council, which describes itself as the “principal liaison between leadership in the federal government and in the electric power sector,” said investor-owned electric companies, electric cooperatives and public power utilities “continuously monitor and prepare for threats to the grid and other infrastructure.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The organization, which coordinates efforts to guard against threats to critical infrastructure, said it was working with law enforcement investigating the attacks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Understanding what happened in North Carolina will be important to minimize future threats and to keep our industry’s defenses at the forefront,” the organization </span><a href="https://www.electricitysubsector.org/-/media/Files/ESCC/Documents/1252022ESCCPressReleaseFINAL.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FERC Commissioner Mark Christie, a former Virginia utility regulator, said attacks on </span><a href="https://www.aep.com/assets/docs/safety/What's%20on%20Pole_AEP.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">transformers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the drum-shaped devices on utility poles that lower the voltage before electricity is delivered to residences and businesses, are relatively common. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They’re vulnerable to a drunk with a gun and an attitude. We have a lot of incidents of that. That’s not unusual,” he said. “The substations are a different ballgame. … A transformer knocks out a block or two. A substation, several tens of thousands of people.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Noting that it was likely that NERC would come back with a recommendation to upgrade security standards, Christie said he hoped the Department of Energy would find a way to use grid resilience money from the </span><a href="https://www.energy.gov/gdo/bipartisan-infrastructure-law" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bipartisan infrastructure law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to lessen the blow for electric ratepayers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s going to cost money and I hope this doesn’t all flow through to ratepayers,” he said.</span></p>

(Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scientists at a U.S. national laboratory announced Tuesday that they achieved fusion ignition, a breakthrough decades in the making that could have major implications for clean energy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Researchers at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory near San Francisco said that on Dec. 5, for the first time anywhere in the world, </span><a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/doe-national-laboratory-makes-history-achieving-fusion-ignition" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">they managed to produce</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> more energy from a nuclear fusion reaction than was needed to produce it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is what it looks like for America to lead. And we’re just getting started,” said U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm.</span></p>
<p>Virginia Rep. Don Beyer, D-Alexandria, who is founder and chair of the U.S. House Fusion Energy Caucus, called fusion “the holy grail of clean energy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When we learn to develop and deploy it effectively, it can provide virtually unlimited, clean, inexpensive power without the environmental risk of existing nuclear fission plants,&#8221; he said in a statement. &#8220;The long-term impact on the fight against climate change, the incredible economic potential, and the possibilities for reducing global poverty are hard to overstate.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, at the announcement, officials said it would be years before a commercial application, such as a fusion power plant, might emerge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There are very significant hurdles, not just in the science but in technology,” said Kim Budil, director of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. “Probably decades. Not six decades I don’t think. Not five decades, which is what we used to say. I think it’s moving into the foreground, and probably with concerted effort and investment, a few decades of research on the underlying technologies could put us in a position to build a power plant.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Granholm said the Biden administration has a goal of getting to a commercial fusion reactor in a decade. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve got to get to work, and this shows that it can be done, which has been a question,” she said, adding that now researchers can begin improving the technology necessary to bring a commercial project to fruition. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fusion, the same scientific process by which the sun and other stars are powered, involves the merging of two light atomic nuclei to form a single, heavier nucleus, a reaction that releases “massive amounts of energy,” according to the </span><a href="https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/news/what-is-nuclear-fusion" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">International Atomic Energy Agency</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scientists have been attempting to harness fusion power since the 1930s because of its potential to provide vast amounts of clean energy, since fusion produces little waste and poses none of the hazards of </span><a href="https://nrl.mit.edu/reactor/fission-process#:~:text=When%20a%20U%2D235%20nucleus,for%20creating%20a%20chain%20reaction." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">nuclear fission</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which splits atoms to generate heat. The challenge, however, has been re-creating the conditions that allow fusion to occur, including extreme pressures and temperatures exceeding 100 million degrees Celsius.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In this experiment we used the world’s most energetic laser, the </span><a href="https://www.llnl.gov/news/national-ignition-facility-achieves-fusion-ignition" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Ignition Facility</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, to create X-rays that cause a tiny capsule to implode and create a very hot, very high-pressure plasma,” said Mark Herrmann, the lab’s program director for weapon physics and design. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And that plasma wants to immediately lose its energy. It wants to blow apart, it wants to radiate. It’s looking for ways to cool down. But the fusion reactions are depositing heat in that plasma,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;So there’s a race between heating and cooling. And if the plasma gets a little bit hotter, the fusion reaction rate goes up, creating even more fusions … which gets even more heating. And so the question is can we win the race? And for many many decades we lost the race. … But last Monday that all changed.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Herrmann and other officials said the fusion breakthrough will also help ensure the safety and effectiveness of the nation’s nuclear weapon stockpile, which is also </span><a href="https://www.llnl.gov/missions/weapons" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">part</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Lawrence Livermore’s mission, without underground weapons testing, since fusion ignition is a component of thermonuclear weapons.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arati Prabhakar, director of the White House’s Office of Science and Technology Policy, recalled the summer she spent at Livermore as a student in 1978 working on lasers related to fusion experiments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They never lost sight of this goal,” she said. “And last week, lo and behold, indeed they shot a bunch of lasers at a pellet of fuel and more energy was released from that fusion ignition than the energy of the lasers going in. … I just think this is such a tremendous example of what perseverance really can achieve.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andrew Holland, CEO of the </span><a href="https://www.fusionindustryassociation.org/staff" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fusion Industry Association</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a nonprofit working to commercialize fusion power that calls itself “the unified voice of the fusion industry,” said in a statement that the announcement is “an important milestone” and evidence that fusion “is not science fiction.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This will give governments around the world further incentive to support the development of commercial fusion energy,” Holland said. “It also shows that now is the time to establish regulatory regimes which both protect the public and encourage innovation. The FIA and our member companies will continue to meet milestones and drive rapid increases in fusion investment while supporting efforts to increase interest from governments around the world.”</span></p>

(Robert Zullo / States Newsroom)</p><p><b></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">An aging electric grid, fossil fuel power plant retirements and a massive renewable electricity buildout are all contributing to a boom in transmission and distribution wire projects by electric utilities across the country. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020, investor-owned electric utilities spent $25 billion on transmission, up from $23.7 billion in 2019, figures that the </span><a href="https://www.eei.org/en/resources-and-media/industry-data" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Edison Electric Institute</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which represents investor-owned electric companies, expected to only grow going forward. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ohio-based American Electric Power, which is one of the nation’s largest electric companies and operates the largest transmission system in the country (serving 5.5 million customers in 11 states) said last year that it </span><a href="https://www.aep.com/news/releases/read/7289/AEP-Highlights-Planned-Capital-Investments-in-Renewables-and-Energy-Grid-Reaffirms-Operating-Earnings-Growth-Rate-of-5-Percent-to-7-Percent#:~:text=The%20company%20plans%20to%20invest,custom%20energy%20solutions%20to%20customers." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">plans to spend</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> $23.3 billion between 2022 and 2026 on transmission and distribution.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But much of that spending is happening on local projects in states with widely differing regulatory regimes. And there’s been growing concern at the state and federal levels that too much of it is occurring without enough transparency and oversight to ensure transmission owners are appropriately planning for new technology, considering more cost-effective regional approaches or alternate solutions and not ripping off their ratepayers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s going to be a significant amount of transmission built,” Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Chairman Richard Glick said at a Nov. 15 meeting of a joint federal and state task force on electric transmission. “We need to make sure consumers get the best bang for their buck.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The meeting came more than a month after a </span><a href="https://www.ferc.gov/news-events/events/technical-conference-transmission-planning-and-cost-management-10062022" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FERC technical conference</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> during which electric utility regulators and consumer counsel from a wide variety of states said, to varying degrees, that they often lacked the authority, information and expertise to properly vet and oversee the rising number of transmission projects happening in their states.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s led to growing support for the idea of an independent monitor to examine the need, costs and planning behind the wave of new projects to protect customers and ensure utilities — for whom transmission spending and the return on equity it comes with is a major profit stream — are looking beyond their own narrow financial interests.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is inexplicable, other than perhaps explained by utility influence, that massive expenditures for these utility local transmission projects are being charged to consumers without the government regulatory oversight that has been developed over a century for consumer protection,” Mike Haugh, director of the analytical department at the Office of the Ohio Consumers’ Counsel, </span><a href="https://elibrary.ferc.gov/eLibrary/filelist?accession_number=20221004-5148&amp;optimized=false" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wrote in comments</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to FERC in support of independent transmission monitors. </span></p>
<p>Such monitors, he said, <span style="font-weight: 400;">“would allow for another level of protection for consumers that are </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">paying for the transmission system.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not everyone, of course, is on board.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Electric companies and transmission owners see it as an unnecessary layer of bureaucracy, and even some utility regulators say it’s a job best left to states. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘Screams out for more oversight’</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the task force meeting Nov. 15, Andrew French, a commissioner at the Kansas Corporation Commission, which regulates electric utilities, said transmission costs in his state have gone from $4 a month on the average customer’s bill 10 or 15 years ago to $20 today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are seeing a flood of capital investment in that area and that screams out for more oversight,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jennifer Easler, the Iowa state consumer advocate, which is responsible for reviewing and investigating regulated services provided by gas and electric utilities, said during the October FERC conference that regulators need more information in advance to perform a holistic assessment of local transmission projects that aren’t being properly vetted at the federal or </span><a href="https://minnesotareformer.com/2022/09/26/amid-a-massive-american-clean-energy-shift-grid-operators-play-catch-up/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">regional transmission operator</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> levels.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_28809" class="wp-caption alignright" style="max-width:100%;width:1024px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_7127-2-scaled.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-28809" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_7127-2-1024x677.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="677" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_7127-2-1024x677.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_7127-2-300x198.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_7127-2-768x508.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_7127-2-1536x1015.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_7127-2-2048x1354.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  An electrical substation near Imboden, Va. (Sarah Vogelsong/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“By the time it arrives at the state regulator, when a utility wants to replace a new line because of age and condition, the regulator is hard pressed to say no to that,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But some state regulators do have processes in place to properly vet transmission projects and utility building plans, which are called</span> <a href="https://blog.aee.net/understanding-irps-how-utilities-plan-for-the-future" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">integrated resource plans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In Nevada we have one vertical (investor-owned utility) that&#8217;s regulated, and it handles just about all the transmission in the state, which means that any time new transmission is being proposed, in an interstate context at least, there&#8217;s a lot of robust review and analysis of that transmission,” said Cameron Dyer, assistant general counsel for the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada at the October FERC conference.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And not all utility regulators see the need for an independent monitor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tricia Pridemore, chairman of the Georgia Public Service Commission, touted Georgia’s pro-business rankings, economic development wins, below-average electric rates, growth in solar energy, lack of outages or brown-outs and a collaborative process between regulators and utilities that “has been perfected over decades” at the Nov. 15 FERC task force meeting. (According to the federal Energy Information Administration, however, Georgia is hardly an electric rate utopia, ranking </span><a href="https://www.eia.gov/state/rankings/?sid=GA#series/31" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">15th most expensive</span></a> state<span style="font-weight: 400;"> in average residential retail electric price.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She admonished other state utility regulators to secure the budget and staffing to properly oversee projects rather than rely on a federally imposed monitor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It lessens your authority to do the hard things that simply must be done,“ she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the FERC proceedings,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">several large transmission owners have also dismissed the concept of an independent monitor as an unnecessary layer of bureaucracy that could gum up the works at a crucial juncture for the electric grid. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are currently living at a time when the need for transmission infrastructure investment has likely never been greater since the dawn of the industry. However, there remain a few who continue to throw sticks in the spokes with a desire to divert the focus from progress to regress,” wrote </span><a href="https://elibrary.ferc.gov/eLibrary/filelist?accession_number=20220921-5118&amp;optimized=false" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Charles Marshall, vice president of transmission planning for ITC Holdings</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which describes itself as the largest independent electricity transmission company in the United States. ITC owns and operates high-voltage transmission in Michigan, Iowa, Minnesota, Illinois, Missouri, Kansas and Oklahoma. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This has led to a push for additional layers of bureaucracy that could introduce new uncertainty and jeopardize needed investments in reliability and resilience,” Marshall wrote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeff Burleson, a senior vice president of environmental and system planning at Atlanta-based Southern Company, which operates electric companies in Georgia, Alabama and</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Mississippi, said the company posts transmission plans twice a year on the Southeastern Regional Transmission Planning website and gets “a significant amount of oversight at our state regulatory agencies.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I also don&#8217;t feel that there is value for us from thinking about some sort of independent monitor because we already have so much scrutiny that comes through all of our processes,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Easler, the Iowa consumer advocate, said in her comments filed with FERC that growing transmission costs are hitting many Iowa ratepayers hard and there’s</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">often little state regulators can do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I would disagree with the notion that this is creating additional bureaucracy. It&#8217;s addressing a major oversight gap that exists,” Easler said at the October conference.  </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The scope of the problem</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Federal Power Act, </span><a href="https://www.ferc.gov/sites/default/files/2021-04/federal_power_act.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">which dates to 1920</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, grants FERC oversight over electric transmission in interstate commerce and charges it with ensuring that costs billed to customers are “</span><a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/16/824d" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">just and reasonable.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yet, over the past few decades, the commission has used its expansive ratemaking authority to institute several shortcuts that reduce its direct oversight,” said </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ari Peskoe, director of the Electricity Law Initiative at Harvard University</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Law School, in <a href="https://elibrary.ferc.gov/eLibrary/filelist?accession_number=20220916-5192&amp;optimized=false" target="_blank">comments</a> filed with FERC. “The commission’s policies do not protect consumers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Peskoe singled out FERC </span><a href="https://www.ferc.gov/formula-rates-electric-transmission-proceedings-key-concepts-and-how-participate" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“formula rates,”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which, instead of relying on a contested rate case to establish the utility’s cost of service for transmission, allow the company to file information with FERC in various categories — including rate of return, operations and maintenance, depreciation, taxes and other factors — that is used to calculate the rate they’re able to charge customers for local projects. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Formula rates are a vehicle for avoiding burdens of proof and limiting protests. The commission’s default presumption that all transmission expenditures are prudent allows utility costs to flow through to consumers’ bills without scrutiny,” Peskoe wrote, adding that FERC policies for transmission asset replacement and end-of-life projects amount to “a blank check that may be worth hundreds of billions of dollars over the next few decades.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While there’s some opportunity to challenge utilities’ formula rates, “it’s not practical to do so on the piecemeal basis that these other projects are progressing,” Easler said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The absence of customer-initiated challenges to local transmission upgrades in formula rate reviews is not an indication that all is well,” she wrote in her comments to FERC. “Rather, in the face of relentless transmission rate increase, it is an indication that this regulatory process is inadequate to protect customers from unjust and unreasonable charges resulting from inefficient siloed transmission planning processes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FERC Commissioner Mark Christie, a former member of the Virginia State Corporation Commission, has said the amount of transmission spending utilities are packing into their <a href="https://www.nrel.gov/state-local-tribal/blog/posts/phrase-of-the-day-rate-base.html" target="_blank">rate bases</a> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(the total value of a regulated utility’s assets upon which its electric rates and profits are calculated) nearly tripled between 2012 and 2020. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What goes into rate base goes into consumer bills,” Christie said at the</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Nov. 15 task force meeting. “This is a hugely important issue. This is a ton of money.” Christie questioned task force members on whether FERC should deny formula rate treatment to utilities in states that can’t certify that they have a “credible process” for evaluating need and prudence of projects. </span></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong / Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transmission projects that span different utilities’ service territories in areas managed by </span><a href="https://minnesotareformer.com/2022/09/26/amid-a-massive-american-clean-energy-shift-grid-operators-play-catch-up/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">regional transmission organizations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> go through a vetting process involving multiple parties, but utilities have almost total control over local projects, a major incentive to avoid regional projects in which they may have to share control and profits with another utility. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They like the status quo, which is them building their own transmission wholly within their own territory and not having to share,” said Nick Guidi, an attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center who works on electricity regulation issues at FERC and is pushing for market reform in the Southeast. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guidi quibbled in particular with the characterization by Burleson, the Southern Company executive, that the company’s state regulators conduct a thorough review of transmission projects. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even where certificate of public need procedures (a permit to build and operate a utility facility) exist in the Southeast, it’s generally only for new lines, not lines that are being rebuilt, upgraded or replaced. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So we don&#8217;t always have this fulsome review of a comprehensive plan,” he said. “An (independent transmission monitor) would be a tremendous resource for states who don&#8217;t often have the resources to monitor the process.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Local limitations</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many states limit what their public utility commissions can approve based on size of transmission line, leading to utilities often picking solutions that fall under that threshold in order to avoid scrutiny. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That means that while the project might not be the most efficient or cost effective, it’s the easiest one for the utility to get built with the least amount of oversight.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lauren Azar, a former commissioner at the Wisconsin Public Service Commission, said Wisconsin also has no certificate requirement for smaller transmission lines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Ohio, </span><a href="https://dis.puc.state.oh.us/ViewImage.aspx?CMID=A1001001A21K18B61640F01982" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">only lines above 100 kilovolts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> require a certificate of public need.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In North Carolina, a public need certificate is only required for new construction of a transmission line that’s 161 kilovolts or larger, said James McLawhorn, director of the energy division at the North Carolina Utilities Commission’s Public Staff, which is the state’s consumer advocate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So we have a lot of 115, and we find out about it when, as we said this morning, when it shows up in rates,” McLawhorn said in October at the FERC conference.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The role of a monitor </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In October, Kentucky Public Service Commission Chairman Kent Chandler said the monitor could serve a similar function to the independent market monitor in PJM, the nation’s largest </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">regional transmission operator</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that coordinates the movement of wholesale electricity in all or parts of 13 states and the District of Columbia. The </span><a href="https://www.pjm.com/about-pjm/who-we-are/pjm-board/independent-market-monitor" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">market monitor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is tasked with helping maintain “competitive and nondiscriminatory” power markets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I can understand people saying that it might be an extra layer of bureaucracy, but for many of these projects it may be the only real set of eyes that&#8217;s looking at the need and the planning, and you can say it&#8217;s an extra layer, but it may be the only one really parsing through the numbers,” Chandler said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There seemed to be little appetite among consumer advocates or utility regulators for giving the monitor authority to issue orders rejecting or requiring any particular projects to be built. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Certainly they&#8217;re not going to issue an order requiring something to be built, but they can provide information to the states to whatever agency has jurisdiction to consider a transmission expansion, whether it&#8217;s in their own state, or three or four states over,” said Henry Tilghman, an energy lawyer representing the </span><a href="https://nippc.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Northwest and Intermountain Power Producers Coalition</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a regional organization for independent power producers and other companies. “Just some good information that gives them confidence that they have the information they need to make an informed decision for their ratepayers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A final FERC decision on independent monitors, however, isn’t imminent. Though the current discussion on independent transmission monitoring is occurring as the commission is </span><a href="https://www.ferc.gov/explainer-transmission-notice-proposed-rulemaking" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">weighing a proposed rule</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> aimed at encouraging more effective long-term regional transmission planning and changing how the benefits and costs of new transmission are allocated, an order on independent monitoring would most likely come in a future rulemaking proceeding, experts said.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It would require another NOPR (notice of proposed rulemaking),” Guidi said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adrienne Mouton-Henderson, director of market and policy innovation at the Clean Energy Buyers Alliance, an association for commercial, industrial, nonprofit and other organizations looking to purchase clean energy, said the same objections to transmission monitors were raised about electric market monitors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Everyone complained when it was first raised. … It’s going to stop the system, we’re just going to be stalled out. And that’s simply not been the case,” she said. “Band-Aiding the system right now and putting the same assets in place is not helping us get renewables there, it’s not helping corporate sustainability goals, it’s not helping us get to clean energy. Transmission lines need to be rebuilt, they need to be upgraded regionally, and we need to make sure that we do it in a cost-effective manner for all ratepayers. … And we simply aren’t doing it right now.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mass adoption, seen as critical to cutting the </span><a href="https://www.epa.gov/greenvehicles/fast-facts-transportation-greenhouse-gas-emissions" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">largest single source</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of U.S. carbon emissions, couldn’t happen until the infrastructure to allow drivers to recharge wherever they were heading was in place. And those charging stations weren’t coming until more drivers switched to plug-in electric vehicles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s one of the reasons why growth in electric vehicle sales </span><a href="https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/articles/new-plug-electric-vehicle-sales-united-states-nearly-doubled-2020-2021" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">was sluggish</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for much of the past decade, industry experts say.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Times are changing, however. The commercials for electric versions of their best-selling trucks blanketing airwaves show major U.S. automakers like </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDptc0ycLhc" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ford</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiA_5-eK8fY" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chevrolet </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">are jumping with both feet into the EV market, vying with the likes of startups like Rivian for a share of the lucrative pickup market. And far from offering a single electric model here or there, many automakers plan to go </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/wheels/news/automaker-ev-plans/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">mostly electric</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over the next two decades. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Between 2015 and 2021, charging stations for plug-in electric cars </span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/06/07/todays-electric-vehicle-market-slow-growth-in-u-s-faster-in-china-europe/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more than tripled</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, according to Pew Research, though that infrastructure has generally remained clustered in large metro areas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And the billions of direct electric vehicle charging infrastructure funding for states in the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law and the array of </span><a href="https://afdc.energy.gov/laws/electric-vehicles-for-tax-credit" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tax credits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the more recent Inflation Reduction Act could supercharge that trend. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are living through a historic moment in terms of federal leadership on climate and clean energy technologies,” said Sarah Baldwin, director of electrification for Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan energy and climate policy think tank. Baldwin said the federal action signals an end to “yo-yo, on-again, off-again” policy on electric vehicles. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re shifting in a way we’ve never shifted before,” she said. “These two pieces of legislation  are 100% laying the groundwork for transforming the U.S. transportation sector to a clean electricity future, one that is better for our health, one that stimulates the U.S. economy and one that tackles climate change.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But while the federal government has sent strong signals to consumers and the auto industry, it will be up to state and local governments to help make ubiquitous electric vehicle charging a reality. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The states that proactively embrace this industry … will reap the benefits in terms of economic development, job creation and investment in the state,” said Cory Bullis, a senior public affairs manager for FLO, a Canadian manufacturer and operator of charging stations that cut the ribbon in October on its first U.S. facility in Auburn Hills, Michigan. “For states to effectively make use of these federal funding opportunities, they also need to do the work to understand what are their charging infrastructure needs.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘EVs are breaking through’</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bipartisan infrastructure law passed by Congress last year included $7.5 billion to build out a nationwide network of more than half a million vehicle charging stations. About $5 billion of that is dedicated to the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure formula program, which will provide each state a share of funding that mirrors its share of federal highway aid. The other $2.5 billion is for discretionary grants for charging and fueling infrastructure </span><a href="https://highways.dot.gov/newsroom/biden-harris-administration-announces-approval-first-35-state-plans-build-out-ev-charging" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">aimed at</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> increasing charging access in “rural, underserved and overburdened communities.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All 50 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico </span><a href="https://highways.dot.gov/newsroom/historic-step-all-fifty-states-plus-dc-and-puerto-rico-greenlit-move-ev-charging-networks" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have submitted </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">and had their NEVI plans approved by the Federal Highway Administration, unlocking more than $1.5 billion in funding for the 2022 and 2023 fiscal years that’s expected to help build charging systems covering about 75,000 miles of highway. </span><a href="https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/environment/nevi/ev_deployment_plans/ak_nevi_plan.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alaska</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will spend an estimated </span><a href="https://driveelectric.gov/state-plans/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$11.1 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this year. If all goes to plan over the next five years, the nation will have charging stations every 50 miles along the federal highway system, with some exceptions.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I was surprised that all of the states submitted plans and are pursuing the money,” said Chris Bast, a former deputy director at the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality who is now director of EV infrastructure investments at the Electrification Coalition, a nonprofit that promotes policies to speed widespread adoption of electric vehicles. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He noted that the apportionments for states under the NEVI program aren’t huge in the grand scheme of federal highway funding and wondered if the money would be worth the effort for state officials, particularly in places not seen as particularly welcoming to electric vehicles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Often anything that smells like climate action or clean energy &#8230; people go to their priors and head to their corners,” he said. “But I think EVs are breaking through and EV charging is breaking through. States across the country no matter if they&#8217;re red, blue or in between are going after the money.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘Now is a great time to step up to the plate’</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the infrastructure law provided direct money to build charging infrastructure, the electric vehicle components of this year’s Inflation Reduction Act are mostly centered around tax credits.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Achieving a net-zero emissions economy by 2050, the Biden administration’s </span><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/22/fact-sheet-president-biden-sets-2030-greenhouse-gas-pollution-reduction-target-aimed-at-creating-good-paying-union-jobs-and-securing-u-s-leadership-on-clean-energy-technologies/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">goal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, will require all new passenger vehicles and medium- and heavy-duty vehicles to be electrified “no later than 2035 and 2045, respectively,” </span><a href="https://energyinnovation.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Implementing-the-Inflation-Reduction-Act-A-Roadmap-For-Federal-And-State-Transportation-Policy.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">per a report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Baldwin co-authored for Energy Innovation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That means the country must “swiftly build sufficient charging infrastructure to ensure a predictable driver experience while reducing range anxiety,” the report says. At the same time, Congress and President Joe Biden saw the Inflation Reduction Act as a chance to make domestic production of electric cars and trucks and the components needed to build them a top priority.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The IRA </span><a href="https://www.electrificationcoalition.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/SAFE_1-sheet_Webinar.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">extends tax credits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for new passenger electric vehicles, creates a new tax credit for commercial electric vehicles and used electric vehicles and lays out new sourcing requirements for electric vehicle components, intended to foster growth of battery and mineral industries in the United States and countries in which the U.S. has free trade agreements, Baldwin said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislation also extends a federal tax credit on charging equipment through 2032 – 30% up to $1,000 for an individual and 6% with a maximum credit of $100,000 per unit for commercial uses — though it must be placed in a low-income or rural area, per an analysis by the </span><a href="https://www.electrificationcoalition.org/work/federal-ev-policy/inflation-reduction-act/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Electrification Coalition</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Those send a signal to automakers that say if you build it we have the supports in place to make sure people buy it,” Bast said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But states can and should do more, Baldwin and Bast said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More states, for example, could adopt</span> <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/08/26/californias-2035-ban-on-new-gas-powered-cars-set-to-apply-to-virginia/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rigorous emissions standards</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> aimed at phasing out internal combustion cars and </span><a href="https://www.edf.org/media/new-jersey-becomes-nations-latest-clean-trucks-state-dumping-dirty-diesel" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">new rules</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> targeting emissions-heavy trucks and other large commercial vehicles, as in New Jersey, Oregon, Washington and elsewhere, Baldwin said. States could also add their own electric vehicle incentives and tweak fees levied on </span><a href="https://www.myev.com/research/interesting-finds/states-that-charge-extra-fees-to-own-an-electric-vehicle" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">electric cars</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in lieu of gas taxes, which pay for road construction in many states. The fees can vary widely, from $50 per year in Colorado to $200 in Ohio and Arkansas to $225 in Washington, per the </span><a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/energy/new-fees-on-hybrid-and-electric-vehicles.aspx" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Conference of State Legislatures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/07/15/dmv-launches-pay-per-mile-program-that-could-save-some-drivers-money/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia, for example</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, is rolling out a voluntary system in which drivers pay based on miles traveled instead of a higher fixed fee. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But while the state under Democratic control <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/02/19/continuing-climate-change-fight-virginia-lawmakers-commit-to-clean-car-standards/" target="_blank">adopted California vehicle standards</a> intended to encourage the transition away from internal combustion engines, Republicans and Gov. Glenn Youngkin have pledged to roll back the move following the Golden State&#8217;s announcement that it will <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/08/26/californias-2035-ban-on-new-gas-powered-cars-set-to-apply-to-virginia/" target="_blank">ban the sale of new gas-powered cars beginning in 2035</a>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“States still play a leadership role in ensuring this EV transition is smooth and easy for consumers and beneficial for the economy,” Baldwin said. “Now is a great time to step up to the plate and take action.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">States can also take a cue from the federal government, which created the Joint Office of Energy and Transportation, linking the U.S. departments of Transportation and Energy to help coordinate efforts around clean transportation, said Bast, the former Virginia official, noting that many state agencies don’t have experience working together on issues like charging infrastructure, which incorporates the electric grid, the road system and other policy areas. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The investments in the infrastructure law and the Inflation Reduction Act really throw the window open for state and local policy action,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State and local governments can take the lead by electrifying their own fleets, examining permitting regimes for charging infrastructure, linking charging companies and potential host businesses as well as identifying communities that might be eligible for charging infrastructure grants. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Your work will either make it easier for EVs or harder for EVs,” he said. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How broad a role it should play, however, is a matter of debate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. Department of Energy is looking to dole out $7 billion from last year’s bipartisan infrastructure law that could fund </span><a href="https://www.energy.gov/oced/regional-clean-hydrogen-hubs" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">up to 10 </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">regional clean hydrogen hubs, defined as “a network of clean hydrogen producers, potential clean hydrogen consumers and connective infrastructure located in close proximity” to be sited across the country. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The H2Hubs will be a central driver in helping communities across the country benefit from clean energy investments, good-paying jobs and improved energy security – all while supporting President Biden’s goal of a net-zero carbon economy by 2050,” the department said in </span><a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/biden-harris-administration-announces-historic-7-billion-funding-opportunity-jump-start" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a news release </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">last month, calling the federal cash infusion one of the largest in the DOE’s history.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That pool of money joins provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act – which created a clean </span><a href="https://www.bakerbotts.com/thought-leadership/publications/2022/august/clean-hydrogen-and-fuel-cell-incentives-in-the-inflation-reduction-act-of-2022" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hydrogen production</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> tax credit and enacted big changes in </span><a href="https://time.com/6205570/inflation-reduction-act-carbon-capture/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">carbon capture tax credits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – that could also boost hydrogen. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Some states are going to be motivated by climate goals. Hydrogen is an important tool for achieving those climate goals,” said Bryan Willson, a professor of mechanical engineering and executive director of the Energy Institute at Colorado State University. “Others are really motivated by economic development, and hydrogen represents a tremendous new business opportunity.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Willson is also the director of the </span><a href="https://rangecollaborative.org/about-us/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rocky Mountain Alliance for Next Generation Energy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which is made up of universities and national labs from four western states that are providing technical support to the effort to create the Western Interstate Hydrogen Hub, </span><a href="https://energyoffice.colorado.gov/sites/energyoffice/files/documents/FINAL%20Western%20Inter-States%20Hydrogen%20Hub%20MOU.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a collaboration</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> between Colorado, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming, two red states and two blue ones.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Matt Fry, a senior policy manager focusing on carbon management at the nonprofit </span><a href="https://betterenergy.org/who-we-are/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Great Plains Institute</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and a former adviser to Republican Wyoming Gov. Matt Mead, said even conservative states have come around on the need to capture carbon and the obvious effects of a changing climate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We know that this is what we’re going to have to do,” he said. “We’ll utilize hydrogen as we bridge from a more fossil-fuel-based economy to a more electrified economy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similar hub agreements have been made between </span><a href="https://gov.louisiana.gov/index.cfm/newsroom/detail/3587" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Louisiana, Oklahoma and Arkansas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">; </span><a href="https://www.governor.nd.gov/sites/www/files/documents/10.05.2022%20Heartland%20Hydrogen%20Hub%20MOU.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota and Wisconsin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.coneg.org/new-york-leads-consortium-with-other-northeast-states-to-develop-a-regional-hydrogen-hub-proposal/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey and New York</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Minnesota and Wisconsin have a separate </span><a href="https://governor.ky.gov/attachments/MidwesternHydrogenCoalitionMOU.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">memorandum of understanding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan and Ohio aimed at “accelerating and improving” clean hydrogen production. And </span><a href="https://oregoncapitalchronicle.com/2022/09/13/oregon-washington-hope-to-make-northwest-the-u-s-leader-of-green-hydrogen-energy/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oregon and Washington</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are also collaborating to create a Pacific Northwest hub.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other states, like </span><a href="https://www.governor.pa.gov/newsroom/bipartisan-support-continues-for-gov-wolf-clean-hydrogen-hub-ambitions/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pennsylvania</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.axios.com/local/atlanta/2022/06/07/georgia-coalition-hydrogen-hub" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Georgia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, have launched efforts to create hubs on their own.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The hubs are trying to focus on areas where you have resources to produce it, resources to use it and resources to balance that supply and demand,” said Jeffery Preece, director of research and development at the Electric Power Research Institute. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re still working on where and how to deploy hydrogen in a decarbonized future. It’s important to bring stakeholders together &#8230; to figure this out. Getting it focused in hubs helps to really find those ways where we’re challenged with limitations on infrastructure today.”</span></p>
<p><b>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Why hydrogen?</h4>

	 </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s a consensus that hydrogen, which releases</span> <a href="https://www.edf.org/blog/2022/03/07/hydrogen-climate-solution-leaks-must-be-tackled#:~:text=While%20carbon%20dioxide%20can%20be,used%20in%20a%20fuel%20cell." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">no carbon emissions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when burned, could be a major part of addressing hard-to-decarbonize portions of the economy in which electrification isn’t feasible, including </span><a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/hydrogen-key-decarbonizing-global-shipping-industry" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">shipping</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.airbus.com/en/innovation/zero-emission/hydrogen" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">aviation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, heavy ground transportation </span><a href="https://www.railwayage.com/mechanical/locomotives/cps-hydrogen-locomotive-powers-up/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">like rail</span></a>,<span style="font-weight: 400;"> and industries such as </span><a href="https://cen.acs.org/environment/green-chemistry/steel-hydrogen-low-co2-startups/99/i22#:~:text=The%20Hydrogen%20Breakthrough%20Ironmaking%20Technology,hydrogen%20created%20with%20renewable%20electricity." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">steelmaking</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and cement.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Hydrogen fuel cells can </span><a href="https://www.ornl.gov/news/heavy-duty-vehicles-ideal-entry-hydrogen-fuel-cell-use" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">power heavy vehicles</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> like long-haul tractor-trailers that need greater range than batteries can currently provide, or hydrogen </span><a href="https://us.orsted.com/renewable-energy-solutions/power-to-x?gclid=Cj0KCQjw48OaBhDWARIsAMd966ADuxhWGzTbJMFjPIHMooP4EfC7-UZMWMcgV2g_GRm6nKV2u5kWMiIaArlXEALw_wcB" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">can be used</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to produce fuels compatible with existing internal combustion engines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It can also be blended — </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/energyinnovation/2022/03/29/gas-utility-hydrogen-proposals-ignore-a-superior-decarbonization-pathway-electrification/?sh=27e3561376a1" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">up to a certain point</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> currently — with natural gas to burn in gas turbines for electric generation. In what it called the largest test of its kind, Georgia Power </span><a href="https://www.georgiapower.com/company/news-center/2022-articles/georgia-power-mitsubishi-power-epri-complete-worlds-largest-hydrogen-fuel-blending-at-plant-mcdonough-atkinson.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported in June</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that it was able to burn a 20% hydrogen blend in one of the turbines at its Plant McDonough-Atkinson natural gas power plant outside Atlanta, achieving a 7% reduction in CO2 emissions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But how clean hydrogen is depends on how it’s produced. Right now </span><a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/fuelcells/hydrogen-production-natural-gas-reforming" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">most hydrogen</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the U.S. is produced using steam methane reforming via natural gas, so-called “</span><a href="https://www.h2bulletin.com/knowledge/hydrogen-colours-codes/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">grey” hydrogen</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “Green” hydrogen is produced by an electrolysis process with clean energy. “Blue” hydrogen is fossil-fuel derived but coupled with</span><a href="https://www.nationalgrid.com/stories/energy-explained/what-is-ccs-how-does-it-work" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> carbon capture</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, in which CO2 that would normally go up a smokestack or flue is filtered out of emissions and </span><a href="https://www.netl.doe.gov/sites/default/files/2018-11/Citronelle-SECARB-Project.PDF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">stored underground</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, though there are increasingly more efforts to find</span><a href="https://www.energy.gov/fecm/carbon-utilization" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> beneficial uses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for that carbon.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s precious little green or blue hydrogen being produced at the moment, but Willson said the money for hydrogen hubs, production tax credits and the Department of Energy’s “</span><a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/fuelcells/hydrogen-shot" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hydrogen shot</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” an initiative to reduce the cost of hydrogen produced from renewable energy from the current cost of about $5 per kilogram to $1 per kilogram over the next decade, could change that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Right now there’s no question that hydrogen from fossil resources is cheaper,” he said. “But as the cost of renewables continues to drop and the cost of hydrogen continues to come down, the case for green hydrogen becomes pretty compelling.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given that dynamic, though, environmental groups worry that pushing to use hydrogen in scenarios in which renewable power and electrification (such as for </span><a href="https://www.nationalgrid.com/stories/energy-explained/heating-our-homes-hydrogen" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">home heating</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and appliances like stoves) make more sense could wind up prolonging the life of fossil fuels, particularly natural gas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In general, when it comes to hydrogen, we feel that there are some good opportunities there and there are also some very bad possibilities depending on how this is implemented,” said Patrick Drupp, the Sierra Club’s deputy legislative director for climate and clean air.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drupp noted that the political wrangling over the infrastructure bill produced some constraints for the Department of Energy as it evaluates hydrogen hub proposals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Certain things were mandated in the legislation that we don’t agree with,” he said. “The DOE should focus on things where hydrogen has the best possible outcomes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, </span><a href="https://oced-exchange.energy.gov/FileContent.aspx?FileID=e159ff1f-5572-437e-b02d-b68acb461893" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">at least one</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> hub must demonstrate the production of hydrogen from fossil fuels (with carbon capture), one must be from nuclear and one must be from renewable energy. They must also be located in different regions of the U.S. “and shall use energy resources that are abundant in that region, including at least two H2Hubs in regions with abundant natural gas resources,” DOE documents state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building out a large hydrogen economy, with its unique storage and transportation requirements, Drupp noted, will require expensive infrastructure like new pipelines to handle high concentrations of hydrogen being blended into the natural gas system. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of March, natural gas and electric utilities had proposed more than two dozen pilot projects related to producing and distributing hydrogen for electric generation, heating buildings or other uses, according to a</span><a href="https://energyinnovation.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Assessing-the-Viability-of-Hydrogen-Proposals.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Energy Innovation, Policy &amp; Technology, a nonpartisan energy and climate policy think tank. Blending hydrogen with natural gas for those purposes would do little to curb greenhouse gas emissions and might “thwart more viable decarbonization pathways while increasing consumer costs, exacerbating air pollution and imposing safety risks,” the report warned.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “There’s a lot of money out there,” Drupp said. “The gas industry sees the writing on the wall and sees this as an opportunity to prolong their industry.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">President Joe Biden’s administration laid out </span><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/09/15/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-new-actions-to-expand-u-s-offshore-wind-energy/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ambitious additional goals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last month to boost offshore wind power generation, one of the American renewable energy industry’s emerging wide open frontiers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The federal announcements come as coastal states across the country are increasingly setting offshore wind energy targets, seeking to capture not just clean energy but the potentially big economic benefits of their ports serving as hubs for the </span><a href="http://www.chouest.com/press/windfarm-service-operation-vessel.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">vessels</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/10/25/siemens-gamesa-chooses-virginia-for-offshore-wind-turbine-blade-factory/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> blade manufacturing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.live5news.com/2021/11/09/graham-attend-opening-one-of-a-kind-charleston-renewable-energy-plant/" target="_blank">cables</a> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and other infrastructure needed to get turbines more than </span><a href="https://newatlas.com/energy/vineyard-wind-ge-haliade-x-turbine/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">850 feet tall </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">installed miles out at sea. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But amid news releases touting megawatt targets and jobs, there’s been less attention on the challenge of bringing all that electricity ashore and connecting it to a grid that was designed to bring power to the coast, not the other way around.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is so exciting to see the goals put forward and it’s a great signal and clear signal to the industry,” said Maddy Urbish, head of government affairs and market strategy for New Jersey at Ørsted North America. The Danish company, a </span><a href="https://orsted.com/en/our-business/offshore-wind#:~:text=%C3%98rsted%20leads%20the%20way&amp;text=Our%20ambition%20is%20to%20have,offshore%20wind%20capacity%20by%202030.&amp;text=Since%20pioneering%20the%20world's%20first,the%20world%20several%20times%20over." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">world leader in offshore wind</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, currently has 5,000 megawatts of projects </span><a href="https://us.orsted.com/renewable-energy-solutions/offshore-wind#project-list" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">under development or under construction</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in U.S. waters.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So that’s incredibly encouraging and exciting for the industry. When we get down to the challenges we see from the grid it becomes immediately less sexy,” Urbish said. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">A sea change </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With nearly </span><a href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/shorelength.html#:~:text=NOAA's%20official%20value%20for%20the,U.S.%20shoreline%20is%2095%2C471%20miles" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">95,500 miles</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of coastline and steady wind resources offshore, developers like Ørsted see vast potential in the U.S. market. The U.S. Department of Energy has estimated that domestic offshore wind generation potential is </span><a href="https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2016/09/f33/National-Offshore-Wind-Strategy-report-09082016.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">roughly equal to double</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the nation’s total electric demand. What’s more, about 80% of U.S. electric load is in coastal or Great Lakes states near offshore wind resources.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve significantly increased our workforce here in the U.S. and that’s in direct response to the potential here,” Urbish said. “The U.S. is a key market for Ørsted at this point.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Massachusetts is contracting for 5,600 megawatts of offshore wind </span><a href="https://www.mass.gov/news/offshore-wind-update" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">by 2027</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Maine says its initial goal of 5,000 megawatts by 2030 is “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.maine.gov/energy/initiatives/offshorewind#:~:text=Maine's%20Ocean%20Energy%20Task%20Force,of%20offshore%20wind%20by%202030." target="_blank">not realistic at this point”</a> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">but still considers offshore wind “one of our state’s largest untapped clean energy resources.” Louisiana, with a large skilled offshore oil and gas workforce that is </span><a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/gulf-oil-industry-embraces-offshore-wind-to-a-point/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">partially repositioning</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for offshore wind, aims for</span> <a href="https://lailluminator.com/2022/07/25/offshore-wind-farm-proposed-for-gulf-of-mexico-near-galveston-could-power-2-3-million-homes/" target="_blank">5,000 megawatts of offshore wind by 2035</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in its most recent climate plan. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And the new Inflation Reduction Act </span><a href="https://coastalreview.org/2022/08/new-law-repeals-offshore-wind-energy-lease-moratorium/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">undoes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a Trump administration moratorium on federal offshore wind leases in the Southeast, potentially opening up new opportunities for Georgia, the Carolinas and Florida, though the Sunshine State’s potential is seen as limited because of a lack of strong, sustained winds near the coast.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, getting all that power to electric consumers will require billions in upgrades to the electric grid and a whole lot better regional planning by states and grid operators, experts say.  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Offshore wind is big,” said Simon Mahan, executive director of the Southern Renewable Energy Association, a trade group for large renewable energy and energy storage companies. “When you bring it ashore it’s gonna have an effect on nearby generation regardless of market structure. They’re the size of nuclear reactors. … So it’s really important to do good studies.” </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘A big job’</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Until fairly recently, renewable energy advocates said there had been less emphasis by policymakers and </span><a href="https://minnesotareformer.com/2022/09/26/amid-a-massive-american-clean-energy-shift-grid-operators-play-catch-up/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">grid managers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on transmission infrastructure upgrades and the comprehensive regional planning needed to make mass offshore wind a reality, though the federal government and states are starting to come to grips with the scope of the problem. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There needs to be a lot more done than what’s being done right now and people are starting to realize that,” said Walt Musial, principal engineer and offshore wind platform lead at the</span><a href="https://www.nrel.gov/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> National Renewable Energy Laboratory</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “The integration of this is going to be a big job and something we have to start working on soon. These transmission projects can take longer to build than the plants themselves.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With relatively small, </span><a href="https://dwwind.com/project/block-island-wind-farm/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">stand-alone wind projects</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it’s often feasible for developers to find their own solutions to interconnection, said Mike Jacobs, a senior analyst with the Union of Concerned Scientists who focuses on renewable energy and the electric grid. Indeed, wind developers with projects further along in the pipeline can take advantage of old thermal generation sites — like Ørsted plans to do with the former </span><a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/national-international/changing-climate/how-an-offshore-wind-farm-will-come-onshore-in-ocean-city-nj/3170444/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">B.L. England coal-fired power plant</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Upper Township, New Jersey, south of Atlantic City — as points of interconnection because of the existing grid infrastructure there. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But with the potential scale of American offshore wind energy and the huge targets proposed by states like New Jersey, project-by-project transmission solutions won’t work, Jacobs said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Now you talk about 1,000 megawatts at a time. And New Jersey wants 10 of those. The transmission needed to be upscaled on shore is significant and needs to reach further inland,” he said. “The cable you brought to the nearest connection point from water to land is going to run into something that’s going to be inadequate and needs to be upscaled.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘Better than nothing’</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That means billions of dollars in upgrades will be necessary to accommodate the offshore wind buildout contemplated by state and federal leaders. In Virginia, Dominion Energy, the state’s largest utility, estimates the transmission upgrades required as part of its $10 billion 2,640 megawatt wind installation will be about 16 to 17% of the total project cost, a company spokesman said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PJM Interconnection, which runs the electric grid in all or parts of Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia, estimated that injecting offshore wind generation (it studied scenarios ranging from 6,416 megawatts up to 17,016 megawatts) into the existing onshore transmission system, as well as meeting other renewable energy goals of the states it serves, would require anywhere from $627 million in a short-term scenario to as much as $3.2 billion in long-term scenarios, per </span><a href="https://pjm.com/-/media/library/reports-notices/special-reports/2021/20211019-offshore-wind-transmission-study-phase-1-results.ashx" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> released last year. That study only examined upgrades that would be necessary for existing infrastructure, not any “sea-to-shore or any offshore transmission networks.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They do require a fair amount of upgrades to the traditional land-based transmission system,” said Ray DePillo, director of development for offshore wind for PSE&amp;G, New Jersey’s largest utility. “That’s a lot of megawatts to put into a single point or multiple points into the transmission system.” </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_33229" class="wp-caption alignright" style="max-width:100%;width:300px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/anatomy_wind_energy.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-33229 size-medium" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/anatomy_wind_energy-300x188.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="188" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/anatomy_wind_energy-300x188.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/anatomy_wind_energy.jpg 648w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Offshore wind coastal interconnection points identified by PJM in a 2021 study. (Image courtesy of PJM Interconnection)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PSE&amp;G has partnered with Ørsted on </span><a href="https://coastalwindlink.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coastal Wind Link</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a series of offshore stations that will connect multiple wind farms to the grid at a single onshore point rather than having every offshore wind farm connect using its own cable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That proposal is among a series of transmission bids New Jersey’s Board of Public Utilities will consider under a deal it reached with PJM Interconnection. Generally, PJM would be responsible for planning transmission upgrades and allocating costs to accommodate individual offshore wind generation projects as part of the interconnection process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But with a giant backlog in PJM’s interconnection queue driven by a flood of new renewable projects and an overhaul underway, New Jersey and PJM negotiated the State Agreement Approach, which “enables a state, or group of states, to propose a project to assist in realizing state public policy requirements as long as the state (or states) agrees to pay all costs of any state-selected build-out.” PJM in turn is seeking transmission bids on the state’s behalf in coordination with the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities. It received more than 80 proposals ranging in cost from $1.2 billion to more than $7 billion, depending on various scenarios, PJM said, though those costs don’t necessarily include onshore upgrades. The board will ultimately decide what gets built.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“New Jersey came to realize that if they wanted to do this large and fast they had to take the matter into hand,” Jacobs said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New Jersey ratepayers will shoulder the cost of the transmission upgrades themselves, even though those grid improvements may have broader benefits for reliability beyond the state’s borders. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is a good news and bad news story,” Jacobs said. “The benefits from New Jersey doing this will flow beyond New Jersey. … What we’re doing is having the states fill a gap that was not expected and should not need to be done.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rob Gramlich, founder and president of consulting firm Grid Strategies, called the solution “highly suboptimal.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But I agree with New Jersey that although it’s suboptimal it’s better than nothing,” he said. </span></p>
<p>At the heart of the friction is the traditional guiding principle of interconnection, that new generators should pay for the transmission upgrades necessary to connect them to the grid because grid managers like PJM haven’t generally looked for broader benefits to the system, critics say.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That model was tolerable when the new generators were large gas power plants that could be sited close to existing interconnection points and high voltage lines, but not so much now with hundreds of smaller, more diffuse solar and wind projects that are trying to connect to the grid, Gramlich added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The flaws of that system are now quite evident to everybody,” he said. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Tackling transmission</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.ferc.gov/news-events/news/ferc-issues-transmission-nopr-addressing-planning-cost-allocation" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A new proposed rule</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission aims to better quantify the broader benefits of transmission upgrades, which some renewable energy proponents say could grease the wheels for the buildout required to decarbonize the grid. And the recently passed Inflation Reduction Act includes $100 million </span><a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IN/IN11980" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">specifically earmarked</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for offshore wind transmission planning, modeling and analysis. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The fact of the matter is we need more studies, we don’t know what we don’t know,” said Mahan of the Southern Renewable Energy Association. “The IRA funding is there to help solve some of this problem.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are ongoing studies as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Melinda Marquis, offshore wind grid integration lead at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, is leading a Department of Energy </span><a href="https://www.nrel.gov/wind/atlantic-offshore-wind-transmission-study.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> expected to be finished next year that will identify optimal interconnection points along the Atlantic coast. It’s one of several seeking answers to how best to incorporate offshore wind into the grid, Marquis said, and states like New York, which is pushing for 9,000 megawatts of offshore wind by 2035, have done their </span><a href="https://www.nyserda.ny.gov/All-Programs/Offshore-Wind/About-Offshore-Wind/Master-Plan" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">own studies. </span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The way offshore has been deployed in the North Sea, in England for instance, is the same way the very early offshore wind plants in the U.S. are developing. That is where each offshore wind plant builds one radial connection to shore. … So each developer is picking the cheapest, best place to inject the power,” Marquis said. “There’s a limited number of points of interconnection along the Atlantic.” </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_33230" class="wp-caption alignright" style="max-width:100%;width:300px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Wind-pipeline-activity.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-33230" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Wind-pipeline-activity-300x233.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="233" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Wind-pipeline-activity-300x233.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Wind-pipeline-activity.jpg 512w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  (Image courtesy of National Renewable Energy Laboratory via the U.S. Department of Energy)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right now, there aren’t many incentives for developers to share interconnection and transmission infrastructure, Marquis said. Her group’s study will quantify costs under various build-out scenarios, compare different transmission technologies, explore implications for grid reliability and examine effects on marine life and fisheries. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The ocean is really a pretty crowded place,” she said, adding that the study is incorporating data on marine sanctuaries, national wildlife refuges, reefs, sea floor sediment, shipping lanes, fishing grounds and military areas, among others. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We hope that the results of our study will be very helpful for the people who make decisions about the way transmission is expanded, how it is built, and we hope this will lead to a very resilient, reliable grid, with a very low cost to the ratepayer that minimizes impact on marine species and the marine environment,” Marquis said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She noted that representatives from major U.S. utilities and grid operators are participating in the study. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Department of Energy really understands this and they’re funding us to tackle this,” she said. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘All of the above’</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, similar to New Jersey, other states are realizing the importance of taking the lead on transmission planning. New York wants offshore wind projects connecting to shore to be </span><a href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-hochul-announces-new-yorks-third-offshore-wind-solicitation-accelerate-clean-energy" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“meshed ready</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” which means being able to share sea-to-shore connection infrastructure among </span><a href="https://www.nexans.com/en/nexans_blog/nexans_blog_posts/meshed-offshore-grids-are-set-to-power-the-global-energy-transition.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">different offshore wind plants</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> rather than each one having a separate connection to shore. PJM says it’s talking with other states about how to upgrade transmission to meet their energy goals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have had exploratory discussions with our states to pursue similar goals like NJ but nothing formalized yet,” Ken Seiler, vice president of planning, said last month, adding that the grid operator is at work on the second phase of a regional wind study “meant to identify regional transmission solutions to offshore wind and all other renewable portfolio development planned for by the states.” PJM’s counterpart in the middle of the country, MISO, </span><a href="https://fresh-energy.org/whats-up-with-miso-the-midcontinent-independent-system-operator" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">which covers an area stretching from Minnesota to Louisiana</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, says its transmission planning has been all land-based and there are no offshore wind projects in its interconnection queue. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“However, MISO is equipped to study and evaluate any offshore projects that may be submitted in the future,” said Brandon Morris, a spokesman for the organization.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And last month, five New England states, including Maine and New Hampshire, issued a joint “</span><a href="https://newenglandenergyvision.files.wordpress.com/2022/09/transmission-rfi-notice-of-proceeding-and-scoping.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">request for information</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” seeking comments from offshore wind developers, the electric transmission industry and others “regarding changes and upgrades to the regional electric transmission system needed to integrate renewable energy resources, including but not limited to offshore wind resources, as well as significant other new renewable resources” into the grid.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think this happens with all of the above, to use an energy cliche,” said Jacobs. “We will have some of the developers go ahead because they’re impatient and find the opportunities to build their own connections. We will have an institutional approach where we get the federal government and the regional operators to do what they are mandated already to do which is plan for a reliable, consumer friendly open access system. All this will happen because the states will present a credible threat to these institutions that are supposed to be doing it in the first place.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the better part of the past century, the American electric power system evolved around large, mostly fossil fuel power plants delivering electricity to residences, businesses and industry through a network of transmission and distribution wires that collectively came to be called the electric grid.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But as the </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/energy-environment/2018/11/23/major-trump-administration-climate-report-says-damages-are-intensifying-across-country/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">threat of climate change</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> driven by carbon pollution becomes more dire and as technological advances make wind, solar and battery storage </span><a href="https://www.popsci.com/story/environment/cheap-renewable-energy-vs-fossil-fuels/#:~:text=When%20it%20comes%20to%20the,cheapened%20at%20a%20blistering%20pace." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ever cheaper</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> options, states, corporations and voters are increasingly pushing to aggressively decarbonize the grid.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Power generation resulted in more than 1.7 billion short tons of carbon dioxide emissions in 2020, according to the</span> <a href="https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=74&amp;t=11#:~:text=In%202020%2C%20total%20U.S.%20electricity,carbon%20dioxide%20(CO2)." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Energy Information Administration</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and accounted for about </span><a href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a quarter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of all U.S. carbon emissions. Transportation contributes another 27%, and policies to speed up electric vehicle adoption, including in the recently passed </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/08/19/1118519199/what-the-inflation-reduction-act-means-for-electric-car-buyers-and-auto-companie" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inflation Reduction Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, rely on the electricity needed to charge all those battery-powered cars being produced cleanly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thirty states and Washington, D.C., have active renewable or clean energy requirements, and three other states have voluntary renewable energy goals, </span><a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/energy/renewable-portfolio-standards.aspx" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">per the National Conference of State Legislatures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And </span><a href="https://www.epa.gov/greenpower/green-power-partnership-fortune-500r-partners-list" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">major corporations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — from Amazon, Target and Microsoft to Boeing and Google — are also increasingly becoming major green power consumers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That collective momentum has led to a flood of renewable energy development — thousands of projects, </span><a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/have-some-renewable-energy-an-investor-would-like-to-speak-with-you/619718/#:~:text=U.S.%20battery%20storage%2C%20smart%20grid,the%20sector%20crashed%2C%20Prabhu%20said." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">billions of dollars in capital</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and thousands of </span><a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/doe-report-finds-energy-jobs-grew-faster-overall-us-employment-2021" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">jobs</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">— but getting that electricity to customers is more complicated than just building solar panels and wind turbines. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Millions of American electric customers are in territories managed by entities called regional transmission organizations or independent system operators, which are tasked with managing the flow of electricity across the grid, running electric markets, ensuring reliability and overseeing new interconnections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And while grid operators say they’re doing their best to manage the renewables transition while ensuring reliability and keeping costs stable, critics contend they’ve been caught flatfooted and are only just now coming to grips with the new demands of a changing power system on their markets and interconnection queues. That’s creating a bottleneck that’s holding up thousands of projects that could help create a cleaner and more resilient grid and tripping up state clean power goals.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Running the grid</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) created standards for regional transmission organizations in a </span><a href="https://www.ferc.gov/sites/default/files/2020-06/RM99-2-00K_1.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1999 order</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, in part to spur better regional grid management and more competitive </span><a href="https://learn.pjm.com/electricity-basics/market-for-electricity.aspx#:~:text=The%20wholesale%20market%20begins%20with,to%20meet%20end%2Duser%20demand." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wholesale electric markets</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are currently seven regional transmission organizations or independent system operators operating in the United States. The biggest, PJM, is one of the largest wholesale electric markets in the world and coordinates the movement of electricity in all or parts of 13 states and Washington, D.C., a territory that numbers 65 million people. Roughly two-thirds of American electric customers live in an area where service is managed by a regional transmission organization (RTO) or an independent system operator (ISO), according to the </span><a href="https://www.epa.gov/green-power-markets/power-market-structure" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Environmental Protection Agency</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_33142" class="wp-caption alignright" style="max-width:100%;width:512px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/NERC_grid_chart.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-33142" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/NERC_grid_chart.jpg" alt="" width="512" height="167" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/NERC_grid_chart.jpg 512w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/NERC_grid_chart-300x98.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  How the electric grid works. (North American Electric Reliability Corporation)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the West and Southeast, customers are generally served by traditional utilities that are typically vertically integrated (meaning they’re responsible for generating, transmitting and distributing electricity to their customers) and do their own planning and trade power with each other, but not as part of an organized market like an RTO, said Seth Blumsack, a professor of energy policy and economics at Penn State.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The differences between an RTO and ISO are largely technical. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They functionally do the same thing nowadays,” said Jeff Dennis, managing director and general counsel of Advanced Energy Economy, a trade group that represents more than 100 companies working in energy efficiency, demand response, energy storage, solar, wind, hydro, nuclear, electric vehicles, biofuels and smart grid technologies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There are sort of three reasons they matter: markets, transmission and reliability,” said Casey Roberts, a senior attorney with the Sierra Club. “Those markets and how they’re designed determine what revenue generators earn and how often they run.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because they’re charged with managing the grid and ensuring reliability, RTOs and ISOs also oversee new connections for power generators. And across the country, they’ve been buried in the past several years by an avalanche of interconnection requests from wind, solar and increasingly battery storage developers, spurred by how cheap those generation sources have become and also as a result of states’ clean energy policies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A number of these RTOs have decision systems that were designed for a bygone era of the grid,” Blumsack said. “They were sort of designed when your market participants were transmission owners, big generation owners, utilities. As you have mandates for new technologies and all these new market actors emerging, it’s been hard for some RTOs to integrate them.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The queue blues</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most conspicuous examples of that dynamic have been the interconnection queues, in which thousands of projects, mostly wind and solar, </span><a href="https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/02/14/interconnection-delays-and-costs-are-the-biggest-barrier-for-utility-scale-renewables-say-developers/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">languish</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> while waiting for approval to connect to the grid. There’s been little regional and interregional transmission expansion in the past decade, said John Moore, director of the Natural Resources Defense Council’s Sustainable FERC Project. For example, wind energy is </span><a href="https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/wind/where-wind-power-is-harnessed.php" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">abundant in parts of the Midwest and West</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but it needs long-range transmission lines to </span><a href="https://missouriindependent.com/2022/07/11/grain-belt-express-announces-expansion-that-means-more-clean-energy-for-missouri/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">get it to population centers</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">that comprise the bulk of the electric load.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With all of those pressures on the grid, it was to some extent predictable but unfortunate that we’re at this point — with a big backlog and delays for renewable projects,” Moore said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developers also in many cases can’t get good information on the costs of that connection and any associated grid upgrades they’ll be required to pay for prior to application, Roberts and </span><a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/energy-transition-interconnection-reform-ferc-qcells/628822/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">other critics</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> say, leading to developers filing for multiple projects just to find the best place to site a single solar array, for example.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Usually developers don’t start putting steel in the ground until they have the results of their interconnection study,” Roberts said. “Sometimes the interconnection costs can be more than 50% of the project cost.”</span></p>

(Source: Federal Energy Regulatory Commission)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many grid operators have struggled to manage their interconnection queues. The Midcontinent Independent System Operator, or MISO, which encompasses part or all of 15 states stretching from Minnesota to Louisiana, has</span><a href="https://cdn.misoenergy.org/GIQ%20Web%20Overview272899.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> hundreds of mostly wind and solar projects</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in its interconnection queue that amounted to a capacity of more than 118,000 megawatts as of Sept. 19. However, MISO got an interconnection reform plan approved by the FERC earlier this year that is intended to</span><a href="https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/ferc-approves-miso-plan-to-expedite-interconnection-timelines-for-new-generators-69380972" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> streamline the process</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But nowhere has the problem been more pronounced than within PJM, which is headquartered near Philadelphia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They exist in many, many places in the country,” said Dennis of Advanced Energy Economy. “PJM has just been the worst example in recent years.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of early September, PJM had more than 2,500 projects in its queue with a total capacity of more than 225,000 megawatts, according to Ken Seiler, PJM’s vice president of planning. For some perspective, that’s more than the maximum output of all the power generation in the PJM region right now (about </span><a href="https://www.pjm.com/~/media/about-pjm/newsroom/fact-sheets/pjm-at-a-glance.ashx" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">185,000 MW</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Here’s the crazy thing about the interconnection backlog that PJM finds themselves in,” said Lorig Charkoudian, a Democratic member of the Maryland House of Delegates whose district is just outside Washington. “PJM would tell you that what they do, what they take pride in, is they forecast and they plan. Here we have a situation where you could have absolutely forecast this moment if you wanted to.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Charkoudian, an economist, points to examples like PJM </span><a href="https://www.ncelenviro.org/app/uploads/2021/03/State-Legislative-Sign-on-Letter-to-PJM.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rules</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that have </span><a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/pjm-focused-mopr-takes-effect-ferc-capacity-market/607417/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">since been overhauled</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> but initially penalized renewable energy sources trying to participate in PJM’s capacity market. She also criticized the grid operator’s</span> <a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/is-the-bloom-off-the-regd-rose-for-battery-storage-in-pjm/503793/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">previous restrictions on battery storage</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as hindering Maryland and other states with aggressive plans to</span> <a href="https://governor.maryland.gov/session2020-environment/#:~:text=CARES%20embraces%20Maryland's%20clean%20and,100%25%20clean%20electricity%20by%202040." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">decarbonize</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You knew this moment was coming, you had a structure in place that was unworkable. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forecasting is what you do. Fix it. And fix it 10 years ago,” she said. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Reforms to the rescue?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PJM and other RTOs say they are.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The existing planning queue was designed to process larger, centralized generation resources that were far fewer in number,” said Seiler, the PJM vice president of planning. “It was also not designed to weed out the many speculative projects that may not have the financing or other means necessary to bring the project to completion.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A new interconnection process developed by a PJM task force </span><a href="https://insidelines.pjm.com/pjm-files-interconnection-process-reform-with-ferc/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">will shift</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to a “first-ready, first-served basis rather than first come, first-served.” The new framework also includes a “cluster” approach to studying interconnection costs, reducing the number of additional studies required when projects are modified and streamlining interconnections for projects “that do not contribute to the need for network upgrades.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Along with the process revisions, PJM studied more projects than all other RTOs combined in 2020 leading to 30,000 MW worth of generation completing the study process and having executed final agreements in hand. Despite this, only 1,500 MW worth of generation has gone commercial in 2022 as developers face additional challenges beyond the interconnection study process,” Seiler said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For some renewable developers, environmental advocates and state politicians, though, it’s an imperfect fix. For one, PJM is proposing to </span><a href="https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/02/03/pjm-flooded-with-interconnection-requests-proposes-two-year-review-pause/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">freeze</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> its queue for two years to work through the backlog, creating delays for projects that haven&#8217;t been filed yet. (By comparison, MISO is pushing to cut its interconnection application process </span><a href="https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/ferc-approves-miso-plan-to-expedite-interconnection-timelines-for-new-generators-69380972" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to about a year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, without any freeze on new requests.) Going forward, PJM envisions processing new interconnection requests within two years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In comments to the FERC, the Organization of PJM States, which represents state public service commissions in PJM territory, called the reforms a “step in the right direction” and a “considerable improvement to the existing processes which is hindering some states’ ability to achieve their policy goals.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, while the group encouraged FERC to approve the plan, it said it was “deeply concerned that, even under PJM’s proposed reforms, a project entering the queue today may not be able to achieve commercial operation until nearly 2030.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘A potential roadblock’ </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aside from the queue problems, critics say </span><a href="https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2019/11/26/biased-capacity-markets-accelerating-gas-over-solar-storage/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">capacity markets</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> like PJM’s, which are intended to ensure there’s enough available electricity to handle spikes in load, are tilted toward fossil fuel generators and allow old, inefficient and polluting power plants to limp along rather than be retired as well as charge electric customers for </span><a href="https://www.nrdc.org/experts/tom-rutigliano/lower-pjm-prices-show-promise-capacity-market-reform" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">capacity they don’t need</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In terms of what the role is, RTOs are both critically important for the clean energy transition, but also without reform of their markets a potential roadblock to the clean energy transition,” Dennis said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">RTO markets, Dennis said, were designed 20 to 25 years ago around the generation of the time, primarily coal, gas and nuclear power plants. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The resources that we will rely on in the future have different technical and operating characteristics,” he said. “That’s really where we are in a market like PJM. We’re trying to evolve these rules.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seiler, the PJM vice president, said the organization is “committed to a reliable energy transition as cost-effectively and reliably facilitating state decarbonization policies (and other state policies) through our competitive markets, operations and planning processes. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is at the heart of almost everything we do today.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘Steps in the right direction’</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For renewable energy developers and advocates, though, there are signs that RTOs are working better with states to help them meet their goals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MISO recently approved more than $10 billion for 18 transmission projects comprising more than 2,000 miles of transmission line in the upper Midwest, including in Michigan, Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri and the Dakotas. The </span><a href="https://cdn.misoenergy.org/MTEP21%20Addendum-LRTP%20Tranche%201%20Report%20with%20Executive%20Summary625790.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “represents the most complex transmission study effort in MISO’s history,” the grid operator said, and will provide a host of benefits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Carbon-free and clean energy goals set by MISO member utilities, state and municipal government policies and customer preferences continue to drive growth in wind, solar, battery and hybrid projects,” MISO said. “As the region faces both a changing resource fleet and increased prevalence of extreme weather events, the ability to move electricity from where it is generated to where it is needed most becomes paramount.”</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_33145" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:909px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/MISO_transmission.png" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-33145" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/MISO_transmission.png" alt="" width="909" height="715" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/MISO_transmission.png 909w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/MISO_transmission-300x236.png 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/MISO_transmission-768x604.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 909px) 100vw, 909px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  A slide from a MISO presentation details the benefits of more than $10 billion in new transmission projects. (MISO)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PJM also reached a novel deal with the </span><a href="https://www.nj.gov/bpu/about/divisions/ferc/saa.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Board of Public Utilities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in New Jersey, which has set an ambitious goal for offshore wind energy development of 7,500 megawatts by 2035. That deal will allow a “first-of-its-kind competitive transmission process” administered by PJM, which is expected to drive down costs of getting that wind-generated electricity to customers as long as New Jersey handles the bill within its own borders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The provision enables a state, or group of states, to propose a project to assist in realizing state public policy requirements as long as the state (or states) agrees to pay all costs of any state-selected build-out,” PJM said in a</span><a href="https://insidelines.pjm.com/ferc-accepts-pjm-njbpu-agreement-to-further-offshore-wind-goals/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> news release</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then there’s what Dennis, of Advanced Energy Economy, called an “aggressive agenda” by the FERC itself to help smooth the renewable transition for grid operators and developers alike. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A recent </span><a href="https://www.ferc.gov/media/order-no-841" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FERC order</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, for instance, directs RTOs and ISOs to remove barriers to electric market participation for energy storage, </span><a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/how-u.s-grid-operators-plan-to-tackle-energy-storage-at-gigawatt-scale" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a crucial technology</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for balancing the intermittent nature of wind and solar power.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And two other proposed major rules deal with </span><a href="https://www.ferc.gov/news-events/news/ferc-issues-transmission-nopr-addressing-planning-cost-allocation" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">transmission</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.ferc.gov/news-events/news/ferc-proposes-interconnection-reforms-address-queue-backlogs" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">interconnection</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, respectively.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Who pays for transmission is one of the biggest barriers to getting transmission built,” Dennis said. “FERC is trying to streamline that by determining who the beneficiaries are in a standardized way.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The hope is the change will head off one of the most common objections by states to new transmission — that their residents are paying for it without getting enough benefit, Dennis said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposed interconnection rule is aimed squarely at expediting the queue backlogs for connecting new electric generation to the grid.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“At the end of 2021, there were more than 1,400 gigawatts of generation and storage waiting in interconnection queues throughout the country. This is more than triple the total volume just five years ago. Projects now face an average timeline of more than three years to get connected to the grid,” FERC said in a June news release.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main components are: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A “first-ready, first-served” cluster study process in which large interconnection studies encompass multiple generating facilities rather than individual ones</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Firm deadlines and penalties if transmission providers fail to complete studies on time</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ability for multiple generators to share a single interconnection request and co-locate on a shared site</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Better modeling for how “non-synchronous” generating facilities like wind, solar and storage will actually perform when they connect to the grid </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They’re definitely both steps in the right direction,” said Roberts, the Sierra Club attorney. “It’s really important for FERC to set a baseline for transmission and interconnection that will work better for consumers.&#8221;</span></p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a sticky Sunday afternoon in August 1997, my dad and I parked along Jamestown Road in Williamsburg and got out for a brief, self-guided tour of William and Mary’s old campus. A dreamy, humid haze hung over the deserted place, with the Sunken Gardens and sylvan brick paths lush and late-summer green. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I said something like “looks nice” before hopping back in the car for the drive back to central New Jersey.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next time I was there was a year later, when I got off the train to report for the beginning of my freshman year at the nation’s second-oldest university. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ever since, I’ve been leaving (and coming back to) Virginia. This time, though — as my wife and I move our boys, calico cat and German shepherd to southern Illinois for work, family and other reasons — feels different. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And harder.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I launched my career in newspapers here in the Old Dominion as a freelancer at the Goochland Gazette in 2004, the latest in a series of odd jobs I’d taken in the years since I graduated, moved to Richmond and tried to figure out what to do with my life. (There was the radio station, the restaurants and bars, substitute teaching, armored car guarding and appliance delivery — all good post-graduate education in their own right.)</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_32567" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:300px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG_5508-1-scaled.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-32567" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG_5508-1-300x255.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="255" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG_5508-1-300x255.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG_5508-1-1024x870.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG_5508-1-768x652.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG_5508-1-1536x1305.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG_5508-1-2048x1739.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  The first news story the author ever published: in 2004 at the Goochland Gazette. (Robert Zullo/ Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I left Virginia for the first time not long after and got my first full-time reporting gig in northern New Jersey. I liked it so much I turned down a career in federal law enforcement to pursue what’s become 17 years in journalism so far. I landed next in south Louisiana, where I spent five years as a reporter and editor and, as happens sometimes, met a woman. (More on her later.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I came back to Virginia for the first time in 2012 to become the Richmond Times-Dispatch’s city hall reporter after years of trying to get hired at the paper. This was it, I thought. Finally, a job at a metro daily in a fun, up-and-coming city. But then that woman, a talented photojournalist who by now was working in Pittsburgh, and I got engaged. And her paper hated the idea of losing her so much that they decided to bring me up to the Steel City rather than risk her coming to Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So Julia and I got married, had our first son and became Pittsburgh Pirates fans. Then the well-known travails of the newspaper business caught up with the Post-Gazette and we got nervous about our job security. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Times-Dispatch graciously offered to bring me back, and there I was, back in Richmond, convinced I was here for good this time. (At a staff meeting, a TD exec even joked about it: “Are you gonna stay this time?”) My wife threw herself into a career as a freelance photojournalist, where </span><a href="https://www.wtvr.com/our-rva/their-historic-picture-went-viral-now-these-brown-ballerinas-are-making-an-impact" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">she helped chronicle</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the highs and lows in Virginia news over the past six years for The Washington Post, Reuters, The New York Times and other outlets, though she did manage to get herself</span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/insider/an-arrest-warrant-from-liberty-university-for-me.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">banned from Liberty University</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> along the way. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the Times-Dispatch, unfortunately, though, the layoffs started soon after I got back from Pittsburgh and haven’t really stopped since. So with a family and a mortgage, I was pondering getting out of the business when Julia came across a listing for what became the Virginia Mercury. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_224" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:4510px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/group.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-224" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/group.jpg" alt="" width="4510" height="3145" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/group.jpg 4510w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/group-300x209.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/group-768x536.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/group-1024x714.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/group-100x70.jpg 100w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/group-696x485.jpg 696w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/group-1068x745.jpg 1068w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/group-602x420.jpg 602w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/group-1920x1339.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 4510px) 100vw, 4510px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  The original Virginia Mercury staff in 2018.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The past four years have been the highlight of my professional life. I stressed endlessly before and during our launch over whether we’d be taken seriously, whether anyone would read us, whether our new model would be accepted and whether I was making a major career mistake and dragging others down with me. But it turns out, when you hire </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/mercury-takes-top-awards-at-press-competition/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">people</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who are </span><a href="https://www.thenews-gazette.com/content/oliver-wins-outstanding-journalist-award" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">good</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at what they do and let them write good stories, the rest tends to take care of itself. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have always asked readers to judge us by our journalism. And while the</span> <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/virginia-mercury-wins-11-first-place-awards-in-press-contest/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">awards </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span><a href="https://www.vpa.net/articles/virginia-press-association-names-virginia-mercury-reporter-2021-outstanding-young-journalist/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">accolades</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have been nice, the greatest satisfaction comes from seeing the Mercury republished in newspapers and websites across the states, having lawmakers cite our coverage in floor sessions and committee meetings and hearing that it’s useful for Virginians across the ideological spectrum. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many things broken in our culture and our politics. The newspaper industry, which has traditionally produced the bulk of the journalism so crucial to our civic life, continues its slow-motion demise. </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/07/21/lets-look-trust-news-media-equal-coverage/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trust in media</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is way down. Too often, we see preconceived narratives shaping coverage, with the reporting reverse-engineered accordingly. Too many readers on all sides of the political and cultural divides hunt for outlets and stories that affirm, rather than challenge, their view of the world. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Mercury, though, will be in good hands, and the commitment to fair, tough and factual reporting on the policy and politics that affect (and sometimes afflict) the commonwealth will remain. I know Sarah Vogelsong, who has been assuming her new role as editor in chief this month, will lead the outlet to bigger and better things. </span></p>
<p>https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/new-editor-to-lead-virginia-mercury/#:~:text=By%3A%20Staff%20Report%20%2D%20June%208%2C%202022%2012%3A02%20am&#038;text=Sarah%20Vogelsong%2C%20an%20award%2Dwinning,Virginia%20government%2C%20politics%20and%20policy.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In our family, it’s time to let someone else’s career drive the ship. I’m so proud of my wife, who has worked relentlessly to break into academia and will be joining the photojournalism faculty at Southern Illinois University in Carbondale, where she earned her master’s degree and where she grew up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for me, I’ll be going back to what drew me into this business in the first place: getting out of the office and reporting, this time for our parent organization, </span><a href="https://statesnewsroom.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">States Newsroom</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, on the electric grid and renewable energy as we stare down the menace of climate change. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s exciting but also bittersweet, that old cliché we still employ because nothing else (maybe there’s a German word?) really describes the mix of mirth and melancholy that comes with embracing something new and promising at the cost of leaving something (and someplace) you love behind. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And so here I am again. The house is (mostly) packed. The</span> <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/1157647293/richmond-sidewalk-chicken-bone-8x10" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">chicken bones</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bake on downtown sidewalks. The air is thick and the James is <a href="https://www.axios.com/local/richmond/2022/07/22/richmond-hottest-weekend-cooling-tips" target="_blank">bathtub warm</a>. The leafy vines choke the alleys in the Fan. Where I&#8217;m typing, south of the rivah, the cicadas chirp. The bats swoop at dusk. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just like when I decamped for Pittsburgh nine years ago. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe time </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">is</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a flat circle. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe one day I’ll be back. </span></p>

<p>U.S. Reps. Ben Cline, R-Botetourt, Bob Good, R-Campbell, and Morgan Griffith, R-Salem, joined 15 other GOP members to oppose <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-resolution/1130/text" target="_blank">the resolution</a>, which passed the House Monday with overwhelming bipartisan support in a <a href="https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2022364" target="_blank">394-18 vote</a>. The resolution expresses &#8220;support for the sovereign decision of Finland and Sweden to apply to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) as well as calling on all members of NATO to ratify the protocols of accession swiftly.&#8221;</p>
<p>https://twitter.com/RepDonBeyer/status/1527751355624042499?s=20&#038;t=I_IBuvCffB3P_5aqXxWt9w</p>
<p>The Nordic countries<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/erdogan-says-turkey-will-freeze-finland-swedens-nato-bids-if-promises-not-kept-2022-07-18/" target="_blank"> are seeking to join</a> the collective defense organization of 30 member countries in the wake of Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine.</p>
<p>Though he called Russian President Vladimir Putin a &#8220;tyrant&#8221; who is &#8220;ruthlessly destroying&#8221; Ukraine, in a statement to the Mercury Good said he voted against the resolution as a &#8220;no-confidence vote in the Biden administration&#8217;s failed foreign policy, including the lack of a coherent strategy for the $56 billion of our tax dollars being spent in Ukraine.&#8221;</p>
<p>Good said adding two countries to NATO &#8220;is only likely to escalate tensions with Russia and increase the chances President Biden will eventually be deploying American troops.&#8221;</p>
<p>Biden has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/31/opinion/biden-ukraine-strategy.html" target="_blank">repeatedly rejected</a> the possibility of sending U.S. troops to fight in Ukraine.</p>
<p>Griffith said in a statement that he wasn&#8217;t opposed to Finland and Sweden joining NATO but thought the House was overstepping its bounds.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Senate has the constitutional role to ratify or reject accession to NATO, but the House does not. The resolution in fact goes further than support for admitting Finland and Sweden to NATO by calling on the alliance’s other members to support it, too,&#8221; Griffith said. “Decisions about the future of NATO need to be made carefully and with a full consideration of the facts.&#8221;</p>
<p>Both Good and Griffith raised concerns about NATO members not meeting their <a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/07/11/628137185/fact-check-trumps-claims-on-nato-spending" target="_blank">defense spending obligations</a> — member nations agreed at a 2014 summit to spend 2 percent of GDP on defense by 2024 and most are not on target to do so— which was a frequent Trump-era punching bag.</p>
<p>&#8220;Although Finland meets the threshold of spending two percent of its GDP on defense, Sweden does not. Too many current members of the alliance do not meet this benchmark even though it was agreed upon in 2014. President Trump was right to urge countries to spend more on defense, and we should fix this major challenge to the alliance’s standing before NATO takes on more obligations,&#8221; Griffith said.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Cline did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday. The rest of Virginia&#8217;s delegation, including U.S. Rep. Rob Wittman, R-Montross, voted yes.</p>

Federal regulators and animal welfare groups have uncovered critical violations within the facility, including hundreds of puppy deaths with no causes listed. (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals)</p><p>A federal judge will allow Envigo — which is shutting down a controversial dog-breeding facility in Cumberland County under pressure from federal regulators because of a string of animal welfare violations— to sell more than 500 dogs to labs over the objections of the U.S. Department of Justice.</p>
<p>Federal attorneys seeking an injunction to enforce the terms of the act had argued that Envigo, which breeds the beagles for medical research, should be prohibited from selling the dogs since its had violated the terms of its license issued by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.</p>
<p>&#8220;While extraordinary relief is warranted to address defendant’s failure to meet its obligations under the AWA and to protect the animals at the Cumberland facility from further harm, equitable considerations do not justify an order that would prevent defendant from fulfilling its existing contracts,&#8221; U.S. District Judge Norman Moon wrote <a href="https://www.peta.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/PI-Order.pdf" target="_blank">in an order</a> granting the injunction.</p>
<p>In May, after years of violations and legislative debate in Virginia, including<a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/03/08/virginia-lawmakers-pass-new-regulations-for-controversial-beagle-breeding-facility/" target="_blank"> new regulations passed by the legislature</a> this year, federal agents <a href="https://www.peta.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/012-Joint-Motion-to-Extend-TRO.pdf" target="_blank">seized hundreds of dogs and puppies</a> found to be “in acute distress.”</p>
<p>In a statement, Daphna Nachminovitch, senior vice president of cruelty investigations for the Norfolk-based People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, said Inotiv, Envigo&#8217;s parent company, took in about $225 million in revenue in the past six months, less than 1 percent of which was from selling dogs.</p>
<p>&#8220;It wants to wring every last penny out of the exploitation of these long-neglected dogs, who have already been through so much,” Nachminovitch said. “Inotiv owes these beagles the opportunity to have what every dog deserves—the freedom to enjoy life in a loving home. It’s time for this company to finally do the right thing: Let all the dogs be adopted now.”</p>
<p>But Moon sided with Envigo, which argued that the research dogs are “exceedingly important to domestic pharmaceutical discovery and development,” noting that the Cumberland operation has produced &#8220;up to 25 percent of the domestic supply of beagles for research” and there aren&#8217;t enough animals to meet the demands of research institutions, according to court documents.</p>
<p>As condition of the injunction, however, Envigo won&#8217;t be able to transfer or euthanize any of the other 2,700 dogs at the facility without the approval of the Justice Department or the court, PETA said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It would appear they will be assessed for adoption candidacy, and that should become clear by mid next week,&#8221; Dan Paden, PETA&#8217;s vice president of evidence analysis, told the Mercury.</p>

(Alex Kent/ For the Tennessee Lookout)</p><p>It was not unlike the formulaic false ending in a horror movie.</p>
<p>You could have been forgiven for thinking the worst was over when the mob of MAGAns had been repulsed from the halls of the U.S. Capitol and Congress resumed its duty of certifying the presidential election returns last year.</p>
<p>But the spectacle of scores of Republicans — <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/01/08/cline-good-griffith-and-wittman-sided-with-the-mob-virginia-must-remember-it/" target="_blank">including</a> our lily-livered Virginia GOP delegation of Ben Cline, Bob Good, Morgan Griffith and Rob Wittman — voting last year against certifying the election results despite the chaos and violence they&#8217;d all just witnessed was the real-life equivalent of Michael Myers<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guY4cuELvLw" target="_blank"> rising zombie-like</a> from the floor.</p>
<p>We really should have seen it coming.</p>
<p>After all, what had the Trump years been for Republicans except a long, inexorable exercise in trading principle for political expediency? And though for<a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/05/13/chip-roy-leadership-donald-trump/" target="_blank"> a handful of them</a> Jan. 6, 2021, was a bridge too far, for most of the others it was just another occasion for dissembling, dodging and whatabouting that continues to this day.</p>
<p>https://twitter.com/RepBobGood/status/1479064191382216709?s=20</p>
<p>Rather than the pull-back-from-the-brink moment many of us hoped Jan. 6 would be, instead it has only become another <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/01/01/post-poll-january-6/" target="_blank">fault line</a> in our bitter polarization. And it&#8217;s reverberated in our national and state politics ever since.</p>
<p>Witness the delicate dance our new governor, Glenn Youngkin,<a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/after-months-of-refusing-to-say-biden-won-legitimately-youngkin-says-of-course/" target="_blank"> had to perform</a>, tiptoeing around &#8220;election integrity&#8221; until he was declared the winner of the Republican convention, a method the party had decided on because it could not, in fact, trust primary voters to select an electable candidate. Witness Del. Charles Poindexter, R-Franklin, a conservative who had been in the House of Delegates for 13 years,<a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/06/09/democratic-primary-voters-in-virginia-oust-some-of-general-assemblys-most-outspoken-delegates/" target="_blank"> felled in a primary</a> by a lawyer named Wren Williams who was Trump’s deputy legal counsel during the recount in Wisconsin, which cost the Trump campaign more than $3 million and ended up boosting President Joe Biden’s margin of victory. Williams deemed Poindexter insufficiently supportive of Trump&#8217;s Big Lie that the election was stolen from him.</p>
<p>“I guess the final straw for me is November came and went, then December, then January, and we didn’t hear a peep out of my delegate,” said Williams, who is joining the House of Delegates when it gavels in today. “Nothing about the election, nothing about Donald Trump, nothing about election integrity.”</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also new Del. Marie March, R-Floyd, who<a href="https://roanoke.com/news/local/embattled-christiansburg-restaurant-owner-takes-issue-with-blacksburg-lawmaker/article_25c4c950-55dc-11eb-b9cb-a7a11dafaabc.html" target="_blank"> attended the &#8220;Stop the Steal</a>&#8221; rally that preceded the Capitol riot, though she says she didn&#8217;t march to the Capitol. March has <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+sum+HB113" target="_blank">introduced legislation</a> permitting local school boards &#8220;to display on the sides and rear of public school buses decals containing the motto &#8216;In God We Trust&#8217; or the phrase &#8216;One Nation Under God,'&#8221; the better, apparently, to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhlR9DrKow" target="_blank">identify the commies </a>at the General Assembly who will presumably out themselves by opposing her bill.</p>

<p>They will join incumbent Dels. John McGuire and Dave LaRock, who <a href="https://www.axios.com/va-election-candidates-stop-the-steal-jan-6-rally-cb600ba1-35ab-48f5-bb3c-7062eae8a40d.html" target="_blank">also attended</a> the Stop the Steal rally, and Sen. Amanda Chase, R-Chesterfield, who is perennially on the outs with her GOP colleagues in the Senate and was<a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/01/27/a-badge-of-shame-virginia-senate-votes-to-censure-amanda-chase/" target="_blank"> censured by the body</a> for her comments lending support to the attack on the Capitol. Collectively, they are sure to up the nonsense level in the oldest continuous legislative body in the western hemisphere and cause headaches for their leadership.</p>
<p>Last week, I asked George Mason University political science professor Mark Rozell, <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/01/05/not-a-happy-story-but-how-does-it-end/" target="_blank">who talked with me last year</a> on the eve of the Capitol riot, what the intervening year has taught us about politics. Here&#8217;s what he had to say:</p>
<p><em>On the Democrats&#8217; wall-to-wall Jan. 6 anniversary speechifying and moralizing and whether it was effective: </em></p>
<p><strong>Rozell:</strong> &#8220;How can they be so naive a year later to think any minds would change at all on the other side? There they were expressing absolute astonishment that the<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/republicans-january-6-anniversary-capitol-riot-liz-cheney-2022-1" target="_blank"> two Cheneys</a> were the only ones on the floor. &#8230; They were speaking to their own support base primarily&#8230; to an audience of those who rightfully are astonished, dismayed, scared for the future of this country and wanted powerful voices to reflect those very strong sentiments held by many Americans.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>On Trump&#8217;s shadow still looming over GOP politics:</em></p>
<p>&#8220;Trump&#8217;s hold on the Republican base remains secure and the incumbents recognize that they will get a primary going against him if they are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/05/us/politics/republican-impeachment-votes-trump-jan-6.html" target="_blank">not loyal to him</a>. &#8230;Political scientists have said for generations that the first rule of Congress is to get reelected. &#8230;For those folks asking for profiles in courage, there&#8217;s a reason why those people are considered extraordinary in history and there are several, not hundreds, of chapters in that book.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>On a Virginia Republican Party that has become moderate enough to unify behind Youngkin but also is putting some majorly right-wing lawmakers in office:</em></p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a feature of very different electoral constituencies. &#8230; The House of Delegates candidates are running from relatively small districts, oftentimes with very like-minded constituencies. It is possible to run as a strong, unyielding Trump Republican in a rural conservative legislative district and win. &#8230; Statewide, Youngkin had to walk a tightrope act. He had to hold the rural Trump voting base while at the same time appealing to moderate swing voters in the urban crescent, and, remarkably to some, he did. And by the way he was <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/12/13/lessons-virginia-democrats-can-take-from-their-2021-losses/" target="_blank">helped by Terry McAuliffe</a> in that regard.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>On where Jan. 6 belongs in the pantheon of low moments in American history: </em></p>
<p>&#8220;This brings me to (Vice President) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YnYHO4_98A" target="_blank">Kamala Harris&#8217; speech</a>. She invoked the three horrible days in American history. &#8230; For the former two, this country unified, that&#8217;s the big difference. There&#8217;s no debate about what happened at Pearl Harbor and 9/11, leaving aside some real outlier conspiracy crazy stuff. &#8230; But, on Jan. 6, &#8230; are we really gonna argue about what&#8217;s right there for everybody to see? And yet you hear these conspiracy theories about Democrats and antifa followers posing as Trump followers. People will believe what they want to believe. Facts don&#8217;t seem to matter. &#8230; It is without a doubt a dark day in American history. &#8230; In some ways Jan. 6 stands alone as a uniquely dark episode in our history in that this was as a domestic assault on our government.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>On how this gets better in a deeply divided nation: </em></p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the most difficult one to answer. For me I don&#8217;t feel optimistic that there&#8217;s any short-term or medium-term solution to what&#8217;s bedeviling our democracy. This is going to be an ongoing battle. Can anyone challenge Trump in the Republican Party? And who&#8217;s he going to be running against? An 82-year-old incumbent with low popularity? &#8230; We have come out of periods of intensified polarization in our past, none more so than the Civil War, but even in my lifetime, during the American war in Vietnam. It gives me hope that the country can similarly move into a different posture than we are right now. Maybe it takes a different kind of crisis, a unifying leader, someone who can define a common vision for the country. But right now we have two sides that are firmly set in their own camps and it&#8217;s all about what color jersey you&#8217;re wearing.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the zero sum politics that&#8217;s so damaging to this system, a system that&#8217;s predicated on the notion of moderation and compromise. No one group gets to win everything, but there are a series of compromises among competing interests that bring about some measure of the public good ultimately. &#8230; That&#8217;s not the mindset right now. This is <a href="https://billofrightsinstitute.org/primary-sources/federalist-no-10" target="_blank">James Madison&#8217;s ultimate nightmare</a> right now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can confirm that Dr. Lane has notified Gov. Northam of his intent to leave the VDOE for a new position, the specifics of which he has not yet disclosed,&#8221; said Virginia Department of Education spokesman Ken Blackstone. &#8220;The date is still to be determined. He has not had discussions with the incoming Youngkin administration regarding his position, which is appointed by the governor.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lane formerly served as a public school superintendent in Chesterfield, Goochland and Middlesex counties.</p>
<p><em>UPDATE:</em></p>
<p>On Monday morning, Youngkin announced he is naming Aimee Rogstad Guidera as education secretary. Guidera is an education consultant, former education policy staffer for the National Governors Assocation and the former founder and chief executive of the Data Quality Campaign, which was described by <a href="https://ideas.time.com/2012/01/13/school-of-thought-12-education-activists-for-2012/slide/aimee-guidera-the-data-driver/" target="_blank">Time Magazine in 2012</a> as &#8220;widely credited for playing a key role in prodding states to improve their data systems and publicly holding them accountable for doing so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aimee will be a critical partner in restoring expectations of excellence; overseeing a record education budget to invest in teachers, facilities and special education; rolling out innovation lab and charter schools; and standing for a curriculum that prepares Virginia’s children for a dynamic future and removes politics from the classroom,” Youngkin said in a statement.</p>
<p>Guidera moved to Virginia in 1995 and her daughter attended Fairfax County Public Schools, Youngkin&#8217;s news release says.</p>
<p>“A nationally recognized leader, Aimee is deeply respected for her distinguished career advocating for innovation and choice, data-driven reform and high standards, and will apply these principles in order to implement the Day One Game Plan,&#8221; Youngkin said. &#8220;Most importantly, she understands that parents matter, and the best interests of students must come first. Her leadership, intellect and talent will be tremendous assets as we ensure Virginia kids are the best prepared in the country to succeed, and that they are taught how to think, not what to think. She will help us recharge a system that has settled for too long.”</p>
<p><em>This post has been updated to reflect Gov.-elect Glenn Youngkin&#8217;s announcement of an education secretary selection. The headline has also been clarified to reflect Youngkin&#8217;s pick of an education secretary, not state superintendent. </em></p>

Ralph Northam last month  at the Executive Mansion. (Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Ralph Northam presented legislative budget writers Thursday with his</span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/all-releases/2021/december/headline-916424-en.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">final fiscal blueprint</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for Virginia government that proposes tax cuts, state employee pay raises, stoking the state’s reserve savings and strengthening the public retirement fund. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Robust tax collections augmented by federal pandemic economic relief funds created unprecedented operational surpluses, even during the  social and financial upheavals from the coronavirus pandemic the past two years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All totaled, the state would appropriate</span><a href="https://dpb.virginia.gov/forms/20211216-1/BudgetDirectorsPresentation12-16-2021.pdf" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">$7.7 billion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> more in the upcoming two-year, $158 billion operational budget than in the current budget and still have cash left over, according to</span><a href="https://www.finance.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/secretary-of-finance/pdf/master-revenue-reports/Nov-2021-GACRE-(EMAIL).pdf" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">several </span></a><a href="https://www.finance.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/secretary-of-finance/pdf/master-revenue-reports/JMC-12_16_21-w_Appendix.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">presentations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the General Assembly’s money committees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A major share, $1.7 billion, would go into the state’s “rainy day” reserves, and $1 billion would go into the commonwealth’s public employee retirement system to reduce an unfunded liability. Public education gets nearly $2 billion extra over the next two years, including money to help localities rebuild or renovate school buildings. There are 10 percent raises for teachers, law-enforcement personnel and all state employees spread out over the next couple of years.</span></p>
<p>“Governor Northam’s budget announcement today highlights the record of success the commonwealth has experienced under Democratic leadership. Our state has the largest budget surplus in its history,&#8221; said House Speaker Eileen Filler-Corn, D-Fairfax, who will be relinquishing control of the chamber to Republicans in January after the GOP captured the majority in the November elections. &#8220;This budget responsibly sets aside funds for the future and provides tax relief for working Virginians while still making necessary investments in our schools, our teachers, our health care system and our infrastructure, including our transportation system, broadband access and the environment.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Historically, the end-of-term budgets that Virginia governors leave at the close of their single, non-successive, four-year terms get significantly revised beginning in January when the General Assembly’s budget-writing committees scrutinize them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with the heady revenue forecasts and spending commitments, the outgoing Democratic governor also tossed out a challenge to his Republican successor, Republican Glenn Youngkin, to match his success.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In touting budgeted incentives to attract business expansion and jobs to Virginia, Northam referenced Virginia’s designation this year by CNBC as its</span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/13/virginia-is-back-as-americas-top-state-for-business.html#:~:text=Virginia%20is%20back%20as%20America%E2%80%99s%20Top%20State%20for,posted%20the%20biggest%20decline.%20...%20More%20items...%20" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Best State for Business</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and addressed Youngkin, who attended the presentation at Northam’s invitation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Being named Best State for Business is a testament to our talented workforce, our education system, our commitment to diversity, and our strong business climate, and it shows that when you treat people right, good things happen. Because of this investment, Gov.-elect Youngkin, you will one day, I am confident, find yourself in a rural community to cut the ribbon on a</span><a href="https://www.vedp.org/certified-sites" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">megasite</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> during your term, and I will be cheering you on. And because of this, I also expect to see Virginia as the Best State for Business for the fourth year in a row,” Northam said, glancing at Youngkin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No pressure,” Northam added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the budget priorities Youngkin heard from Northam were several that Youngkin had championed as a candidate this year, including dropping the state’s share of the sales tax on groceries, significant funding for historically Black colleges and universities and enhanced funding for law enforcement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Minority Leader Tommy Norment, R-James City, noted as much in a statement released after the presentation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“By having the introduced budget emulate several of Governor-elect Youngkin’s key priorities, Gov. Northam has acknowledged the decisive outcome of the November elections and the impending change in Virginia’s government,” Norment said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was referring not only to the upcoming partisan change in the executive branch of state government but also the GOP taking control of the House when the new General Assembly convenes on Jan. 12. Youngkin is to be sworn in at noon on the State Capitol steps three days later.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I am pleased that Gov. Northam’s final budget proposal seeks to fund a number of initiatives that were proposed by Republicans just a few months ago, including tax relief and helping localities repair crumbling schools,&#8221; Incoming House Speaker Todd Gilbert, R-Shenandoah said. &#8220;That being said, the final budget produced by the House of Delegates will contain tax relief for all Virginians, proposals to keep Virginians safe, ease the burden of higher costs due to federal government inaction, and additional priorities Republicans championed during the 2021 campaigns.”</p>

(Julia Rendleman/ For the Virginia Mercury)</p><p>The Supreme Court of Virginia has blocked an attempt by the company that provided health care in state prisons to continue fighting the cancelation of its contract by prison officials.</p>
<p>The court on Saturday denied a motion for a stay and a petition for review filed by Armor Correctional Health Services, which has been battling the Virgina Department of Corrections for months over a decision to terminate a contract with company and bring prison health care back in house.</p>
<p>The decision comes after the Circuit Court for the City of Richmond found the DOC &#8220;did not act arbitrarily and capriciously&#8221; in ending the arrangement with Armor, which had held the contract since 2014.</p>
<p>“Today’s proceedings are a victory for the quality of health care in our facilities,” Harold Clarke, corrections department director, said in a statement Saturday. “Our goal has always been to provide the constitutionally-mandated level of health care in our facilities and this transition will ensure that we are able to continue to do so in the future.”</p>

<p>VitalCore Health Strategies, a Kansas-based correctional health care company, began a contract on Dec. 12 with the state to provide prison health care on an interim basis &#8220;while the department prepares to fully assume responsibility for delivering health care services to the nearly 25,000 inmates in state custody,&#8221; the Department of Corrections said.</p>
<p>Armor had waged a protracted campaign to keep the $90 million contract, which <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/07/26/virginia-department-of-corrections-announces-plans-to-de-privatize-prison-healthcare/" target="_blank">state officials moved to end</a> last summer after years of rising health care costs and complaints over substandard medical care in Virginia prisons. The Miami-based company lobbied gubernatorial campaigns and members of the General Assembly, blaming the pandemic for staffing shortfalls and accusing the state of mismanagement.</p>
<p>“We believe​, and our outcomes show, Armor has been a valuable partner in providing quality health care to individuals incarcerated in Virginia and obviously we are disappointed we are no longer working with the commonwealth,&#8221; Santhia Curtis, Armor’s general counsel, said in an email to the Mercury.</p>

(Julia Rendleman/ For the Virginia Mercury)</p><p>Just weeks after the last Confederate statue on Richmond&#8217;s Monument Avenue was removed, a long-anticipated monument to emancipation was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4WgPRauTkY" target="_blank">unveiled Wednesday</a> on Brown&#8217;s Island.</p>
<p>“Resilience in the face of horror and pain is what this day is all about, which is why a little rain and a train are not gonna stop us,” State Sen. Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond, chair of the legislature&#8217;s Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Commission, which commissioned the Emancipation and Freedom Monument, told a crowd shielded from the rain by umbrellas, ponchos and tents.</p>
<p>The monument project began nearly a decade ago as an initiative to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation and abolition.  The pair of 12-foot bronze statues, representing a man, a woman and an infant freed from slavery, was designed by artist Thomas Jay Warren of Oregon.<a href="http://mlkcommission.dls.virginia.gov/lincoln/monument.html" target="_blank"> It honors 10 African American Virginians</a>, five from 1866 to 1970 and five from the period before emancipation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Emancipation was not a moment, it was a movement that began when this country began and Virginia was the center of the struggle,&#8221; McClellan said. &#8220;Virginia, the birthplace of American democracy, was also the birthplace of the American slave trade. Virginia, with its leaders who wrote the founding documents that promised life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness for all, and a government by, of and for the people and yet those very men owned people that they considered three-fifths human.&#8221;</p>

<p>Richmond Mayor Levar Stoney said the monument, unlike the Confederate statues that have come down in the city since the racial justice protests of 2020, &#8220;will withstand the test of time.&#8221;</p>
<p>“We were once the capital of the Confederacy and the capital of the Lost Cause. Well, no longer is that Richmond. Together we are building a capital of compassion, a capital of opportunity, a capital of hope,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The names honored on the base of the monument were selected from a list of more than 100 nominations after a lengthy round of public hearings and narrowing by a commission workgroup.</p>
<p>“Here in Virginia we have worked to tell a more full and comprehensive story of our shared past,&#8221; said Gov. Ralph Northam, who referenced his decision to remove a towering tribute to Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee on state-owned land on Monument Avenue. &#8220;Part of that effort has been to take a hard look at who and what we have put up on pedestals in this commonwealth and ask if they truly should be there. &#8230;  Just a couple weeks ago, one of my proudest days, we took down a statue of a man who led an army to stop the emancipation and freedom these figures symbolize.”</p>
<p>The Virginians honored on the monument are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mary Elizabeth Bowser</strong>, a spy for the Union in the Confederate White House.</li>
<li><strong>William Harvey Carney</strong>, a former slave who fought in the 54th Massachusetts Voluntary Infantry Regiment and for his actions at Fort Wagner was the first African American awarded the Medal of Honor.</li>
<li><strong>Gabriel</strong>, who led an insurrection plot in 1800.</li>
<li><strong>Dred Scott</strong>, an enslaved man whose unsuccessful lawsuit for his freedom led to the infamous Supreme Court decision that persons of African descent were not United States citizens.</li>
<li><strong>Nat Turner</strong>, leader of an 1831 slave revolt in Southampton County.</li>
<li><strong>Rosa Dixon Bowser</strong>, an educator, women’s rights activist and social reformer who founded the first African American teachers association and co-founded the Virginia State Federation of Colored Women’s Clubs and the National Association of Colored Women.</li>
<li><strong>John Mercer Langston,</strong> Virginia’s first African American member of Congress and the first president of what is now Virginia State University.</li>
<li><strong>John Mitchell Jr.</strong>, a community activist, the first African American to run for governor of Virginia and editor of the Richmond Planet newspaper, which covered local, national, and worldwide news, especially lynchings, segregation, and the rise of the Ku Klux Klan.</li>
<li><strong>Lucy Simms</strong>, a prominent educator who taught three generations of African American children in the Harrisonburg area.</li>
<li><strong>The Rev. Wyatt Tee Walker</strong>, a Petersburg minister, civil rights activist, chief of staff to Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and co-founder of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.</li>
</ul>
<p>&#8220;For too long, our history has not told their story,&#8221; said Del. Delores McQuinn, D-Richmond, a member of the commission. “The fight for freedom has been anything but easy. Yet through it all, African Americans have remained resilient in the face of oppression.&#8221;</p>

(Chesterfield Public Schools)</p><p>With many students about to head back to classes later this month, the Virginia Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics says all children, regardless of vaccine status, should wear masks indoors in school.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is based on the observation that COVID-19 infection rates are rapidly increasing across the commonwealth, the Delta variant is more contagious than previous strains of the virus and can be spread by even those that are vaccinated and face masks have been scientifically proven to be effective, well-tolerated and safe,&#8221; the group, which represents more than 1,300 members across Virginia, said in statement.</p>
<p>Last week, Gov. Ralph Northam said school districts would be expected to impose universal masking, an announcement that came just weeks after his administration left decisions on school COVID-19 precautions<a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/07/21/virginias-new-school-guidance-keeps-most-safety-decisions-in-the-hands-of-local-districts/" target="_blank"> in local hands</a> and after some large school systems said they would make <a href="https://www.henricocitizen.com/articles/henrico-schools-expected-to-release-mask-policy-tuesday/#:~:text=Henrico%20County%20Public%20Schools%20officials,choice%2C%E2%80%9D%20the%20policy%20reads." target="_blank">masks optional</a>. Northam said a state law passed early this year requires school systems to offer in-person instruction and to adhere “to the maximum extent practicable” to all safety recommendations set by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/schools-childcare/k-12-guidance.html" target="_blank"> announced last week</a> that it recommends universal masking in schools regardless of vaccination status.</p>
<p>Some Virginia Republicans have said Northam is misrepresenting the legislation that passed with bipartisan support and have chafed over what a GOP state senator and Republican gubernatorial candidate Glenn Youngkin called a de facto &#8220;mask mandate.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Make no mistake &#8211; Governor Northam is overreaching and implementing a mask mandate.</p>
<p>We have to respect parents&#39; decisions about their own children. If parents, teachers, &amp; children want to wear a mask then they can &#8211; but there should NOT be a schoolwide mask mandate. <a href="https://t.co/QNQCBS62DJ" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/QNQCBS62DJ</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Glenn Youngkin (@GlennYoungkin) <a href="https://twitter.com/GlennYoungkin/status/1423651458583568384?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank">August 6, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>State Sen. Siobhan Dunnavant, R-Henrico, an OB-GYN who sponsored the legislation reopening schools, <a href="https://www.audacy.com/newsradiowrva/podcasts/richmonds-morning-news-20797/sen-siobhan-dunnavant-august-9-2021-631141445" target="_blank">told a conservative radio host Monday morning</a> that Northam&#8217;s statement amounted to &#8220;malfeasance of leadership.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe the governor wants a mask mandate but he is unwilling to make the call himself so he has found an indirect way where he can claim it’s somebody else’s decision,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Several weeks ago he told school divisions you may decide for yourself. &#8230; Thursday he drops the bomb that that this law may be a problem for them and they should check with their legal counsel.”</p>
<p>Asked by the Mercury last week whether she thought kids should wear masks in schools, Dunnavant didn&#8217;t give a straight answer. “Parents and schools need to collaborate and take into consideration the latest information and guidelines as well as every child’s individual challenges to make a decision that ensures every child has in-person education,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Dunnvant told WRVA Monday that &#8220;the conversation we should be having as parents, teachers (is) this is what the CDC guidelines say. Maybe we should think about doing this for a month but we understand that some of your kids can’t see or have anxiety or can’t learn and really in person is the most important so let’s work together not under a mandate, but in a collaboration. Let’s have a community agreement where we figure this out together and do what’s best for our children, but mandates are not that. “</p>
<p>The Virginia chapter of the pediatric association said keeping schools open is &#8220;best accomplished through effective mitigation strategies that include vaccination of eligible children and the wearing of face masks by all children except those with a medical exemption determined by a physician,&#8221; adding that increasing vaccination remains a parallel priority.</p>
<p>&#8220;Continuing to use a simple, important layer of mitigation (masks) during a time of substantial community spread of disease will reduce illness and quarantine and keep more children healthy and in school, allowing families to continue to go to work as well.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Virginia Manufacturers Association alleged the state Department of Environmental Quality had violated the state Administrative Process Act when it revised regulations that brought Virginia into the <a href="https://www.rggi.org/" target="_blank">Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative</a>, which caps carbon emissions from power plants, arguing that it created &#8220;an illegal carbon tax on ratepayers.”</p>
<p>https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/manufacturers-seek-to-block-virginia-from-joining-carbon-market-in-lawsuit/</p>
<p>&#8220;DEQ did what the General Assembly required it to do. Therefore, the court finds that DEQ did not violate the VAPA in issuing the amended regulation,&#8221;  Circuit Court Judge Beverly Snukals.</p>
<p>The Department of Environmental Quality came up with rules for participation in a carbon market in 2018. But due to a state requirement that the General Assembly must approve any exchange of state monies, the initial regulation devised a complicated system for distributing allowances that emitters would then have to sell into the broader market. Although the State Air Pollution Control Board approved that regulation in 2019, Republicans blocked Virginia from taking any further action through budget language.</p>
<p>“Virginia’s CO2 Budget Trading Program is a key component in reducing our carbon pollution while also investing in mitigation and resiliency projects that protect communities from the negative effects of climate change, especially sea-level rise,&#8221; said Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring, whose office handled the case. &#8220;I’m really proud we were able to protect this central piece of our climate strategy, and I appreciate all the work our environmental attorneys did in this complex and important case.”</p>
<p>After Democrats took control of both houses of the General Assembly in 2020, they pushed through the Clean Energy and Community Flood Preparedness Act, which authorized DEQ’s director “to establish, implement, and manage an auction program to sell allowances into a market-based trading program consistent with the RGGI program and this article.”</p>
<p>“Virginia’s participation in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative is already working to drive down carbon dioxide emissions in the commonwealth in tens of millions of dollars to help low-income families reduce electricity bills and communities combat flooding,&#8221; said Nate Benforado, an attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center, in a statement. &#8220;The Virginia Manufacturers Association’s last-ditch effort to upend this program not only would have subverted the will of the General Assembly, but also would have hurt millions of people across Virginia who stand to benefit from cleaner air to breathe and programs to deal with climate change.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a statement, Brett Vassey, president and CEO of the Virginia Manufacturers Association, said the group was disappointed by the decision.</p>
<p>&#8220;For years electricity consumer have been told that RGGI is not a tax and would only cost few dollars per month – not true,&#8221; Vassey said. &#8220;The public has also been outraged by the lack of transparency and participation in the regulatory process &#8211; again it has been clearly demonstrated in this case. Our goal all along was that this suit would ensure that the Virginia General Assembly and all state agencies would return to transparent taxation and ensure that all regulations follow the Virginia Administrative Process Act. Today, electricity consumers were denied both.&#8221;</p>

(Ned Oliver/ Virginia Mercury)</p><p>One of the coverage areas the Mercury set out to focus on when we launched nearly three years ago was Virginia&#8217;s Freedom of Information Act and the issues that perennially swirl around it like the constant cloud of dirt that follows Pigpen from &#8220;Peanuts.&#8221;</p>
<p>Virginia&#8217;s open records law doesn&#8217;t just suffer from problems with its text — in the form of loopholes, exemptions and<a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/05/15/fix-foia-the-pandemic-is-throwing-virginias-public-records-shortcomings-into-stark-relief/" target="_blank"> provisions allowing exorbitant charges</a> for records that belong to the taxpayers — but also from a general culture of contempt for the concept on the part of some government officials.</p>
<p>That much was apparent Tuesday during a subcommittee meeting of Virginia&#8217;s Freedom of Information Act Advisory Council, which was hearing testimony on one bill that would attempt to curb the high costs some public bodies impose for records and another that opens up police disciplinary records to public scrutiny.</p>
<p>Catastrophizing is common at the Capitol. Change this code section a little or tweak a word here or there and all the demons of unintended consequence will come roaring out of Pandora&#8217;s box, lobbyists often argue.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="0o7ukmkBxJ"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2021/05/19/a-virginia-lawmaker-wants-to-make-foia-requests-cheaper-or-free-some-government-and-police-groups-arent-happy-about-it/">A Virginia lawmaker wants to make FOIA requests cheaper or free.

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;A Virginia lawmaker wants to make FOIA requests cheaper or free. Some government and police groups aren’t happy about it.&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2021/05/19/a-virginia-lawmaker-wants-to-make-foia-requests-cheaper-or-free-some-government-and-police-groups-arent-happy-about-it/embed/#?secret=h7SktMxXx2#?secret=0o7ukmkBxJ" data-secret="0o7ukmkBxJ" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p>Even by those standards, the squalling from opponents — chiefly local government lawyers and representatives from police agencies — made it clear that some of them view FOIA not just as a headache they&#8217;d rather not deal with but as a dangerous tool for the citizenry to bedevil their betters at county and city governments, sheriff&#8217;s offices and police agencies.</p>
<p>&#8220;It presents an invitation for individuals angry at local government for any reason to harass the local government and to abuse the law out of spite,&#8221; Martin Crim, a lawyer who represents several Northern Virginia localities, <a href="http://foiacouncil.dls.virginia.gov/subcom_mtgs/2021/martincrimremarks.pdf" target="_blank">testified in his written remarks on the bill to reduce FOIA costs.</a> &#8220;Each locality I have worked for has had at least one FOIA antagonist at some point who filed multiple document requests for no practical purpose, so it cannot be said that the local governments must have done something to deserve such abuse.&#8221;</p>
<p>Crim also seemed to suggest allowing localities to put high price tag on records requests was a necessary barrier to frivolous or annoying requests, pointing to one person who asked for all records dealing with Lake Manassas, which led to a cost estimate of around $20,000. (Public bodies are <a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacodepopularnames/virginia-freedom-of-information-act/" target="_blank">only allowed</a> to impose &#8220;reasonable charges not to exceed its actual cost incurred in accessing, duplicating, supplying or searching for the requested records.&#8221;)</p>
<p>“The idea there is if you’re going to give people carte blanche to make local government turn over documents, they’re going to use that tool inappropriately,” Crim said.</p>
<p>In a similar vein, Virginia Tech Police Chief William &#8220;Mac&#8221; Babb, complained about people who &#8220;just FOIA to be FOIA&#8217;ing&#8221; and said the bill would encourage records requests &#8220;without a specific purpose.&#8221;</p>
<p>Guess what? If that guy wants to get all the records related to that lake and decorate his house with them, it&#8217;s government&#8217;s job to provide them in a timely and cost effective way. It is not government&#8217;s job to decide whose record request is in good faith or &#8220;for a purpose&#8221; and whose isn&#8217;t, as Del. Danica Roem, D-Manassas, who introduced the legislation, noted. <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/10/16/motives-shouldnt-matter-when-it-comes-to-foia-requests/" target="_blank">Motives don&#8217;t matter</a> when it comes to FOIA.</p>
<p>“If we are going to have a bias in that regard, it should be that we err on the side of acknowledging that public documents are public,” Roem said. “As opposed to the hassle, time and cost to government.”</p>
<p>Implicit in all this pushback is the idea that fulfilling records requests is a nuisance these functionaries barely tolerate instead of a core part of the public services they exist to provide.</p>
<p>&#8220;Another way to look at the impact of <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?211+sum+HB2000" target="_blank">HB2000</a> is that it shifts the cost of providing public records from the requester to the taxpayers. I understand why the press association wishes to minimize its expenses, but often the documents requested are of no interest to the public and do not contribute to public understanding of government,&#8221; Crim said.</p>
<p>People who request records usually are taxpayers, and in many cases what we&#8217;re subsidizing — with FOIA fees that can run into the hundreds and thousands of dollars — is years of inefficient record keeping, outdated computer and software systems that make finding records hard and public employees like Crim who seem to think they should get to decide which requests are and aren&#8217;t worthy.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do think the overall tone of what we heard today, more or less, is heavily in favor of the protectors of that information,&#8221; said Roem, a former newspaper reporter who has been pushing to reform FOIA. &#8220;The people who actually have that information. As opposed to the natural default being public accessibility. That&#8217;s where I want to focus the conversation here.&#8221;</p>
<p>But for her and other reformers, Tuesday&#8217;s meeting shows that it&#8217;s not just about changing the law, it&#8217;s also about changing some obnoxious attitudes in some obstinate bureaucrats.</p>

(Virginia.org)</p><p>Environmental groups are again raising alarms about levels of fecal bacteria in Shenandoah Valley waterways from livestock and poultry operations and calling on state agencies to do a better job of warning inland swimmers about the risks, as they do at 46 coastal beaches.</p>
<p>Citing Virginia Department of Environmental Quality data, the Environmental Integrity Project and the Shenandoah Riverkeeper said 72 percent of monitoring sites along the Shenandoah River and its tributaries — covering a large area that runs from Berryville to Stuart&#8217;s Draft — had E. coli levels that the federal Environmental Protection Agency would consider unsafe for swimming.</p>
<p>&#8220;However, Virginia posted no signs warning rafters, kayakers, or swimmers about health threats — as it does regularly with swimming advisories on ocean beaches and in saltwater areas,&#8221; the groups said in a statement.</p>
<p>The number of waterway sites sampled for bacteria by state officials also fell, with an average of 70 places on waterways in the Shenandoah Valley sampled between 2015 and 2018, but only 35 in 2019 and 25 in 2020, <a href="https://environmentalintegrity.org/news/bacteria-levels-in-shenandoah-valley-remain-high-despite-revised-pollution-standards/" target="_blank">the groups said in a report last week</a>.</p>
<p>“Virginia should strengthen its bacteria standards and post swimming advisory signs in freshwater areas used by rafters and swimmers that are contaminated with fecal bacteria, especially now that rafting and tubing season is starting up on the Shenandoah River,” said Eric Schaeffer, executive director of the Environmental Integrity Project and a former EPA official.</p>
<p>&#8220;People might be upset by warning signs, but the signs would increase public pressure on state lawmakers to invest the funds and effort needed to reduce pollution — for example, by requiring farmers to fence their herds of cattle out of the Shenandoah River.&#8221;</p>

<p>Monitoring for bacteria and issuing advisories in Virginia is complicated. The Virginia Department of Health issues the beach swimming advisories when bacteria concentrations hit certain levels through a grant from the EPA, said Margaret Smigo, VDH&#8217;s waterborne hazards program coordinator. The DEQ monitors surface water quality and determines if waterbodies are defined as impaired per the federal Clean Water Act.</p>
<p>&#8220;No such federal or state-funded program exists for inland waterbodies,&#8221; Smigo said, adding that officials tried and failed to secure additional state money for an inland water quality advisory program. &#8220;Due to the interest and concerns expressed by public and nonprofit groups for improving the information available on inland beach water quality, VDH has made several attempts to secure funding as recently as 2018, for the 2019-2020 state fiscal budget year. Unfortunately, to date, such efforts have not been successful.&#8221;</p>
<p>Greg Bilyeu, a spokesman for the DEQ said the agency&#8217;s bacteria data are not intended to be real-time indicators of swimming conditions but rather identify recreational waters in need of a clean-up plan and track long-term trends. He added that the State Water Control Board has adopted new EPA water quality criteria that require more intensive sampling over a shorter period of time and rejected a contention by the Environmental Integrity Project and the Shenandoah Riverkeeper that the agency had lowered standards.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been very transparent about the challenges, spending a lot of time engaging with folks including the Riverkeeper network, but unfortunately, DEQ simply does not have the resources to collect the number of samples needed to assess the new EPA criteria that have been the basis for almost all Virginia water quality standards,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>To be sure, much of the heat coming from GOP lawmakers likely rests in their conviction that some violent felons deserve to die behind bars as well as the fact that, for a party desperate to claw back some control in a state that has slipped out of their grasp, &#8220;soft on crime&#8221; offensives aimed at Democrats are a return to bread-and-butter basics.</p>
<p>But that doesn&#8217;t mean there isn&#8217;t a whole lot of there there, especially for people concerned about governmental transparency, the ability of watchdog agencies to do their job and whistleblower protections, all things Democrats recently professed to care very much about, at least when it came to Donald Trump&#8217;s White House.</p>
<p>To recap:</p>
<p>• The Office of the State Inspector General, acting on complaints made to the State Waste, Fraud and Abuse Hotline, conducted an investigation into the release of Vincent Martin — who was convicted of the 1979 killing of a Richmond Police officer and spent 40 years in prison, earning a reputation as a model prisoner — amid an outcry from police officers, prosecutors and conservative lawmakers.</p>
<p>• In July, the IG&#8217;s office was getting ready to release its findings that the board and former Chairwoman Adrianne Bennett had violated state law and its own victim-notification procedures in Martin&#8217;s case when Northam&#8217;s administration was notified the report was about to land in the hands of journalists. That email &#8220;appeared to set off a chain of events that would delay the report’s release and end with the redaction of nearly everything in it,&#8221; the Mercury&#8217;s Graham Moomaw <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/11/23/redactions-to-watchdog-report-on-va-parole-board-came-after-governors-office-got-notice-of-foia-requests/" target="_blank">reported</a> in November.</p>
<p>• Republicans in the General Assembly demanded an unredacted copy of the report, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/richmond-shootings-virginia-u-s-news-288401a58b7d88c409cabf174c1c491e" target="_blank">getting it and releasing it in August</a>. State code says the IG “shall notify the governor’s chief of staff, the speaker, majority leader, and minority Leader of the House of Delegates, and the president pro tempore, majority leader and minority leader of the Senate of problems, abuses, or deficiencies relating to the management or operation of a state agency or nonstate agency.”</p>
<p>• Not long after the release of the report to the General Assembly, Inspector General Michael Westfall and his staff were summoned to a meeting in which the administration officials hammered them over the release of the report by the GOP lawmakers and aggressively contested some of the IG&#8217;s findings. Westfall and his associates, who largely stuck to their guns, mentioned there were other reports coming on Parole Board wrongdoing. Northam&#8217;s representatives, including Secretary of Public Safety Brian Moran and Chief of Staff Clark Mercer, seemed intent on making sure more embarrassing details weren&#8217;t publicly released.</p>

Ralph Northam, discusses an investigation into the Virginia Parole Board at a news conference in August. (Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p>• Westfall apparently took that message to heart. In October, we learned there were <a href="https://apnews.com/article/richmond-virginia-laws-f1729b3fc2717e3cf964f19f1484022b" target="_blank">a half dozen more reports</a> by the IG&#8217;s office on whether the Parole Board followed state law and its own procedures in the release of convicted killers. They were redacted almost entirely but later leaked out to the media in unredacted form, revealing that Bennett&#8217;s zeal to release inmates and ignore requirements about victim and prosecutor notification extended to other cases. Both the Northam administration and the Inspector General&#8217;s Office, ascribing amazing transitive properties to the broad Freedom of Information Act exemption the Parole Board enjoys, claimed the reports&#8217; contents couldn&#8217;t be legally disclosed, including by members of the General Assembly, because of prohibitions in the FOIA law.

<p>• In February, WTVR, a Richmond TV station,<a href="https://www.wtvr.com/news/problem-solvers/problem-solvers-investigations/full-parole-board-report" target="_blank"> reported that an earlier draft of the report</a> on the Martin case was shortened from 13 pages to six pages. That happened after it got sent to <a href="https://www.wtvr.com/news/problem-solvers/problem-solvers-investigations/email-shows-osig-shared-parole-board-report-with-attorney-generals-office" target="_blank">Attorney General Mark Herring&#8217;s office</a>. The earlier draft contained additional allegations about the conduct of Bennett and current Chairwoman Tonya Chapman. That prompted Sen. John Bell, D-Loudoun, one of the few Democrats to say much of anything about the Parole Board case, to join with Sen. Bryce Reeves, R-Spotsylvania, in asking the Senate to form a committee for &#8220;<a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/02/25/more-revelations-on-va-parole-board-wrongdoing-prompt-call-for-new-investigation/" target="_blank">a clear and transparent investigation free of influence</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>• At the end of February, as questions mounted about the role his administration might have played in squelching the details of the reports,<a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/03/01/northam-supports-outside-investigation-into-watchdog-report-on-parole-board/" target="_blank"> Northam said</a> he supported an &#8220;outside investigation&#8221; into the mess.</p>
<p>• Last month, an IG investigator, Jennifer Moschetti, came forward seeking whistleblower protection for sharing full versions of her reports with members of the General Assembly. She was suspended, <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/state-investigator-fired-following-va-parole-board-disclosures-attorney-says/" target="_blank">then fired</a>, but not before she revealed that she had gotten a bonus and plaudits from her work on the Parole Board cases, work that Mercer and Moran have publicly blasted as &#8220;biased.&#8221; Moschetti, who was present at the recorded meeting in August, said the real purpose of the meeting was to &#8220;intimidate the state inspector general and the investigators tasked with making fact findings related to members of the Parole Board.”</p>
<p>• In late March, Chapman, the current board chair,<a href="https://apnews.com/article/journalists-lawsuits-virginia-richmond-27516c634f56f9205e9792629a00f0ed" target="_blank"> sued WTVR</a>, claiming the television station defamed her by publishing details in the draft Martin report and seeking $7 million in damages.</p>
<p>• Earlier this month, the Democratic-led General Assembly approved a $250,000 budget amendment from the Northam administration for the Attorney&#8217;s General&#8217;s Office, which was advising both the Parole Board and the Inspector General&#8217;s Office, to choose an outside investigator to probe the IG&#8217;s inquiry into the Martin case. Republicans in the General Assembly immediately denounced it as a &#8220;partisan whitewash,&#8221; noting that the outside investigator will be chosen by Democrats:  Herring, the governor&#8217;s office and Democratic leaders in the legislature. “It’s an investigation of the investigation,” said Sen. Mark Obenshain, R-Rockingham. “It’s an investigation of our supposedly independent watchdog. Who’s ever heard of such a thing?”</p>

<p>Got all that? I&#8217;ll agree with the governor&#8217;s office on this at least: This has indeed become an &#8220;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/audio-shows-northam-administration-criticizing-watchdog/2021/04/19/7645395a-a14a-11eb-b314-2e993bd83e31_story.html" target="_blank">absolute circus</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Flip the script and picture a similar sequence of events unfolding amongst the governor&#8217;s office, the attorney general and a state agency in a GOP administration, complete with allied lawmakers saying &#8220;Nothing to see here,&#8221; and you can bet Democrats would have let slip the dogs of war also.</p>
<p>But regardless of what you think about parole and who should get it, maybe even more troubling than what&#8217;s leaked out about the workings of the Parole Board is what the scandal has revealed about the Office of the State Inspector General, created in 2011 by the General Assembly and housed under the umbrella of the governor&#8217;s office.</p>
<p>The inspector general, whose role is to &#8220;maximize the public’s confidence and trust in state government,&#8221; is appointed by the governor, approved by the General Assembly and reports to the governor&#8217;s chief of staff. And, as the recording makes clear, that structure can make for some uncomfortable grilling by people with the power to fire the watchdog when his office delivers a report the administration really doesn&#8217;t like.</p>
<p>“This is the type of stuff that leads to me getting a new job. Against my will,” Westfall said in the audio recording after leaving the meeting with Mercer and Moran. “And I’m fine with that. I knew that when I took the job.”</p>
<p>&#8220;If you get let go because of this, then everybody’s’ going to be up in arms,” a colleague replied.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t have to be for this,” Westfall said. “It can be something else. You know how that works.”</p>
<p>That reporting structure, according to former Del. Steve Landes, R-Augusta, <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?111+sum+HB2076" target="_blank">who carried the House version </a>of the legislation creating the office, was a necessary compromise to get it off the ground.</p>

Steve Landes, R-Augusta. (Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p>“We tried to thread the needle as best we could,&#8221; Landes, now the Augusta County Circuit Court clerk, told me in an interview. “My preference would have been to have a completely independent agency. But going through the legislative process you have to be a realist sometimes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Never did lawmakers contemplate back in 2011 that the Inspector General&#8217;s Office would refuse to divulge information to the legislature that created it, confirms its leader, funds the agencies it investigates and passes statutes governing how those agencies operate, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;For those of us sitting on the outside, especially those of us who used to be in the legislature, it&#8217;s ridiculous that they can’t share information with the legislature,&#8221; Landes said, calling the administration&#8217;s FOIA arguments &#8220;ludicrous.&#8221;</p>
<p>Withholding completed investigative reports, firing the investigator who gave them to lawmakers and claiming dubious FOIA exemptions  sets the state down a &#8220;scary path,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>“It’s counterintuitive to why the Inspector General&#8217;s Office was set up in the first place. It was never supposed to be a secretive body,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The General Assembly is going to have to really look at the statutes and strengthen them. &#8230; When they find something that they don’t like, the idea shouldn&#8217;t be that the administration can just sweep it under the rug.&#8221;</p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury - Sept. 11, 2018)</p><p>St. Augustine — who famously longed for chastity and continence, but not just yet — would recognize a similar spiritual conundrum in Virginia senators on campaign finance reform.</p>
<p>Sure thing. Just not right now.</p>
<p>Last month, in the waning days of the 2021 General Assembly session, the Senate, on a voice vote, (which means there wasn&#8217;t a roll taken)<a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/02/23/virginia-senate-punts-on-campaign-finance-bill-but-lawmakers-agree-to-study-future-reform/" target="_blank"> killed legislation</a> that would have barred lawmakers from using campaign money for personal expenses. It would have been a modest, commonsense guardrail in Virginia&#8217;s Wild West campaign finance landscape.</p>
<p>Del. Marcus Simon, D-Fairfax, who carried the bill — which passed the House of Delegates 100-0 —  said he was “obviously disappointed” the Senate “couldn’t find a way to live under the same rules as the federal government and at least 47 other states.” He had told the Associated Press, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/campaigns-campaign-finance-reforms-bills-campaign-finance-virginia-1e1ebc13273fbdcf5a5c6bf0ce4aeec9" target="_blank">when it looked like a break-through was possible,</a> that it was his eighth year sponsoring the bill.</p>
<p>An anti-corruption group, <a href="https://www.coalitionforintegrity.org/" target="_blank">the Coalition for Integrity</a>, which ranks Virginia worse than all but five other states on its <a href="https://www.coalitionforintegrity.org/swamp2020/" target="_blank">S.W.A.M.P. index,</a> was flabbergasted.</p>
<p>“I cannot believe they killed the bill,” Shruti Shah, the group&#8217;s president and CEO, <a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/va-senate-democrats-scuttle-bill-to-bar-personal-use-of-campaign-funds/article_e88db59e-85b4-5a3a-b65e-2cdc9646abd3.html" target="_blank">told the Richmond Times-Dispatch</a>.</p>
<p>I can.</p>
<p>Real campaign finance reform is an issue whose time never seems to come in Virginia, despite occasional outbreaks of progress, like <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/va-senate-panel-advances-bill-forcing-lawmakers-to-reveal-big-pre-session-donations/" target="_blank">Sen. David Suetterlein&#8217;s bill</a> last year that forced lawmakers to disclose in a timely fashion who&#8217;s showering them with cash right before they start voting on legislation.</p>
<p>Nancy Morgan, a coordinator with the Virginia chapter of <a href="https://americanpromise.net/who-we-are/about-american-promise/?#solution" target="_blank">American Promise</a>, which advocates for a constitutional amendment to end big money in politics, has spent the past few years unsuccessfully trying to convince Republicans and Democrats in the General Assembly to enact donation limits and other reforms.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have said Virginians have been waiting 30 years for this,&#8221; she said. &#8220;On the Senate side, there&#8217;s always been this sort of complacency.&#8221;</p>
<p>A commission assembled in the wake of former Gov. Bob McDonnell&#8217;s gift scandal (<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/r/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/11/17/Editorial-Opinion/Graphics/Integrity_Commission_Final_Report_Nov_2015.pdf" target="_blank">the Commission on Integrity and Public Confidence in State Government</a>) recommended a range of reforms, including tightening restrictions on personal use of campaign funds. Before that, there was the Governor&#8217;s Commission on Campaign Finance Reform, Government Accountability and Ethics and Related Matters. The panel, convened by Gov. Doug Wilder,<a href="https://rga.lis.virginia.gov/Published/1994/SD65/PDF" target="_blank"> called for, among other things</a>, campaign contribution limits, back in 1992.</p>
<p>Many lawmakers claim to not see a problem that needs fixing, pointing to Virginia&#8217;s disclosure laws as superior to actual campaign limits. But, Morgan said, that disclosure is made accessible because of the <a href="https://www.vpap.org/" target="_blank">Virginia Public Access Project</a>, a nonprofit, not because of any governmental entity. And as far as what exactly they&#8217;re spending all that money on, you can get some information via VPAP, but it&#8217;s anyone&#8217;s guess as to whether it&#8217;s an actual campaign-related expense.</p>
<p>The<a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2014Schedule-D.pdf" target="_blank"> form the state requires</a> for campaign expenditures doesn&#8217;t exactly demand a lot of details. In 2016, Associated Press reporter Alan Suderman, as part of a sprawling review of Virginia campaign spending, noted that &#8220;behavior that would get lawmakers locked up in other states or at the federal level is perfectly fine in the Old Dominion. Virginia is the only state where lawmakers can raise unlimited campaign donations from anyone, including corporations and unions, and spend the money on themselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then, as now, candidates, including those who haven&#8217;t faced a serious challenge in years, can amass huge war chests to dissuade potential opponents and can throw it around pretty much however they like, from meals  and &#8220;community goodwill&#8221; to travel and lodging and legal expenses, in addition to anything else they can dream up.</p>
<p>“What everyday Americans expect is for campaign funds to be used for their campaign,&#8221; said Beth Rotman, director of money in politics and ethics at Common Cause, a national nonpartisan good government group. “You need a robust oversight agency to actually make that possible and you need more regulations than what you have currently in Virginia.”</p>
<p>Combining relatively low legislative pay — <a href="https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/item/2021/2/SB1100/Introduced/1/1/" target="_blank">$17,640 for delegates and $18,000 for senators</a>, plus per diems — with unlimited campaign donations and barely any restrictions on how it can be spent is a recipe for trouble. <a href="https://www.dailypress.com/government/dp-nws-virginiaway-overview-20141116-story.html" target="_blank">A 2014 investigation</a> by the Daily Press&#8217; Dave Ress found &#8220;legislators who are paid, officially, as part-timers, but who have access to tens of thousands of dollars a year more in allowances, fringe benefits and campaign funds — and who are held to only the most minimal accounting for how they use that money.&#8221; <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/virginias-ethics-laws-create-a-vacuum/2013/08/23/9cd8d766-0b48-11e3-9941-6711ed662e71_story.html" target="_blank">The Washington Post editorial board noted in 2013</a>, in the midst of the McDonnell scandal, that lawmakers could quite literally &#8220;live off lobbyists for virtually any expense, large or small.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rotman and other reformers favor a small donor system with matching public funds, as in<a href="https://www.nyccfb.info/program/how-it-works/" target="_blank"> New York</a> and <a href="https://www.commoncause.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/CT_SmallDonorDollar_Report_WEB.pdf" target="_blank">Connecticut</a>, to give candidates an incentive to seek money from regular people, not just those who can write the biggest checks.</p>
<p>&#8220;Right now the wealthy special interests are well aware they’re getting a great return on their investment,&#8221; Rotman said.</p>
<p>But instead of reform, this year we&#8217;re getting another study,<a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?212+sum+HJ526" target="_blank"> via legislation</a> by Del. David Bulova, D-Fairfax, which creates a joint subcommittee to study &#8220;comprehensive campaign finance reform.&#8221; It will be tasked with &#8220;examining the costs of campaigning in the commonwealth, the effectiveness of the commonwealth&#8217;s present disclosure laws and their enforcement, the constitutional options available to regulate campaign finances and the desirability of specific revisions in the commonwealth&#8217;s laws, including the implementation of contribution limits, all with the aim of promoting the integrity of, and public confidence in, the commonwealth&#8217;s campaign finance system.&#8221;</p>
<p>To prevent it from becoming just another adornment for a dusty shelf that gets ignored by people in the legislature who may, shockingly, be reluctant to limit the degree of impunity with which they can spend lots and lots of money, the League of Women Voters of Virginia is attempting to drum up some attention from the citizenry.</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems like that in Virginia there isn’t a sufficient groundswell of interest, enough to put pressure on these members,&#8221; said Janet Boyd, a volunteer with the league who&#8217;s worked on campaign finance reform. “Because clearly in previous iterations of these subcommittees, the engagement was weak enough that they could discount it.”</p>

(Alex Kent/ For the Tennessee Lookout)</p><p>Few living have seen a more disgraceful day at the U.S. Capitol than Wednesday, when thousands of supporters of President Donald Trump, whipped into a frenzy beyond reason after months of lies about the election, bashed their way into the building in a deadly spectacle that will live in infamy.</p>
<p>But in a way, the worst was yet to come.</p>
<p>The horror of a violent mob, set to its work by the president of the United States, rampaging through the Capitol, fighting with police, shattering windows and doors and ransacking offices, did nothing to convince Virginia&#8217;s Republican congressmen — U.S. Reps. Ben Cline, Bob Good, Morgan Griffith and Rob Wittman — that maybe voting against certifying President-elect Joe Biden&#8217;s clear and convincing win in several states, thus perpetuating Trump&#8217;s baseless election delusions, wasn&#8217;t what the country needs at the moment. Griffith <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/01/07/congress-fistfight/" target="_blank">even had the stones</a> to get indignant about Republicans getting called out for lying about the election results.</p>
<p>Rather than admitting, as Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham mercifully did, that &#8220;<a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?507698-5/senate-rejects-objection-arizona-electoral-votes-93-6&amp;live=&amp;vod=&amp;start=6344" target="_blank">enough is enough,</a>&#8221; they selfishly decided that their political futures would be best served by pandering to the very people who had just committed an outrage the likes of which had not been seen since <a href="https://history.house.gov/Oral-History/Events/1954-Shooting/" target="_blank">a 1954 terrorist attack</a> or the British sack of Washington in the War of 1812.</p>
<p>We should all be embarrassed that none of the Republicans of the Old Dominion, with its long history of statesmanship, could muster the courage of U.S. Rep. Chip Roy, a Texas Republican and a staunch conservative, who refused to go along with the crowd, <a href="https://news4sanantonio.com/news/local/sen-chip-roy-wont-object-to-electing-biden-though-it-may-sign-my-death-warrant" target="_blank">even if it meant signing his &#8220;political death warrant.&#8221;</a> (Cline, Griffith and Wittman<a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/12/11/three-va-republicans-join-texas-lawsuit-challenging-presidential-election-result/" target="_blank"> also signed onto a failed lawsuit</a> trying to overturn election results in four battleground states.)</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">

<p>In all likelihood, none of them actually believe that Trump won the election or that there was any kind of legitimate argument against its validity.</p>
<p>It is certainly contemptible, but also almost pitiable, to be so bereft of principle that you knowingly help perpetuate a fantastical lie because you fear so much telling your constituents the truth: that Donald Trump lost fair and square. That there were no irregularities, mass voter fraud, voting machine skullduggery, ballot destruction or any of the other nonsensical claims the president has raised and which have been rejected by virtually every court they have been presented to, Republican election officials at the state level and even by <a href="https://apnews.com/article/barr-no-widespread-election-fraud-b1f1488796c9a98c4b1a9061a6c7f49d" target="_blank">Trump&#8217;s own attorney general</a>.</p>

<p>Donald Trump lit the flame, but it was Republicans in Congress who handed him the match. It is reckless and unforgivable.</p>

<p>Surely these guys know the bit about gaining the world only to lose one&#8217;s soul. What do they stand to gain for debasing themselves so irrevocably for a man who does not care about them, his followers or anyone except himself? Keeping their front-row seat as the minority party gnashes its teeth impotently over the next few years? Owning the libs?</p>
<p>Is it worth it?</p>
<p>I hope so. Because everyone will remember where they stood on Wednesday night, despite their pathetic statements deploring the fact that the people they&#8217;ve been helping to radicalize for years — on abortion, immigration, gun control, religion and a host of other wedge issues — actually went and did the damn thing. And it&#8217;s not hard to see how priming their party faithful to ignore basic facts, all available evidence and common sense might come back to haunt them in their own future endeavors.</p>
<p>The GOP&#8217;s bargain with Trump was always a Faustian one and here we behold the hellish result.</p>

<p>They&#8217;ve lost the right to talk about <a href="https://twitter.com/nytimes/status/1347280627817656323?s=20" target="_blank">law and order</a>. They&#8217;ve lost the right to talk about election integrity, or integrity of any kind. They&#8217;ve lost the right to talk about the Constitution.</p>

</p><p>Already the first days of 2021 feel less like the darkness before the dawn and more like a deeper plunge into our bitter polarization and the ceaseless ravages of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Despite the arrival of vaccines, the initial batches have been slow to be doled out amid<a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/americas-vaccine-rollout-disaster.html" target="_blank"> a morass of confusion</a> at the state and local level and a federal government that evidently failed to consider the <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/12/31/in-virginia-slow-vaccine-rollout-frustrates-health-care-providers/" target="_blank">&#8220;final mile&#8221; of distribution</a>.</p>
<p>That means that in Virginia and elsewhere, even as transmission surges and deaths mount, some potentially life-saving doses are apparently sitting quite literally in a deep freeze or worse. At a D.C. supermarket, for example, a pharmacist <a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/friends-get-lucky-randomly-receive-covid-19-vaccine-before-doses-expire/2527704/?_osource=SocialFlowTwt_DCBrand" target="_blank">administered the vaccine to random customers,</a> saying otherwise that the doses would have to be tossed out, presumably with the rotting produce.</p>
<p>Like the response to the pandemic, our national politics continue to be our great national shame. The latest nadir, coming during the last days of a presidency that relentlessly kept digging for rock bottom but always found new depths to plumb, is  the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/election-2020-joe-biden-donald-trump-elections-coronavirus-pandemic-e2a6fa060432bd19d92a142a0da5688e" target="_blank">scores of GOP members of Congress</a> rallying to President Donald Trump&#8217;s bid to overturn the election results, even after the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3hrN0cP58Y" target="_blank">stunning audio</a> was released of his call to Georgia&#8217;s top election official (a Republican) demanding that he find him &#8220;11,780 votes&#8221; and throwing around threats about criminal offenses.</p>
<p>https://twitter.com/GaSecofState/status/1345753643593687040?s=20</p>
<p><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/12/11/three-va-republicans-join-texas-lawsuit-challenging-presidential-election-result/" target="_blank">Three Virginia Republican congressmen</a> joined a failed Texas lawsuit that sought to toss out the election results from four battleground states. At least one of those, joined by newly elected Rep. Bob Good, R-Campbell, says he will vote against certifying the election results Wednesday.</p>
<p>https://twitter.com/ReElectWittman/status/1346098556164308992?s=20</p>
<p>Of course, not many, if any, of these people believe Trump&#8217;s nonsensical claims of election fraud, ballot destruction and voting machine tampering, assertions plucked from fringe websites, social media and obscure chatrooms.</p>
<p>https://twitter.com/RepRiggleman/status/1346089733533872132?s=20</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how the conservative writer David French <a href="https://frenchpress.thedispatch.com/p/debunking-the-frivolous-and-dangerous" target="_blank">put it</a>: &#8220;Intimidated by Trump and desperate for the approval of Trump’s base, they have lent their own gravitas to utterly frivolous arguments, used their platforms to falsely whip up public concerns about election integrity, and then used the concerns they helped create as the justification for continuing a fruitless fight.&#8221;</p>
<p>What do Republicans hope to gain by fluffing the president&#8217;s delusions all the way to the bitter end? It&#8217;s probably more about what they have to lose. Because so many congressional districts are so <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/27/supreme-court-gerrymandering-1385960" target="_blank">gerrymandered</a>, many GOP lawmakers live in mortal fear of a challenge from the right, to the point that they&#8217;re willing to debase themselves endlessly rather than give any opening to a Trumpier challenger.</p>
<p>&#8220;The paranoid strain of American politics always operated way outside the mainstream, always was marginalized and widely dismissed as the purview of a relatively small number of people with no influence in politics,&#8221; said Mark Rozell, dean of the Schar School of Policy and Government at George Mason University. &#8220;What is shocking about this current movement is the extent to which the paranoid stream has entered the public forum via elected officials in positions of responsibility.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rozell, who spent 40 years studying, teaching and writing about government and political science, sounded genuinely flabbergasted by the degree to which Republican politicians have been stoking baseless election conspiracies when I spoke to him before the holidays.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never thought in my lifetime or any time we would be having discussions about<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/20/media/stelter-trump-martial-law/index.html" target="_blank"> martial law</a> in America or overturning a legitimate national election,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I can only surmise they do so because they believe it is critical to their own political survival as Republicans. &#8230; It is beyond me to understand why preserving one’s short term electoral viability would be a bigger motivator than upholding the very principles of our Republic and the rule of law.&#8221;</p>
<p>High-minded notions aside, there are huge potential practical ramifications for our system and the politicians who line up to get on what another conservative writer, Jonah Goldberg, called the &#8220;<a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/opinion/op-ed/bs-ed-op-0105-goldberg-stupid-20210104-tn4gabydtbfujosdcrllpnv4v4-story.html" target="_blank">stupid side of history</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Trump has been an absolute albatross for Virginia Republicans, but apparently not even years of electoral defeats — the GOP hasn&#8217;t won a statewide race here since 2009, has seen its legislative majorities obliterated and lost three congressional seats — will allow the dread bird to slip from their necks into the sea.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think they’re afraid that Trump doesn’t go away — that he maintains his hold over the Republican voting base during his post presidency,&#8221; Rozell said. &#8220;The demographics of the state, the transition that is happening here is so clearly obvious that it’s astonishing that Republicans continue to run as if this is old Virginia. &#8230; Trump is bringing down the party in Virginia time and again and they’re staying on the sinking ship with him. And it makes no political sense.&#8221;</p>
<p>They&#8217;re also opening the door to every election (including the ones they run in) to be challenged in similar fashion when the loser doesn&#8217;t like the result.</p>
<p>And while <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/hillary-clinton-trump-is-an-illegitimate-president/2019/09/26/29195d5a-e099-11e9-b199-f638bf2c340f_story.html" target="_blank">too many people on the left</a> ran with the idea that Trump&#8217;s 2017 win was illegitimate because of Russian interference and the ensuing investigation into whether his campaign colluded with Russian operatives, many Democrats <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/donald-trump-russia-democrats-233467" target="_blank">were reluctant</a> to openly question Trump&#8217;s legitimacy. (While they&#8217;re howling now, a handful of Democrats <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/27/politics/electoral-college-objection-bush-boxer/index.html" target="_blank">have engaged</a> in the same type of electoral college challenges <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-congress/u-s-congress-certifies-trumps-electoral-college-victory-idUSKBN14Q25R" target="_blank">in the past</a>, though not in the numbers Republicans are marshaling for this week&#8217;s vote.)</p>
<figure id="attachment_13886" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:1920px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Rep.-Rob-Wittman-scaled.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-13886" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Rep.-Rob-Wittman-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1281" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Rep.-Rob-Wittman-scaled.jpg 1920w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Rep.-Rob-Wittman-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Rep.-Rob-Wittman-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Rep.-Rob-Wittman-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Rep.-Rob-Wittman-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Rep.-Rob-Wittman-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Rep.-Rob-Wittman-696x464.jpg 696w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Rep.-Rob-Wittman-1068x712.jpg 1068w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Rep.-Rob-Wittman-630x420.jpg 630w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  U.S. Rep.

<p>&#8220;There are a lot of Democrats who assumed that somehow or another the Russians had hacked voting systems,&#8221; said Eric Oliver, a University of Chicago political science professor who studies conspiracy theories and political psychology. &#8220;Leaders of the Democratic Party didn&#8217;t really foster that. &#8230; This is where the asymmetry comes in. You see all these Republicans who would privately say they know better.&#8221;</p>
<p>Oliver said studies suggest people who identify as strongly conservative are less persuaded by reason or rationality and more susceptible to what he calls &#8220;magical thinking,&#8221; which he describes as making &#8220;attributions to unobservable forces to try to explain some event.&#8221;</p>
<p>That predisposition, combined with Trump&#8217;s insistence the election was stolen from him and the willingness of other top Republicans to go along for the ride, have led to a massive rejection of the election results by Republican voters.</p>
<p><a href="https://poll.qu.edu/national/release-detail?ReleaseID=3685" target="_blank">A December poll</a> found that 77 percent of Republican voters think there was widespread voter fraud — though not a shred of actual evidence has emerged and down-ballot performance by the GOP was indeed better than expected  — and 70 percent of them think Biden&#8217;s victory was illegitimate.</p>
<p>https://twitter.com/cnnbrk/status/1346215088429162497?s=20</p>
<p>&#8220;Add those two factors together and it’s really ripe for deepening this sense of misinformation,&#8221; Oliver said, calling the most corrosive aspect of the current climate the flagging confidence in American institutions aligning with surging anti-democratic sentiment. Throw in the hollowing out of the middle class, anxiety of evangelicals and other conservative religious people in an increasingly secular nation, political elites more focused on elections than crafting policy and these United States look increasingly like a tangled mass of yowling cats more interested in combat than compromise.</p>
<p>“One quarter of people we survey say we’re living in biblical end times and prophecy,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That’s a very different way of understanding the world. &#8230; I don’t know how we bridge that gap honestly.”</p>
<p>How quickly and fully the page gets turned on Trumpism remains to be seen. Sen. Amanda Chase, R-Chesterfield, who has fully embraced the &#8220;Stop the Steal&#8221; song and dance and is seeking the GOP nomination for governor this year, is a sign that Trump&#8217;s strain of conspiratorial conservative politics will remain with us for the near term at least.</p>

Amanda Chase, R-Chesterfield, speaks at a &#8220;Stop the Steal&#8221; rally outside of the Virginia Department of Elections on Nov. 7, 2020. (Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p>Rozell said he used to lecture foreign visitors about U.S. elections and the transition of power, relating the cornerstone values about constitutional powers and the rule of law. A prime example was the disputed 2000 presidential election, during which Florida recounts were scuttled in<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2000/ALLPOLITICS/stories/12/13/gore.ends.campaign/index.html" target="_blank"> controversial fashion</a> by the U.S. Supreme Court, resulting in a concession by then Vice President Al Gore in which he took issue with the court&#8217;s decision but accepted it in the spirit of national unity, Rozell said.</p>
<p>“I can’t tell that story to those groups anymore,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This is having a profoundly damaging effect on the reputation of this country internationally. We have been looked to as a guidepost on how to conduct peaceful elections and transfer of power. It doesn&#8217;t look that way right now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Is there a way out of the hole?</p>
<p>Rozell thinks there&#8217;s a chance that with Trump out of the picture, &#8220;institutionalists&#8221; in the House and Senate, seizing on Biden&#8217;s long history in the Senate and pledge to restore some unity, might rediscover the art of compromise and legislating. It&#8217;s incumbent on leadership in both parties, but particularly the GOP, to tone down the partisan shots, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don’t think most Americans enjoy this. The vast majority of Americans are not political extremists,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And I think the vast majority of the country would be extremely receptive to a shift in political tone.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, that depends on the massive shadow Trump has cast over the nation&#8217;s politics and the Republican Party receding significantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don’t think he’s going away,&#8221; Rozell said, calling Trump&#8217;s dramatic and total remaking of the GOP in his image over the past four years &#8220;unprecedented.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is one for the history books. It’s not a happy story. He has reconstituted the Republican Party into something I never would have expected.&#8221;</p>

Ben Chafin, R-Russell. (Photo by Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>Virginia State Sen. A. Benton &#8220;Ben&#8221; Chafin Jr., R-Russell, has died of COVID-19, the Senate Republican leadership announced Friday evening.</p>
<p>“Tonight, as the Senate of Virginia comes to grips with this tremendous and untimely loss caused by COVID-19, our sympathy and prayers are with Ben’s wife, Lora Lee, their children and grandchildren, and Ben’s mother and his sister, Justice Teresa Chafin,&#8221; Senate Republican Leader Tommy Norment, R-James City, said in a statement.</p>
<p>Chafin, 60, was born in Abingdon and was briefly a member of the House of Delegates before winning a special election to the Senate in 2014. He is the first Virginia lawmaker to die from the virus, though several have had bouts with COVID-19, as has Gov. Ralph Northam and his wife, Pam.</p>
<p>“Ben was deeply and wholeheartedly committed to the commonwealth, and especially to the people of Southwest Virginia. A community leader in Russell, Ben rose to prominence in the fields of law, banking and agriculture long before his neighbors elected him to the General Assembly,&#8221; Norment said.</p>
<p>“First as delegate and then senator, Ben relentlessly promoted and fought for the interests and values of Southwest. He put the interests of those he was entrusted to serve first, cherishing the people of the region he proudly called ‘home.’&#8221;</p>
<p>Northam, a Democrat and former state senator who also presided over the chamber as lieutenant governor, said Southwest Virginia had &#8220;lost a strong advocate — and we have all lost a good man.&#8221;</p>
<p>https://twitter.com/VaCapitolPolice/status/1345206872954068998?s=20</p>
<p>“I knew Ben as a lawmaker, an attorney, a banker, and a farmer raising beef cattle in Moccasin Valley, working the land just as generations of his family had done before him. He loved the outdoors, and he loved serving people even more. He pushed hard to bring jobs and investment to his district, and I will always be grateful for his courageous vote to expand health care for people who need it,&#8221; Northam said, referring to <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/07/23/four-years-of-political-battling-over-medicaid-expansion-has-ended-what-comes-next/" target="_blank">Chafin&#8217;s vote to expand Medicaid in 2018</a>. Northam has ordered the state flag to be lowered to half-staff.</p>
<p>“Pam and I are praying for Lora and their children. &#8230; This is sad news to begin a new year with the loss of a kind and gracious man. May we all recommit to taking extra steps to care for one another,&#8221; Northam said.</p>
<p><a href="https://roanoke.com/news/local/state-sen-ben-chafin-who-represented-part-of-new-river-valley-dies-from-covid-19/article_b62cc1ce-4c99-11eb-8907-7b5fc33eb581.html#tracking-source=home-top-story" target="_blank">The Roanoke Times</a> reported that Chafin had tested positive for the virus in December but that his family kept the diagnosis private for weeks.</p>
<p>Democratic House Speaker Eileen Filler-Corn, D-Fairfax,<a href="https://twitter.com/EFillerCorn/status/1345182799775625216?s=20" target="_blank"> said</a> she was &#8220;deeply saddened&#8221; by Chafin&#8217;s death, which comes less than two weeks before the General Assembly is scheduled to convene on Jan. 13.</p>
<p>&#8220;I respected his commitment to the people of the 38th senatorial district and his strong advocacy on their behalf,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Democratic Senate Majority Leader Dick Saslaw, D-Fairfax, said Chafin &#8220;epitomized the Virginia gentleman — he was compassionate, thoughtful and cared deeply for his district and all Virginians. We will miss him dearly.&#8221;</p>

The value of the work isn&#8217;t meant to be judged by how many people click on a given story.</p>
<p>Indeed, wise reporters and editors stop questioning early in their careers why some stories, especially those that might seem more trivial, take flight while others of equal or greater import fail to land with a big audience.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s just a sampling of the important work Mercury journalists did in a year more challenging than any I&#8217;ve seen in my 15-year career that&#8217;s not on this list:</p>
<p>• Kate Masters&#8217; unrelenting coverage of the state&#8217;s response to the pandemic, from<a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/05/01/supply-shortages-and-poor-coordination-delayed-covid-19-testing-in-virginia-for-weeks/" target="_blank"> testing capacity</a> to <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/06/23/cant-explain-the-about-face-sudden-reversal-on-nursing-home-disclosures-lead-to-bipartisan-questioning/" target="_blank">surging deaths and secrecy surrounding nursing homes</a> to the <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/12/31/in-virginia-slow-vaccine-rollout-frustrates-health-care-providers/" target="_blank">rollout of vaccines.</a></p>
<p>• Sarah Vogelsong&#8217;s exhaustive reporting on Virginia&#8217;s implementation of the Clean Economy Act, the landmark energy legislation passed by the General Assembly in 2020, in our <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/category/energyenvironment/virginias-clean-energy-transition/" target="_blank">Virginia&#8217;s</a> <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/category/energyenvironment/virginias-clean-energy-transition/" target="_blank">Clean Energy Transition</a> special series. I promise you won&#8217;t find as comprehensive, insightful and crucial coverage on this critical legislation that will affect every Virginian (through their power bills and air quality) from any other news outlet. Sarah also<a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/08/31/virginia-officials-backed-off-push-to-close-shore-poultry-plants-for-two-weeks-to-fight-pandemic/" target="_blank"> broke a story</a> about Virginia health officials backing away from a push to close poultry plants to protect workers from COVID-19.</p>
<p>• Ned Oliver&#8217;s<a href="https://twitter.com/nedoliver/status/1267073616744722432" target="_blank"> photography</a> and<a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/06/08/richmond-police-keep-quiet-on-discipline-after-officers-attack-demonstrators/" target="_blank"> coverage</a> of the George Floyd protests in Richmond and what the General Assembly<a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/11/11/every-criminal-justice-reform-that-passed-in-virginia-after-george-floyds-death/" target="_blank"> did</a> and <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/10/20/virginia-lawmakers-get-mixed-reviews-on-police-reform-efforts/" target="_blank">didn&#8217;t </a>do in a special session called in part to address racial inequities in our criminal justice system.</p>
<p>• Graham Moomaw&#8217;s <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/10/15/a-lot-at-stake-for-communities-of-color-race-takes-central-role-in-redistricting-fight/" target="_blank">insightful and leading reporting</a> of one of the biggest things on Virginia&#8217;s ballot this year, a redistricting amendment that voters approved in November and which will dramatically alter how we draw political boundaries here, as well as the<a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/12/09/terry-mcauliffe-is-running-for-governor-again-can-anyone-beat-him/" target="_blank"> battle for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination</a> next year.</p>
<p>• The work of our experienced and talented roster of columnists and contributors, including <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/author/roger-chesley/" target="_blank">Roger Chesley</a>, <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/author/bob-lewis/" target="_blank">Bob Lewis</a>, <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/author/ivy-main/" target="_blank">Ivy Main</a>, <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/author/samantha-willis/" target="_blank">Samantha Willis</a> and <a href="http://virginiamercury.com/author/wyatt-gordon/">Wyatt Gordon</a>.</p>
<p>All that said, it can be an interesting exercise to check which stories generated the most views. Spoiler alert: It was a big year for marijuana policy, venomous caterpillars and coverage of Virginia&#8217;s struggling unemployment system as pandemic idled workers desperately searched for news on their claims.</p>
<p>Here they are:</p>
<h2><strong>No. 10: <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/11/16/northam-we-are-going-to-move-forward-with-legalizing-marijuana-in-virginia/" target="_blank">Northam: ‘We are going to move forward with legalizing marijuana in Virginia’</a></strong></h2>
<p>In November, Gov. Ralph Northam formally announced that the state would pursue recreational marijuana legalization, less than a year after the legislature decriminalized the drug. The news wasn&#8217;t exactly a shock, coming after a state mandated study looking at the ins and outs of legalization that said a recreational cannabis industry could generate more than $300 million per year in tax revenues by the fifth year of operations and, combined with decriminalization, could reduce marijuana arrests by 84 percent. Legalization could also create more than 11,000 jobs, the study found.</p>

<h2><strong>No. 9: <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/will-virginia-sign-on-to-trumps-plan-to-boost-unemployment-benefits-by-400/" target="_blank">Will Virginia sign on to Trump’s plan to boost unemployment benefits by $400?</a></strong></h2>
<p>Throughout the pandemic, stories about unemployment benefits, eviction and utility relief and other kitchen table coverage, set against the muddled plans put forward by the Trump administration and the inability of state systems to come to grips with the crush of claimants, were among the most-read articles on the Mercury. &#8220;Governors, lawmakers and state unemployment agencies on Monday wrestled with confusion created by President Donald Trump’s executive action extending unemployment benefits, and it appeared some states could settle for $300 a week in benefits instead of the $400 that the president touted,&#8221; States Newsroom national correspondent Jacob Fischler reported.</p>
<h2><strong>No. 8: <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/05/28/yes-disobeying-virginias-mask-order-could-carry-a-criminal-charge-but-northam-appears-to-be-counting-on-compliance/" target="_blank">Yes, disobeying Virginia’s mask order could carry a criminal charge. But Northam appears to be counting on compliance.</a></strong></h2>
<p>In May, after a good bit of &#8220;will he or won&#8217;t he&#8221; speculation, Gov. Northam joined other leaders in imposing a mask mandate on Virginians. But there were a lot of unanswered questions. And the Mercury&#8217;s Kate Masters got to the bottom of what Northam&#8217;s rule would, and wouldn&#8217;t do, which thousands of readers were looking for answers about.</p>
<figure id="attachment_18456" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:1920px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/200516_vm_reopen_phase_one_0443.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-18456" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/200516_vm_reopen_phase_one_0443.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1280" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/200516_vm_reopen_phase_one_0443.jpg 1920w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/200516_vm_reopen_phase_one_0443-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/200516_vm_reopen_phase_one_0443-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/200516_vm_reopen_phase_one_0443-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/200516_vm_reopen_phase_one_0443-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/200516_vm_reopen_phase_one_0443-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/200516_vm_reopen_phase_one_0443-696x464.jpg 696w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/200516_vm_reopen_phase_one_0443-1068x712.jpg 1068w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/200516_vm_reopen_phase_one_0443-630x420.jpg 630w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Jay Breneman and his daughter, Anna Grace, browse footwear at Walkabout Outfitter in Richmond, Va., May 16, 2020.

<h2><strong>No. 7: <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/virginia-says-it-accidentally-overpaid-35000-workers-receiving-unemployment-insurance/" target="_blank">Virginia says it accidentally overpaid 35,000 workers receiving unemployment insurance</a></strong></h2>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to sum up this story from May on another SNAFU in pandemic-related unemployment benefits administration better than Ned Oliver did in his one-two lede:</p>
<blockquote class="td_quote_box td_box_center"><p>The good news: After waiting weeks for the state to set up an online system to allow self-employed workers to collect pandemic assistance through the CARES Act, people began receiving their first checks last week.</p>
<p>The bad news: Just over 35,000 of them were overpaid between $600 and $1,200 — money the state says will be deducted from future checks.</p></blockquote>
<h2><strong>No. 6: <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/virginia-expects-to-begin-distributing-300-a-week-unemployment-supplement-in-late-september/" target="_blank">Virginia expects to begin distributing $300-a-week unemployment supplement in late September</a></strong></h2>
<p>Remember that $300 extra in unemployment benefits the Trump administration and states were trying to coordinate in August? By September, it was supposed to be on the way but hadn&#8217;t gotten to Virginians. <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/10/15/virginia-one-of-last-states-to-distribute-300-unemployment-supplement-authorized-by-trump/" target="_blank">Virginia would actually be one of the last states to start doling out the money</a>, not getting around to it until mid-October. Thousands of Mercury readers were wondering why it hadn&#8217;t arrived yet.</p>
<h2><strong>No. 5: <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/09/11/venomous-caterpillar-no-one-has-heard-of-sends-new-kent-woman-to-er/" target="_blank">Venomous caterpillar ‘no one has heard of’ sends New Kent woman to ER</a></strong></h2>
<p>It was no surprise that in a year when so many of us spent so much of our lines online, every weird and terrible animal tale (remember the murder hornets?) flew around the internet as evidence that 2020 had dropped yet another dreadful shoe. Rex Springston — who built a career out of those stories and many more about nature and the environment at the Richmond Times-Dispatch and now kindly contributes them to us — had a big hit by recounting the ordeal of a New Kent woman who was stung by the poofy-but-poisonous puss caterpillar. The story became such a sensation, with outlets around the world recasting Rex&#8217;s reporting, without actually doing any of their own, <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/10/27/step-aside-murder-hornet-how-the-puss-caterpillar-took-the-internet-by-storm/#:~:text=The%20puss%20caterpillar%20is%20covered,the%20fur%20of%20a%20cat." target="_blank">that he wrote a followup</a> marveling on what passes for journalism sometimes in the information age. &#8220;Each day each headline got more and more preposterous,” said Michelle Stoll, the Virginia forestry department’s public information director.</p>
<figure id="attachment_21428" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:1137px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Puss_CDC_CROP.png" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-21428" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Puss_CDC_CROP.png" alt="" width="1137" height="758" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Puss_CDC_CROP.png 1137w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Puss_CDC_CROP-300x200.png 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Puss_CDC_CROP-1024x683.png 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Puss_CDC_CROP-768x512.png 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Puss_CDC_CROP-696x464.png 696w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Puss_CDC_CROP-1068x712.png 1068w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Puss_CDC_CROP-630x420.png 630w" sizes="(max-width: 1137px) 100vw, 1137px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  The puss caterpillar, (Megalopyge opercularis) which can inflict a painful sting on people.

<h2><strong>No. 4: <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/03/08/virginia-lawmakers-vote-to-decriminalize-marijuana-set-25-civil-penalty-for-possession/" target="_blank">Virginia lawmakers vote to decriminalize marijuana, set $25 civil penalty for possession</a></strong></h2>
<p>What can we say? The people want cannabis coverage. Ned Oliver had the big sweep story on the legislature&#8217;s historic vote in March to deciminalize marijuana possession. “This means close to 30,000 people a year will no longer be labeled as criminals and no longer will suffer the negative repercussions of a criminal conviction,” said Sen. Adam Ebbin, D-Alexandria, who carried the legislation in the Senate.</p>
<h2><strong>No. 3: <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/metalheads-with-kazoos-drown-out-westboro-baptist-church-at-capitol/" target="_blank">Metalheads with kazoos drown out Westboro Baptist Church at Capitol</a></strong></h2>
<p>Call it an oldie but a goodie. This story actually isn&#8217;t from 2020. It&#8217;s from 2019. But because of the mysteries of the internet, it began circulating again (mostly on Facebook and Reddit it seems) and was again launched into one of our most-read stories of 2020. Can&#8217;t keep those metalheads down.</p>
<h2><strong>No. 2: <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/virginia-cuts-off-unemployment-benefits-to-12000-people-for-refusing-to-return-to-work/" target="_blank">Virginia cuts off unemployment benefits to 12,000 people for refusing to return to work</a></strong></h2>
<p>In June, with lots of questions looming about how state health officials would ensure that workplaces were COVID-19 safe for Virginia workers, since regulations on that front hadn&#8217;t been approved yet, the Virginia Employment Commission said it had cut off unemployment benefits to more than 12,000 people the agency says had refused to return to work.</p>
<p>“As employers have resumed operations, many have attempted to recall furloughed or laid-off employees to work,” the agency said in a statement. “While certain circumstances, such as health, childcare or other caregiver responsibilities, may warrant continued payments of unemployment benefits to a claimant who has refused to return to work, the payments will be paused pending the outcome of an administrative review.”</p>
<h2><em>Drumroll please &#8230;</em></h2>
<h2><strong> No. 1:<a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/07/01/marijuana-is-now-decriminalized-in-virginia-heres-what-that-means/" target="_blank">Marijuana is now decriminalized in Virginia. Here’s what that means.</a></strong></h2>
<p>Did I mention that people really want cannabis coverage? Ned Oliver&#8217;s explainer on the details of Virginia&#8217;s decriminalization legislation makes marijuana policy news the alpha and omega of our list this year. That underscores how rapidly typically slow-moving Virginia altered course on the issue.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s a significant shift in a state where police reported a record 29,000 arrests for marijuana possession in 2018 and a study the prior year found 127 people were being held in jail solely on a marijuana charge — enforcement that disproportionately targeted Black Virginians,&#8221; Ned reported.</p>

</p><p>It was more than 12 years ago, and it sure feels like a different era in American politics.</p>
<p>Stung years earlier during his unsuccessful bid for the GOP nomination by a <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2004/11/mccain200411" target="_blank">despicable, racist and false</a> whisper campaign during the South Carolina primary, John McCain wasn&#8217;t having it in 2008 when an elderly White woman at a town hall <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrnRU3ocIH4" target="_blank">said she couldn&#8217;t trust his opponent</a>, Barack Obama, because he was &#8220;an Arab.&#8221;</p>
<p>McCain grabbed the mic from her.</p>
<p>“No, ma’am,” he said. “He’s a decent family man [and] citizen that I just happen to have disagreements with on fundamental issues, and that’s what this campaign is all about.&#8221;</p>
<p>To a White man who said he was &#8220;scared&#8221; of an Obama presidency, McCain replied: &#8220;I want to be president of the United States and obviously I do not want Sen. Obama to be. But I have to tell you &#8230; he is a decent person and a person that you do not have to be scared (of) as president of the United States.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sadly, McCain is dead now, and, for the most part, so is the kind of bare-minimum decency he demonstrated on his side of the aisle.</p>
<p>The election is over. Donald Trump has lost. <a href="https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-donald-trump-new-hampshire-elections-31aca0d0de0d3f4e0cd1297167e778eb" target="_blank">A handful of Republicans</a> have acknowledged this basic fact.</p>
<p>But many others, including here in Virginia, are either going through convoluted contortions to make it sound like we never actually KNOW who won an election until results are certified across the nation or, way worse, parroting Trump&#8217;s pernicious, nonsensical claim that the election he&#8217;s lost by thousands and thousands of votes in swing states (a margin that&#8217;s <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/11/politics/joe-biden-2020-election-win/index.html" target="_blank">grown daily</a> in many states as more votes are counted) is actually being stolen because of fraud that is at once so massive and widespread that it&#8217;s altered the results and so clandestine that no<a href="https://apnews.com/article/election-2020-donald-trump-virus-outbreak-elections-courts-f67b847f656e08a6019dcb308f2b4451?utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_medium=AP_Politics&amp;utm_campaign=SocialFlow" target="_blank"> actual evidence has emerged</a>.</p>
<p>Indeed it&#8217;s quite an exercise in intentional cognitive dissonance to crow about better-than-expected GOP down-ballot performance while simultaneously blasting the results you don&#8217;t like as fraudulent.</p>
<p>https://twitter.com/RSLC/status/1326268464638676994?s=20</p>
<p>https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1327279929319432200?s=20</p>
<p>It&#8217;s no surprise that Trump, conspiracy-theorist in chief that he is, is baselessly blaming his loss on voter fraud. His entire presidency (<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/trump-lied-to-me-about-his-wealth-to-get-onto-the-forbes-400-here-are-the-tapes/2018/04/20/ac762b08-4287-11e8-8569-26fda6b404c7_story.html" target="_blank">and much of his life</a>) has been an exercise in fabulation — from lying about <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/440778-trump-says-2017-claim-of-obama-wiretapping-was-based-on-a-little-bit" target="_blank">Trump Tower wiretapping</a> and hush-money payments to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/08/23/not-just-misleading-not-merely-false-lie/" target="_blank">Stormy Daniels</a> to his <a href="https://www.politifact.com/article/2019/dec/16/lie-of-the-year-donald-trump-whistleblower-wrong/" target="_blank">Ukraine</a> phone call, the severity of the <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/11/trumps-lies-about-coronavirus/608647/" target="_blank">coronavirus</a> and <a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/list/?page=4&amp;category=&amp;ruling=pants-fire&amp;speaker=donald-trump" target="_blank">all kinds of things in between</a>.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s slightly less clear is why Republicans feel compelled to continue to admire the emperor&#8217;s nonexistent haberdashery.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is the downside for humoring him for this little bit of time? No one seriously thinks the results will change,” a &#8220;senior Republican official&#8221; <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/11/10/whats-downside-humoring-him-gop-officials-unintentionally-revealing-quote-about-trump-era/" target="_blank">told The Washington Post</a>. “He went golfing this weekend. It’s not like he’s plotting how to prevent Joe Biden from taking power on Jan. 20. He’s tweeting about filing some lawsuits, those lawsuits will fail, then he’ll tweet some more about how the election was stolen, and then he’ll leave.”</p>
<p>To state what should be obvious to anyone hoping to forge something like a functional constitutional republic out of the bitter polarization of Trump&#8217;s America, the downside is the poison being poured into the ears and eyeballs of millions of conservative voters who are being told, by people who know better, that an election is being stolen in plain sight.</p>
<p>https://twitter.com/BrianSchoeneman/status/1326968728207183877?s=20</p>
<p>Some of it seems like a basic grift.</p>
<p>For example, the Republican Party of Virginia launched an &#8220;<a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/11/12/as-some-in-gop-amplify-election-conspiracies-riggleman-says-republicans-have-a-duty-to-speak-out/" target="_blank">election integrity fund</a>&#8221; in attempt to siphon more money out of its voters ostensibly on behalf of the guy who has helped lose the Virginia GOP every statewide election, control of the General Assembly and three House of Representative seats since he took office. Perhaps it has a lot do with keeping conservative voters and donors angry and engaged with a pair of Georgia runoffs that could decide control of the Senate. Maybe it&#8217;s just the natural lurch from one angry electorate to another and Republicans are attempting to keep the fires stoked after a rare loss by an incumbent president.</p>
<p>https://twitter.com/jtuckermartin/status/1326897662168363016?s=20</p>
<p>To be frank though, some people don&#8217;t actually know better, evidenced by some representative emails from readers, of which we&#8217;ve gotten many since the election was finally called for Biden Saturday.</p>
<p>&#8220;Trump has not lost this election!!!!!!!!! You folks are nothing but propaganda!!!!! Biden is not the president elect stop lying!&#8221; one wrote.</p>
<p>Another: &#8220;As it turns out, you are just another propaganda mouth piece for the Establishment, repeating the lies of the globalist elite who want to destroy the foundation of the United States. &#8230; Obviously, there was massive, blatant election fraud and voter fraud in this election. There are mountains of evidence of this, and it is not conspiracy theory, it is conspiracy fact.&#8221;</p>
<p>These are the fever dreams Republicans are breathing life into.</p>
<p>There is a direct path from the vicious, false Obama birtherism that launched Trump&#8217;s political career to the present alternate reality so many people seem to be living in. It was already beginning to shape the GOP electorate during the McCain-Obama race and unfortunately was partly ushered in <a href="https://time.com/4516462/obama-line-sarah-palin-donald-trump/" target="_blank">by McCain himself</a> when he made the catastrophic mistake of <a href="https://www.npr.org/2016/01/23/464068087/how-sarah-palin-paved-the-way-for-donald-trump" target="_blank">choosing as his running mate</a> Sarah Palin, who Obama <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/12/politics/obama-memoir-promised-land/index.html" target="_blank">himself says </a>brought &#8220;xenophobia, anti intellectualism, paranoid conspiracy theories, an antipathy toward Black and brown folks&#8221; to &#8220;center stage.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is the reason people still refuse to wear masks — to the point that Alabama&#8217;s top health official has faced <a href="https://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/story/news/local/community/2020/11/12/montgomery-community-hero-alabama-health-officer-scott-harris-guide-state-through-covid-19-crisis/3744644001/" target="_blank">death threats</a> because he encouraged the governor there to impose a mask mandate — even as the nation falls back into the maw of a pandemic that has already <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/researchers-covid-19-death-toll-could-double-winter-world-war-n1247726" target="_blank">killed more than 244,000 and could kill thousands</a> more before it&#8217;s brought to heel. It&#8217;s the reason there are people on your timelines who are all of a sudden experts in all 50 states&#8217; election laws, the Electoral College and voting machines. It&#8217;s the reason there are loud-and-proud QAnon adherents <a href="https://www.rollcall.com/2020/11/05/qanon-goes-to-washington-two-supporters-win-seats-in-congress/" target="_blank">in Congress now</a>.</p>
<p>Republicans have been accused of &#8220;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/growing-number-of-republicans-struggle-to-defend-trump-on-g-7-choice-ukraine-and-syria/2019/10/18/20e56612-f1b8-11e9-89eb-ec56cd414732_story.html" target="_blank">playing with fire</a>,&#8221; for much of the Trump era — countenancing his refusal to release his tax returns and<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/01/20/trump-businesses-empire-tied-presidency-100496" target="_blank"> fully divest </a>from his businesses, covering for his attempted strong-arming of a foreign leader to get dirt on Biden, turning a blind eye to a laundry list of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/28/opinion/trump-administration-corruption-conflicts.html" target="_blank">corrupt self-dealing</a> and making excuses for his <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/08/trump-coronavirus-deaths-timeline.html" target="_blank">disastrous dissembling and mismanagement</a> of the virus response.</p>
<p>Now, they&#8217;re content to torch the integrity of the entire election system because they can&#8217;t or won&#8217;t put the shambling monster they&#8217;ve unleashed back in its cage.</p>

(Parker Michels-Boyce/ For the Virginia Mercury)</p><p>David Isay knows StoryCorps&#8217; latest move won&#8217;t go over well with everyone.</p>
<p>Getting strangers to talk to each other despite political differences — an attempt to bridge our deep divisions and recognize our common humanity that it calls<a href="https://storycorps.org/discover/onesmallstep/" target="_blank"> One Small Step</a> — isn&#8217;t exactly de rigueur.</p>
<p>“We know from polling that there are people on either end who have no interest in hearing the stories of other people,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Combat, both of the virtual and actual varieties, feels <a href="https://www.voterstudygroup.org/blog/has-american-partisanship-gone-too-far" target="_blank">more of the moment</a> than conversation.</p>
<p>In its promotional materials, One Small Step <a href="https://www.dannyhayes.org/uploads/6/9/8/5/69858539/kalmoe___mason_ncapsa_2019_-_lethal_partisanship_-_final_lmedit.pdf" target="_blank">cites a 2019 study</a> by Louisiana State University and University of Maryland professors that found &#8220;40 percent of people view the other party as &#8216;downright evil&#8217;; one in five Republicans and Democrats agree with the statement that their political adversaries &#8216;lack the traits to be considered fully human&#8217;; and about 20 percent of Democrats and Republicans think the country would be better off if large numbers of the opposition were dead.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Isay is banking on research that suggests there&#8217;s an &#8220;<a href="https://hiddentribes.us/" target="_blank">exhausted majority</a>&#8221; that&#8217;s ready to try find a way past perilous political polarization.</p>
<p>“We think that the people of Richmond have the courage to do this,&#8221; he told me in an interview Monday. Based on polling, research and a pilot with VPM, Richmond became one of four cities StoryCorps has picked in which to anchor One Small Step, which &#8220;invites two people who don’t know each other — and may not think they have a single thing in common — to take a moment to reflect upon and share what we care about and the dreams we have for our future generations.&#8221;</p>
<p>It builds on the venerable <a href="https://storycorps.org/" target="_blank">StoryCorps</a> model, now about 17 years old, which has recorded interviews with more than 650,000 participants to store the wit, wisdom, heartbreak and humor of a huge variety of people at the Library of Congress.</p>
<p>Isay knows One Small Step is up against a multi-billion dollar social media and media complex invested in fomenting hate and division and a toxic political climate in which many brook no criticism, real or perceived, of their tribe.  “It&#8217;s a David and Goliath kind of insane moonshot effort,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>But he also thinks it&#8217;s a crucial moment to try to stem the tide. Because when we start seeing political opponents as dangerous &#8220;others&#8221;  who need to be destroyed, rather than fellow Americans with whom we disagree, we&#8217;re on a slippery slope to horrific things.</p>
<p>“I became concerned about the dehumanization,&#8221; he said. &#8220;A democracy can’t survive in a swamp of mutual contempt.”</p>
<p>One Small Step, he says, is based on contact theory, <a href="https://www.apa.org/monitor/nov01/contact#:~:text=A%20longstanding%20line%20of%20research,certain%20conditions%2C%20such%20as%20equal" target="_blank">which holds that under certain conditions</a>, such as equal status and common goals, contact between groups can promote tolerance and acceptance.</p>
<p>“It’s not the answer to everything,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It’s a small attempt to help take down the temperature.&#8221;</p>
<p>While StoryCorps interviews have traditionally been face-to-face, these will be virtual as a result of the pandemic. To participate, you sign up <a href="https://storycorps.org/discover/onesmallstep/richmond/" target="_blank">here, </a>after which you&#8217;ll answer some questions, get matched up with someone from across the political divide with whom you&#8217;ve got something in common, agree to ground rules and sit for a virtual meeting that will be recorded for posterity.</p>

<p>&#8220;The dream with this is we convince the country it’s our patriotic duty to see the humanity of people with which we disagree,&#8221; Isay said. &#8220;I hope people will have the courage to take this small step and listen to someone different than them and I promise they won&#8217;t regret it.”</p>
<p>Participants talk about their parents, their faiths and their life experiences, among other personal details. But, like many a family around the Thanksgiving table, there&#8217;s one thing they&#8217;re encouraged to steer clear of.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We suggest that you don&#8217;t talk about politics,&#8221; Isay said. </span></p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>Though a University of Virginia model now projects a potential new peak in Virginia COVID-19 cases in November, a top state health official says it&#8217;s too soon to tell whether<a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/coronavirus/coronavirus/covid-19-in-virginia-cases/" target="_blank"> an uptick in cases</a> over the past few weeks is indicative of a bigger trend.</p>
<p>“It’s premature to say now things are increasing,&#8221; said Dr. Lilian Peake, Virginia&#8217;s state epidemiologist. &#8220;We really have had quite a bit of increase over the summer. And that’s been generally going down. Now we are seeing a little bit of increase but it’s small and we need to see what happens with that.”</p>
<p>A model released last week by UVA&#8217;s Biocomplexity Institute projects that confirmed COVID-19 cases will peak in Virginia during the week ending Nov. 22 with 8,394 weekly cases and a total of 202,040 confirmed cases by Thanksgiving, though the institute cautioned that model isn&#8217;t necessarily a crystal ball. (As of Tuesday there were 167,754 confirmed and probable cases in Virginia.)</p>
<p>&#8220;Models are designed to project what could happen based on current trends but do not forecast what will happen. Behavioral responses drive changes in current trends,&#8221; <a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/content/uploads/sites/182/2020/10/UVA-COVID-19-Model-Weekly-Report-2020-10-16.pdf" target="_blank">the Oct. 16 report says</a>. Previous reports by the institute indicated Virginia hit its weekly peak <a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/content/uploads/sites/182/2020/10/Weekly-Report-Oct-9.pdf" target="_blank">the week of Aug. 9</a>, when there were 7,581 weekly cases. Incidence of COVID-19 in Virginia remains below the national average, Peake said, with 88 new cases per 100,000 last week compared to the national average of 117 per 100,000.</p>
<p>The model says five Virginia health districts have entered &#8220;surge trajectories&#8221; (defined as 2.5 or more confirmed cases per 100,000 people per week) and the &#8220;reproduction rate,&#8221; the number of cases expected to be generated by one case, is above 1.0 statewide and in all but one region.</p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p>Bryan Lewis, a <span style="font-weight: 400;">computational epidemiologist and a research professor at UVA, said the institute&#8217;s latest projection was also informed by increasing transmission rates in cooler </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">states like <a href="https://wisconsinexaminer.com/2020/10/16/state-works-to-ramp-up-community-testing-for-virus/" target="_blank">Wisconsin,</a> <a href="https://thehill.com/changing-america/well-being/prevention-cures/521756-north-south-dakota-report-high-new-coronavirus" target="_blank">North Dakota and South Dakota</a> and previous research on how respiratory viruses spread, particularly when cold weather forces more people inside.</span></p>
<p>“We’ve been seeing increased rates up there,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That onset of colder weather, combined with schools across Virginia resuming in-person instruction, school-related virus transmission data from other states as well as the increased cases in college towns when universities brought students back, augurs an increase in virus cases into the late fall and early winter.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;While early, national and global trends suggest concerns about winter case growth and schools reopening may be founded,&#8221; the institute wrote in its most recent update.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s not carved in stone. Human behavior can make all the difference, both Lewis and Peake said. And after more than eight months of grappling with a pandemic virus that&#8217;s infected millions of Americans and killed almost 221,000 people (including nearly 3,500 in Virginia) now isn&#8217;t the time to let &#8220;COVID fatigue&#8221; set in, especially as Thanksgiving approaches and many people are considering how to approach large family gatherings, they said.</p>
<p>“Outbreaks are occurring when people let their guard down,” Peake said, citing recent examples of workplace breakrooms and lunch rooms when masks come off and social distancing isn&#8217;t observed. &#8220;One thing that we have learned is there is a lot of asymptomatic transmission.”</p>
<p>Peake said state officials are monitoring mounting case numbers in southwest, central, and southern Virginia and have rapid-response teams to help curb rising transmission, similar to the approach the state took with surges in eastern Virginia over the summer. The teams combine workers focused on testing strategies, containment of outbreaks, communications and making recommendations for isolation and quarantine, she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Each region is doing that to really look at the data and understand what can we do differently,” Peake said.</p>
<p>The prescription for <a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/content/uploads/sites/121/2020/10/VDH-Interim-Guidance-for-Halloween-Events-2.pdf" target="_blank">Halloween</a> and the coming holiday season is more of the same: masks, social distancing and avoiding large gatherings.</p>
<p>“It’s been hard but it has kept a lot of people well,&#8221; Peake said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Virginians have done a really good job of taking this seriously and putting preventative measures in place,&#8221; she added. &#8220;Transmission is continuing. In some areas it is quite high. So it’s important for all Virginians to continue to take this seriously and practice preventive measures that we know are working. &#8230; There has been some good news about potential vaccines. So if we continue to take this seriously and practice safe measures, hopefully in the future we’ll have a vaccine and have better treatment.”</p>
<p>From a policy standpoint, Virginia has done a good job of managing the pandemic, Lewis said. Some of the commonwealth&#8217;s residents, however, don&#8217;t get as high marks for their compliance, in his view.</p>
<p>“There’s guidelines, mandates, etc. &#8230;  But adherence is what drives reduction of the disease,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Virginia, and much of the rest of the country, he noted, are entering a potential high transmission season not having knocked down prevalence of the virus enough to relax any restrictions.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re heading into the winter with a higher number of cases than we would have preferred,&#8221; he said, likening the situation to a speeding car coming to a bend in the road. &#8220;We’re going into this curve a little too fast.”</p>

(Virginia Mercury)</p><p>In a tumultuous 2020, when it seems like everything is fraying at the seams, there are still certainties.</p>
<p>Death. Taxes.</p>
<p>And Virginia officials flouting the spirit and letter of the state&#8217;s Freedom of Information Act — which<a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacodepopularnames/virginia-freedom-of-information-act/" target="_blank"> says</a> it &#8220;ensures the people of the commonwealth ready access to public records in the custody of a public body or its officers and employees&#8221; but too often fails to deliver on that simple and important mission.</p>
<p>Consider the perverse spectacle of a watchdog agency, the Office of the State Inspector General, intended to &#8220;maximize the public’s confidence and trust in state government by promoting and practicing the highest level of integrity, efficiency, effectiveness and economy,&#8221; refusing to release details of its investigation into the latest misdeeds of the Virginia Parole Board.</p>
<p>Crazy as it may sound, it&#8217;s hard to maximize the public&#8217;s confidence when you won&#8217;t tell the public what you&#8217;ve discovered.</p>
<p><a href="https://apnews.com/article/richmond-virginia-laws-f1729b3fc2717e3cf964f19f1484022b" target="_blank">As The Associated Press</a> and other outlets reported, after receiving a tip through the state&#8217;s Fraud, Waste and Abuse Hotline, the inspector general substantiated five allegations that the parole board didn&#8217;t properly notify prosecutors of decisions and seven allegations that it failed to &#8220;endeavor diligently&#8221; to contact victims. But details were almost entirely redacted in documents provided to the AP and other news outlets. Here&#8217;s a very representative sample of what the OSIG sent me last week:</p>
<figure id="attachment_22422" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:768px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/OSIG_REPORT.png" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-22422" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/OSIG_REPORT.png" alt="" width="768" height="512" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/OSIG_REPORT.png 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/OSIG_REPORT-300x200.png 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/OSIG_REPORT-696x464.png 696w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/OSIG_REPORT-630x420.png 630w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  The Virginia Office of the State Inspector General has refused to release details of an investigation into the Virginia Parole Board. Documents provided to the Mercury were almost entirely redacted.</p></figure>
<p>&#8220;I share the public’s desire to achieve as much transparency as possible and encourage you to work with the Office of the Attorney General to release as much information as you are legally able to,&#8221; Secretary of Public Safety Brian Moran wrote in an letter to Inspector General Michael Westfall (<a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-and-regional/va-watchdog-substantiates-6-of-7-allegations-against-the-va-parole-board-in-new-unidentified/article_96470ee1-f8fb-5af0-9183-e1304b961b7b.html" target="_blank">as reported by the Richmond Times-Dispatch</a>) about Westfall&#8217;s decision to withhold, both from the public and Virginia lawmakers, the details of what exactly the Parole Board had done this time.</p>
<p>At a news conference Tuesday, though, Moran insisted it was against the law to divulge anything else.</p>
<p>“The report itself is property of OSIG,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It is their authority, obligation, responsibility to determine whether or not that gets released. And by code, it contains information that is not FOIA-able.”</p>
<p>Moran also suggested Westfall is refusing to release the report to the Republican lawmakers who are demanding to see it because the last time he did that — involving an investigation into another Parole Board decision<a href="https://apnews.com/article/richmond-shootings-virginia-u-s-news-288401a58b7d88c409cabf174c1c491e" target="_blank"> involving convicted cop-killer Vincent Martin</a> — they released the information to the public.</p>
<figure id="attachment_4247" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:1920px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/mercury-ctb-shots-2.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" id="longdesc-return-4247" class="size-full wp-image-4247" tabindex="-1" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/mercury-ctb-shots-2.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1280" longdesc="https://www.virginiamercury.com?longdesc=4247&amp;referrer=22258" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/mercury-ctb-shots-2.jpg 1920w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/mercury-ctb-shots-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/mercury-ctb-shots-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/mercury-ctb-shots-2-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/mercury-ctb-shots-2-696x464.jpg 696w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/mercury-ctb-shots-2-1068x712.jpg 1068w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/mercury-ctb-shots-2-630x420.jpg 630w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Secretary of Public Safety Brian Moran. (Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p>“The initial report regarding Mr. Martin was provided to a select number of legislators. Those legislators immediately released the report,&#8221; Moran said. “I don’t want to speak for Mr. Westfall, but I suggest that is his reluctance to release that again to those legislators for fear they will publish it publicly which is forbidden by the code section.”</p>
<p>Never mind that Westfall evidently decided <a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/government-politics/governors-office-inspector-general-to-give-report-of-parole-board-investigation-to-legislators/article_6d9ca023-43fa-5d02-9665-02cc74c4b5f0.html" target="_blank">the last time around</a>, as the Republican lawmakers argued, that the law required him to turn over the report to the legislators, since state code says explicitly that the IG &#8220;shall notify the Governor&#8217;s chief of staff, the Speaker, Majority Leader, and Minority Leader of the House of Delegates, and the President pro tempore, Majority Leader, and Minority Leader of the Senate of problems, abuses, or deficiencies relating to the management or operation of a state agency or nonstate agency.&#8221;</p>
<p>Asked why his office wouldn&#8217;t release it&#8217;s own copy of the report, Moran again insisted that is &#8220;forbidden by code.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Inspector General&#8217;s Office says that because the Parole Board is exempt from the FOIA law, the report it prepared on the Parole Board&#8217;s wrongdoing can&#8217;t be released without the board&#8217;s consent.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Note that all Virginia Parole Board information provided to OSIG to conduct this administrative Fraud, Waste and Abuse Hotline investigation is exempt from FOIA under Code of Virginia §§ <a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title2.2/chapter37/section2.2-3703/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title2.2/chapter37/section2.2-3703/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1602786792487000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH3fVH6HFFsq8GQ2fOycMFETbHo-Q" target="_blank">2.2-3703(A)(1)</a> and <a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title2.2/chapter37/section2.2-3705.3/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title2.2/chapter37/section2.2-3705.3/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1602786792487000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFaKI38OGVyC2j_vGcJkc15B8vSYw" target="_blank">2.2-3705.3(7)</a>. The Virginia Parole Board maintains its FOIA exclusions and has not waived its FOIA protections,&#8221; Westfall wrote in an email to me last week.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In effect, the OSIG is (at least in part) invoking an exemption it itself does not enjoy on behalf of another agency. It is also muddying the waters with another code section that exempts &#8220;investigative notes, correspondence and information furnished in confidence and records otherwise exempted by this chapter or any Virginia statute, provided to or produced by or for &#8230;  the Office of the State Inspector General with respect to an investigation initiated through the Fraud, Waste and Abuse Hotline.&#8221;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The same section, however, says &#8220;Information contained in completed investigations shall be disclosed in a form that does not reveal the identity of the complainants or persons supplying information to investigators. Unless disclosure is excluded by this subdivision, the information disclosed shall include the agency involved, the identity of the person who is the subject of the complaint, the nature of the complaint and the actions taken to resolve the complaint.&#8221;</p>
<p>https://twitter.com/opengovva/status/1313807878298505217?s=20</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see those redactions being supported by the exemption,&#8221; Megan Rhyne, executive director of the Virginia Coalition for Open Government and an occasional Mercury guest columnist, said in an interview.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what Alan Gernhardt, executive director of the Virginia Freedom of Information Advisory Council, told me:</p>
<p>&#8220;Speaking generally, many exemptions in FOIA are limited both as to the type of record covered and the public body that may invoke the exemption. And when that is the case, due to the narrow construction policy, only the public body identified in the exemption may use such a limited exemption,&#8221; Gernhardt wrote in an email. &#8220;Similarly, while the Parole Board itself is largely exempt from FOIA, OSIG is subject to FOIA and records OSIG prepares, owns, or possesses in the transaction of public business would be public records by definition. Whether such records must be disclosed would depend on their contents and whether any exemptions or prohibitions apply, just as with any other public records.&#8221;</p>
<p>I asked both Moran and a spokeswoman for Gov. Ralph Northam what code section he was referring to in saying it was forbidden to release the information. I didn&#8217;t get an answer. However, since he invoked the FOIA law in his remarks, I inquired whether there was anything in the exemptions cited by the OSIG that prohibited the release of the information. Both Rhyne and Gernhardt, FOIA experts both, said no.</p>
<p>&#8220;If they’re claiming it is prohibited somewhere that would be outside of FOIA,&#8221; Gernhardt said.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re inclined to take a charitable view, Moran could be making a mistake I&#8217;ve seen over and over in my career. Sometimes public officials equate an exemption, a provision against mandatory disclosure, with a prohibition.  But, then again, one of the sections of the FOIA law OSIG cited starts with this: &#8220;The following information contained in a public record is excluded from the mandatory disclosure provisions of this chapter but may be disclosed by the custodian in his discretion, except where such disclosure is prohibited by law.&#8221;</p>
<p>Long story short, Moran or Westfall could disclose the report, unless there&#8217;s a law somewhere (which they haven&#8217;t cited) that says they can&#8217;t.</p>
<p>As far as OSIG&#8217;s redactions, we don&#8217;t know whether they&#8217;re lawful because we don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s been redacted.</p>
<p>Like with other FOIA disputes, the only way to way to find out is to file suit and go to court, like a Northern Virginia man did when he got a stiff arm by Speaker of the House Eileen Filler-Corn, D-Fairfax, as he sought documents on her decision to pull statues and busts of Confederates <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/confederate-memorials-quietly-removed-from-virginia-capitol-overnight/2020/07/24/8d2a0dee-cced-11ea-bc6a-6841b28d9093_story.html" target="_blank">in the dead of night</a> from the Capitol.</p>
<p>A judge last week slapped the speaker with a $500 civil penalty and roughly $2,000 in attorney&#8217;s fees. Her offense? When asked for records related to the hiring of the company that moved the artifacts and the cost, among other documents, the speaker&#8217;s office replied that they did not exist.</p>
<p>&#8220;After she said the requested documents did not exist, I said, &#8216;That&#8217;s impossible, let me file the FOIA request with the House clerk and a FOIA request with the Department of General Services,&#8217; and eventually I got the truth, but not from her,&#8221; <a href="https://www.wtvr.com/news/local-news/judge-fines-virginia-house-speaker-eileen-filler-corn-foia-violation" target="_blank">David Webster told WTVR</a>.</p>

(Pool photo by Bob Brown/ Richmond Times-Dispatch)</p></figure>
<p>A spokesman for Filler-Corn seemed to imply that the fact that she was removing Confederate iconography should give her a pass on the FOIA transgression.</p>
<p>&#8220;When the speaker made the decision to remove the statues and artifacts honoring the Confederacy from the Capitol, it was understood that it would upset and agitate some people in Virginia and throughout the country,&#8221; Kevin O’Holleran told WTVR. &#8220;First, the plaintiff has received all the documents he requested from the House Clerk&#8217;s Office. The office complied and responded to the plaintiff&#8217;s request in this matter as was believed to be required. The Clerk’s office provided these documents to members of the General Assembly, the media and any individuals who have asked. We understand that those who take action to make the commonwealth more equitable will continue to receive these types of requests, but in no way will it inhibit any work we are doing on behalf of the people of the commonwealth.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what Richmond General District Court Judge Tracy Thorne-Begland, who imposed the fines, <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/FOIA_VIOLATION.pdf" target="_blank">had to say</a>: &#8220;It just strains credulity here to conclude that the speaker was unaware of the existence of these records and unaware of at least a starting point as to where they were. I would agree that she has no duty to make an expansive recommendation, but when she has directed an action that was complied with by her clerk that specifically references the hiring of a company, I think it&#8217;s unreasonable to conclude that she was unaware of the existence of a contract and I think it&#8217;s unreasonable to conclude that she should not have made a bare-bones effort to locate the government agency that had these documents.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rhyne said the penalty imposed on Filler-Corn was a rare FOIA-related punishment for a Virginia public official.</p>
<p>&#8220;The penalties do require a finding that the violation was done willfully and knowingly. The inclination of judges has been to assume that their fellow public servants are just making honest mistakes,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>And, like the cases illustrated above, FOIA fights often have a partisan dimension.</p>
<p>&#8220;FOIA tends to be supported by whoever&#8217;s ox is not being gored,&#8221; Rhyne said. &#8220;It&#8217;s the party in power in that&#8217;s usually more resistant to FOIA than the party&#8217;s that not in power. &#8230; When people use it as a sword, the reaction is &#8216;Oh it&#8217;s not valid because it&#8217;s politically motivated.'&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course, that shouldn&#8217;t be the case. FOIA should apply equally no matter who the requester is, no matter why they want the records. But with the law shot through with exemptions and loopholes and &#8220;see you in court&#8221; as the only recourse for the jilted, it&#8217;s probably an inevitable eventuality.</p>
<p>While you could choose to see the Filler-Corn example as a case of the system working as it should, it still took attorneys, a judge and weeks of delay to work through that system.</p>
<p>Creating a quick-acting arbiter, either by empowering a &#8220;FOIA ombudsman&#8221; in the Office of the Attorney General as Del. Danica Roem, D-Prince William, <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+sum+HB2507" target="_blank">has (so far unsuccessfully) proposed</a> or by giving our existing FOIA Advisory Council more resources and teeth to issue binding rulings, as Rhyne favors, would go a long way towards deterring the types of stonewalling that&#8217;s all too common in the commonwealth.</p>

Justice Ginsburg spoke to over 300 attendees about the Supreme Court's previous term. (Photo by Tom Brenner/Getty Images)</p><p>U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the longest-serving member of the court&#8217;s liberal minority, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/18/us/ruth-bader-ginsburg-dead.html" target="_blank">died Friday night</a> after a struggle with pancreatic cancer, touching off both tributes and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/09/19/ruth-bader-ginsburg-death/" target="_blank">a war of words</a> about filling her seat in a fraught election year.</p>
<p>Virginia Sens. Tim Kaine and Mark Warner, both Democrats, called her a &#8220;giant.&#8221;</p>
<p>Warner said history would remember her as a &#8220;trailblazer and a voice for liberty and equality.&#8221;</p>
<p>https://twitter.com/MarkWarner/status/1307115344012738560?s=20</p>
<p>Kaine, in a statement, said she left behind a &#8220;legal system far fairer than the one she found as one of only nine women in her first-year Harvard Law class.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kaine added: &#8220;As a litigator, she rid our country of statutes that discriminated against women who were breadwinners and men who were child-rearers. As a justice, her majority opinions opened Virginia&#8217;s last all-male public school to women and freed people with disabilities from the isolating confines of institutions. Just as famously, she was uncompromising when the court erred on issues of equality and fundamental rights, penning dissents that sharply defended the Voting Rights Act and women’s access to reproductive health care, all while reminding us ‘you can disagree without being disagreeable.'&#8221;</p>
<p>Citing the &#8220;Scalia precedent&#8221; set by Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, Kaine urged the Senate to &#8220;wait until after the next inauguration before considering a nominee&#8221; for the seat. McConnell famously <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/18/politics/merrick-garland-senate-republicans-timeline/index.html" target="_blank">refused to allow a vote</a> on a nominee by Democratic President Barack Obama to fill the seat of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in February 2016, also an election year.</p>
<p>Ginsburg&#8217;s own wish, from her death bed, was that she not be replaced until there&#8217;s a &#8220;new president,&#8221; <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/09/18/100306972/justice-ruth-bader-ginsburg-champion-of-gender-equality-dies-at-87?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;amp;utm_medium=twitter" target="_blank">according to an NPR report</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;He will do everything he can to ensure that this Supreme Court seat is not filled until then,&#8221; a statement from Kaine&#8217;s office says.</p>
<p>However, McConnell said President Donald Trump&#8217;s nominee &#8220;will receive a vote on the floor of the United States Senate,&#8221; which is controlled by Republicans.</p>

(Sarah Vogelsong/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>For a while now, but especially in the past few weeks, I&#8217;ve been thinking about &#8220;The North Wind and the Sun.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you know your Aesop, you&#8217;ve read <a href="http://read.gov/aesop/143.html" target="_blank">the fable</a>. The Sun and the North Wind engage in a contest to see who can get a traveler to remove his cloak. The Wind goes first, blowing with all his considerable fury, but succeeding only in getting the man to wrap the garment tighter about himself. Then comes the Sun&#8217;s turn. He gently turns up the lumens and in short order the man&#8217;s cloak is off.</p>
<p>Obviously, it&#8217;s a parable about persuasion, and the idea that virulent argument and force only push opponents deeper into their entrenched positions.</p>
<p>From the armed men <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/08/25/ammon-bundy-idaho/" target="_blank">storming the halls of the Idaho Capitol</a> to the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/blm-dc-protesters-berate-diners-demand-they-raise-their-fists-in-viral-videos" target="_blank">shrill screaming</a> at sidewalk diners in Washington, D.C. and <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2020/09/07/Pittsburgh-protest-police-investigate-video-restaurant-clash-diners-Mercato-Penn-Avenue-Downtown/stories/202009070059?fbclid=IwAR2XkBZm-xu8JgxtePeyXjxBEkYpaaXz6_J4LxYdAR-6WdI8JPwNRmuGnCE" target="_blank">Pittsburgh,</a> and the bloodstained, burned out streets of Kenosha and Portland, the United States&#8217; as a governmental enterprise of the people, by the people and for the people and the concept of &#8220;E Pluribus Unum&#8221; has never looked more precarious in my four decades on the planet.</p>
<p>It seemed inevitable that confrontations between the people tearing up liberal cities in the name of fighting fascism and those playing paramilitary G.I. JOE — both of whom&#8217;s growing public presence during the Trump years has been derided and minimized as &#8220;<a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/portland-braces-for-another-round-of-proud-boys-antifa-fights" target="_blank">LARPing</a>&#8221; by too many — would eventually escalate from fistic flailing to major bloodshed.

<p>Violent delights have violent ends. Violence begets violence. Blood for blood. An eye for an eye leaves the whole world blind.</p>
<p>Pick your aphorism. But the largely silent majority who abhor the idea of civil discord leaving bodies on American streets need to speak out against what appears to be <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/i-am-not-sad-that-a-fing-fascist-died-tonight-overheard-at-antifa-gathering-in-portland-after-patriot-prayer-backer-is-shot-to-death" target="_blank">growing acceptance</a> on left and right of violent confrontation as an acceptable means to an end. Too often, those who egg it on and media who give<a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2020/08/27/906642178/one-authors-argument-in-defense-of-looting" target="_blank"> credence to dangerous nonsense</a> seem to have no appreciation or direct experience of the damage <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/09/11/medic-recalls-being-shot-arm-kyle-rittenhouse-kenosha-protest/3466920001/" target="_blank">bullets</a>, <a href="https://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/2020/06/01/rochester-ny-looting-mom-of-woman-attacked-in-viral-video-during-unrest-speaks-out/5300655002/" target="_blank">blunt objects</a>, punches and kicks from<a href="https://www.star-telegram.com/news/local/article243133236.html" target="_blank"> mob beatings</a> can inflict on human bodies. It often <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/08/26/elderly-man-defending-store-during-kenosha-riots-has-jaw-broken/?utm_medium=SocialFlow&amp;utm_campaign=SocialFlow&amp;utm_source=NYPTwitter" target="_blank">spills out of control</a>. There are almost always unintended consequences and collateral damage. And it often provokes a violent reaction.</p>
<p>It has been fashionable in the wake of the protests to selectively quote the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. saying &#8220;a riot is the language of the unheard.&#8221;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_K0BWXjJv5s" target="_blank"> But in the same 1966 Mike Wallace interview</a>, King called riots &#8220;self defeating and socially destructive.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The ultimate weakness of violence is that it is a descending spiral, begetting the very thing it seeks to destroy. Instead of diminishing evil, it multiplies it. Through violence you murder the hater, but you do not murder hate,&#8221;<a href="https://centeronconscience.org/martin-luther-king-jr/#:~:text=It%20destroys%20community%20and%20makes,lie%2C%20nor%20establish%20the%20truth." target="_blank"> he also famously wrote</a>. &#8220;Returning violence for violence multiplies violence, adding deeper darkness to a night already devoid of stars. Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.&#8221;</p>
<p>From the pathological inability of the president to salve the nation&#8217;s deep racial wounds to some Democrats&#8217; reluctance to condemn rioting and violence for what it is until it appeared to pose a political threat, many of our leaders from the federal to the local level have not covered themselves in glory during our hellish summer of unrest.</p>
<p>Left, right and center, we should all hope the sun comes out soon.</p>
<p>The wind is howling.</p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>In March, the nation watched in horror as refrigerated trucks appeared outside hospitals in New York City to handle the overflow of bodies of people who died from COVID-19.</p>
<p>In July, more than four months after the pandemic was declared,<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jemimamcevoy/2020/07/17/repeating-nys-nightmare-texas-and-arizona-request-refrigerated-trucks-for-filling-morgues/#76c2e51c2214" target="_blank"> Texas and Arizona were among states</a> requesting the morgue trucks and it was hard to see the development, coming as <a href="https://www.wtok.com/2020/07/22/adph-alabama-sets-daily-record-for-covid-19-deaths-as-more-than-70k-test-positive-and-nearly-30k-recover/" target="_blank">southern</a> and western states saw a surge in cases, as anything except <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/09/coronavirus-american-failure/614191/" target="_blank">an utter national failure</a>.</p>
<p>Early in the pandemic, encouraged by the response to social distancing requests by governors, I allowed myself to think that we might get a handle on the virus in spite of the absence of any meaningful national leadership. It wouldn&#8217;t magically disappear, as the president <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-still-believes-coronavirus-will-just-disappear-as-cases-rise-2020-7" target="_blank">has suggested</a>, but with ubiquitous, rapid testing, plentiful protective equipment and social distancing rules, I reasoned, we could maybe get to a new normal that brought back a semblance of our former lives.</p>
<p>Instead, cases are surging, people are still arguing about masks, tests are still hard to come by and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/long-delays-in-getting-test-results-hobble-coronavirus-response/2020/07/12/d32f7fa8-c1fe-11ea-b4f6-cb39cd8940fb_story.html" target="_blank">it&#8217;s taking forever</a> to get results. A Mercury reporter&#8217;s result, from a precautionary test taken after Richmond protest coverage, took 12 days before it came back negative. A family member&#8217;s recent test took more than two weeks to deliver the result, also negative, but not of much utility at that point.</p>
<p>While many of our fellow Virginians and Americans haven&#8217;t been very responsible, particularly <a href="https://www.vpap.org/visuals/visual/twenty-somethings-and-covid/" target="_blank">some younger people</a>, according to Gov. Ralph Northam&#8217;s administration, millions of other people across the country and here have held up their end of the bargain: wearing masks, staying home, avoiding large gatherings, etc. The point was to give the nation time to drastically ratchet up its testing capacity and keep hospitals from being overwhelmed by a tidal wave of patients.</p>
<p>How then, did it come to pass that we&#8217;re proceeding with Phase III at a time when getting COVID-19 test results back <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/covid-test-results-delays-dc-virginia-maryland/2020/07/17/0f773006-c546-11ea-8ffe-372be8d82298_story.html" target="_blank">can take two weeks or more</a>, Northam&#8217;s administration is still being confoundingly tight-lipped about outbreak information and knuckle-draggers are still protesting mask orders and business restrictions as tyranny?</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re in a really bad place right now,&#8221; said Dr. William Petri, chief of the Division of Infectious Diseases and International Health at UVA, in an interview last month.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that other countries have shown the way forward, including massive testing and contact tracing, the U.S. virus response is governed by a patchwork of state and local policies — many governors have resisted imposing mask orders, for example — and hamstrung by flabbergasting supply bottlenecks in testing. And while Virginia has fared better than some other states (&#8220;Having a physician as a governor maybe worked to our advantage,&#8221; Petri said), the Virginia Department of Health still thinks the public isn&#8217;t generally entitled to know where, with any specificity, outbreaks are occurring.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/content/uploads/sites/182/2020/07/TelePress-Briefing-7-29-20.pdf" target="_blank">In a call with reporters</a> a day after the Northam administration announced new restrictions in Hampton Roads following a surge in cases the state linked to bars and restaurants, Dr. Norman Oliver, the state health commissioner, couldn&#8217;t say how many cases stemmed from those venues. Asked if the state or local health districts would put out information on specific outbreaks, such as when they&#8217;re tied to restaurants and bars, he demurred.</p>
<p>&#8220;To the second question whether we would release data about a large superspreader event for the lack of a better word, I&#8217;ll reserve judgment on that,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I think there may be a situation — there could be — I could envision situations we might be concerned about superspreader kind of events and in the interest of public health, we would want to advise people about that to help them protect themselves from the community by avoiding such events. But offhand, I don&#8217;t know that that&#8217;s something that would automatically be done with any large event and it&#8217;s also hard to tell sometimes like with the events I was just talking about.&#8221;</p>
<p>Contrast that response with health officials in Ingham County, Michigan, who have put out lots of communications on an outbreak at an <a href="http://hd.ingham.org/About/ArticlesPublications/tabid/3378/ctl/ArticleView/mid/4286/articleId/9051/Ingham-County-reduces-restaurant-capacity-as-outbreak-linked-to-local-bar-grows.aspx" target="_blank">East Lansing bar</a> that was responsible for at least <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/30/us/michigan-bar-positive-coronavirus/index.html" target="_blank">152 cases</a>. The county also notified the public about an outbreak at <a href="http://hd.ingham.org/About/ArticlesPublications/tabid/3378/ctl/ArticleView/mid/4286/articleId/9052/Coronavirus-cases-linked-to-Lansing-veterinary-clinic-Many-are-likely-exposed.aspx" target="_blank">a veterinary clinic.</a></p>
<p>In Virginia, when the Free Lance-Star tried to get more details about a surge in cases in Westmoreland County,<a href="https://fredericksburg.com/news/local/westmoreland-virus-cases-jump-almost-70-since-july-1/article_52b67d3a-2441-5e0a-8fb7-87fdb366c518.html" target="_blank"> it was met with this comically useless answer</a> from the local health director: &#8220;Dr. Richard Williams, director of the Three Rivers Health District, wouldn’t say where the outbreaks occurred, except that they’re in the 10-county area that includes the Northern Neck and Middle Peninsula.&#8221;</p>
<p>Virginia, including in its <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/07/09/virginia-wont-release-data-on-covid-19-outbreaks-at-chicken-plants-despite-nursing-home-reversal/" target="_blank">refusal to release information on poultry plant outbreaks</a>, has too often decided that COVID-19 information should only be doled out on a need-to-know basis.</p>
<p>I was on that same press call with Oliver, and I pressed him on why the state wouldn&#8217;t want to be more proactive in telling Virginians where and how people are contracting the virus here.</p>
<p>&#8220;The reluctance is because the — it&#8217;s not a particular bar that&#8217;s the problem,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s any kind of social gathering right? So the fact that you know Bar X is a bar where there were a number of cases doesn&#8217;t mean that Bar Y is one that you can go to and not be exposed to COVID-19. The general rule should be if you&#8217;re in a place with other people, you should be wearing a mask and &#8230; try to maintain physical and social distance. And that&#8217;s true whether or not there&#8217;s been a case there or there&#8217;s never been a case there. You could be the first case.&#8221;</p>
<p>While I can understand the doctor&#8217;s logic, I would argue that knowing that people got COVID-19 at Bar X might convince others to stay away from Bar Y. (And it bears mentioning that the health department, has in fact, decided that particular bars are a problem, because <a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/business/consumer/vp-bz-coronavirus-restaurant-health-20200721-ur2l3zrt75fm5i2glnxlc2yfvu-story.html" target="_blank">they&#8217;ve moved to shut down some</a> for not following COVID rules.)</p>
<p>I would also contend that basic human psychology too often means a threat doesn&#8217;t move from the abstract to the concrete until it menaces someone or something we&#8217;re familiar with. Witness all the social media testimonials of people <a href="https://www.dailyherald.com/news/20200731/this-disease-is-not-a-joke-lake-zurich-man-thought-covid-19-was-a-hoax-then-needed-new-lungs" target="_blank">who proclaimed the virus &#8220;no joke&#8221;</a> or some <a href="https://khn.org/news/california-gop-consultant-rues-big-mistake-that-led-to-familys-covid-infections/" target="_blank">variation thereof</a> after they or someone else they know contracted COVID-19 (Google &#8220;COVID&#8221; and &#8220;no joke&#8221; and you will find a frightening number of stories with essentially the same format and even similar quotes).</p>
<p>The owners of that Michigan bar, by the way, called the outbreak a <a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/michigan/2020/07/23/harpers-bar-owner-covid-19-outbreak-rude-awakening/5494997002/" target="_blank">&#8220;rude awakening&#8221;</a> for them and other bars and restaurants as they tried to prevent the state from revoking its license.</p>
<p>Last month, I took my first Lyft ride since the pandemic began, getting a ride to the mechanic to pick up my car. The driver, an older woman, and I both wore masks. She seemed amused when I asked if it was OK to roll down the window. Even though it was hot, I said, it was probably better to have fresh air, just in case. I asked if she was worried about the virus, given the close proximity to strangers that came with her job.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know anybody who has it.&#8221;</p>
<p>When and if we all know someone who has it, we&#8217;ll be in a pretty dire spot from a public health perspective, of course, even worse than the <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/09/coronavirus-american-failure/614191/" target="_blank">unenviable position we find ourselves in here in the U.S</a>. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s important for the Virginia Department of Health and local health districts to be more transparent about where outbreaks are happening.</p>
<p>Scrolling through the news releases from local health districts on the VDH website I came across <a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/news/2020-regional-news-releases/lord-fairfax-health-district-warns-residents-of-rabies-risk/" target="_blank">one</a> from the Lord Fairfax Health District that illustrates just how opaque health officials have been on where COVID-19 is spreading here.</p>
<blockquote class="td_quote_box td_box_center"><p>On July 25, 2020, a raccoon involved in an altercation with several barn cats was made available to the health department. The event occurred in a rural area off of White Hall Road in Frederick County. The raccoon tested positive for rabies, according to the Lord Fairfax Health District.</p>
<p>“This raccoon no longer poses a threat,” said Lord Fairfax Health District Director Dr. Colin Greene, “however, the event offers a reminder that any contact with a raccoon, fox, skunk or bat that could result in exposure to the animal’s saliva should be considered a potential rabies exposure. This applies to humans and domestic animals, and anyone exposed should receive an immediate medical evaluation.”</p></blockquote>
<p>When we know more specifics about a clash between a rabid raccoon and barn cats in Frederick County than Virginia outbreaks of a pandemic virus that&#8217;s taken hundreds of thousands of lives globally, sickened millions and massively disrupted the world&#8217;s economy, that&#8217;s a big problem.</p>

<p>The news releases, statements and tweets were coming in hot and heavy Sunday afternoon after Dominion Energy and its partner, Duke Energy, <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/07/05/dominion-cancels-atlantic-coast-pipeline-announces-sale-of-natural-gas-transmission-and-storage-assets/" target="_blank">announced</a> that the 600-mile Atlantic Coast Pipeline was toast, undone by a string of successful legal challenges that stripped it of permits, spiraling costs from years of delays and, as result of those lags, <a href="https://ieefa.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Atlantic-Coast-Pipeline_January-2019.pdf" target="_blank">scarce evidence</a> that anyone actually needed the gas the project was supposed to deliver.</p>

<p>This is, of course, <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/10/25/the-con-at-the-heart-of-the-atlantic-coast-pipeline/" target="_blank">as I&#8217;ve written before </a>and as all the <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/04/20/the-atlantic-coast-pipeline-is-looking-like-a-riskier-investment-every-day/" target="_blank">available evidence</a> suggests, pretty much the exact opposite of what would have happened for those consumers in North Carolina and Virginia if this pipeline had actually been built. The project always appears to have been really about saddling captive ratepayers with gas capacity they didn&#8217;t need to benefit utility shareholders.</p>
<p>However, when I first started covering the pipeline project four years ago, more or less by newsroom accident at the Richmond Times-Dispatch, I was actually skeptical of many of the arguments against the project.</p>
<p>I knew next to nothing about the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, utility regulation or the <a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/high-returns-on-new-pipelines-spur-unnecessary-capacity-report-argues/505609/" target="_blank">handsome rate of return</a> such pipeline projects were guaranteed to deliver to investors. I assumed it would be difficult for a consortium of energy companies to use the extraordinary power of eminent domain to grab land from people absent a compelling public need argument.</p>
<p>Or, as I may have actually said at one point back then: &#8220;They wouldn&#8217;t be building a pipeline if no one actually needed the gas, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>I had a lot to learn.</p>
<p>I had yet to delve into Dominion&#8217;s arguments about <a href="https://apnews.com/dfaaf172a89449b9a2b9c3be402f493f" target="_blank">&#8220;supply diversity&#8221; and polar vortexes</a>. I had yet to talk to scientists like David Sligh and Rick Webb and walk the steep, karst terrain and mountain streams the pipeline contended it could cross <a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/virginia/pipeline-opponents-northam-is-going-to-have-to-answer-for-what-this-looks-like/article_dd3d0c7a-11c1-5a40-bcb8-95454bff3c5e.html" target="_blank">without ruining them or risking rupture</a>.</p>
<p>I had yet to meet people like Pastor Paul Wilson and John and Ruby Laury, who didn&#8217;t want to live with the massive compressor station Dominion planed to erect in the middle of their historic, bucolic and rural community of Union Hill, where the project became <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/08/02/in-buckinghams-union-hill-a-center-of-resistance-for-the-atlantic-coast-pipeline-dominion-brings-in-a-ringer/" target="_blank">divisive </a> as the influential energy giant dangled millions of dollars in<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/how-money-stokes-divide-historic-black-community-virginia-pipeline-battle-n943236" target="_blank"> community enhancements</a> in exchange for tacit support.</p>
<p>I had yet to talk to people like Bill Limpert, whose <a href="https://www.newsleader.com/story/opinion/columnists/2018/10/17/atlantic-coast-pipeline-set-destroy-bath-county-old-growth-forest/1669261002/" target="_blank">ancient trees</a> in the retirement home he and his wife had built in Bath County would have been torn down and who, like Irene Leech in Buckingham County, worried about living in the<a href="https://www.fredericksburg.com/business/dominion-shareholders-approve-name-change-but-face-pressure-on-environmental/article_d424c751-8588-53df-85df-7299a082d427.html" target="_blank"> &#8220;blast zone&#8221;</a> of infrastructure that can fail catastrophically.</p>
<p>I had yet to watch Dominion, with the assistance of the Northam administration, bend the state&#8217;s <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/12/05/northams-struggle-to-explain-air-board-move-suggests-its-exactly-what-it-appears-to-be/" target="_blank">air</a> and water boards, regulatory bodies with authority over the pipeline, to its will.</p>
<p>Over the past four years, I&#8217;ve spent many hours talking to lots of people and written thousands of words about the pipeline. No one, in my opinion, distilled the grift at the core of the project as well as Theresa “Red” Terry, known for her weeks-long tree-sit on her own land to protest the separate Mountain Valley Pipeline.</p>
<p>“Dominion is buying their own gas so they can have permission to rape our property,” she told the State Water Control Board. “I would love to look at anyone else and say ‘I would love to make money. I’m taking it from you.'&#8221;</p>
<p>Not unlike the great and powerful Oz, when the curtain surrounding the project was finally pulled away, there wasn&#8217;t much to see behind it except a hustle.</p>

Lee Monument for a peaceful rally in Richmond, Va., June 2, 2020. Parker Michels-Boyce for the Virginia Mercury</p><p>At the time, I laughed.</p>
<p>Nearly 13 years later, amid the protests convulsing American cities over police brutality and racism, it doesn&#8217;t seem like a joke.</p>
<p>I was writing profiles of the candidates vying to replace a longtime south Louisiana sheriff and Godfrey &#8220;Doc&#8221; Buquet, a retired chief of detectives who looked more than a little like a scary Santa Claus, was running an underfinanced longshot campaign for his old boss&#8217; job.</p>
<p>Part of his message that set him apart in a crowded field of candidates pushing for crackdowns on drug crime was a call for kinder, gentler hearts-and-minds community policing, though he didn&#8217;t use that terminology.</p>
<p>“We’re not here to make enemies of the citizens of our parish,” he told me. “We need to have some understanding and compassion.”</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s something else he said, left on the cutting room floor for <a href="https://www.houmatoday.com/article/DA/20071012/news/608096853/HC" target="_blank">that article</a>, that&#8217;s stuck with me all these years.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was in a gang,&#8221; Doc said he told young offenders as something like an ice-breaker during volunteer work in his spare time. &#8220;It&#8217;s called the police.&#8221;</p>
<p>During my time at newspapers, I covered police departments in four states, from agencies like the Cranford Township Police in suburban New Jersey to the 900-officer Pittsburgh Police Bureau, which saw a <a href="https://www.wtae.com/article/ex-pittsburgh-police-chief-nate-harper-sentenced-to-federal-prison/7465096" target="_blank">chief sent to federal prison</a> not long after I arrived in the city. I have known great people who worked at all of them.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m no policing expert. But, from ridealongs with narcotics agents and sitting down with detectives to talk <a href="https://www.houmatoday.com/article/DA/20080113/News/608099994/HC" target="_blank">cold cases </a>to years of covering trials, car crashes, homicides and other crime, I&#8217;ve spent a lot of time around cops. I&#8217;ve seen and reported on the good, the bad and the ugly — everything from <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2015/06/03/Pittsburgh-has-paid-5-million-since-2010-for-suits-against-police/stories/201506030092" target="_blank">excessive force lawsuits</a> and <a href="https://www.houmatoday.com/news/20070926/ex-deputy-gets-10-years-for-sex-with-teen" target="_blank">egregious cases</a> of police misconduct to <a href="https://www.houmatoday.com/news/20080724/officer-shoots-suspect-in-crozier-drug-raid" target="_blank">cops shooting people</a>, cops <a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/local/suspect-in-special-agents-slaying-who-had-a-mosby-court-address-was-on-housing-authoritys/article_beff41e3-65ba-55ab-b483-3a7ef44f6e0c.html" target="_blank">being shot, </a>controversial deaths of <a href="https://www.houmatoday.com/article/DA/20111223/News/608099928/HC" target="_blank">suspects in custody</a> and heartwarming <a href="https://www.houmatoday.com/article/DA/20070908/News/608095584/HC" target="_blank">acts of kindness.</a></p>
<p>There were common threads, though, that too often emerged, particularly in Pittsburgh, where even the <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2019/07/09/pittsburgh-police-kopy-s-brawl-pagans-undercover-detectives-keep-jobs-honick-burgunder/stories/201907090109" target="_blank">worst cops</a> were shielded by collective bargaining agreements and an <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2019/08/14/pittsburgh-police-kramer-road-rage-arbitration-appeal/stories/201908140085" target="_blank">arbitration system</a> that made it tough to kick them off the force. (That should be something of a cautionary tale for Virginia localities now that the General Assembly has <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/virginia-lawmakers-open-door-to-collective-bargaining-with-public-employees-but-only-at-local-level/" target="_blank">cracked open the door</a> for collective bargaining with county and city employees.)</p>
<p>Closing ranks around people who shouldn&#8217;t be wearing a badge. Defending the indefensible. Embellishing or manufacturing threats to justify beatings, shootings, arrests or harassment. And even when they <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2014/12/09/Pittsburgh-to-settle-lawsuit-with-teacher-accosted-by-police-for-52-000/stories/201412090203" target="_blank">were caught red-handed</a>, there were often few, if any, repercussions. Of course, the consequences of this version of a Mafia omertà fell hardest on the most heavily policed and brutalized black communities.</p>
<p>Bad apples? A poison tree? That&#8217;s really a distinction without a difference at this point.</p>
<p>Some police precincts and headquarters across the country were under siege (<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/29/minneapolis-police-protest-george-floyd-288361" target="_blank">even torched</a>) during the protests and riots that broke out following George Floyd&#8217;s death under the knee of a Minneapolis cop. Demonstrators <a href="https://www.policemag.com/557489/numerous-police-officers-injured-in-nationwide-riots" target="_blank">openly attacked police</a> in the streets. Calls to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/06/07/defund-police-heres-what-that-really-means/" target="_blank">defund </a>or even abolish police departments are gaining steam, including in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/30/opinion/george-floyd-police-funding.html" target="_blank">mainstream publications</a>. Over the weekend, nine members of Minneapolis&#8217; City Council <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/minneapolis-city-council-intent-disband-police-department/" target="_blank">vowed to dismantle</a> the city&#8217;s police department.</p>
<p>Already, an uneasy national debate is unfolding about what &#8220;defunding&#8221; really means, with <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/06/08/defund-police-democrats-307766" target="_blank">Democrats backing away</a> from the most extreme interpretations that have been on display on protesters&#8217; signs across the country and <a href="https://virginia.gop/democrats-promise-chaos/" target="_blank">Republicans sensing a political opportunity</a> even as they continue to cover for a president seemingly <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/06/09/republicans-deflect-questions-after-trump-tweet-75-year-old-protester-309075" target="_blank">intent</a> on making our national unrest worse at every turn.</p>
<p>Fixing the racial inequities in our criminal justice system demands a national response, given the patchwork nature of police standards and regulation in the United States, though that seems unlikely at the moment given our deeply polarized national government. We should all be able to agree that having <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/protests-spread-over-police-shootings-police-promised-reforms-every-year-they-still-shoot-nearly-1000-people/2020/06/08/5c204f0c-a67c-11ea-b473-04905b1af82b_story.html" target="_blank">1,000 people killed every year</a> by the police, a disproportionate number of them black people, and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/08/us/us-police-floyd-protests-country-comparisons-intl/index.html" target="_blank">orders of magnitude more</a> than other developed countries, is unacceptable, despite some <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/6/2/21276472/police-killing-statistics-african-american" target="_blank">apparent progress</a> in the number of unarmed people slain by officers.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s just common sense that we need to reduce the number of interactions armed agents of the state have with people grappling with mental illness, drug addiction and homelessness by removing those responsibilities from their portfolio. That African-American communities shouldn&#8217;t bear the brunt of efforts to juke stats or <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2015/03/06/us/ferguson-missouri-racism-tickets-fines/index.html" target="_blank">raise revenue</a>. That the power to use force, deadly and otherwise, should be reserved for only the most extreme situations. Here&#8217;s a <a href="https://8cantwait.org/?fbclid=IwAR2ny6O6oEIGpMhmzEJ_y7MOHWh5OzGen00z0d83Otzdn4N8CLOEaWxauvE" target="_blank">good primer</a>.</p>
<p>Many police departments around the country have been giving us <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/06/08/the-whole-world-is-watching-the-brutal-police-response-to-protests/" target="_blank">near daily examples</a> of why they need to be reined in, like when the Richmond Police without warning deployed tear gas on peaceful protesters, falsely claiming it was about officer safety and <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/06/08/richmond-police-keep-quiet-on-discipline-after-officers-attack-demonstrators/" target="_blank">refusing to answer questions</a> about discipline despite profuse apologies from the mayor and police.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/buffalo-police-pushed-old-man-said-he-tripped-because-police-ncna1225881" target="_blank">Shoving elderly people</a> to the ground, <a href="https://www.wtvr.com/news/local-news/police-investigating-after-video-shows-richmond-officer-macing-man-inside-his-home" target="_blank">pepper spraying</a> and arresting people whose only offense is mouthing off and beating and shooting journalists and others in the face <a href="https://www.insider.com/black-lives-matter-protesters-journalists-hurt-disabled-police-rubber-bullets-2020-6" target="_blank">with rubber bullets</a> isn&#8217;t the way to convince the citizenry that business-as-usual is fine.</p>
<p>https://twitter.com/weslyinfinity/status/1267321172309544960?s=20</p>
<p>Community legitimacy is the most important currency for a police department. Too many of them have casually burned through it without fear of consequences. And now we&#8217;re seeing all over the country what happens when it&#8217;s spent.</p>
<p>Understanding and compassion was what George Floyd needed as he was gasping for breath under Derek Chauvin&#8217;s knee.</p>
<p>Understanding and compassion is what we all need as we set to the long, difficult and fraught task of changing policing in America.</p>

(Kate Masters/ Virginia Mercury)</p><p>Protesters in Richmond and Hampton Roads blocked highways and started fires Friday night as unrest that has gripped the country following the <a href="https://minnesotareformer.com/2020/05/29/former-minneapolis-police-officer-derek-chauvin-arrested/" target="_blank">death of George Floyd during his arrest by police in Minnesota</a> spread to Virginia.</p>
<p>In Richmond, at least one car, a Dumpster and a GRTC Pulse bus were set afire. Protests continued in pockets of the city long after the first demonstration had dispersed. By 1 a.m., officers in full riot gear were guarding Richmond police headquarters on W. Grace Street, which protesters had surrounded hours earlier.</p>
<p>Blocks away, officers used pepper spray to move demonstrators off the street near the intersection of Monroe and Broad, where a GRTC Pulse bus had been set on fire. “You want to die, bro?” one officer yelled at a demonstrator as the blaze grew larger. “Back up.” Some of the protesters began to chant “Black lives matter” as the bus — powered by natural gas — went up in a jet of flames.</p>

People all over our country are hurting and angry, and rightly so,&#8221; Northam said. “People are crying out for justice and healing.

Ralph Northam convenes a cabinet meeting to discuss coronavirus response on Monday. (Gov. Ralph Northam's office)</p><p>Last month, as it was becoming apparent that Virginia was lagging other states in testing capacity and struggling to procure enough protective gear for long-term care facilities, first responders and hospitals, Gov. Ralph Northam&#8217;s administration announced it had reached a deal with global consulting firm McKinsey and Company to shore up those aspects of the state&#8217;s response.</p>
<p>“We realized that we need some help to make sure we are doing this in a systematic and effective way,&#8221; Secretary of Public Health Dr. Daniel Carey <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/virginia-contracts-with-mckinsey-to-secure-more-testing-supplies-personal-protective-equipment/" target="_blank">said at the time</a>.</p>
<p>The Mercury&#8217;s Kate Masters later requested a copy of the contract via Virginia&#8217;s Freedom of Information Act and any reports McKinsey had prepared for the state for its more than half a million fee.</p>
<p>What we got back was laughably useless as a result <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/05/08/reopening-virginia-hinges-on-ppe-and-testing-but-state-wont-give-details-on-contract-to-boost-supplies/" target="_blank">of copious redactions</a> (including, bizarrely and illicitly, the name of the McKinsey partner who signed the contract) and the Virginia Department of Emergency Management&#8217;s decision to withhold 120 pages of reports bought and paid for by taxpayers, <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Virginia-Mercury-FOIA-McKinsey-Contract-Response-ltr-1.pdf" target="_blank">citing</a> &#8220;working papers&#8221; and trade secret exemptions.</p>

<p>We asked followup questions seeking more specific answers on the redactions and applicability of the working papers exemption and got this response yesterday:</p>
<p>&#8220;VDEM has reached out to McKinsey with a request that they narrow the scope of the redactions and McKinsey is reviewing the documents. Once we hear back from them, I&#8217;ll be able to answer your questions,&#8221; VDEM staffer Brookie Crawford wrote Thursday. Why VDEM appears to have outsourced its responsibilities under FOIA to a private company remains a mystery.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s no secret that the working papers exemption in particular and its ever broader interpretation have become the bane of the Virginia press, good government groups and anyone else seeking insight into how decisions that affect all of us are made.</p>

<p>Taking advantage of a precedent <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/06/24/AR2009062403522.html" target="_blank">set by former Gov. Tim Kaine</a>, Northam&#8217;s then-spokeswoman <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/11/28/working-papers-exemption-claimed-to-shield-governors-calendar-amid-pipeline-permit-uproar/" target="_blank">cited the working papers exemption</a> in denying the release of the governor&#8217;s calendar after Dominion Energy CEO Tom Farrell was spotted leaving the governor&#8217;s office in 2018 on the heels of Northam&#8217;s decision to pull two members off the State Air Pollution Control Board as it considered a crucial permit for the energy giant&#8217;s Atlantic Coast Pipeline.</p>
<p>Gov. Terry McAuliffe sought to invoke it in 2016 <a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/local/government-politics/foia-council-mcauliffe-s-list-for-felon-voting-order-can/article_328e310b-f333-5270-b55e-3193b1668d24.html" target="_blank">to prevent the release</a> of a list of more than 200,000 people convicted of felonies whose voting rights he had restored. Loudoun&#8217;s then-commonwealth&#8217;s attorney, Jim Plowman, filed a FOIA request, then a lawsuit, finally getting the list as part of a settlement more than a year later, even though the state&#8217;s FOIA Council, in a nonbinding opinion, had long before said the working papers claim was erroneous.</p>
<p>“They’re giving me everything I asked for a year ago. They just dragged it out,” <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/mcauliffe-to-turn-over-list-of-restored-felons-to-settle-suit-from-state-prosecutor/2017/06/15/7d73635a-51e4-11e7-b064-828ba60fbb98_story.html" target="_blank">Plowman told The Washington Post</a>. &#8220;It seems a bit unreasonable that you have to actually file a lawsuit to get something that people should have everyday public access to.”</p>
<p>But under Virginia&#8217;s FOIA law, pretty much the only way to find out whether the denial, redaction or withholding of information was valid is to sue.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a whole lot of states have a working papers exemption, so in that, Virginia is near-unique and the exemption itself would seem to be the problem,&#8221; said Megan Rhyne, executive director of the Virginia Coalition for Open Government and an occasional Mercury commentary contributor. But, she noted, most states have some sort of legal privilege to shield some legislative and executive records from disclosure.</p>
<p>What makes Virginia very unique, however, is that &#8220;the exemption is at the disposal of far more people and positions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Consider the sheer number of individuals to which the exemption (which also includes the blanket term &#8220;correspondence&#8221;) could apply:</p>
<blockquote class="td_quote_box td_box_center"><p>Working papers and correspondence of the Office of the Governor; Lieutenant Governor; the Attorney General; the members of the General Assembly, the Division of Legislative Services, or the Clerks of the House of Delegates and the Senate of Virginia; the mayor or chief executive officer of any political subdivision of the Commonwealth; or the president or other chief executive officer of any public institution of higher education in Virginia. &#8230; &#8220;Office of the Governor&#8221; means the Governor; the Governor&#8217;s chief of staff, counsel, director of policy, and Cabinet Secretaries; the Assistant to the Governor for Intergovernmental Affairs; and those individuals to whom the Governor has delegated his authority pursuant to to § 2.2-104.<a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title2.2/chapter37/section2.2-3705.7/" target="_blank"> § 2.2-3705.7.</a></p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;The exemption then gets distorted by the people who claim it on behalf of this already expansive group, and then also by dumping way too much of what that group touches into the working papers/correspondence bucket,&#8221; said Rhyne, who has fought for changes to the law for years and who perhaps summed up the state of affairs best <a href="https://www.suffolknewsherald.com/2015/03/17/end-foias-working-papers-exemption/" target="_blank">in a 2015 op-ed in the Suffolk News Herald</a>: &#8220;We’re talking several hundred people here conducting the public’s business in near-total, sanctioned secrecy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Efforts to rein in the exemption, including after a lengthy study of FOIA between 2014 and 2016, fizzled. But, as part of that review, Rhyne <a href="http://foiacouncil.dls.virginia.gov/subcom_mtgs/2015/WorkingPapersExamples.pdf" target="_blank">prepared a list</a> of several dozen examples of instances in which it was invoked, encompassing everything from a working group assembled by Gov. Bob McDonnell on uranium mining to cost-cutting plans at Christopher Newport University to a report on whether scientists at Eastern Virginia Medical School had broken the state&#8217;s anti-cloning law.</p>
<p>&#8220;We proposed changes that would have removed the correspondence part of the exemption. The proposal never made it into the final draft of the study&#8217;s omnibus bill,&#8221; Rhyne said. &#8220;During that study, we also supported (veteran Virginia government reporter) Dave Ress&#8217; proposal to require production of exempt records after a decision on them has been made, as well as legislative proposals by (former Del.) David Ramadan and (Sen.) Chap Petersen to remove university presidents from the exemption. Neither of these made it into the final draft, either.&#8221;</p>
<p>Shielding huge quantities of records from disclosure isn&#8217;t the only problem. There&#8217;s also the exorbitant costs that some state agencies charge for filling what are routine requests elsewhere.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/05/12/virginias-first-responders-have-been-given-personal-information-on-covid-19-patients-for-weeks/" target="_blank">Monday&#8217;s Mercury story by Kate Masters,</a> which revealed that state health officials have been giving individual COVID-19 patient information to local emergency officials, was also the result of a FOIA request filed with the Virginia Department of Health for a batch of emails. The initial quote for that request was $2,800, based on an estimated 40 hours of staff labor (at $70 an hour by a high-ranking state official) though we were able to talk the department down to a little more than $1,000.</p>
<p>What a bargain!</p>
<p>Implicit in Virginia&#8217;s system is the idea that processing records requests is an annoying extraneous task for which public agencies and government bodies are entitled to charge extra, instead of, as I would argue, a core function that we all already pay them to perform. <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/2019-Open-Government-Guide-1.pdf" target="_blank">In neighboring North Carolina, </a>for example, public bodies may charge a service fee if making copies of records &#8220;involves extensive clerical or supervisory assistance,&#8221; but cannot charge a fee &#8220;to recover fees for time spent examining or removing confidential information from records.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Mercury has also been quoted similar eye-popping figures in requests for communications dealing with other aspects of the state&#8217;s response.  (<a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?181+sum+HB1603" target="_blank">A bill</a> by Del. Danica Roem, D-Manassas, filed in her first session in 2018, that would have corralled some FOIA fees, among other provisions, was left in committee.)</p>
<p>In more mundane times, dust-ups over the FOIA law and provisions that allow public bodies wide latitude to set their own policies on which highly paid person can bill the requester for the privilege of withholding everything possible might seem esoteric.</p>
<p>But with the pandemic still raging, all our lives turned upside down and our state government still struggling to explain its testing lag while it makes decisions on when businesses and schools can open, how outbreaks are being triaged and how protective gear and testing supplies are being procured and distributed, among other aspects of the response, FOIA is the only serious tool available to pierce the veil.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s hardly a wieldy implement.</p>
<p>Consider also the broadside from <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/05/covid-19-tests-combine-virginia/611620/" target="_blank">The Atlantic Thursday</a> about how the Northam administration&#8217;s decision to include antibody testing in its overall testing numbers, first revealed by the <a href="https://www.richmond.com/special-report/coronavirus/virginia-misses-key-marks-on-virus-testing-as-leaders-eye-reopening/article_021e12c6-6d20-5030-9068-4caaeda495f7.html" target="_blank">Richmond Times-Dispatch</a>, amounts to &#8220;juking&#8221; the stats.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">The Atlantic fact checked Northam admin&#39;s claim that other states were also combining results from viral and antibody tests into the same stat. </p>
<p>&quot;This is false.&quot;</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Unfortunately, that imperative for disclosure about what the state is up to is running smack into a law that affords broad discretion for the highest levels of our government to keep the decisions they make under wraps and bill exorbitant fees for other information.</p>
<p>The governor, who has made much of his time as president of the <a href="https://www.vmi.edu/news/headlines/2017-2018/watch-live-as-corps-marches-in-inaugural.php" target="_blank">Honor Court</a> at the Virginia Military Institute, seems content to let some entities in Virginia operate on the honor system during the pandemic, including refusing to require<a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/05/06/legislators-make-bipartisan-call-for-more-data-on-covid-19-outbreaks-at-nursing-homes/" target="_blank"> long term care facilities</a> to disclose COVID-19 outbreaks (<a href="https://www.progress-index.com/news/20200506/northam-silent-on-push-for-nursing-home-data" target="_blank">or even say</a> whether he thinks that&#8217;s a good idea) and <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/04/30/northam-urges-larger-role-for-feds-on-poultry-worker-safety-but-advocates-press-state-to-step-up/" target="_blank">extending the same courtesy</a> to poultry plants where the virus is spreading among some of Virginia&#8217;s most vulnerable workers.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="gQqrdgK6eJ"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2020/05/08/little-information-is-publicly-available-on-the-governors-covid-19-work-groups-businesses-are-especially-concerned/">Scant information is publicly available on the governor&#8217;s COVID-19 work groups.</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Scant information is publicly available on the governor&#8217;s COVID-19 work groups.&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2020/05/08/little-information-is-publicly-available-on-the-governors-covid-19-work-groups-businesses-are-especially-concerned/embed/#?secret=g5L1zr1IzG#?secret=gQqrdgK6eJ" data-secret="gQqrdgK6eJ" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p>Our state government, however, isn&#8217;t supposed to operate on the honor system. We are entitled to reasonable information on what it&#8217;s doing on our behalf and with our money.</p>
<p>But because of the considerable shortcomings in our public records law, on many crucial decisions in a once-in-a-century crisis, we remain in the dark.</p>

(Parker Michels-Boyce / For the Virginia Mercury)</p><p>They came. They honked. They went.</p>
<p>A few hundred protesters, in a demonstration that appears to be linked to a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/18/coronavirus-americans-protest-stay-at-home" target="_blank">conservative push</a> to make some political hay out of stay-at-home orders and social distancing shutdowns and egged on by<a href="https://www.wtkr.com/news/politics/protesters-bring-the-noise-demand-to-reopen-virginia" target="_blank"> cynical Virginia politicians</a> and <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/17/trump-states-stay-at-home-orders-192386" target="_blank">President Donald Trump</a>, cruised around the Virginia Capitol Wednesday, laying on their klaxons during the General Assembly&#8217;s reconvened session.</p>
<p>Add it to the list of disturbing and bizarre signs of our times: pro-Trump demonstrators blasting a Democratic governor for adhering to the social distancing policies and guidelines for reopening the economy published by &#8230;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/openingamerica/" target="_blank"> the Trump administration.</a></p>
<p>But let&#8217;s leave logic aside, as the president&#8217;s supporters have been doing for years.  The anti-illegal immigration president who <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/5-questions-about-president-trumps-use-of-undocumented-workers/2019/12/04/29439928-16a2-11ea-a659-7d69641c6ff7_story.html" target="_blank">employs undocumented immigrants</a>. The business wiz who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/05/07/us/politics/donald-trump-taxes.html" target="_blank">wrecked a string of enterprises</a>. The tough guy <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-avoided-the-military-draft-which-was-common-at-the-time-vietnam-war-2018-12" target="_blank">who dodged the draft</a>. The choice of righteous evangelicals whose personal life is &#8230; <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/may/08/stormy-daniels-talks-about-trump-and-the-worst-90-seconds-of-my-life-on-stand-up-tour" target="_blank">far from godly</a>. I could go on, but you get the point.</p>
<p>Fortunately, <a href="https://www.people-press.org/2020/04/16/covid-19-and-the-countrys-trajectory/" target="_blank">according to polling</a>, most people appear to recognize that the measures aren&#8217;t some plan to subjugate us all but necessary to contain the spread the spread of the virus and avoid swamping hospitals. For a sobering counterpoint to the &#8220;Don&#8217;t Tread on Me&#8221; nonsense on display in Richmond Wednesday, consider that in New York City they were stacking bodies on top of each other in refrigerated trucks and digging mass graves before deciding they would<a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/coronavirus/ny-coronavirus-nyc-freeze-bodies-victims-hart-island-burying-20200421-e6aotqvsqja3hg6nkerlukl6rm-story.html" target="_blank"> freeze some of them</a> instead.</p>

<p>Nearly two months after <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-conference/" target="_blank">Trump said</a> the number of COVID-19 cases in the United States was &#8220;going to be down to close to zero&#8221; <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html" target="_blank">there are more than 800,000 cases and close to 45,000 deaths as of Wednesday</a>.</p>
<p>Reasonable people can disagree on how far social distancing should go and whether it&#8217;s unfair to let state monopolies like liquor and the lottery remain in business while others that could conceivably adhere to social distancing remain shuttered. There are valid critiques of Gov. Ralph Northam&#8217;s administration, which was been slow to act and opaque with information and has yet to adequately explain why Virginia testing, so crucial to getting back to a semblance of normalcy, continues to lag other states.</p>
<p>Railing about tyranny and <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/04/21/virginia-gops-inaccurate-release-blasting-tyrannical-shutdowns-took-text-from-viral-social-media-post/" target="_blank">promoting conspiratorial garbage</a> isn&#8217;t the right way to make those arguments.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;ve already spilled too much ink on that lot.</p>
<p>Rather, as I tried to listen to the House of Delegates livestream over the blaring of stupid, spiteful horns, I thought about something that made a big impression on me during my nearly two and a half years in Pittsburgh.</p>

<p>Fred Rogers, known to millions as Mr. Rogers, was inescapable in the Steel City, where his nationally televised children&#8217;s show was filmed between 1968 and 2001. His words of wisdom about &#8220;looking for helpers&#8221; inevitably made the rounds in times of tragedy, so much so that it became a meme, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/10/look-for-the-helpers-mr-rogers-is-bad-for-adults/574210/" target="_blank">even criticized</a> as dangerously tranquilizing when used by adults in a childish attempt to inoculate themselves against a frightening and flawed world.</p>
<p>There have been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/28/us/testing-coronavirus-pandemic.html" target="_blank">massive failures</a> that left us collectively unprepared to respond to this pandemic, contributing to the angst that good-faith protesters (I assume at least some must be) feel about social distancing shutdowns, financial insecurity and the general helplessness that afflicts many of us as we we watch the mounting death toll and spread. And there is no escaping the horror and the heartbreak.</p>
<p>But as we watch incredulous as some of our fellow Virginians and Americans rage against the very measures intended to save the lives of themselves and their families, it&#8217;s worth remembering that there ARE lots of helpers, from the delivery drivers working long hours to bring packages and food to our doors, grocery store staff and convenience store clerks, food processing workers, funeral home employees, trash collectors, police, firefighters and EMTs, and, most importantly, the scientists and doctors developing <a href="https://news.virginia.edu/content/uva-health-offering-covid-19-testing-virginia-hospitals" target="_blank">tests</a>,<a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/virginia/update-vcu-to-treat-covid-19-patients-with-plasma-from-those-who-have-recovered-from/article_434516e1-9f6e-51f5-b30d-d328870cc8bc.html" target="_blank"> treatments</a> and <a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/news/health/vp-nw-coronavirus-research-virginia-20200326-u2xnkmmojjahzazzbivrztlfdy-story.html" target="_blank">vaccines</a>.</p>
<p>Instead of the former, let&#8217;s focus on the latter, those tending to the living and the dead. The ones who are helping.</p>

The Speaker of the House collapsed on the dais as she led a floor session. A lawmaker cast votes from a Plexiglas enclosure.</p>
<p>The typically sleepy reconvened session of the Virginia General Assembly on Thursday fully reflected the bizarre world into which we’ve all been thrust by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>“If anyone in this room is going to die from the virus if they get it, it’s me,” said Sen. George Barker, D-Fairfax, who worked from the transparent enclosure constructed by Senate staff. He said he was still recovering from open heart surgery and a bout of pneumonia.</p>
<p>The reconvened session, held every spring, is usually a perfunctory exercise to address the governor’s amendments and vetoes to legislation. This year, Gov. Ralph Northam asked both chambers to put their legislative stamp of approval over a significantly tempered spending plan as lawmakers scramble to respond to a public health — and economic — emergency.</p>
<p>Most of the governor’s legislative amendments were accepted, including a slate of budget cuts that will delay raises for teachers, millions in new funding for the state’s neediest school districts, an expansion of Medicaid and a free community college program. But, despite squeaking through the House, the governor&#8217;s push to move <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/04/10/virginias-may-elections-might-be-scrapped-people-are-still-voting-in-them-anyway/" target="_blank">May municipal elections to November</a> went down in the Senate, where some senators hoped to push the governor into convening a special session to address the issue.</p>
<h2><strong>Special precautions, a loud protest and a fainting spell</strong></h2>
<p>In an effort to reduce the risk of viral transmission, the House and Senate convened two and a half miles apart — the Senate in an event hall behind the Virginia Museum of Science, and the House in a massive open-sided tent erected beside the state Capitol.</p>
<p>The latter setup left House staff scrambling to respond to an ongoing series of technical glitches that stalled votes for the first hour of the session. “The problem seems to be that people have unplugged things,&#8221; House Clerk Suzette Denslow admonished. “So please don’t.”</p>
<p>Later that afternoon, legislators came to a standstill for several tense minutes after Speaker Eileen Filler-Corn collapsed at the dais. Spokesman Jake Rubenstein attributed the fall to a dizzy spell worsened by the glaring afternoon sun on the tent. Filler-Corn took her place again after some water and an assessment by Del. Dawn Adams, D-Richmond, a licensed nurse practitioner.</p>

<p>The tension was heightened by a demonstration calling for an end to Northam’s stay-at-home order, in which hundreds of cars drove on streets around Capitol Square honking.</p>
<p>The “Reopen Virginia” demonstration was one of several staged across the country by <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/04/17/as-coronavirus-crisis-drags-on-virginia-republicans-escalate-calls-to-reopen/" target="_blank">a loosely organized</a> movement of business interests and right-wing activists. The horns were clearly audible in the tent where the House was conducting its business.</p>

<p>In contrast, the Senate’s meeting space was quiet, climate controlled and free of technical glitches, which prompted some gloating by Senate Majority Leader Dick Saslaw, D-Fairfax.</p>
<p>“We didn&#8217;t have any problems voting. Other people did. Our presiding officer didn&#8217;t keel over.” He said, adding that, “The good news is, Eileen&#8217;s doing fine.”</p>
<p>The behavior of some lawmakers did earn a stern admonishment from Senate Clerk Susan Schaar, who pleaded with senators  to keep their masks over their faces as some took pulled them down to talk.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have several people in this room in a high risk category for various reasons, including myself,” she said.</p>
<h2><strong>A four-month delay for Virginia’s minimum wage increase</strong></h2>
<p>Lawmakers narrowly agreed to a four-month delay for the state’s first minimum wage increase in more than a decade.</p>
<p>Under legislation passed last month by newly elected Democratic majorities, the minimum wage would have increased from $7.25 to $9.50 on Jan. 1. Gov. Ralph Northam, citing economic turmoil caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, proposed pushing that back to May 1, 2021.</p>
<p>Democrats were somewhat divided over the proposal. Some called it prudent. Some said they opposed the delay but worried Northam would veto the bill altogether if they didn’t accept it. And a few said they opposed it and voted against it.</p>
<p>Sen. Janet Howell, D-Fairfax, fell into the latter camp, arguing the low wage workers the bill would help are among the front-line service workers keeping the public healthy.</p>
<p>“I think it should go into effect now,” she said.</p>
<p>Sen. Adam Ebbin, D-Alexandria, cautioned that there was no guarantee Northam would still sign the bill if they rejected his amendment.</p>

<p>“They say, ‘Be careful what you wish for, you just might get it,’” he said. “I would ask the body, ‘Be careful what you ask for, you might not get it.’”</p>
<p>Senate Minority Leader Tommy Norment, R-James City, said a four-month delay wasn’t nearly long enough to give small businesses time to recover from the pandemic. “This is just untimely,” he said.</p>
<h2><strong>A COVID-19 emergency release program for Virginia prisons</strong></h2>
<p>Northam’s administration has faced <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/04/21/virginias-prison-system-said-it-was-doing-everything-it-can-to-keep-covid-19-at-bay-cases-are-exploding/" target="_blank">significant criticism</a> for not doing more to reduce the state’s prison population as COVID-19 began to spread.</p>
<p>Though he’s rejected calls to use his pardon power to release low-risk inmates nearing the end of their sentences, he sent a budget amendment to the General Assembly proposing a release program that would allow the Department of Corrections to release as many as 2,000 of its 30,000 inmates.</p>
<p>The proposal faced outspoken opposition among Republicans, narrowly clearing the House on a 47-45 vote.</p>
<p>The measure allows DOC to discharge any prisoners with less than a year left to serve who have nonviolent records. It goes into effect immediately.</p>
<p>Lawmakers also moved up the effective date of a program that grants parole eligibility to so-called Fishback inmates, who were sentenced by juries after Virginia abolished parole but before the state began informing juries of that fact.</p>
<p>GOP lawmakers also opposed that measure, noting the parole board just angered the law enforcement community <a href="https://www.nbc12.com/2020/04/15/virginia-man-convicted-officer-slaying-gets-parole/" target="_blank">by granting parole</a> to a man convicted of killing a Richmond police officer 40 years ago.</p>
<p>“This is an especially bad idea given the board’s conduct over the past three weeks,” said Sen. Mark Obenshain, R-Rockingham.</p>
<h2><strong>Eviction protections and a quicker path to payday loan reform</strong></h2>
<p>Lawmakers adopted <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/04/15/for-virginians-left-out-of-federal-bailout-northam-proposes-60-day-eviction-grace-period/" target="_blank">two reforms</a> aimed at helping renters during the COVID-19 pandemic. One would prevent eviction lawsuits from being heard for at least two months after the state court system reopened. Another makes a 10-percent cap on interest rates for late payments effective immediately.</p>
<p>Neither measure drew significant debate.</p>
<p>A push to speed the enactment of payday loan reforms was more controversial. The legislation would cap interest on the loans at 36 percent, among other reforms. The state currently has among the weakest consumer lending laws in the country, allowing interest rates in the triple digits.</p>
<p>Northam asked the General Assembly to approve an amendment moving up the effective date of the bill six months from July 1, 2021, to Jan. 1.</p>
<p>Some balked, arguing short-term loans are more important now more than ever. Del. Kathy Byron, R-Bedford, wondered whether brick-and-mortar loan shops would suddenly close.</p>
<p>Other lawmakers were less sympathetic, and the measure passed. “Is there anybody who really feels sorry for the payday lenders?” said Sen. Joe Morrissey, D-Richmond. “I only wish the governor moved it up to this past weekend.”</p>
<h2><strong>Attempt to move elections stalls in Senate</strong></h2>
<p>Gov. Ralph Northam’s request to move numerous May municipal elections to November narrowly passed the House but stalled in the Senate amid concerns over destroying thousands of ballots that had already been cast, among other objections.</p>
<p>“We cannot make decisions based on hysteria,&#8221; said Sen. Chap Petersen, D-Fairfax, who was among a group of Democratic senators <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/04/21/three-democratic-senators-back-shorter-delay-for-virginias-may-elections/" target="_blank">pushing an alternate plan</a> that would move the more than two hundred local elections scheduled for May 5 to June.</p>
<figure id="attachment_17709" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:1920px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/VASH118-scaled.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-17709" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/VASH118-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1280" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Virginia State Sen.

Siobhan Dunnavant, R-Henrico, second from right, as they prepare for the reconvene session to order at the Science Museum of Virginia Wednesday April 22, 2020, in Richmond, Va.

<p>Several Republicans in the House and Senate said absentee ballots in the local races were being cast at record levels.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it would be a horrible precedent to turn away ballots that have already been cast,&#8221; said Sen. David Suetterlein, R-Roanoke County.</p>
<p>But Sen. Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, said the pandemic, which is infecting and killing more Virginians every day, made the move to November the best option before the senators Wednesday night.</p>
<p>“This kind of stuff happens every once in a century,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Surovell said the governor has the power to push the elections back two weeks on his own.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gov. Northam is grateful that the House of Delegates made the commonsense decision to move these elections to November. He will carefully review next steps, given the actions of the Senate,&#8221; Northam spokeswoman Alena Yarmosky said in a statement.</p>
<h2><strong>&#8216;Gray machines&#8217; survive </strong></h2>
<p>Though it actually voted to ban them earlier this year, the General Assembly approved a request from the Northam administration to allow “gray machines,” gambling devices that resemble slots, to remain in existence for another year with an accompanying $1,200 per month per machine tax that will create a pool of money to help Virginia weather the pandemic.</p>
<p>“Mostly I think they’re kind of sleazy,” said Sen. Janet Howell, D-Fairfax, of the machines, which have popped up in restaurants, bars, truck stops and convenience stores across the state by trying to exploit a gray area of Virginia law.</p>
<p>“But when we left here, we also had a great economy. As everybody knows, the world has changed since then. … This is an emergency measure to help us through very hard economic times.”</p>
<p>Howell said allowing the machines to continue to operate is expected to generate $150 million for the fund.</p>
<p>Sen. Mark Peake, R-Lynchburg, said it was bad policy to allow the so-called skill machines “because we need some money. “</p>
<p>State law previously banned slot machines before lawmakers opened the door for historic horse racing terminals and casinos over the past two years. That’s put the squeeze on the Virginia Lottery, which generates money for education, <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/va-lottery-says-its-on-track-to-lose-140m-this-year-to-gray-market-skill-games/" target="_blank">to the tune</a> of about $140 million last year.</p>
<p>“I think it’s a bad idea for Virginia to sell our souls for gambling money,” Peake said.</p>

<p>To keep be able to keep their own distance from each other, the House met in a tent on the Capitol grounds, beset by blaring horns from the drive-by protesters and technical difficulties. The Senate met in a space commandeered from the Science Museum of Virginia across town.</p>
<p>&#8220;Please do not take the hand sanitizer home,&#8221; Senate Clerk Susan Clarke Schaar told senators as they adjourned just after 10 p.m.</p>

(Robert Zullo/ Virginia Mercury) </p><p>The sales clerk craned her neck to the right, squinting as she peered past about a hundred yards of aisles.</p>
<p>&#8220;I see a pallet back there. You should probably go check it out,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Standing six feet away on a large red circle (a social distancing aid) installed on the floor, I had asked, with zero expectation of success, whether this particular Richmond Target had any toilet paper in stock. I took the Easter baskets my wife had ordered in advance for our two little boys from the customer service counter to the car and made a beeline back inside the store.</p>
<p>I hung a right past the registers and, still not believing it could be true, walked to a back corner, past over-the-counter drugs, lotions, vitamins, toothpaste, curling irons and groceries and other shoppers in masks (homemade and otherwise) who were assiduously trying to avoid me.</p>
<p>At last I arrived at a partially empty set of shelves containing a few packages of bathroom tissue. That finding such a previously mundane product felt like unearthing the treasure of the Sierra Madre made me chuckle out loud in the empty aisle through my vacuum cleaner filter homemade mask.</p>
<p>I grabbed two packages, sure I would be greeted at home like a conquering hero, and made my way to another set of red circles at the self-checkout, where a young employee who was diligently disinfecting card reader keypads politely intercepted half my haul, telling me the store was limiting customers to one each.</p>
<p>Is there a German noun for a powerful, sublime combination of the banal and the surreal? Because that&#8217;s what washed over me in a massive wave as I surrendered my illicit extra package of toilet paper, paid and left. This, after all, was a store I&#8217;ve been in hundreds of times in three stints living in the Richmond area since 2002.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard sometimes to come to terms with just how fast things have changed in the past month or so. But, per public health officials and state leaders, for those of us who have the luxury of self-isolation, the social distancing <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/04/13/new-models-show-social-distancing-is-working-in-virginia-though-cases-still-could-exceed-hospital-capacity/" target="_blank">is working</a>.</p>
<p>While we now lead the world in reported deaths (though there&#8217;s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/02/us/politics/cia-coronavirus-china.html" target="_blank">good reason to be skeptical</a> about China&#8217;s numbers) and despite our <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2020/04/04/coronavirus-government-dysfunction/?arc404=true" target="_blank">federal government&#8217;s myriad failures</a>, we appear to be <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/do-you-buy-that-social-distancing-is-working-to-help-flatten-the-curve/" target="_blank">having success</a> in flattening the curve to avoid overwhelming our hospitals here in Virginia, though they haven&#8217;t been so lucky in places like <a href="https://www.michiganadvance.com/2020/04/09/new-tcf-center-field-hospital-will-admit-1st-patients-friday/" target="_blank">Michigan</a>, <a href="https://www.recordonline.com/news/20200413/virus-death-toll-tops-10000-in-new-york-hospitals-still-getting-2000-new-patients-day" target="_blank">New York </a>and<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/08/rural-hospital-coronavirus-covid-19-louisiana-new-orleans" target="_blank"> Louisiana</a>.</p>
<p>Already, what should be heralded as a glimmer of good news in our deeply divided, seriously fact-challenged society — people are heeding advice, companies are transitioning to making masks and ventilators, etc. — is becoming fodder for morons mouthing off in your social media feeds, trying to use the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/07/health/ihme-updated-covid19-model/index.html" target="_blank">changing projections</a> as evidence the whole thing was overblown anyway.</p>
<p>But maybe, I thought, in the midst of all the horror, MAYBE there was an opportunity to sit back and appreciate the fact that we can still pull together and do what&#8217;s right for the common good.</p>
<p>That said, I&#8217;m not sure everyone still gets it.</p>
<p>A few days after my Target trip I was dispatched to a grocery store, where I parked, called a number and waited for our prepaid order to be loaded into our trunk. It felt like a debauched way to get groceries, but my wife had woken up at 3 a.m. to get her order in the online queue, so there was no backing out now.</p>
<p>I looked to my right. A driver in a van was wearing a surgical mask, waiting. To my left, another shopper was wearing a mask and gloves, hands on the steering wheel. I hadn&#8217;t brought my mask and a momentary spasm of panic hit me. I had not intended to get out of the car. Rather, I was told all I had to do was pop the trunk and let the employee put the bags in.</p>
<p>As I waited, I watched the lady to my left go around to the back of her compact hatchback and start pulling items out of bags as the store employee loaded them in, evidently trying to verify that she&#8217;d gotten what she ordered. The grocery store worker was two feet away, their heads both occupying the same small space inside the back of the car for what seemed an uncomfortably long period of time.</p>
<p>Then I looked to my right. The other driver remained in her car, popping open the back of her minivan. She had a mask on her face. But when the maskless employee came up with her receipt, she took her mask down to converse with her at a distance of about 16 inches.</p>
<p>Then, as she got ready to drive away, she pulled it back over her face.</p>
<p>When my turn arrived, the grocery store runner tried to hand me my receipt. &#8220;You can just put in one of the bags,&#8221; I said. &#8220;I trust you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s all stay safe out there. For as long as it takes.</p>

<p>In the gravel lot of a maintenance yard for coal-bed methane machinery, a 68-year-old heavy equipment operator was showing me his truck — festooned with Trump and &#8220;Hillary for Prison&#8221; stickers — for <a href="https://www.richmond.com/business/trump-s-win-warmly-received-in-southwest-virginia-but-how/article_bd04a380-8e41-5d8e-b0e2-8d05cdae898a.html" target="_blank">a story</a> I was reporting on whether the president-elect could deliver on his promise to resuscitate the dying coal industry. (He couldn&#8217;t, of course, and<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-coal/president-trump-cant-stop-u-s-coal-plants-from-retiring-idUSKCN1P80BY" target="_blank"> hasn&#8217;t</a>.)</p>
<p>But back then, John Compton was riding high.</p>
<p>&#8220;He’s going to tear up the playhouse up in Washington, and that’s a damn plus,&#8221; <a href="https://www.richmond.com/business/trump-s-win-warmly-received-in-southwest-virginia-but-how/article_bd04a380-8e41-5d8e-b0e2-8d05cdae898a.html" target="_blank">he told me</a>.</p>
<p>Mr. Compton&#8217;s metaphor has proven apt, if not for the reason he meant. During more than three years in office, Trump has shown himself to be the same petulant bully he&#8217;s always been, only now he&#8217;s at the helm of a nation of 330 million desperately trying to come to grips with a pandemic that is killing thousands around the world and will kill and sicken more people here.</p>

<p>There has been endless coverage of how Trump&#8217;s flippant and often false remarks about COVID-19 in January and February put us <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/28/trump-coronavirus-politics-us-health-disaster?CMP=share_btn_fb&amp;fbclid=IwAR1xsGymGAlRloImwQWeTXqTZY6cXGS2PQl47fWPDPFhIfILpdRXPepOwv0" target="_blank">miles behind the curve</a> in dealing with the virus, as well as the problems with testing and a shortage of ventilators and protective medical equipment that continue — more than two months since the U.S. recorded its first case — to be the most pressing obstacles to getting it under control..</p>
<p>It&#8217;s almost like putting a shallow, self-obsessed, spiteful reality show star in charge of the country was a really bad idea.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">I love Michigan, one of the reasons we are doing such a GREAT job for them during this horrible Pandemic.

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>But perhaps the most alarming indication that our ailing American experiment might be headed for life support (preferably in a hospital that has a spare bed and hasn&#8217;t run out of ventilators) is how lack of a coherent virus response from the federal government left states, private labs and universities to come up with ad hoc solutions and vie with each other for testing kits and materials and medical equipment now in scarce supply.</p>
<p>“We’re not waiting for the feds to step up,” the chief health officer in Montgomery County, Maryland, which is looking to get testing kits from other countries, told <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-maryland-dc-coronavirus-trump/2020/03/24/b81f4d4e-6dec-11ea-b148-e4ce3fbd85b5_story.html" target="_blank">The Washington Post last week.</a>  “We’ve known that they’re just not, so we’re not waiting for that to happen.”</p>
<p>It has also created a patchwork of emergency orders, closures and other measures across the country, where every governor is essentially fending for herself or himself. Trump, bewilderingly, among a string of mixed messages, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/27/us/politics/coronavirus-trump-ventilators-gm-ventec.html" target="_blank">dragged his feet</a> in using federal powers under the Defense Production Act to get ventilators, protective equipment and other essentials to where they need to go.</p>
<p>“Allowing the free market to determine availability and pricing is not the way we should be dealing with this national crisis at this time,&#8221; Gov. Ralph Northam said Wednesday.</p>
<p>That said, there&#8217;s also been plenty of blame to go around. I&#8217;ve been reluctant to criticize Northam&#8217;s response in the midst of this crisis. I&#8217;m sure everyone in his administration is doing their best to deal with a public health emergency the likes of which hasn&#8217;t been seen in this country since probably the 1918 flu epidemic.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s worth pointing out that Northam has been slower to act than other leaders around the region and country. He initially declined to shut down bars and restaurants, <a href="https://apnews.com/5771c0ea1957097bd7f791ffd87ae1fe" target="_blank">saying </a>he was &#8220;more about carrots than sticks&#8221; and citing a statistic that Virginians get roughly half of their meals from restaurants. I&#8217;ve asked Northam&#8217;s spokeswoman for the provenance of that stat twice, but never got a response. Last week, he changed his mind, shutting down restaurant dining rooms as part of sweeping new restrictions closing some non-essential businesses.</p>
<p>A day after saying decisions on closing schools would be made at the local level, he likewise changed course and ordered them <a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/all-releases/2020/march/headline-854442-en.html" target="_blank">closed for two weeks</a> before extending that to the rest of the school year. Virginia officials, for some strange reason, kept making it a point of emphasis that there was no evidence of community spread when it was, according to some experts,<a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/03/12/a-real-and-legitimate-threat-for-all-our-sakes-take-coronavirus-seriously/" target="_blank"> likely already a foregone conclusion</a> because of the paucity of testing.</p>
<p>And, just last week, <a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/all-releases/2020/march/headline-855474-en.html" target="_blank">he ordered hospitals</a> to postpone elective surgeries well after it became obvious that the virus had the potential to overwhelm Virginia hospital capacity.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a tough balancing act for a pro-business governor to order shutdowns that will leave thousands out of work and could mean that some establishments never reopen. However, given the fumbling federal response, it seemed apparent weeks ago that such steps would be necessary if there was to be any hope of limiting the spread of the virus here.</p>
<p>&#8220;One might assume that a governor who spent most of his career as a physician would be among the first to press for quick, decisive action to combat a deadly, fast-spreading infectious disease,&#8221; <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/grading-the-regions-coronavirus-response-hogan-1st-northam-last-and-bowser-in-the-middle/2020/03/22/b8fe4066-6b86-11ea-9923-57073adce27c_story.html" target="_blank">Washington Post correspondent Robert McCartney wrote</a>. &#8220;One would be mistaken.&#8221;</p>
<p>Maryland&#8217;s Gov. Larry Hogan <a href="https://www.fox5dc.com/news/maryland-gov-larry-hogan-joins-fox-5-to-discuss-his-coronavirus-response" target="_blank">took some (gentle) issue</a> with Northam&#8217;s initial reluctance on closing restaurants and bars for dine-in service. Other officials here have<a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/03/20/governor-faces-calls-for-special-session-bolder-and-swifter-action-on-covid-19/" target="_blank"> also called on him</a> to go further faster, including implementing a &#8220;stay at home&#8221; order like in New York, California or elsewhere, which Northam has resisted.</p>
<p>“Virginia must take action now to halt the spread of COVID-19 before it results in further illness and death within the commonwealth,” Charlottesville Mayor Nikuyah Walker wrote on behalf of the City Council. “The council does not believe that this Executive Order’s social distancing measures are sufficient to contain the spread of COVID-19 in Virginia.”</p>
<p>Northam, asked several times why he hasn&#8217;t taken more aggressive action earlier, has fallen back on words like &#8220;fluid&#8221; and &#8220;dynamic&#8221; to describe the virus response. He also claimed the distinction between his urging that Virginians to stay home and (like other states) ordering them to do so was a matter of &#8220;<a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/03/27/were-talking-semantics-here-northam-defends-not-issuing-stay-at-home-order-for-virginians/" target="_blank">semantics</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s not semantics to say that some Virginia workers are likely left in limbo, risking firing if they follow the governor&#8217;s advice against the wishes of their bosses.</p>
<p>&#8220;People are going to die that don’t need to because we will not have hospital capacity. We have a very limited number of hospital beds, relative to the number of sick that we’re going to see,&#8221; said Del. Sam Rasoul, D-Roanoke, who has urged Northam to issue a shelter in place order, in an <a href="https://www.wsls.com/news/local/2020/03/28/delegate-sam-rasoul-calls-for-gov-northam-to-issue-stay-at-home-order/" target="_blank">interview with a local TV station</a>.</p>
<p>If past is prologue, and Northam issues a broader lockdown only after more grim statistics on deaths, infections and hospitalizations emerge, it could be too little, too late. I hope not.</p>
<p>It remains likewise troubling that Dr. Lilian Peake, the state epidemiologist, <a href="https://www.styleweekly.com/richmond/how-bad-will-it-get/Content?oid=15856136" target="_blank">still says the state</a> has no modeling (at least that she&#8217;s willing to share) that indicates how much worse the pandemic will get here.</p>
<p>Will it be the horror that is befalling New York, Detroit, New Orleans, Italy and Spain? If state officials have any inkling of what awaits Virginia, they&#8217;re not saying publicly. Not with any specificity anyway.</p>
<p>And what&#8217;s more, the governor has opted to space out his briefings <a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/about-the-governor/governors-calendar/" target="_blank">to once every two days</a> (during the week at least). There was no briefing this weekend.</p>
<p>That seems an incongruous decision given the escalating number of infections and lots of unanswered questions about Virginia&#8217;s hospital bed capacity, testing regimen, school closures and the myriad facets of this crisis.  Northam&#8217;s administration might not have much new to add, but it&#8217;s important to have a daily opportunity for reporters to get questions answered and information out to the public.</p>
<p>It seems inevitable that COVID-19 will be a major milestone in the history of the United States. Coming at a time of toxic politics, deep distrust of government, media and institutions, will we take a turn for the better or the worse? Could we shift back towards respecting expertise, deference to science and a realization that the institutions we have, while fallible, like all creations of human beings, have a crucial role in national emergencies and our daily lives? Could we rediscover the meaning of  &#8220;e pluribus unum?&#8221;</p>
<p>Or we will plunge deeper into political and cultural tribalism and partisan gridlock, further eroding our ability to respond to health crises, threats and to solve big problems confronting our nation?</p>
<p>Time will tell. But, while this will in all likelihood get worse before it gets better, let&#8217;s all keep meticulous notes on the shortcomings this pandemic is revealing in our government, our health care system, our social safety net, our economy and labor laws and especially how we pick our politicians.</p>
<p>Of all the catastrophic mistakes that have been made in managing the COVID-19 crisis, failing to learn the painful lessons it is teaching us would be the biggest.</p>

(Ned Oliver/ Virginia Mercury)</p><p>A much-watched bill that would restore the ability of the State Corporation Commission to review Dominion Energy&#8217;s base rates has been placed on the docket for the Senate Commerce and Labor Committee&#8217;s <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+doc+S0210302" target="_blank">Monday meeting</a>.</p>
<p>The bipartisan legislation by Del. Jay Jones, D-Norfolk, and Del. Lee Ware, R-Powhatan, cleared the House on a 77-23 vote but <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/02/21/bipartisan-fair-energy-bills-act-facing-headwinds-in-senate/" target="_blank">hadn&#8217;t moved in the Senate</a>. Some environmental groups and ratepayer advocates say it&#8217;s a crucial companion to the <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/02/20/ten-things-to-know-about-the-clean-economy-act/" target="_blank">Clean Economy Act</a>, which would set dates for closure of Virginia fossil fuel plants and usher in big spending on energy efficiency and renewable energy projects like wind and solar, among many other provisions, that&#8217;s working its way to final passage.</p>
<p>Under the Fair Energy Bills Act, the SCC, charged with reviewing Dominion’s rates and earnings in 2021, would conduct that review subject to guidelines laid out in Chapter 10 of Title 56 of the state code, instead of Chapter 23, and allow any overearnings from 2017-2020 to be refunded to customers.</p>
<p>At stake is big money. Dominion overearned by about $356 million in 2017 and <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/dominion-earned-278-million-more-than-permitted-in-2018-regulators-find/" target="_blank">$277 million in 2018</a>, according to the SCC, and it&#8217;s important to ensure that new spending on transitioning to carbon-free electric generation shouldn&#8217;t be placed on top of already inflated base rates, proponents of the bill say.</p>
<p>“Given that the 1990s was the last time there was a deeper review of what comprises the base rate for Virginia’s largest electric utilities and given that rate-payers have paid off some items that had been part of the base rate, this type of bill would help ensure that the next regular rate review in 2021 is based on more accurate, up-to-date data, helping ensure electric utility customer rates set by the commission are more fair moving forward,” said Dana Wiggins, director of outreach and financial advocacy at Virginia Poverty Law Center, in a statement last month.</p>
<p>The General Assembly is scheduled to adjourn in a week.</p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>Back in 2018, as Dominion Energy was pushing its contentious Grid Transformation and Security Act through the General Assembly, the Senate Commerce and Labor Committee was debating whether the legislation allowed a &#8220;double dip&#8221; — that is, billing ratepayers twice for hundreds of millions in new utility spending contemplated by the law.</p>
<p>Sen. Dick Saslaw, D-Fairfax, pointed to Dominion lobbyist Jack Rust (a former state delegate) and called on senators who were getting queasy about passing yet another package of giveaways to utility shareholders to just take his word for it rather than pay heed to objections from the Attorney General&#8217;s Office and staff from the State Corporation Commission.</p>
<p>“If he tells you this thing cannot be double-counted, you can pretty much take that to the bank. I think they’ve solved the problem of that,” <a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/local/government-politics/white-smoke-on-dominion-energy-regulatory-overhaul-bill-heading-to/article_a67b708a-2182-5ccf-b8e7-30f5982f2ca0.html" target="_blank">Saslaw said</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, there was in fact a double dip in the law, illustrated best by the<a href="https://apnews.com/642cc31d479f4ded9eabee34534c201f/House-changes-utility-rewrite-bill-to-prevent-double-dipping" target="_blank"> late-night vote</a> later in the session by the House to excise it.</p>
<p>Since then, Democrats have taken control of both the House and Senate; a new group, Clean Virginia, has pumped millions into Virginia campaigns to counter Dominion&#8217;s much-publicized influence; and the <a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/virginia/democratic-party-of-virginia-rejects-political-dollars-from-dominion/article_d47bd616-46f1-5186-836d-b2af1f1dd091.html" target="_blank">Democratic Party itself</a> and <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/herring-tells-blue-virginia-he-wont-take-dominion-money/" target="_blank">senior figures</a> in it have renounced the company&#8217;s cash. In many arenas this session, we&#8217;ve been reminded that it&#8217;s a new day in Richmond and (constantly, it seems) that &#8220;<a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/virginia-turns-deep-blue/" target="_blank">elections have consequences</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>For energy policy though, there may have been no more consequential election than the one that saw Saslaw, first elected as a delegate in 1976, barely <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/06/12/primary-tuesday-gop-delegate-felled-from-the-right-democratic-giant-barely-fends-off-progressive-hopeful-and-morrissey-wins-but-not-from-jail-this-time/" target="_blank">squeak by</a> a primary challenger, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/va-candidate-backed-by-democratic-socialists-draws-attacks-from-senate-minority-leader-richard-saslaw/2019/06/05/a0e6c7ca-8705-11e9-98c1-e945ae5db8fb_story.html" target="_blank">who hammered him</a> for his long and mutually beneficial ties to Dominion.</p>
<p>And so here we are again with a sprawling energy bill <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/02/24/yeah-im-not-perfect-either-pass-the-clean-economy-act/" target="_blank">with lots of moving parts</a> apparently heading into conference, dogged by complaints that it&#8217;s too friendly to Dominion&#8217;s bottom line by some critics and too much for ratepayers to swallow by Republicans, many of whom, with Democrats now in charge, are suddenly very concerned about electric bills. After all, both Republicans and Democrats voted in 2015 to shield Dominion and Appalachian Power from SCC scrutiny of their base rates, which has allowed Dominion to rack up hundreds of millions in &#8220;overearnings&#8221; <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/dominion-earned-278-million-more-than-permitted-in-2018-regulators-find/" target="_blank">in the years since</a>.</p>
<p>And while the Clean Economy Act has lots of merits, there&#8217;s also a bi-partisan, complementary bill (the<a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/02/21/bipartisan-fair-energy-bills-act-facing-headwinds-in-senate/" target="_blank"> Fair Energy Bills Act</a>) remaining that would go a long way toward resetting the base line for Virginia&#8217;s electric utility customers, making the necessary burden of shifting the state to carbon-free generation over the next several decades more bearable for ratepayers. With the clock running out on the session, however, Saslaw hasn&#8217;t yet put it on the docket for the Commerce and Labor Committee, which he took over from another Dominion MVP, former Sen. Frank Wagner, R-Virginia Beach.</p>
<p>Dominion has been fighting attempts to reduce its base rates from its regulated Virginia utility, which <a href="https://www.richmond.com/z-no-digital/dominion-rules-after-epic-corporate-feud-energy-giant-emerges-to/article_379c07be-0d7d-5d16-8a28-3b30c9a2076b.html" target="_blank">is a major cash cow</a> for the larger company, for years. At Monday&#8217;s committee meeting, Saslaw and other senators of both parties <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/02/25/electric-competition-expansion-is-dead-for-the-year-after-senate-kills-remaining-proposals/" target="_blank">united to kill bills</a> that encroached on Dominion&#8217;s monopoly, raising concerns about captive ratepayers. (<a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+sum+HB528" target="_blank">A pro-ratepayer bill,</a> restoring the ability of the SCC to determine how costs related to closure of coal and gas plants will be amortized, did somehow escape Saslaw&#8217;s committee over his opposition).</p>
<p>Saslaw&#8217;s unapologetic coziness with Dominion, his biggest campaign contributor, is well established.</p>
<p>In 2017, just after he helped kill a bill that would have returned regulation of utility base rates — amid mounting windfalls for shareholders at the expense of ratepayers — to the State Corporation Commission, <a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/virginia/government-politics/general-assembly/bill-that-might-have-meant-millions-for-utility-ratepayers-snuffed/article_583675c4-86a3-5b05-96f6-8bcb9e5d971c.html" target="_blank">Saslaw told me</a> this:</p>
<p>&#8220;The SCC is on Dominion all the time. Dominion could cure cancer, and the SCC could find fault with them,&#8221; he said. (He also bulldozed the way for big Dominion spending on<a href="https://www.newsadvance.com/business/dominion-backed-bill-on-burying-lines-breezes-through-senate/article_d48e88eb-d4c6-5364-b95a-6c3db833280d.html" target="_blank"> line undergrounding projects</a> the commission had repeatedly rejected as unjustifiably expensive.)</p>
<p>In 2018, <a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/powerful-senate-committee-kills-rate-freeze-repeal-awaits-saslaw-s/article_575b2d58-9ff0-5db6-8f9d-2065a89fdd70.html" target="_blank">he angrily denied</a> that the massive utility regulatory overhaul the company was pushing was &#8220;Dominion&#8217;s bill.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/patrickmwilson/status/953076447522050054" target="_blank">https://twitter.com/patrickmwilson/status/953076447522050054</a></p>
<p>The same month, <a href="https://apnews.com/c994e09470254d6c95add4ff78c43255/Facing-new-scrutiny,-powerful-utility-turns-to-old-friends" target="_blank">the Associated Press reported</a> on Saslaw&#8217;s umbrage when fellow Democrats criticized a Republican state senator&#8217;s ties to Dominion. Saslaw had gotten a missive from Dominion executive Bob Blue, who wrote to say he was &#8220;disappointed to see this, especially considering how our company has supported Democrats over the years. As you know, many of us have been personal supporters as well.”</p>
<p>Saslaw promptly tried to set Democrats straight. He &#8220;quickly apologized and criticized the state party for not doing its &#8216;homework&#8217; on &#8216;how generous Dominion has been to me&#8217; and others in the party,&#8221; the AP reported.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s not the best bit from the story:</p>
<div class="td-paragraph-padding-2">
<p class="Component-root-0-2-42 Component-p-0-2-35"><em>He erupted when a reporter asked whether Dominion executives had ever reminded him of their giving.</em></p>
<p class="Component-root-0-2-42 Component-p-0-2-35"><em>“Zero. Zero. Zero,” Saslaw said, his voice rising to a yell.</em></p>
<p class="Component-root-0-2-42 Component-p-0-2-35"><em>When reminded of Blue’s email, Saslaw later apologized and said he misspoke.</em></p>
</div>
<p>So, despite all the sound and fury over our dominant utility&#8217;s role in Virginia politics and governance, all the pledges and rejection of its campaign cash and the seismic elections that ushered in new Democratic majorities, Dominion, while facing a shifting political landscape and perhaps more uphill sledding, still has a powerful ace in the hole to help keep the odds ever in its favor.</p>

<p>The board agonized behind <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/03/01/after-hours-behind-closed-doors-state-water-control-board-decides-not-to-revoke-mountain-valley-pipeline-certification/" target="_blank">closed doors for hours</a> with its legal counsel over whether it had the authority to revoke a certification it issued for the Mountain Valley Pipeline, which had been spilling sediment all over its Southwest Virginia construction route, clogging private property and state waterways with mud.</p>
<p>No? Don&#8217;t worry. Neither, evidently, do a bipartisan bunch of senators who killed two of three bills to beef up enforcement of violations from destructive pipeline projects in a committee Tuesday. Some seemed unsure of what the board actually does.</p>
<p>By this time last year, Southwest Virginia landowners and residents had been <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/12/14/state-water-board-will-reconsider-water-quality-certification-for-mountain-valley-pipeline/" target="_blank">begging the citizen board</a> for months to do something about the pipeline construction, which had unleashed <a href="https://www.wsls.com/news/2018/05/19/report-of-mudslide-in-franklin-county-near-mountain-valley-pipeline-construction/" target="_blank">torrents of mud</a> that covered roads and choked streams. Ultimately, it decided it couldn&#8217;t revoke the water certification it issued for the project, even in the face of a criminal investigation and widespread violations of state law that would lead to a <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/mountain-valley-pipeline-agrees-to-pay-virginia-2-15-million-for-environmental-violations/" target="_blank">more than $2 million fine and consent decree</a>.</p>
<p>Two of three bills introduced by Del. Chris Hurst, D-Montgomery, to fix the obvious inability of state regulators to halt the damage wrought by MVP or similar projects, went down in the Democrat-led Senate Agriculture, Conservation and Natural Resources Committee on identical 13-1 votes. Sen. Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond, long believed to be<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/va-state-sen-mcclellan-launches-pac-possibly-signaling-a-bid-for-governor/2019/05/06/83cc20f2-701e-11e9-9eb4-0828f5389013_story.html" target="_blank"> eyeing a statewide run</a> in 2021, was the only vote against killing the bills.</p>
<p>The committee did advance <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+sum+HB646" target="_blank">Hurst&#8217;s bill</a> increasing penalties for violations by the largest natural gas pipelines but not <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+sum+HB644" target="_blank">one</a> that would have assessed additional fines for cumulative violations nor <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+sum+HB643" target="_blank">another</a> that would give the water board stop work authority, among other provisions.</p>

(Mason Adams/ For the Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p>Though a lobbyist for the pipeline developers tried to pin the MVP&#8217;s damage almost exclusively on heavy rain in 2018, violations on the job sites are <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Wild-Va.-Complaint-MVP-CD-violations-2.6.20.pdf" target="_blank">still happening</a>, according to Wild Virginia, which combed through dozens of the Department of Environmental Quality&#8217;s own inspection reports between September and December. That&#8217;s even though much of the work on the project between West Virginia and Pittsylvania County has been idled by vacated federal permits.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mountain Valley&#8217;s violations during a time when its sites are mostly dormant are particularly inexcusable. In this period, all of the company&#8217;s efforts should be devoted to implementing environmental protection measures and yet the same kinds of problems that occurred on a frequent basis throughout the 18-month period before the decree was proposed are still  occurring, though less often,&#8221; wrote David Sligh, the group&#8217;s conservation director, in a letter to DEQ Director David Paylor this month.</p>
<p>Hurst noted that many of the affected landowners, as the violations mounted on MVP in 2018, felt like their complaints to DEQ were akin to shouting into a &#8220;void,&#8221; though he blamed it on the agency being spread too thin.</p>
<p>“They wanted some way of being able to feel like their voices were being heard,&#8221; Hurst told the committee, adding that his legislation would allow the board to &#8220;see, from a bird’s eye view … something is wrong here with the way this thing is being done. &#8230; Let’s empower our citizen board to be able to rise to the challenge and meet the call that is requested by the public and take action when appropriate.”</p>
<p>It didn&#8217;t go over well.</p>
<p>Sen. Joe Morrissey, D-Richmond, perhaps informed by his experience as defense attorney and defendant alike, raised questions about the appeal rights of the pipeline companies in case their project gets shut down.</p>
<p>“I’m one of those people who’s a stickler for due process,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The committee chairman, Sen. Chap Petersen, D-Fairfax City, expressed reservations about giving too much power to a citizen board.</p>
<p>“This is a citizen review panel,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We have to be wary in my opinion about how much authority we give to what is a part time panel. &#8230; I don’t think this is as easy as it looks.”</p>
<p>Yes, it would be too simple to give the regulatory board <a href="https://www.deq.virginia.gov/Portals/0/DEQ/LawsAndRegulations/CitizenBoards/WaterBoard/StateWaterControlBoardOverview.pdf" target="_blank">in charge of administering</a> the state&#8217;s water control law stop-work authority over construction that is actively harming water quality in Virginia.</p>
<p>Better they remain limited to doing what<a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/01/18/when-i-was-accused-of-working-for-the-opposition-after-raising-concerns-about-pipeline-construction-damage/" target="_blank"> DEQ</a> and the<a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/11/19/a-governor-meddles-with-the-air-board-as-it-weighs-a-dominion-energy-permit-and-a-former-member-gets-deja-vu/" target="_blank"> governor&#8217;s office</a> tell them to do.</p>
<p>Opposition from chamber, industry and oil and gas groups amounted to opposition to &#8220;wanting to be held accountable and wanting to be responsible,&#8221; Hurst said. “Whether the violation is minor or major … That’s breaking the law, and if you do it 20 times in a month, you should have your wrist slapped.&#8221;</p>
<p>Several representatives from environmental groups appeared taken aback by the votes to pass the bills by.</p>
<p>“There needs to be more teeth in the enforcement of the conditions of the permits the board approves,&#8221; said Peter Anderson, an attorney with Appalachian Voices, a nonprofit that has worked with landowners affected by the Mountain Valley Pipeline.</p>
<p>“The citizens whose land is impacted and all these permit condition violations are accruing, they&#8217;re throwing their hands up saying &#8216;Why isn’t anyone stopping work while all these violations accrue.&#8217; &#8230; They report violations to DEQ and nothing happens. So the next place they turn is the citizen board that approved the permit in the first place. So if that board has the power to approve the permit but then not enforce the conditions of its permit, that seems to be bit of a break in process.”</p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia-Mercury)</p><p>If you&#8217;ve ever worked in journalism or had the misfortune of listening to a reporter complain about it, you&#8217;ve probably heard a version of this adage: The hours are long and the pay sucks, but, on the other hand, everyone hates you.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s probably too much to expect mass apprehension about what&#8217;s happening to Virginia&#8217;s newspapers, from The Daily Press and The Virginian-Pilot in Hampton Roads to the titles across the state once owned by Warren Buffett&#8217;s Berkshire Hathaway, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/01/29/warren-buffett-newspapers-berkshire-hathaway-lee-enterprises-newspapers/4607530002/" target="_blank">which announced last week</a> it was selling them to an Iowa-based newspaper company called Lee Enterprises. (Not to mention <a href="https://www.progress-index.com/news/20180118/hopewell-news-closes-its-doors" target="_blank">smaller papers</a> that <a href="https://richmondmagazine.com/news/my-take-more-than-a-paper/" target="_blank">have shuffled off this mortal coil</a> in the past few years).</p>
<p>Certainly, even before &#8220;enemy of the people&#8221; and all that, few journalists expected any tears to be shed for them by haters of &#8220;corporate media&#8221; and &#8220;liberal media,&#8221; both epithets leveled at me from left and right over the course of a 13-year career at newspapers in four states. Even so, the toxicity of our current politics and online culture probably makes it less likely than ever.</p>
<p>But many of us who work in Virginia media have felt the shudders reverberate through the state&#8217;s news ecosystem with each announcement of downsizing or layoffs at the state&#8217;s biggest publications, newspaper building sales in <a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/business/vp-bz-monument-newsroom-20200123-5rvrvcki3jbidfpkmi6lxw7mmu-story.html" target="_blank">Norfolk</a> and <a href="https://www.nbc12.com/2020/01/03/hotel-operator-buys-times-dispatch-building-richmond/" target="_blank">Richmond</a> and last week&#8217;s news that <a href="https://www.bhmginc.com/markets/virginia/" target="_blank">10 papers from Bristol to Culpeper </a>and lots of places in between will change hands.</p>
<p>And no matter your political persuasion or personal position on the press, if you care about what happens at your local government, school board, police department or sheriff&#8217;s office, among other institutions, it should also worry you.</p>
<p>I may fail to convince you. But since many of the journalists across the state are expected to keep quiet, put their heads down and go back to their jobs while their industry crumbles around them, I thought they were owed at least this much. I was one of them not that long ago.</p>

<p>I finally landed a job as a city hall reporter at the Richmond Times-Dispatch in early 2012 after years of trying. I had just gone through <a href="https://www.houmatoday.com/news/20111227/courier-and-comet-to-be-sold-to-florida-media-company" target="_blank">a sale in Louisiana</a>, where our pair of sister papers that were part of The New York Times Regional Media Group were <a href="https://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/27/times-company-sells-regional-newspaper-group/" target="_blank">unloaded</a> to a start-up company from Florida, and walked right into another.</p>
<p>A few months after I started, Media General, whose local owners had held the paper for generations, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mediageneral/warren-buffett-to-buy-media-general-newspapers-idUSBRE84G0M920120517" target="_blank">sold almost all its newspaper holdings</a> to Berkshire Hathaway. The mood in the newsroom was cautiously buoyant after years of layoffs, furloughs and downsizing at the RTD. After all, why would one of the nation&#8217;s richest men get into the newspaper business if he didn&#8217;t intend to invest in helping local news chart a sustainable path amid the great digital disruption?</p>
<p>Over the years, that optimism soured based on what I witnessed in two stints at the paper between 2012 and 2018. There was little evidence that BH was willing to expend much effort to become a real media company, invest in the digital product and aggressively grow online subscribers. That last one, by the end, had become the new Holy Grail for newspaper executives, who, in my experience, were always pitching the latest conventional wisdom on the next big business-saving pivot (grow online ad revenue! more <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/was-the-medias-big-pivot-to-video-all-based-on-a-lie" target="_blank">video!</a> contests! photo galleries! events!) to bolster steadily flagging morale.</p>
<p>I always thought it took too long to realize — years after falling woefully <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2019/06/11/google-facebook-antitrust-monopoly-advertising-journalism-revenue-streams-column/1414562001/" target="_blank">behind the internet titans</a> on classified and digital advertising and watching print readership and revenue plummet — that the journalism, something most newspapers still, against all odds, do very well, was the only real product left to market.</p>
<p>Inevitably, BH started <a href="https://www.cjr.org/united_states_project/berkshire-hathaway-newspapers-layoffs.php" target="_blank">doing its own layoffs</a>. When Buffett himself said we were all going &#8220;<a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2016/08/the-playbook-interview-warren-buffett-226892" target="_blank">downhill</a>,&#8221; it was difficult for many of us endeavoring to remain &#8220;<a href="https://www.poynter.org/reporting-editing/2012/warren-buffett-to-his-new-employees-it%E2%80%99s-your-job-to-make-your-paper-indispensable/" target="_blank">indispensable&#8221; </a>to our communities to see BH as anything but another fumbling newspaper chain more interested in sucking the last drops of profit out of a dying industry than figuring out a sustainable model. (Ever the inspiration to his troops, Buffett pronounced his and other local papers <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/warren-buffett-newspapers-are-toast-exclusive-133720666.html" target="_blank">&#8220;toast&#8221;</a> last year.)</p>
<p>As Joshua Benton and Ken Doctor <a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2020/01/turns-out-warren-buffett-wont-be-the-billionaire-who-saves-newspapers-either/" target="_blank">wrote in a post</a> for Harvard&#8217;s Nieman Lab, Buffett &#8220;bought Media General’s papers in 2012 for $142 million; he’s selling his papers (which do include some additional, non-Media General properties) for $140 million today. He was almost certainly able to pull profits out of them every year in between.&#8221;</p>
<p>What will Lee&#8217;s takeover mean? It might not be all bad. Indeed, as a veteran Virginia editor pointed out on Facebook, Lee is at least an established (albeit <a href="http://gatewayjr.org/midwest-reporters-reflect-on-sale-of-warren-buffet-papers-to-lee-enterprises/" target="_blank">cold-blooded as any other</a>) media company, unlike BH Media, which was created to run Buffett&#8217;s new newspaper holdings and was (at least it seemed to me and many others who worked for them) perennially unsure of how to manage them and slow to make digital upgrades.</p>
<p>I asked a Lee representative last week what Virginia journalists and the communities they serve could expect under Lee&#8217;s ownership. I was referred to <a href="https://lee.net/financial/lee-enterprises-to-buy-berkshire-hathaway-newspaper-operations-berkshire-hathaway/article_406cd3d4-428b-11ea-8b89-cbc3dc3a7374.html" target="_blank">statements</a> replete with words like &#8220;synergies&#8221; but short on specifics about newsroom staffing.</p>
<p>&#8220;We see the Berkshire Hathaway newspapers as an excellent long-term investment because we believe in the importance of local news and advertising,&#8221; Lee spokesman Dan Hayes wrote to me. &#8220;Lee outpaces the industry in digital market share and revenue, and we have delivered exceptional performance managing the Berkshire Hathaway newspapers over the last 18 months.&#8221;</p>
<p>I asked if there was a plan to invest in the newsrooms or would there likely be more cuts.</p>
<p>&#8220;Warren Buffett invests for the long term and, as he says in the news release, he would not have done this deal with any company other than Lee because he believes Lee is in the best position to manage through the industry’s current challenges,&#8221; Hayes wrote. &#8220;He loves his newspapers and says he believes they will be in the right hands with Lee. Note his entire quote, how he adds that no organization is more committed to serving the vital role of high-quality news as Lee.&#8221;</p>
<p>I asked how Lee could deliver high quality local journalism without beefing up newsrooms that have been shredded by layoffs, buyouts and attrition.</p>
<p>&#8220;Please note again what Warren Buffett says in the news release. Lee and the Berkshire Hathaway newspapers share a common culture, always striving to deliver the best journalism we can for our communities,&#8221; Hayes said. &#8220;We have continued to do that despite the reality of staff reductions, and in some cases we have actually added staff. But, as you well know, size of staff alone is not a measure of excellence. Your own website could be Exhibit A.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Hayes&#8217; flattery notwithstanding, the Mercury has always set out to complement, not replace, Virginia&#8217;s daily papers, with a focus on state government and policy. It&#8217;s not within our scope or mission to tell you what the city councils in Charlottesville, Virginia Beach or Bristol; the school boards in Spotsylvania, Chesterfield or Newport News; or the police in Nelson, Lynchburg or Martinsville are up to, among the scores of other localities that make up the commonwealth.</p>
<p>Every weekday, we compile a list of Virginia headlines called<a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/category/uncategorized/news-to-know/" target="_blank"> News to Know</a>. The overwhelming majority of those stories still come from Virginia newspapers, which, despite the indignities wrought by mostly corporate owners with <a href="https://www.poynter.org/business-work/2020/corporate-giants-are-coming-for-your-local-news-heres-how-we-fight-back/" target="_blank">a ruthless focus</a> on siphoning the last profits from a struggling business at the expense of the news product, are still delivering, by and large, the best local reporting.</p>
<p>With print revenue sure to continue its long slump, limited potential for new online dollars, either via advertising or subscription, and profit margins to be preserved, the obvious prediction seems to be more downsizing at Virginia&#8217;s newspapers, from the Tidewater to the mountains and everywhere in between.</p>
<p>And if that&#8217;s something you&#8217;re cheering, you&#8217;re in the cut-your-nose-to-spite-your-face crowd. Because it means less reporting <a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/government/virginia/vp-nw-strip-search-20191206-wd2ejtrtqfgbvkbj7xzh7btemu-story.html" target="_blank">like this</a> on what <a href="https://www.nvdaily.com/nvdaily/embezzlement-scandal-leaves-dark-cloud-over/article_56b8cbe7-0cdd-5891-ae8d-734c4c9f4713.html" target="_blank">powerful entities</a> and people in your community are up to, less attention focused on the <a href="https://www.martinsvillebulletin.com/news/local/does-martinsville-really-need-to-go-through-reversion/article_01da3955-96f0-5f76-af04-c1fbf462efd1.html" target="_blank">unique challenges</a> a city, county or town might face and the loss of local institutions that, while businesses, have kept <a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/local/unguarded-a-three-part-series-on-how-richmond-s-guardianship/article_d39e242e-9213-5600-8150-da9566c143b7.html" target="_blank">public service</a> at the front of their mission.</p>
<p>At the Times-Dispatch, where walking into the newsroom once meant looking out over rows of cubicles with dozens of reporters and editors, just a relative handful remain in a place that has become a gaunt shadow of its former self.</p>
<p>More buyouts <a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/business/vp-bz-tribune-buyouts-pilot-press-20200205-dguicg6xz5a7ldvqxkuljjevom-story.html" target="_blank">were accepted</a> Wednesday in Norfolk and Newport News, not long after <a href="https://twitter.com/kdoctor/status/1224700409920528389" target="_blank">a vulture hedge fund, </a>one that was compared <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/is-this-strip-mining-or-journalism-sobs-gasps-expletives-over-latest-denver-post-layoffs/2018/03/15/d05abc5a-287e-11e8-874b-d517e912f125_story.html" target="_blank">to a strip-mining operation</a> by Washington Post media columnist Margaret Sullivan, bought a big stake in Tribune Publishing, which owns the Pilot and Daily Press. (Alden Global Capital, the same fund, <a href="https://dfmworkers.org/now-alden-is-circling-lee-newspapers/" target="_blank">also bought a stake</a> in Lee)</p>

<p>Support them, by all means, with subscriptions, digital or otherwise.

This AK-47-style rifle, with a drum magazine that the owner said could hold more than 40 rounds, was carried it at the Jan. 20 pro-gun rally at the Capitol. (Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>Yes, Monday&#8217;s massive gun rally, which closed streets and saw thousands of heavily armed people playing soldier on the streets of Richmond, ended without violence.</p>
<p>Yes, many of those who attended are undoubtedly law-abiding people sincere in their fervor about the Second Amendment.</p>
<p>Yes, the crowd shouldn&#8217;t be construed as solely a collection of fringe militia and white supremacist types.</p>
<p>However, in the feel-good aftermath that saw lawmakers shower police with (well-deserved) praise for their handling of what many feared could be a deadly tinderbox and Republicans heaping plaudits on &#8220;law-abiding gun owners,&#8221; a few observations raised some questions.</p>
<p>One: Many of the armed demonstrators roaming the streets outside the secure area were masked.</p>
<p>Two: Many were also carrying semi-automatic rifles with high-capacity magazines.</p>
<p>Both of these activities are restricted here by existing law.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s what <a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title18.2/chapter9/section18.2-422/" target="_blank">state code</a> says about masking:</p>
<blockquote class="td_quote_box td_box_center"><p>It shall be unlawful for any person over 16 years of age to, with the intent to conceal his identity, wear any mask, hood or other device whereby a substantial portion of the face is hidden or covered so as to conceal the identity of the wearer, to be or appear in any public place.</p></blockquote>
<p>There are exceptions (&#8220;traditional holiday costumes&#8221; and theatrical productions, protective masks for certain professions, etc.) but none that seem to apply to Monday&#8217;s gun rally.</p>
<p>Just one person was charged under the masking law, as the<a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/police-arrest-21-year-old-richmond-woman-for-wearing-bandanna-near-pro-gun-rally/" target="_blank"> Mercury&#8217;s Graham Moomaw</a> and other outlets reported Monday: a 21-year-old woman who, police said, refused to remove a bandanna. To charge her with a felony and not the many, many armed people brazenly covering their faces as they paraded through the streets of Richmond seems suspect.</p>
<p>And here&#8217;s what<a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title18.2/chapter7/section18.2-287.4/" target="_blank"> state code </a>says about carrying certain weapons in the city of Richmond and other select localities (bold emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote class="td_quote_box td_box_center"><p>It shall be unlawful for any person to carry a<strong> loaded (a) semi-automatic center-fire rifle or pistol</strong> that expels single or multiple projectiles by action of an explosion of a combustible material and is equipped at the time of the offense with <strong>a magazine that will hold more than 20 rounds of ammunition</strong> or designed by the manufacturer to accommodate a silencer or equipped with a folding stock or (b) shotgun with a magazine that will hold more than seven rounds of the longest ammunition for which it is chambered on or about his person <strong>on any public street, road, alley, sidewalk, public right-of-way, or in any public park or any other place of whatever nature that is open to the public</strong> in the Cities of Alexandria, Chesapeake, Fairfax, Falls Church, Newport News, Norfolk,<strong> Richmond,</strong> or Virginia Beach or in the Counties of Arlington, Fairfax, Henrico, Loudoun, or Prince William.</p>
<p>The provisions of this section shall not apply to law-enforcement officers, licensed security guards, military personnel in the performance of their lawful duties, or <strong>any person having a valid concealed handgun permit</strong> or to any person actually engaged in lawful hunting or lawful recreational shooting activities at an established shooting range or shooting contest. Any person violating the provisions of this section shall be guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor.</p></blockquote>
<p>I asked the Capitol Police whether these laws were being enforced during the demonstration Monday. Here&#8217;s what I was told:</p>
<p>&#8220;Our goal is to maintain a safe environment in Capitol Square and throughout Richmond. All of today&#8217;s law enforcement partners are working toward that goal,&#8221; spokesman Joe Macenka replied.</p>
<p>I asked Richmond Police and Virginia State Police the same question Tuesday morning.</p>
<p>&#8220;Same answer,&#8221; Richmond Police spokesman Gene Lepley responded.</p>
<p>Corinne Geller, spokeswoman for the Virginia State Police, said this: &#8220;Our response is in step with what Capitol Police and Richmond Police have already told you to these same questions.&#8221;</p>

<p>It&#8217;s hard to know how many of the thousands of people carrying weapons Monday might have run afoul of the law, since there&#8217;s an exemption for concealed carry permit holders and a requirement that the guns be loaded.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s obvious how fraught police confronting armed demonstrators about their masks and inspecting individual weapons might be in the thick of the rally, where it&#8217;s easy to envision dangerous scenarios that could have unfolded had they started arresting or ticketing the &#8220;WE WILL NOT COMPLY&#8221; crowd. Believe me, I know the police agencies in charge of handling such an influx of armed people don&#8217;t want to hear any griping about what for them was a successfully managed event.</p>
<p>While I, like everyone else who lives or works in Downtown Richmond, am breathing a sigh of relief now, I&#8217;m also uneasy with the idea of Virginia laws falling by the wayside because the sheer number of people who may have been violating them (and the fact that they were carrying loaded guns) presented an insurmountable challenge.</p>
<p>Given the Second Amendment sanctuary movement that&#8217;s swept the state, the notion that it could be too dangerous to enforce some laws if there are enough armed people around doesn&#8217;t bode well.</p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><em><strong>Programming note: The Weekender is moving. Starting this coming week, this newsletter will go out on Saturdays. </strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Mercury commentary ICYMI:</strong> In a guest piece, Alexa Capeloto, an associate professor of journalism at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/01/13/why-some-public-universities-get-to-keep-their-donors-secret/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/01/13/why-some-public-universities-get-to-keep-their-donors-secret/">explores how schools like George Mason University</a> get to keep secret donors who can influence instruction. Mercury columnist Bob Lewis took a look at Virginia legislation that would let college athletes profit off their names and likenesses, another nail in the coffin for the &#8220;myth&#8221; of <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/01/13/the-myth-of-amateurism-va-considers-letting-college-athletes-earn-money-from-name-image-and-likeness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/01/13/the-myth-of-amateurism-va-considers-letting-college-athletes-earn-money-from-name-image-and-likeness/">college athletic amateurism</a>.</p>
<p>Our Ivy Main also broke down <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/01/14/both-this-sessions-big-energy-omnibus-bills-could-be-bolstered-with-amendments/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/01/14/both-this-sessions-big-energy-omnibus-bills-could-be-bolstered-with-amendments/">two big omnibus energy bills </a>in the works this session, and how they could be improved. In another guest piece, Sarah Bedard Holland, CEO of Virginia Health Catalyst, formerly the Virginia Oral Health Coalition, argues for <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/01/14/numbers-dont-lie-virginians-need-oral-health-care/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/01/14/numbers-dont-lie-virginians-need-oral-health-care/">including a dental benefit</a> in Virginia&#8217;s Medicaid program. Karla Loeb, with Sigora Solar, says<a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/01/15/the-virginia-clean-economy-act-is-a-giant-leap-forward-for-virginia-energy-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/01/15/the-virginia-clean-economy-act-is-a-giant-leap-forward-for-virginia-energy-policy/"> the Clean Economy Act</a>, one of those omnibus energy bills, will ensure &#8220;an equitable transition from fossil fuels to clean energy.&#8221;</p>
<p>And, with Monday&#8217;s gun rally looming and the extremist threats that came with it, I posited that our age of misinformation is <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/01/15/reaping-the-harvest-of-the-misinformation-age/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/01/15/reaping-the-harvest-of-the-misinformation-age/">driving much of the inflammatory rhetoric</a>.</p>
<p><strong>About that gun rally: </strong>The Roanoke Times called Republicans&#8217; response to Gov. Ralph Northam&#8217;s Capitol Square gun ban <a href="https://www.roanoke.com/opinion/editorials/editorial-why-republicans-should-embrace-northam-s-declaration-of-emergency/article_f51f7a54-9cb3-5d35-9076-67d29ffbd23c.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.roanoke.com/opinion/editorials/editorial-why-republicans-should-embrace-northam-s-declaration-of-emergency/article_f51f7a54-9cb3-5d35-9076-67d29ffbd23c.html">&#8220;tone deaf.&#8221; </a> &#8220;We don’t know what police are hearing on those &#8216;dark web channels&#8217; but we know what we’ve seen on Facebook, where people have posted comments on the pages of at least one Republican state legislator that Democrats should be hung or shot,&#8221; the paper wrote. &#8220;Those comments, by the way, went without reprimand, without removal. Really?&#8221;</p>
<p>Virginian-Pilot columnist Gordon Morse also had some thoughts on the spread of ubiquitous misinformation: &#8220;Guns save lives and vaccines don’t. So, say some of our fellow Americans and they mean to prevail on those points,&#8221;<a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/opinion/columns/vp-ed-column-morse-0119-20200119-a2e3ehlyencv3o6gwc6wkacf2y-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.pilotonline.com/opinion/columns/vp-ed-column-morse-0119-20200119-a2e3ehlyencv3o6gwc6wkacf2y-story.html"> he wrote</a>. &#8220;Technology will put unified and angry people in Richmond on Monday. But it will not change the reality that we must live with ourselves and reach, if we can, a common understanding.&#8221;</p>
<p>Shannon Watts, the founder of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, says the extremist backlash against new gun restrictions <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/01/9233697/why-gun-rights-white-extremists-rally-richmond-virginia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/01/9233697/why-gun-rights-white-extremists-rally-richmond-virginia">won&#8217;t halt the progress</a> being made in Virginia or elsewhere: &#8220;Because the facts aren’t on their side, and the people aren’t on their side, gun extremists have decided to lie, threaten, and harass women and moms. When volunteers like me have the audacity to tweet about common-sense gun laws, they threaten rape and murder.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/attacks-on-virginias-gun-safety-efforts-are-irresponsible-overreactions/2020/01/16/e20d0a2c-37cf-11ea-9541-9107303481a4_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/attacks-on-virginias-gun-safety-efforts-are-irresponsible-overreactions/2020/01/16/e20d0a2c-37cf-11ea-9541-9107303481a4_story.html">The Washington Post&#8217;s editorial board </a>said the gun lobby&#8217;s &#8220;combustible rhetoric&#8221; over new gun restrictions &#8220;is wildly detached&#8221; from reality. &#8220;Tailor-made to stoke furor, it has found an online echo chamber among neo-Nazis, white supremacists and other militant groups planning to join gun advocates at the Capitol in Richmond next Monday for an event that officials worry could reprise the chaos in Charlottesville in 2017.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Free Lance-Star says gun-rights groups <a href="https://www.fredericksburg.com/opinion/editorial-gun-rally-is-no-place-for-weapons/article_dad06f28-c77a-528f-9e9f-d302848c2f3d.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.fredericksburg.com/opinion/editorial-gun-rally-is-no-place-for-weapons/article_dad06f28-c77a-528f-9e9f-d302848c2f3d.html">are better served </a>leaving their weapons at home for the rally: &#8220;If the governor and the General Assembly overstep their bounds, gun owners are not without recourse. They still have the courts and the ballot box as legal remedies. That’s how our system of government works,&#8221; the paper wrote, adding that &#8220;any violence that might erupt would only serve to undermine rally organizers’ claims that responsible, law-abiding gun owners in Virginia are not the problem.&#8221;</p>
<p>The gun rally is<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/01/16/tapping-brakes-gun-control-still-means-huge-changes-coming-virginias-gun-culture/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/01/16/tapping-brakes-gun-control-still-means-huge-changes-coming-virginias-gun-culture/"> unlikely to deter</a> Democrats from passing new regulations, observed veteran Virginia political writer and radio commentator Norman Leahy in the Post: &#8220;The public policy wind, then, is at Democrats’ backs. And no amount of sanctuary county resolutions, face-to-face lobbying or vocal protests is strong enough to change it. That doesn’t mean Democrats can do whatever they please on guns.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Hooray for the ERA</strong>: The Richmond Times-Dispatch<a href="https://www.richmond.com/opinion/plus/editorial-the-general-assembly-passes-the-era---/article_f213081c-fbf5-5105-91c4-f9a313dc69e8.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.richmond.com/opinion/plus/editorial-the-general-assembly-passes-the-era---/article_f213081c-fbf5-5105-91c4-f9a313dc69e8.html"> said Virginia</a> was &#8220;long overdue&#8221; in passing the Equal Rights Amendment.  &#8220;As the nation marks the 100th anniversary of the passage of women’s suffrage, endorsing a measure that would make discrimination based on gender unconstitutional sends a strong message that Virginia — the birthplace of American democracy — values equality.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>A broad green energy bill for Virginia:</strong> &#8220;The Clean Economy Act is what years of backlash and struggle against Dominion have been leading to,&#8221; <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/local-opinions/with-energy-policy-theres-no-free-lunch/2020/01/17/b13fd97c-3650-11ea-9541-9107303481a4_story.html#comments-wrapper" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/local-opinions/with-energy-policy-theres-no-free-lunch/2020/01/17/b13fd97c-3650-11ea-9541-9107303481a4_story.html#comments-wrapper">wrote a pair of environmental activists </a>in a Post op-ed. &#8220;A full one-third of House and Senate members have pledged not to take election campaign money from Dominion precisely so leaders can listen to their voters in moments like this — not Dominion.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Sanctuary in the eye of the beholder:</strong> &#8220;When it comes to shielding immigrants whose initial act on American soil is an illegal one, leftist officials are often quick to declare their municipalities &#8216;sanctuary cities&#8217; where, essentially, violators of federal immigration law receive local succor,&#8221; <a href="https://www.winchesterstar.com/winchester_star/editorial-sanctuary/article_783afd87-24ff-5266-8a97-85132967dafb.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.winchesterstar.com/winchester_star/editorial-sanctuary/article_783afd87-24ff-5266-8a97-85132967dafb.html">The Winchester Star wrote</a>. &#8220;But when the cause is actually constitutional — preservation of the Second Amendment — Democrats and their ilk, maintain all rules should be followed.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Local control:</strong> Local governments should be able to decide the fate of Confederate statues,<a href="https://www.dailyprogress.com/opinion/opinion-editorial-local-autonomy-important-to-statues-issue/article_36f3e573-a3a9-5ae7-8153-62e5111373f7.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.dailyprogress.com/opinion/opinion-editorial-local-autonomy-important-to-statues-issue/article_36f3e573-a3a9-5ae7-8153-62e5111373f7.html"> The Daily Progress says</a>. &#8220;They should be free to remove statues or other items from public spaces. But if that happens, arrangements ought to be made for the statues’ preservation. Future generations should be granted the opportunity to make their own decisions on the issue as well.</p>
<p><strong>A harsher master:</strong> The Roanoke Times<a href="https://www.roanoke.com/opinion/editorials/editorial-southwest-virginia-gets-the-shaft-in-the-state-senate/article_fd9e2fe3-7682-5946-9399-742712ab6ea2.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.roanoke.com/opinion/editorials/editorial-southwest-virginia-gets-the-shaft-in-the-state-senate/article_fd9e2fe3-7682-5946-9399-742712ab6ea2.html"><u> bemoaned</u></a> the lack of representation from Southwest Virginia on some General Assembly committees: &#8220;Ultimately demography is a harsher political master than the Democrats ever will be. Not having a voice on key committees in Richmond is something the region is going to have to get used to.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>&#8216;Do no harm&#8217;:</strong> The Virginian-Pilot said the Democrats <a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/opinion/vp-ed-editorial-northam-commonwealth-0113-20200113-tovcspe35jdqzg72utlalg33vu-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.pilotonline.com/opinion/vp-ed-editorial-northam-commonwealth-0113-20200113-tovcspe35jdqzg72utlalg33vu-story.html">will be smart </a>to follow Northam&#8217;s pledge to &#8220;First do no harm,&#8221; calling it &#8220;a darn good message for this ambitious new General Assembly. Northam should repeat it often.“</p>
<p><strong>Migratory birds</strong>: The Pilot<a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/opinion/vp-ed-editorial-migratory-birds-0116-20200115-vhgtlkajtfckhdv6kq2cwkglba-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.pilotonline.com/opinion/vp-ed-editorial-migratory-birds-0116-20200115-vhgtlkajtfckhdv6kq2cwkglba-story.html"> also blasted VDOT </a>for paving over an island used for decades by migratory birds without a plan to replace it.  &#8220;Certain accommodations must be made for vital transportation projects such as this, of course. But what price must be paid in the name of progress? And what’s a few dollars more if it protects the natural environment so central to this region’s identity?&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>And a Byrd that shouldn&#8217;t migrate:</strong> The Winchester Star argues that a statue of &#8220;Massive Resistance&#8221; Gov. Harry Byrd <a href="https://www.winchesterstar.com/winchester_star/editorial-no-to-byrd-statue-removal/article_7acaf08c-d2c8-50dd-b6ec-414a0f4927d3.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.winchesterstar.com/winchester_star/editorial-no-to-byrd-statue-removal/article_7acaf08c-d2c8-50dd-b6ec-414a0f4927d3.html">should remain on Capitol Square</a>. &#8220;Mr. Byrd, his antediluvian segregationist stances notwithstanding, was a historical giant — one of Virginia’s most progressive governors (a stringent anti-lynching law and a much-needed road-building plan) and then a titan of the U.S. Senate as protector of the U.S. budget.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Letter of the week<em>:</em></strong> &#8220;I just wish that all those gun rights advocates who showed up at the Capitol this week would have to endure a prolonged lockdown of their school as our grandchild did this week at Moody Middle School,&#8221; Judith Bledsoe Baile of Richmond <a href="https://www.richmond.com/opinion/letters-to-editor/letter-to-the-editor-jan-trauma-of-lockdown-might-sway/article_8f903a06-4e80-53a5-b531-07484d13ba5c.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.richmond.com/opinion/letters-to-editor/letter-to-the-editor-jan-trauma-of-lockdown-might-sway/article_8f903a06-4e80-53a5-b531-07484d13ba5c.html">wrote to the RTD</a>.  &#8220;Perhaps then the terror and the insanity of it all would become real.&#8221;</p>

(Photo by Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>Shortly after Barack Obama won his first term as president, I was sitting in a courthouse in South Louisiana waiting for the start of a proceeding in a trial I was covering.</p>
<p>The sheriff&#8217;s deputies who patrolled the courthouse were chatting with clerks about the havoc the new president-elect was about to create for gun owners. A new, exorbitant tax on ammunition would make it all but unaffordable, so stock up now, they advised.</p>
<p>And, worst of all: &#8220;I heard he wants to get sworn in on one of them Iranian bibles,&#8221; one said. Many of these people I saw every day, relying on them for leads on what was happening in the courthouse. I asked them about the provenance of their inside information on the new president&#8217;s gun agenda. Chain emails, the fake news of the era, turned out to be the source.</p>
<p>A few months later, <a href="https://www.houmatoday.com/news/20090618/local-gun-dealers-cant-keep-bullets-in-stock" target="_blank">I wrote a story</a> about how local gun dealers couldn&#8217;t keep ammunition on the shelves and the same sheriff&#8217;s office was worried about finding enough rounds for range training.</p>
<p>“The American public just went bonkers,” one gun dealer told me. “People are panicked.“</p>
<p>Given the vast expansion of the ability to spread misinformation nowadays, those chain emails your older relatives used to forward so credulously seem like a quaint relics of a simpler time.</p>
<p>Now, with a bunch of gun bills before the Virginia General Assembly, some gun owners here, and some from out of state who are making <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/prospect-of-gun-control-in-virginia-draws-threats-promise-of-armed-protest/2020/01/05/7e9b230c-2e38-11ea-bcd4-24597950008f_story.html" target="_blank">ominous pledges</a> to show up at the Capitol next week, are the ones going ham, the culmination of years of flame-stoking and fear-mongering by right-wing media, pro-gun and anti-government groups.</p>
<p>For a trip through the looking glass,<a href="https://www.fauquier.com/news/carter-gets-death-threats-over-bill-to-allow-government-workers/article_0d035899-26be-5a70-af0c-acce5175375f.html" target="_blank"> check out what happened</a> when a bill wholly unrelated to the gun debate by Del. Lee Carter, D-Manassas, about allowing certain public employees to strike, got sucked into the gun backlash spin cycle, with an assist from Del. Nick Freitas, R-Culpeper.</p>

<p>This didn&#8217;t just circulate in the usual right wing online fever swamps, but made it into <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/second-amendment-sanctuaries-11577661926?redirect=amp" target="_blank">an editorial in the Wall Street Journal.</a></p>

<p>Believe it or not, there&#8217;s scarier stuff out there if you go looking for it. One firearm blog that I won&#8217;t link to, relying on a slew of half-truths and outright falsehoods, wrote this in December: &#8220;Battle lines are being drawn and there are people ready and willing to do ….things.&#8221; There are lots of references to civil war, and, if you think &#8220;boogaloo&#8221; just refers to a dance, maybe <a href="https://www.adl.org/blog/the-boogaloo-extremists-new-slang-term-for-a-coming-civil-war" target="_blank">give this a read</a>.</p>
<p>Virginia State Police, Richmond Police and the Capitol Police are already announcing road closures for Lobby Day on Monday, when thousands of gun activists are expected here at the Capitol.</p>
<p><a href="https://apnews.com/681a7a4bb8f38e83c3d2e2fb0f7ccf01" target="_blank">And the AP reported Tuesday night</a> that Gov. Ralph Northam &#8220;plans to declare a temporary emergency Wednesday banning all weapons, including guns, from Capitol Square&#8221; ahead of the gun rally Monday. The governor has scheduled a briefing for this afternoon, when he&#8217;ll presumably roll that out.</p>
<p>Citing two state officials, the AP reported that Northam &#8220;has grown increasingly concerned about numerous ominous-sounding postings on social media from forces outside Virginia. The official cited one posting that included a photo of an AR-15 and said there are &#8216;great sight angles from certain buildings&#8217; near Capitol Square.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even the Virginia Citizens Defense League, the commonwealth&#8217;s most ardent pro-gun group, (<a href="https://www.vulture.com/2018/07/philip-van-cleaves-recaps-sacha-baron-cohen-gun-prank.html" target="_blank">never forget Puppy Pistol</a>) is trying to tone down some of the rhetoric.</p>
<p>&#8220;There have been many rumors, videos and articles flying around the internet,&#8221; the group wrote in an email to members. &#8220;We cannot stress enough that this is a peaceful day to address our legislature. Yes, we hold a rally, but the point of the day is communication with our representatives. To our knowledge there are no credible threats of violence. That being said, please practice appropriate situational awareness. &#8230; The eyes of the nation and the world are on Virginia and VCDL right now and we must show them that gun owners are not the problem. Lead by example.&#8221;</p>
<p>A Colonial Heights sporting goods store has also been running radio ads warning about misinformation.</p>
<p>&#8220;BY NOW YOU ARE AWARE THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF PROPOSED GUN LAWS COMING TO OUR STATE. UNFORTUNATELY, THERE ARE ALSO PLENTY OF RUMORS BEING SPREAD PLUS FEAR-MONGERING AND &#8216;FAKE NEWS.&#8217; AS YOUR LOCAL, FAMILY-OWNED DEALER OF FIREARMS AND OUTDOOR SPORTING GOODS FOR OVER 43 YEARS, WE’RE WORKING TO ELIMINATE THE FAKE NEWS BY ENGAGING AND TALKING WITH OUR STATE LEGISLATURE EVERY DAY TO HELP KEEP YOU INTELLIGENTLY INFORMED,&#8221; the store, Dance&#8217;s Sporting Goods, <a href="https://dancessportinggoods.com/2A/" target="_blank">wrote on its website</a>, with instructions on how to contact lawmakers.</p>
<p>Not like it matters to some of the extremists out there, who see every gun restriction as an infringement, but it bears repeating that the landmark<a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/07pdf/07-290.pdf" target="_blank"> Heller decision,</a> the Roe v. Wade of the gun rights movement that firmly established the individual right to bear arms, affirmed the compatibility of gun laws and the Second Amendment.</p>
<p>And Florida&#8217;s red flag law, for example, which has resulted<a href="https://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2019/sep/03/dave-aronberg/explaining-how-floridas-red-flag-gun-law-works/" target="_blank"> in hundreds of orders</a> removing firearms from individuals, <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/florida-red-flag-law-gun-control-constitution-1461672" target="_blank">has been upheld</a> by an appellate court. In the United States, courts, not so-called sanctuary counties, sheriffs, local prosecutors or self-<a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/01/13/as-virginia-democrats-advance-new-gun-restrictions-militias-organize-promising-to-resist/" target="_blank">declared militiamen</a>, decide what&#8217;s constitutional.</p>
<p>These are, by and large, all things that us gun owners can and should live with, not a slippery slope to broad gun confiscation and FEMA death camps. Democrats certainly did themselves no favors by waiting weeks <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/12/09/northam-backed-assault-weapon-bill-will-include-grandfather-clause-for-existing-guns/" target="_blank">to clarify</a> that they intended to make accommodations for existing owners of guns that would fall under their proposed assault weapons ban, which also raises thorny questions about registration, <a href="https://www.thetrace.org/2019/08/what-the-data-says-asssault-weapons-bans/" target="_blank">compliance and enforcement</a>.</p>
<p>Firearm regulation in a nation with so many guns is not a panacea for gun violence, and Democrats shouldn&#8217;t lull themselves into thinking that regulating hardware will solve it all, particularly the shootings that disproportionately plague urban areas. Lawmakers should also remain open to ideas like the <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/08/12/something-for-everyone-republican-lawmaker-presents-gun-violence-prevention-idea-favored-by-liberals/" target="_blank">group-violence prevention program</a> proposed last year by Del. Todd Gilbert, R-Shenandoah.</p>
<p>Indeed, as a Boston University researcher <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/08/19/three-gun-laws-that-could-cut-homicides-36-percent-and-more-numbers-on-guns-in-virginia/" target="_blank">told legislators</a> this past summer, three policies that could significantly cut homicides here in Virginia have nothing to do with restricting certain types of firearms.</p>
<p>Still, the package Democrats are pushing is an important part of reducing gun deaths, cracking down on straw purchases and, with proposed red flag laws, attempting to stop people before they use their guns to hurt themselves and others.</p>
<p>Even if Democrats get all the gun control items on their wish list — and with the <a href="https://www.roanoke.com/news/local/rural-virginia-democrats-once-backed-by-nra-feel-the-pressure/article_1fa63a5c-dccb-54a3-a3da-c3145e52e077.html" target="_blank">NRA lobbying</a> some sympathetic Democratic senators pretty hard, there&#8217;s some reason to believe they might not —  firearms still won&#8217;t be regulated half as stringently as motor vehicles. Keep that in mind amid all the sound and fury.</p>

<p><strong>Mercury commentary ICYMI</strong>: Guest columnist Joyce Barnes, a home health worker, remembers the moment her teenage grandson, in his first job as a janitor, outstripped her earnings. <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/01/10/time-for-virginia-to-get-a-raise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/01/10/time-for-virginia-to-get-a-raise/">She says it&#8217;s time to boost Virginia&#8217;s minimum wage</a>. Former State Air Pollution Control Board member and retired UVA professor Vivian Thomson argued that a court decision striking down the permit the board issued for Dominion Energy&#8217;s contentious Buckingham compressor station<a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/01/09/deqs-failure-on-compressor-station-review-is-another-sign-new-leadership-is-needed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/01/09/deqs-failure-on-compressor-station-review-is-another-sign-new-leadership-is-needed/"> illustrates why</a> the state&#8217;s environmental agency needs new leadership.</p>
<p>Mercury columnist Bob Lewis <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/01/06/as-democrats-seek-a-nominee-what-qualities-can-they-sell-to-virginias-voters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/01/06/as-democrats-seek-a-nominee-what-qualities-can-they-sell-to-virginias-voters/">warned pundits</a> that Virginia might not be as blue as it appears, presenting a conundrum for Democrats. Will their presidential nominee be &#8220;a far-left or socialist candidate who alienates centrists and pragmatists essential for winning electoral votes in states like Virginia,&#8221; or a &#8220;&#8216;more traditional candidate who can’t relate to the party’s young, progressive and energetic base?&#8221;</p>
<p>Kathay Feng, with advocacy group Common Cause, called the redistricting amendment that some Democrats are backing away &#8220;<a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/01/07/the-time-for-comprehensive-redistricting-reform-is-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/01/07/the-time-for-comprehensive-redistricting-reform-is-now/">a huge improvement from the status quo</a>&#8221; and should pass the General Assembly again. Mercury columnist Ivy Main says Virginia&#8217;s voluntary renewable portfolio standard, pegged for major changes in this General Assembly session, &#8220;<a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/01/07/the-strange-case-of-thermal-energy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/01/07/the-strange-case-of-thermal-energy/">has enabled all kinds of mischief.</a>&#8221;</p>
<p>And Mercury columnist Roger Chesley, a Howard University graduate, says Gov. Ralph Northam&#8217;s moves to bolster two state historically black universities are commendable but notes that other <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/01/06/guvs-support-of-hbcus-laudable-though-financial-other-struggles-continue/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/01/06/guvs-support-of-hbcus-laudable-though-financial-other-struggles-continue/">challenges remain </a>for similar institutions.</p>
<p><strong>Fear not, Virginia, they&#8217;re just Democrats: </strong>The News &amp; Advance <a href="https://www.newsadvance.com/opinion/editorials/a-healthy-republic-always-is-changing-evolving/article_12a6455a-d108-53a5-a9c9-0b77105bb114.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.newsadvance.com/opinion/editorials/a-healthy-republic-always-is-changing-evolving/article_12a6455a-d108-53a5-a9c9-0b77105bb114.html">attempts to tamp down</a> some of the rhetoric and fear sweeping rural Virginia as the Democrats assume the mantle of power in Richmond.  &#8220;The commonwealth is becoming more urban and more ethnically diverse, and change can be unsettling to some folks,&#8221; the paper wrote. &#8220;A healthy democratic republic is always changing and evolving. It’s nothing to fear. When a republic stops listening to the people, stops changing and evolving … that’s when we should be concerned. But not now, not today.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Criminal justice reform:</strong> The Virginian-Pilot and Daily Press editorial board said the governor&#8217;s proposed criminal justice reform package <a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/opinion/vp-ed-editorial-criminal-justice-reform-0112-20200112-qhukaczfzjboxd2hskdfswrvta-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.pilotonline.com/opinion/vp-ed-editorial-criminal-justice-reform-0112-20200112-qhukaczfzjboxd2hskdfswrvta-story.html">is promising</a>: &#8220;If Northam and his allies can forge consensus — building a true bipartisan coalition for reform — this could prove to be the most consequential legislative achievement this year, a laudable use of the governor’s political capital.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Can the Dems keep it together? </strong>Gordon Morse, Pilot columnist and former speechwriter for Democratic Gov. Gerald Baliles, says the newly-in-power Democrats in Richmond <a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/opinion/columns/vp-ed-column-morse-0112-20200112-ngtmfjdhynewbfm3b7c5scaajy-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.pilotonline.com/opinion/columns/vp-ed-column-morse-0112-20200112-ngtmfjdhynewbfm3b7c5scaajy-story.html">need a dose of self-awareness</a>. &#8220;You cannot look at the state Capitol right now, with its frenetic levels of activity, manic &#8216;history&#8217; thumping and constant assertions of certitude, without conjecturing how long it will take before the wheels on the new Democratic Party jalopy — its shiny new, happy-to-be-here legislative majority — go flying off in all directions,&#8221; he wrote.</p>
<p><strong>Questioning protest policy: </strong>The Sun-Gazette <a href="https://www.insidenova.com/opinion/editorials/sun-gazette-editorial-no-such-thing-as-a-coincidence-in/article_1d5410d8-2ca1-11ea-884c-ff1b50610645.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.insidenova.com/opinion/editorials/sun-gazette-editorial-no-such-thing-as-a-coincidence-in/article_1d5410d8-2ca1-11ea-884c-ff1b50610645.html">questions the timing</a> of Fairfax&#8217;s new policy allowing students to skip school for activism. &#8220;The start of the new free-range protesting policy comes just after the Jan. 24 &#8216;March for Life,&#8217; which will bring a huge crowd (including, one presumes, Fairfax students who hold a pro-life position) to Washington,&#8221; the paper wrote.</p>
<p><strong>Marijuana policy:</strong> Fairfax&#8217;s top prosecutor says he will no longer prosecute simple marijuana possession offenses. &#8220;Prosecuting adults for simple possession of marijuana does not improve community safety,&#8221; Democrat Steve Descano<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/local-opinions/i-wont-prosecute-adults-for-simple-possession-of-marijuana-its-only-fair/2020/01/10/9f13d5aa-31a0-11ea-91fd-82d4e04a3fac_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/local-opinions/i-wont-prosecute-adults-for-simple-possession-of-marijuana-its-only-fair/2020/01/10/9f13d5aa-31a0-11ea-91fd-82d4e04a3fac_story.html"> wrote in The Washington Post</a>. &#8220;In fact, such prosecutions can spur crime.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Ban cellphones while driving: </strong>The Pilot and Daily Press<a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/opinion/vp-ed-editorial-cell-hone-ban-0110-20200110-nlbdo6s7zzdjhbqknuwa6kd3xm-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.pilotonline.com/opinion/vp-ed-editorial-cell-hone-ban-0110-20200110-nlbdo6s7zzdjhbqknuwa6kd3xm-story.html">  support</a> the handheld cellphone ban that&#8217;s eluded lawmakers for years: &#8220;A law prohibiting drivers from using handheld cellphones, one that’s enforced and well publicized, could save a lot of lives.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Biden or bust?</strong> Writing in the Washington Post, Virginia talk radio commentator Norman Leahy has a take Democrats <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/01/09/joe-bidens-virginia-advantage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/01/09/joe-bidens-virginia-advantage/">might not want to hear </a>on recent polling showing Joe Biden is the only Democratic primary candidate with a lead over Trump in Virginia. &#8220;If Democrats nominate anyone other than Biden, then Virginia becomes a swing state again.&#8221;</p>

There isn’t one nationally — not from Trump and not from any of the Democrats, either. But at least Biden is telling the truth: Those workers need to figure out a new career plan.&#8221;</p>

(Ned Oliver/ Virginia Mercury)</p><p><br data-cke-eol="1" /><strong>Mercury commentary ICYMI:</strong> 2019 was quite the year for Virginia, and, through a wild 12 months, the Mercury helped you make sense of it all. I complied a list of some of our best news and opinion coverage <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/12/31/the-best-of-the-mercury-the-editors-picks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/12/31/the-best-of-the-mercury-the-editors-picks/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Jay Bookman, a columnist at the Georgia Recorder, an affiliate website, <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/01/03/climate-change-threat-doesnt-get-the-y2k-urgency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/01/03/climate-change-threat-doesnt-get-the-y2k-urgency/">noted that</a> climate change hasn&#8217;t gotten the urgent attention Y2K (remember that?) received at the end of the century. And, in a guest column, former Virginia State Air Pollution Control Board member Rebecca Rubin <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/01/03/the-time-has-come-congress-must-fully-fund-the-land-and-water-conservation-fund/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/01/03/the-time-has-come-congress-must-fully-fund-the-land-and-water-conservation-fund/">says it&#8217;s time</a> for Congress to fully fund the Land and Water Conservation Fund.</p>
<p><strong>Here comes the session</strong>: The Richmond Times-Dispatch urged lawmakers to continue making progress on improving transparency <a href="https://www.richmond.com/opinion/plus/editorial-let-the-sunshine-in/article_6332ea8a-c439-5a71-8c10-23a82c42f1ea.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.richmond.com/opinion/plus/editorial-let-the-sunshine-in/article_6332ea8a-c439-5a71-8c10-23a82c42f1ea.html">as the legislative session arrives</a> this week. The Roanoke Times noted that &#8220;the Democrats who will run the House of Delegates for at least the next two years — and the state Senate for the next four — bear scant resemblance to the Democrats of 1993,&#8221; <a href="https://www.roanoke.com/opinion/editorials/editorial-it-s-not-anymore/article_a79b1f52-733b-54d3-8e4a-0eeb822608cc.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.roanoke.com/opinion/editorials/editorial-it-s-not-anymore/article_a79b1f52-733b-54d3-8e4a-0eeb822608cc.html">the last time the party </a>held all the levers of state government.</p>
<p>With new gun restrictions looming, Times-Dispatch columnist Jeff Schapiro <a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/plus/gun-show-bustles-fear-of-democrats/article_eb31e4f4-aa25-5e3d-a12f-c9f33c8de4e5.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.richmond.com/news/plus/gun-show-bustles-fear-of-democrats/article_eb31e4f4-aa25-5e3d-a12f-c9f33c8de4e5.html">took the temperature</a> at a gun show in Richmond over the weekend: “&#8217;Fear — fear of Democrats,&#8217; one attendee told him when asked why so many people had turned out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Schapiro also shed some light on how the incoming Democratic majority might tweak the rules of the House: &#8220;One of the first bits of business for the House will be to adopt the rules by which it operates,&#8221;<a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/plus/schapiro-in-va-house-new-rules-of-engagement/article_c343c34c-e7a7-516c-88ce-2d2e51d8ab9d.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.richmond.com/news/plus/schapiro-in-va-house-new-rules-of-engagement/article_c343c34c-e7a7-516c-88ce-2d2e51d8ab9d.html"> he wrote</a>. &#8220;Democrats could ram them through with nary a Republican vote. But were they approved on a strong bipartisan vote, that would signal a potential for magnanimity rather than the usual tyranny of the majority.&#8221;</p>
<p>The RTD <a href="https://www.richmond.com/opinion/plus/editorial-virginia-needs-a-statewide-ban-on-using-handheld-cellphones/article_f4ee60b2-653e-5fdb-b3b1-d3bd78253215.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.richmond.com/opinion/plus/editorial-virginia-needs-a-statewide-ban-on-using-handheld-cellphones/article_f4ee60b2-653e-5fdb-b3b1-d3bd78253215.html">called for a ban</a> on handheld cell phones while driving. And, amid the yawning urban-rural divide, Virginian-Pilot columnist Gordon Morse advised everyone to &#8220;take a breath,&#8221; <a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/opinion/columns/vp-ed-column-morse-0105-20200105-mpjiicmjfne3hpouz6xyazryhe-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.pilotonline.com/opinion/columns/vp-ed-column-morse-0105-20200105-mpjiicmjfne3hpouz6xyazryhe-story.html">asking if </a>&#8220;we can act as if we’ve been doing representative government in Virginia for more than four centuries.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Free Lance-Star <a href="https://www.fredericksburg.com/opinion/editorial-keep-proportional-representation/article_1613eb01-b8dd-5ff8-844b-839d2cf507bc.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.fredericksburg.com/opinion/editorial-keep-proportional-representation/article_1613eb01-b8dd-5ff8-844b-839d2cf507bc.html">picked up the call</a> from Republicans to keep proportional representation on committees as Democrats take power: &#8220;There are risks in abandoning proportional committee representation. It would come across as mean-spirited, unnecessarily alienating a lot of voters, and put a partisan stamp on major legislation that should have both parties’ input and buy-in.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Redistricting:</strong> The admonitions to Democrats against backing off redistricting reform continue.</p>
<ul>
<li>Princeton University professor Sam Wang, writing in the RTD, <a href="https://www.richmond.com/opinion/columnists/sam-wang-column-virginia-was-home-to-the-first-gerrymander/article_c15435fa-6ba8-57eb-9464-cdf7b3847fbf.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.richmond.com/opinion/columnists/sam-wang-column-virginia-was-home-to-the-first-gerrymander/article_c15435fa-6ba8-57eb-9464-cdf7b3847fbf.html">says that since Virginia</a> was home to the first gerrymander, it should be home to a solution.</li>
<li>David Kerr, a VCU adjunct professor of political science, <a href="https://www.insidenova.com/opinion/columnists/kerr-democrats-in-virginia-need-to-fix-the-redistricting-process/article_a5ed428e-28d7-11ea-b5fc-af46b103f438.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.insidenova.com/opinion/columnists/kerr-democrats-in-virginia-need-to-fix-the-redistricting-process/article_a5ed428e-28d7-11ea-b5fc-af46b103f438.html">writing for insidenova.com, said</a> &#8220;it’s tough, when offered a possible guarantee of power for years, to turn it over almost immediately to a bipartisan commission.  &#8230; But, if representative democracy is to mean anything, then this is the right thing to do and now is the time to do it.&#8221;</li>
<li>The Virginian-Pilot and Daily Press also <a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/opinion/vp-ed-editorial-redistricting-0105-20200105-o2r4lk275ndmhazdv2hknwxmw4-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.pilotonline.com/opinion/vp-ed-editorial-redistricting-0105-20200105-o2r4lk275ndmhazdv2hknwxmw4-story.html">say the time is now</a>: &#8220;What’s clear is that the present system is profoundly broken, and Virginia is too close to real reform to allow that moment to pass.&#8221;</li>
<li>The News &amp; Advance: &#8220;<a href="https://www.godanriver.com/opinion/editorials/democrats-don-t-dare-to-gut-redistricting-reform/article_fa4b24fe-5da9-5147-b352-77436ace465c.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.godanriver.com/opinion/editorials/democrats-don-t-dare-to-gut-redistricting-reform/article_fa4b24fe-5da9-5147-b352-77436ace465c.html">Pass the amendment</a>, and give voters the final say in November. If they don’t, prepare to reap the whirlwind.&#8221;</li>

<p><strong>All hail the Space Force:</strong> RTD Deputy Opinions Editor Robin Beres, a retired Navy chief petty officer, welcomes Trump&#8217;s <a href="https://www.richmond.com/opinion/editorial/robin-beres-here-s-to-the-new-space-force/article_b86ed4f2-17f6-59ce-a3af-341e06856c3c.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.richmond.com/opinion/editorial/robin-beres-here-s-to-the-new-space-force/article_b86ed4f2-17f6-59ce-a3af-341e06856c3c.html">new military branch</a>: &#8220;And what about the uniforms? Will they be designed with a nod to stormtrooper chic or be just another run-of-the-mill camouflage-style uniform?&#8221;<br />
<strong><br />
Inside the pipeline case:</strong> <a href="https://www.dailyprogress.com/opinion/opinion-commentary-legal-details-could-have-big-effect-on-pipeline/article_a7c8455d-62ac-5486-9e5b-8f37ca58f49a.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.dailyprogress.com/opinion/opinion-commentary-legal-details-could-have-big-effect-on-pipeline/article_a7c8455d-62ac-5486-9e5b-8f37ca58f49a.html">Writing in The Daily Progress</a>, attorney Walker Richmond takes readers through the legal arcana at the heart of a Supreme Court case that could decide the fate of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline.</p>
<p><strong>Mourning a colleague:</strong> The News &amp; Advance mourned the loss of a young reporter who died in a car crash. &#8220;Like many in our newsroom, she felt called to journalism,&#8221; <a href="https://www.newsadvance.com/opinion/editorials/losing-one-of-our-own-at-the-n-a/article_f76a562d-2daf-5224-967b-4c3dae27c99c.html#tncms-source=infinity-scroll-summary-siderail-latest" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.newsadvance.com/opinion/editorials/losing-one-of-our-own-at-the-n-a/article_f76a562d-2daf-5224-967b-4c3dae27c99c.html#tncms-source=infinity-scroll-summary-siderail-latest">the paper wrote</a>. &#8220;She delighted in doing this work for the community and in the relationships she formed in her work. She had a bright future ahead of her.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Remember that impeachment thing?</strong> The inimitable Winchester Star <a href="https://www.winchesterstar.com/winchester_star/editorial-pelosi-and-the-articles-are-republicans-losing-interest/article_33300534-4a43-5348-bc57-b19c3c3fb0c4.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.winchesterstar.com/winchester_star/editorial-pelosi-and-the-articles-are-republicans-losing-interest/article_33300534-4a43-5348-bc57-b19c3c3fb0c4.html">hasn&#8217;t forgotten about it</a>: &#8220;The solons of our nation return to the fetid shores of the Potomac next week — and to the burning question, of course, of what House Speaker Nancy Pelosi plans to do with her treasured articles of impeachment.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Questioning the carbon tax: </strong>Former journalist and lobbyist Steve Haner, now a fellow at the conservative Thomas Jefferson Institute for Public Policy, <a href="https://www.roanoke.com/opinion/commentary/haner-do-we-really-need-a-carbon-car-tax/article_2813dd3b-3c7b-5136-97b7-03dcb280f7d4.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.roanoke.com/opinion/commentary/haner-do-we-really-need-a-carbon-car-tax/article_2813dd3b-3c7b-5136-97b7-03dcb280f7d4.html">questions the Northam administration&#8217;s transportation carbon reduction plans</a>. &#8220;The economic case is weak and the potential environmental benefits unmeasurably small,&#8221; he wrote in The Roanoke Times. &#8220;Advocates won’t be satisfied with a mere 25 percent reduction by 2032.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Vehicle inspections: </strong>The Danville Register &amp; Bee <a href="https://www.godanriver.com/opinion/editorials/vehicle-inspections-save-lives/article_7a7072d6-f23b-5919-93f0-76a726548b86.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.godanriver.com/opinion/editorials/vehicle-inspections-save-lives/article_7a7072d6-f23b-5919-93f0-76a726548b86.html">says the governor&#8217;s proposal</a> to end vehicle inspections is &#8220;a bad idea that should be killed immediately.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><em>Letter of the week</em>:</strong> &#8220;America! What a country!

Gov. Justin Fairfax is surrounded by members of the media in February in the Capitol. (Ned Oliver/ Virginia Mercury)</p><p>Yes, Virginia, we had ourselves a year.</p>
<p>From the<a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/02/04/a-turbulent-weekend-in-virginia-politics-got-rougher-monday/" target="_blank"> executive branch scandals</a> in the beginning of the 2019 General Assembly session — which came on the heels of a conservative furor over a<a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/01/30/failed-legislation-loosening-restrictions-on-late-term-abortions-which-are-already-legal-in-some-cases-in-virginia-ignites-furor/" target="_blank"> failed abortion bill</a> mentioned by President Donald Trump in his State of the Union address — to the Virginia Beach mass shooting,<a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/07/09/special-session-on-guns-a-big-crowd-a-quick-adjournment-a-post-election-punt-and-a-confusing-charade/" target="_blank"> the debate on gun policy</a> it unleashed and the November elections that delivered <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/11/06/virginia-democrats-win-control-of-general-assembly-sealing-trump-era-power-shift/" target="_blank">a seismic shift</a> in power here, there was no shortage of national attention coming our way in 2019.</p>
<p>In hundreds of news articles and commentary pieces, the Mercury was here to help you make sense of it all. Here&#8217;s a selection of some of the work that I think best exemplifies what we&#8217;re all about. I&#8217;m very proud of our small staff and roster of contributors and I&#8217;ll hope you&#8217;ll stick with us as a go-to source of news and opinion on state government and policy as we head into 2020.</p>
<h2><strong>GOVERNMENT AND THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY</strong></h2>
<p>A big part of what we do is attempt to make the intricacies of state government accessible, engaging and understandable. It&#8217;s why we have a semi-regular feature called <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/category/governmentpolitics/virginia-explained/" target="_blank">Virginia Explained</a> to elucidate policy debates. Articles like this one by Ned Oliver on how the House of Delegates&#8217; subcommittee system bottles up debate and kills legislation was a prime example of that approach.</p>

<p>Often, reporters who spend a lot of time covering the Capitol start to take intractable issues as a given. We didn&#8217;t want to fall into that rut. Many lawmakers and health care and hospital lobbyists grimace when they hear &#8220;certificate of public need.&#8221; But Katie O&#8217;Connor took the time to explain why the rest of us should educate ourselves about the high-stakes argument.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s usually more than meets the eye to the machinations of the General Assembly. Aided by a FOIA request, Ned Oliver pulled back the covers on Republicans&#8217; stonewalling of an appointee by Gov. Ralph Northam to lead the Department of Professional and Occupational Regulation. It came amid a GOP senator&#8217;s battle against the department on behalf of contractors who also happened to be campaign donors.</p>

<h2><strong>PEOPLE, POLICY, CHILDREN &amp; FAMILIES</strong></h2>
<p>Ultimately, we always strive to keep the people affected by the policy made in Richmond at the forefront of our coverage. This piece on the<a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/02/08/a-proper-hand-as-advocates-push-for-prosthetic-device-coverage-legislation-sent-to-commission-for-review/" target="_blank"> importance of coverage for prosthetic devices</a> for the people who need them, and another on <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/01/14/waiting-for-help-developmental-disability-advocates-push-for-funding-to-meet-an-ever-growing-need/" target="_blank">the numbing wait</a> for state support by families with children with severe developmental disabilities, both by Katie O&#8217;Connor, illustrate that approach. Katie also led the state in covering some of the severe shortcomings in Virginia&#8217;s foster care system, shining a light, for instance, on the lack of state support for kinship care families, which advocates credit with bringing some much-needed state attention to the matter.</p>

<p>Virginia&#8217;s sky high numbers of evictions — and what policy prescriptions might reduce them — were also a major topic in 2019. But while that debate usually relied on numbers, Ned Oliver&#8217;s profile on one woman&#8217;s battle with her landlord revealed the ugly reality of the power dynamic that often leaves tenants holding the short end of the stick.</p>

<h2><strong>ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENT</strong></h2>
<p>As former environmental reporter myself, it&#8217;s hard to limit myself to just a few of the pieces Sarah Vogelsong has done for us since she joined us full-time in June, filling a crucial gap in coverage of energy and environmental issues in Virginia. Climate change, of course, is affecting us all. But Sarah&#8217;s maintained a steady focus on explaining how thoroughly it will change life here in so many ways in these two pieces.</p>

<h2><strong>POLITICS</strong></h2>
<p>There&#8217;s a reason the &#8220;Virginia Way &#8220;is as often mocked as it is celebrated. As Graham Moomaw pointed out last month, activity that will probably land a U.S. congressman in prison is perfectly legal here. &#8220;That means Virginia campaigns don’t have to be meticulous about making sure candidates don’t use their political account — often filled by business interests and wealthy donors — as a personal piggy bank,&#8221; he wrote.</p>

<p>What&#8217;s a party to do when some of its members want to swear off corporate donations but it also needs lots of cash to win an election? That&#8217;s the tension Ned Oliver found during a visit to the Homestead in Bath County, where Virginia Democrats were engaged in a retreat with lobbyists and donors. &#8220;Gross but mandatory – that’s pretty much how I feel about this event,” said Del. Lee Carter, D-Manassas. Ned also profiled Michael Bills, the man who has become Virginia&#8217;s biggest donor,<a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/10/21/a-multi-millionaire-set-out-to-counter-dominion-now-hes-the-states-biggest-campaign-donor/" target="_blank"> here</a>.</p>

<h2><strong>GUNS</strong></h2>
<p>The massacre in May at a Virginia Beach municipal building pushed the state into a debate on guns that will continue into 2020 with Democrats in control of the General Assembly.</p>
<p>This piece by Mechelle Hankerson, reporting from her hometown in the wake of the killings, really captured the raw emotion and emerging political consequences of the shooting.</p>

<p>This profile by Ned Oliver on Sen. John Edwards, the last Democrat endorsed by the National Rifle Association in Virginia, showed just how much the landscape on gun regulation here had shifted.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s taken as an article of faith by some gun-control advocates that the NRA&#8217;s money is what makes new restrictions so tough to pass. But, as Mechelle Hankerson uncovered in this piece, it&#8217;s simply not that simple.</p>

<h2><strong>EDUCATION</strong></h2>
<p>Seeing a gap in statewide K-12 and higher education coverage, Mechelle Hankerson has really pushed to fill it with some great coverage of low teacher pay, the legacy of segregation, whether school systems are set up to handle an influx of non-English speakers and the cost of college, among many others. A few highlights:</p>

<h2><strong>THE OTHER VIRGINIA</strong></h2>
<p>We&#8217;re based in Richmond, but we realize there&#8217;s so much more to Virginia than its urban crescent. That&#8217;s why we try to bring you stories from other parts of the state, like Ned Oliver&#8217;s deep dive on Bristol&#8217;s marijuana and gambling gambit.</p>

<p>Mason Adams, a regular Mercury contributor based in Floyd, also helps us bring you stories from Southwest Virginia, like this look at the Democrats&#8217; bid to convert rural voters.</p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>Today&#8217;s a day for countdowns and retrospectives, so as we slide into a new decade, here&#8217;s a look at the Mercury stories that pulled in the most readers in 2019.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to anticipate how far and fast a story will spread once it&#8217;s sucked into the digital maelstrom, and there are slithering snakes, kazoos, guns, Elon Musk&#8217;s tunnel, idle aircraft carriers and marijuana policy among the eclectic bunch.</p>
<h2><strong>No. 10: Virginia&#8217;s &#8220;bridge to nowhere&#8221;</strong></h2>
<p>In May, <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/05/19/next-year-virginias-100m-bridge-to-nowhere-will-finally-connect-to-a-road/" target="_blank">Ned Oliver brought us the story</a> of Virginia&#8217;s very own &#8220;bridge to nowhere,&#8221; which also happens to be the tallest bridge in the state. For years after it was built, the Grassy Creek Bridge in Buchanan County on the Kentucky border was unconnected to any open roads on either side of the state line. But at long last, the bridge was finally linked to a working road. “I don’t understand how they started it that way, but it was what it was,” said former Virginia Transportation Secretary Aubrey Layne.</p>

<h2><strong>No. 9: Spare the snakes</strong></h2>
<p>Mercury contributor Rex Springston, a longtime Virginia environmental reporter, <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/05/02/spare-the-snakes-know-these-six-species/" target="_blank">also had a springtime hit</a> with his admonishment to take it easy on the mostly harmless reptiles waking up from their winter naps. &#8220;Spring is so wonderful — blooming flowers, singing birds and visits from our friends, the snakes,&#8221; he wrote. &#8220;Snakes and people tend to surprise each other, sometimes with tragic results – usually for the snake.&#8221;</p>
<h2><strong>No. 8: When the &#8216;law-abiding&#8217; won&#8217;t abide the law</strong></h2>
<p>Like much of our coverage on gun policy, <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/12/04/law-abiding-gun-owners-say-they-wont-abide-any-new-laws/" target="_blank">a column I wrote</a> on the irony implicit in the &#8220;Second Amendment sanctuary&#8221; movement being propelled by so-called law abiding gun owners in Virginia after the November elections and the promise of new gun control legislation was among the Mercury&#8217;s most-read pieces of the year. &#8220;Gun rights groups aren’t doing themselves or their members any favors,&#8221; I opined. &#8220;Despite their ability to flood county and city meeting chambers with delusional people who are convinced their 30-round magazines and AR-15s are the only thing standing between the citizenry and a tyrannical federal government, they are actually in the minority.&#8221;</p>
<h2><strong>No. 7: Will Virginia legalize it? </strong></h2>
<p>A month before the November elections that shifted control of the General Assembly, Graham Moomaw took a look at<a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/10/17/a-democratic-takeover-could-make-virginia-more-marijuana-friendly-but-legalization-may-still-be-years-away/" target="_blank"> how far and fast Virginia might move on marijuana policy</a>. &#8220;If Democrats win full control of the statehouse next month by gaining four seats, Virginia would enter unknown territory on marijuana policy, with new faces at the helm of legislative committees that have resisted sweeping change,&#8221; he wrote.</p>
<h2><strong>No. 6: No more guns at the Capitol?</strong></h2>
<p>Graham also broke the news that the new Democratic majority <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/12/19/incoming-va-house-speaker-says-democrats-are-considering-a-capitol-gun-ban-for-2020-session/" target="_blank">is weighing </a>a Capitol Square gun ban. &#8220;A no-guns rule could be significant for the crowds expected to fill the Capitol as Democrats take up numerous gun-control proposals, including universal background checks, an assault weapons ban and a red flag law,&#8221; he reported.</p>
<figure id="attachment_5419" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:1920px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/house-gun-hearing-3.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-5419" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/house-gun-hearing-3.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1280" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/house-gun-hearing-3.jpg 1920w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/house-gun-hearing-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/house-gun-hearing-3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/house-gun-hearing-3-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/house-gun-hearing-3-696x464.jpg 696w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/house-gun-hearing-3-1068x712.jpg 1068w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/house-gun-hearing-3-630x420.jpg 630w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  An attendee at a committee hearing in the General Assembly wears a gun in his belt.

<h2><strong>No. 5: Carriers sit idle in Virginia</strong></h2>
<p>Having a D.C. bureau, which we share with other States Newsroom outlets, helps us get federal answers to local questions, like what&#8217;s up with all those aircraft carriers sitting in port in Virginia? <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/11/18/most-u-s-aircraft-carriers-sit-idle-in-virginia-ports/" target="_blank">Allison Winter reported that</a> more than half of the nation’s aircraft carriers are not currently ready for deployment, &#8220;as the massive ships sit along the Virginia coastline in various states of repair or testing.&#8221;</p>

<h2><strong>No. 4: Gun sanctuary movement sweeps state</strong></h2>
<p>Graham Moomaw was at the Amherst County Board of Board of Supervisors meeting in November, just before it became one of scores of Virginia localities to pass some version <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/11/20/were-going-to-have-to-defend-ourselves-after-democratic-victories-rural-virginia-counties-rush-to-declare-themselves-gun-sanctuaries/" target="_blank">of a gun &#8220;sanctuary&#8221; declaration</a> being pushed by pro-gun groups in the wake of the Democratic victories in the legislative elections.</p>
<figure id="attachment_13114" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:1920px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Hands.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" id="longdesc-return-13114" class="wp-image-13114 size-full" tabindex="-1" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Hands.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1440" longdesc="https://www.virginiamercury.com?longdesc=13114&amp;referrer=13893" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Hands.jpg 1920w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Hands-300x225.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Hands-768x576.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Hands-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Hands-80x60.jpg 80w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Hands-265x198.jpg 265w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Hands-696x522.jpg 696w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Hands-1068x801.jpg 1068w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Hands-560x420.jpg 560w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Amherst County residents raise their hands to show support for their county&#8217;s &#8220;Second Amendment Sanctuary&#8221; resolution.

<p>&#8220;The time is coming,” said Jeff Wade, an assistant pastor at a Baptist church in Madison Heights. “I’m mighty afraid that we’re going to have to defend ourselves because of what we believe in. Not only on the Second Amendment, but on any other issue that the government declares to be right, but God declares to be wrong.”</p>
<h2><strong>No. 3: Unimpressed with Elon</strong></h2>
<p>Ned Oliver pulled this <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/03/21/virginia-transit-officials-drove-through-elon-musks-tunnel-they-say-theyll-stick-with-railways-and-roads/" target="_blank">nugget of news</a> from the Commonwealth Transportation Board&#8217;s proceedings: &#8220;Virginia transit officials flew out to California earlier this year to check out a tunnel dug by Elon Musk’s Boring Company and, well, they think the state should stick with traditional railways and roads for now.&#8221;</p>

<h2><strong>No. 2: Getting an answer on assault weapons</strong></h2>
<p>Graham Moomaw was able to nail down Gov. Ralph Northam and Sen. Dick Saslaw about the proposed assault weapon ban legislation that was fueling much of the gun sanctuary push. <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/12/09/northam-backed-assault-weapon-bill-will-include-grandfather-clause-for-existing-guns/" target="_blank">He broke the news</a> that the administration would include a provision allowing Virginians to keep firearms they already have.</p>

<p>The headline <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/metalheads-with-kazoos-drown-out-westboro-baptist-church-at-capitol/" target="_blank">probably made it irresistible</a>. &#8220;Metalheads with kazoos drown out Westboro Baptist Church at Capitol&#8221; was the Mercury&#8217;s most-read post of the year, drawing hundreds of thousands of page views and picked up by numerous other outlets and websites. Ned Oliver wandered up the street to cover the demonstration by the hate group and counter-protest organized by Richmond-based metal singer Randy Blythe of Lamb of God, intended to stick up for Del. Danica Roem, D-Prince William, who was singled out by Westboro for being transgender.</p>
<p>“These people are coming out and speaking a bunch of ignorance about my friend,” Blythe said. “I don’t like that. So we came out and just drowned them out. That’s the easiest way. There’s no point in engaging these people.&#8221;</p>

Robert E. Lee that is located inside the US Capitol August 17, 2017 in Washington, DC. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) called for the removal of all Confederate statues from the United States Capitol.  (Photo by Mark Wilson/Getty Images)</p><p>Gov. Ralph Northam&#8217;s office says he will push for legislation creating a process to replace a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee in the National Statuary Hall Collection in the U.S. Capitol in Washington.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is something the governor and his team have been working on for several months,&#8221; said a spokeswoman for Northam, Alena Yarmosky. &#8220;The governor&#8217;s office has already filed a bill-drafting request for legislation addressing this topic.&#8221;</p>
<p>U.S. Reps. Don McEachin, D-Richmond, and Jennifer Wexton, D-Leesburg, wrote Northam <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Wexton-McEachin-Letter-1.pdf" target="_blank">a letter dated Dec. 20</a> asking him to make a statue to replace Lee part of his agenda for the 2020 General Assembly session that starts next month.</p>
<p>&#8220;As Virginians, we have a responsibility to not only learn from but also confront our history,&#8221; they wrote. &#8220;We must strive for a more complete telling of history by raising up the voice, stories and memories of minorities and people of color.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yarmosky said the governor&#8217;s office had previously discussed the statue with McEachin and Wexton &#8220;and we look forward to continuing to work with them and all others who are committed to making Virginia open, inclusive and equitable.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Lee statue in the U.S. Capitol was donated by Virginia<a href="https://www.aoc.gov/art/national-statuary-hall-collection/robert-e-lee" target="_blank"> in 1909</a>. During that era, McEachin and Wexton said, such statues &#8220;aimed to rewrite Lee&#8217;s reputation from that of a cruel slave owner and Confederate general to portraying him as a kind man and reluctant war hero who selflessly served his home state of Virginia.&#8221;</p>
<p>They said the statue&#8217;s placement in the U.S. Capitol Crypt, &#8220;a prominent location that is displayed to almost every tour group that visits the U.S. Capitol,&#8221; serves as a &#8220;prevalent reminder of Virginia&#8217;s disturbing racial  legacy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alabama and Florida have each removed statues honoring Confederate officers and Florida and Arkansas are adding statues depicting Civil Rights activists, the letter notes.</p>
<p>Wexton and McEachin suggested statues of Nat Turner, who led a slave rebellion, educator Booker T. Washington, pioneering businesswoman Maggie Walker, NAACP attorney Oliver Hill and Barbara Johns, who led a student walkout in Farmville and helped launch the fight against school segregation, as potential replacements.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are countless commendable Virginians who would better represent our Commonwealth in the U.S. Capitol than a Confederate general,&#8221; they wrote. The replacement process calls for authorizing legislation to be passed by the General Assembly and signed by the governor, then communicated to the office of the Architect of the Capitol, which is responsible for the buildings and grounds on Capitol Hill, the letter says.</p>
<p>Northam has also said <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/relaxed-and-reflective-gov-ralph-northam-reflects-on-scandal-charged-year/2019/12/18/a1c09ca2-21ba-11ea-bed5-880264cc91a9_story.html" target="_blank">he&#8217;d sign a law</a> allow Virginia localities to take down Confederate monuments.</p>
<p>Yarmosky said more details will be announced when the governor&#8217;s office rolls out Northam&#8217;s legislative agenda.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle inspections: </strong>The Richmond Times-Dispatch says Gov. Ralph Northam&#8217;s proposal to get rid of vehicle inspections <a href="https://www.richmond.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-state-inspections-promote-road-safety/article_694eb76a-c0aa-530c-87ad-3e808eea4878.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.richmond.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-state-inspections-promote-road-safety/article_694eb76a-c0aa-530c-87ad-3e808eea4878.html">is a bad idea</a>.  &#8220;Just because other states don’t put a premium on safety doesn’t mean that Virginia should follow suit.</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; <a href="https://www.dailyprogress.com/opinion/opinion-editorial-in-budget-mixed-message-from-tax-regulation-proposals/article_7568a8d8-7ed9-57c0-8375-bbff2ae989a5.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.dailyprogress.com/opinion/opinion-editorial-in-budget-mixed-message-from-tax-regulation-proposals/article_7568a8d8-7ed9-57c0-8375-bbff2ae989a5.html">was the reaction</a> from The Daily Progress: &#8220;The proposal to drop inspections requires more discussion in Virginia — if not a study of our own — to make sure it does not endanger the public. Before they allow their legislators to approve any such change, Virginians should be fully confident that it will not put them at increased risk of death, injury and costly property damage.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Impeachment: </strong>A &#8220;bellicose personality, disdain for political decorum and inclination to use divisive and profane language.&#8221; Not Trump, though. <a href="https://www.richmond.com/opinion/columnists/charles-f-bryan-jr-column-our-first-presidential-impeachment/article_6641d997-615d-52cb-8602-eb602218f9dd.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.richmond.com/opinion/columnists/charles-f-bryan-jr-column-our-first-presidential-impeachment/article_6641d997-615d-52cb-8602-eb602218f9dd.html">Historian Charles Bryan</a> looks at the administration of Andrew Johnson, the first president to be impeached, in the RTD.

<p><strong>Higher ed</strong>: The Free Lance-Star says professors focused on income inequality <a href="https://www.fredericksburg.com/opinion/editorial-economic-inequality-in-state-government/article_94862d2d-c7c4-5aec-bd63-db00303d6f74.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.fredericksburg.com/opinion/editorial-economic-inequality-in-state-government/article_94862d2d-c7c4-5aec-bd63-db00303d6f74.html">should consider their bosses first</a>. &#8220;Of the top 25 highest-paid state employees, 18 are employed by Virginia’s state colleges and universities. So academics who bemoan economic inequality in our society should take a harder look at their own state-supported institutions.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Virginia politics:</strong> How did the GOP fall so far so fast? &#8220;Part of the answer rests in the GOP going &#8216;Super Rural&#8217; with its messaging and white male culture while Virginia trends &#8216;Super Suburban&#8217; with more women and minorities taking active political roles in growing suburbs,&#8221; <a href="https://www.roanoke.com/opinion/commentary/gibson-republicans-go-super-rural-democrats-super-suburban/article_fd34aa89-1272-52e8-baa7-0ff5e8f8e84d.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.roanoke.com/opinion/commentary/gibson-republicans-go-super-rural-democrats-super-suburban/article_fd34aa89-1272-52e8-baa7-0ff5e8f8e84d.html">wrote UVA&#8217;s Bob Gibson in The Roanoke Times</a>.  The Virginian-Pilot and the Daily Press call Northam&#8217;s proposed budget &#8220;an ambitious blueprint,&#8221; <a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/opinion/vp-ed-editorial-northam-budget-1222-20191222-etsbi3z6erbvjmi6fmq2vkabo4-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.pilotonline.com/opinion/vp-ed-editorial-northam-budget-1222-20191222-etsbi3z6erbvjmi6fmq2vkabo4-story.html">writing that </a>&#8220;it would be a miracle were the legislature to change party control and survive this session without some huge controversy involving taxes and/or spending.&#8221;</p>

<p>The News &amp; Advance says it&#8217;s time to &#8220;tone it down,&#8221;<a href="https://www.newsadvance.com/opinion/editorials/fellow-virginians-we-need-to-tone-it-down/article_5603082a-14d3-5ecd-9969-4b64ff8a690c.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.newsadvance.com/opinion/editorials/fellow-virginians-we-need-to-tone-it-down/article_5603082a-14d3-5ecd-9969-4b64ff8a690c.html"> particularly the rhetoric</a> around Second Amendment sanctuaries: &#8220;Fellow Americans — and that is what we all are … fellow Americans — we are on a dangerous path at this moment in history,&#8221; the paper wrote. The Register &amp; Bee penned a strong call for <a href="https://www.godanriver.com/opinion/editorials/clean-up-va-campaign-regulations/article_6405b23f-f044-5cb8-98e3-24ae0643f7e2.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.godanriver.com/opinion/editorials/clean-up-va-campaign-regulations/article_6405b23f-f044-5cb8-98e3-24ae0643f7e2.html">campaign finance reform</a>: &#8220;Anyone who believes Virginia politics are as pure as the driven snow is deluding himself. A pretty facade known for decades as &#8216;The Virginia Way&#8217; creates the perception that politics is done differently in the Old Dominion.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>&#8216;Twas the night before session</strong>: RTD columnist Jeff Schapiro<a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/plus/schapiro-a-yuletide-visit-to-northam/article_cedc3d3d-0699-57bb-9fde-64d9c77ad88a.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.richmond.com/news/plus/schapiro-a-yuletide-visit-to-northam/article_cedc3d3d-0699-57bb-9fde-64d9c77ad88a.html"> reworks the old poem</a> with Gov. Ralph Northam as the main character: &#8220;Democratic majorities meant Republicans were done/ Still, Northam worried that January wouldn’t be fun/ After all, he was a centrist, a Democrat neither left nor right/ And as a politico, Northam liked to get things done, not get in a fight.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>The carol that saved Christmas:</strong> Writing at InsideNova.com, VCU instructor and former Stafford School Board member David Kerr says Charles Dickens&#8217; famous story <a href="https://www.insidenova.com/opinion/columnists/kerr-did-charles-dickens-save-christmas/article_16f3e65c-202e-11ea-8eeb-8f4b9ca8a8bf.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.insidenova.com/opinion/columnists/kerr-did-charles-dickens-save-christmas/article_16f3e65c-202e-11ea-8eeb-8f4b9ca8a8bf.html">may have saved Christmas from the Industrial Revolution</a>. &#8220;He had tapped a longing in his readers that most people didn’t even know was there. It was a desire to reestablish a tie to another time, to find some of the connection to the past, and some of the joy of the Christmas season that had faded away.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Death penalty:</strong> Writing in the RTD, Keith Harward, wrongfully convicted of rape and murder, says mistakes made in cases like his <a href="https://www.richmond.com/opinion/columnists/keith-harward-column-innocence-reason-enough-to-abolish-the-death/article_27522f49-4864-57d2-b2a5-b83c235203ad.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.richmond.com/opinion/columnists/keith-harward-column-innocence-reason-enough-to-abolish-the-death/article_27522f49-4864-57d2-b2a5-b83c235203ad.html">are reason enough</a> to get rid of capital punishment. &#8220;If I had been sentenced to death back in 1986, the commonwealth would have executed me in the 1990s along with 65 other men. And no one would have ever known that I was innocent.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><em>LETTER OF THE WEEK:</em></strong> It&#8217;s getting scary out there. &#8220;If law enforcement officers try to enforce the new gun laws, a large force of patriots in Virginia and from other states will meet law enforcement officers with this threat,&#8221; David Curtis of Culpeper <a href="https://www.starexponent.com/opinion/letter-gun-owners-need-to-pray-for-guidance-write-to/article_cc2a075f-11a4-56d6-8574-7ac73506fd8a.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.starexponent.com/opinion/letter-gun-owners-need-to-pray-for-guidance-write-to/article_cc2a075f-11a4-56d6-8574-7ac73506fd8a.html">wrote to the Star-Exponent</a>, calling for gun owners to pray for no new restrictions. &#8220;1861 was the last time a tyrannical government threatened with force the patriots of Virginia. Have we learned anything since then?&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Mercury commentary ICYMI:</strong> In a guest op-ed, Kim Bobo, executive director of the Virginia Interfaith Center for Public Policy, looked forward to the policy balance in traditionally pro-business Virginia <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/12/13/worker-rights-are-returning-to-virginia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/12/13/worker-rights-are-returning-to-virginia/">shifting back toward workers</a> during this General Assembly session.</p>
<p>Mercury columnist Bob Lewis explored how much the &#8220;Second Amendment sanctuary&#8221; push <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/12/09/will-second-amendment-sanctuaries-test-authority-of-virginia-government/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/12/09/will-second-amendment-sanctuaries-test-authority-of-virginia-government/">might test the authority</a> of state government. In a reader response, Kyle Shreve, executive director of Virginia Agribusiness Council, <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/reader-response-biomass-continues-to-be-an-important-renewable-energy-source-for-the-commonwealth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/reader-response-biomass-continues-to-be-an-important-renewable-energy-source-for-the-commonwealth/">picked some bones</a> with Ivy Main&#8217;s take on biomass.</p>
<p>Dr. Harry Gewanter <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/12/10/quest-for-a-quick-fix-on-surprise-medical-bills-could-make-problem-worse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/12/10/quest-for-a-quick-fix-on-surprise-medical-bills-could-make-problem-worse/">warned against</a> making the cure for surprise medical bills worse than the disease. <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/12/12/what-the-roman-senates-grovelling-before-emperors-explains-about-gop-senators-support-for-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/12/12/what-the-roman-senates-grovelling-before-emperors-explains-about-gop-senators-support-for-trump/">And in a piece</a> that first appeared in The Conversation, classics professor Timothy Joseph drew parallels between the supine Senate of Imperial Rome and the American version in the age of Trump.</p>
<p><strong>Second Amendment sanctuaries:</strong> Michael Paul Williams of the Richmond Times-Dispatch <a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/plus/williams-henrico-s-board-faced-an-angry-crowd-asking-for/article_d3f80fc2-5153-511f-a154-7b29fb998792.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.richmond.com/news/plus/williams-henrico-s-board-faced-an-angry-crowd-asking-for/article_d3f80fc2-5153-511f-a154-7b29fb998792.html">blasted Henrico County </a>for yielding, if only in half-hearted fashion, to demands to have the county join the club. &#8220;In pandering to an angry crowd demanding a Second Amendment sanctuary, the Henrico County Board of Supervisors opted for banality and redundancy over common sense.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Roanoke Times<a href="https://www.roanoke.com/opinion/editorials/editorial-why-democrats-should-visit-a-second-amendment-sanctuary/article_58dcfd21-7ca6-54e2-9d83-2ba44c097dde.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.roanoke.com/opinion/editorials/editorial-why-democrats-should-visit-a-second-amendment-sanctuary/article_58dcfd21-7ca6-54e2-9d83-2ba44c097dde.html"> encouraged Democrats</a>, whose new, &#8220;remarkably insular&#8221; leadership is dominated by Northern Virginians, to visit one of the so-called sanctuaries. &#8220;Not because it will change their minds about passing new gun laws. And not because it will change the mind of gun-rights advocates, either,&#8221; the paper wrote. &#8220;They’ll get a better sense of the depth of feeling about guns that exists across rural Virginia (and parts of non-rural Virginia, too).&#8221;</p>
<p>The RTD&#8217;s Jeff Schapiro <a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/plus/schapiro-gun-decrees-are-va-s-version-of-n-c/article_3a5a0d15-2c47-5fa2-b3a9-cf1aecfaaac5.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.richmond.com/news/plus/schapiro-gun-decrees-are-va-s-version-of-n-c/article_3a5a0d15-2c47-5fa2-b3a9-cf1aecfaaac5.html">made comparisons</a> to North Carolina&#8217;s infamous &#8220;bathroom bill&#8221; and the boycotts it spawned. “That’s the trumping effect of business,” one local official told him. &#8220;If it’s going to cost us jobs, let’s back off.”</p>
<p>And The Virginian-Pilot <a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/opinion/vp-ed-editorial-second-amendment-1215-20191215-beniam6osraiphbzzq7k2l25mu-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.pilotonline.com/opinion/vp-ed-editorial-second-amendment-1215-20191215-beniam6osraiphbzzq7k2l25mu-story.html">said rhetoric around the movement</a>, including the Culpeper sheriff vowing to deputize &#8220;thousands&#8221; rather than enforce new laws, has been troubling.</p>
<p>&#8220;The proposals aren’t &#8216;unnecessary&#8217; according to Virginians who voted for lawmakers to adopt such measures. And deputizing a slew of folks to resist measures passed by a duly elected legislature sounds suspiciously like an uprising — and a rather unorthodox way to demonstrate trust in the rule of law.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Rumors of War&#8221;</strong>: The unveiling of the much-anticipated response by artist Kehinde Wiley to Richmond&#8217;s Confederate statues drew much fanfare, even if the tarp didn&#8217;t exactly come off without a hitch.</p>
<p>The Richmond Times-Dispatch<a href="https://www.richmond.com/opinion/plus/editorial-rumors-of-war-builds-upon-history/article_aff81503-7f04-5a96-87c7-1969ecf5d69a.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.richmond.com/opinion/plus/editorial-rumors-of-war-builds-upon-history/article_aff81503-7f04-5a96-87c7-1969ecf5d69a.html"> said it</a> &#8220;blends the past and the present as it looks forward to the future and a changing Richmond.&#8221;  Williams, the paper&#8217;s veteran columnist, <a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/local/williams-years-of-history-doesn-t-sweep-away-with-rumors/article_06db8228-8f3c-5dec-ac76-991f6661af39.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.richmond.com/news/local/williams-years-of-history-doesn-t-sweep-away-with-rumors/article_06db8228-8f3c-5dec-ac76-991f6661af39.html">riffed on the difficulty</a> in getting the cover off: &#8220;You don’t sweep away 400 years of grimy history with the tug of a string. In Virginia, the birthplace of Massive Resistance, the past concedes nothing to the present or future without putting up a fight.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Redistricting:</strong> The RTD&#8217;s Jeff Schapiro<a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/plus/schapiro-on-redistricting-democrats-turning-a-win-into-a-loss/article_8ee1dcf8-f411-5ba0-99e7-18d634222ef0.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.richmond.com/news/plus/schapiro-on-redistricting-democrats-turning-a-win-into-a-loss/article_8ee1dcf8-f411-5ba0-99e7-18d634222ef0.html"> compared Democrats </a>waffling on redistricting to &#8220;congressional Republicans in Washington complaining about the impeachment of President Donald Trump: Recognizing that the facts may be unfavorable, they yowl that the process is flawed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Del. Mark Levine, a Democrat representing Alexandria and parts of Arlington and Fairfax, said the proposed constitutional amendment creating a new process for drawing districts that will come before the General Assembly again next month &#8220;would allow the dead hand of the past to reconstitute itself forever, with little possibility of ever being uprooted again&#8221; <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/local-opinions/why-i-oppose-a-partisan-judicial-virginia-gerrymander/2019/12/11/000777c8-1b9d-11ea-87f7-f2e91143c60d_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/local-opinions/why-i-oppose-a-partisan-judicial-virginia-gerrymander/2019/12/11/000777c8-1b9d-11ea-87f7-f2e91143c60d_story.html">because disputes will be resolved by the conservative state Supreme Court</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Should the partisan appointees of an illegally constituted legislative body control Virginia forevermore?&#8221; he wrote in The Washington Post.  &#8220;We should never rush to amend our Constitution. After all, the goal is not to do some thing about gerrymandering but to do the right thing.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Scooter suits:</strong> An insurance agency rep, writing in The Roanoke Times, <a href="https://www.roanoke.com/opinion/commentary/griffith-electric-scooters----what-s-the-risk/article_05c930aa-de6d-51af-be3a-2a7c02df540b.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.roanoke.com/opinion/commentary/griffith-electric-scooters----what-s-the-risk/article_05c930aa-de6d-51af-be3a-2a7c02df540b.html">warns about those ubiquitous scooters</a> that have made their way to Roanoke and potential liability for riders: &#8220;What happens if the scooter rider hits and injures a pedestrian, damages someone’s property or causes a car accident? Who is responsible? Well, the scooter rider may be held responsible, and most insurance policies will not cover these expenses,&#8221; Rebecca Griffith wrote.</p>
<p><strong>Conservatives and climate change:</strong> Writing in the Staunton News Leader, guest columnist Stephen Nash <a href="https://www.newsleader.com/story/opinion/columnists/2019/11/25/conservatism-doesnt-mean-people-dont-believe-climate-change/4299760002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.newsleader.com/story/opinion/columnists/2019/11/25/conservatism-doesnt-mean-people-dont-believe-climate-change/4299760002/">crunches some numbers </a>on climate views in conservative areas. &#8220;What do folks around here believe about climate change? You may be surprised.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>More transparency please:</strong> <a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/opinion/vp-ed-editorial-transparency-virginia-1213-20191213-cxzxrgnsgjevlpsunsrnmbjtzu-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.pilotonline.com/opinion/vp-ed-editorial-transparency-virginia-1213-20191213-cxzxrgnsgjevlpsunsrnmbjtzu-story.html">The Pilot notes</a> that the General Assembly could do &#8220;much, much better when it comes to putting the General Assembly’s work within easy reach of the people it serves.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>The GOP in the wilderness</strong>: Writing in The Washington Post, Norman Leahy, a weekly commentator on WRVA radio and the Virginia Talk Radio Network, says Virginia Republicans&#8217; <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/12/11/virginia-gops-long-journey-out-wilderness-is-going-get-ugly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/12/11/virginia-gops-long-journey-out-wilderness-is-going-get-ugly/">new life in the minority could get ugly</a>. &#8220;The question is how the GOP will spend its time in the political wilderness and whether the result will look more like Rocky IV or The Donner Party,&#8221; he wrote. &#8220;Early indications lean heavily toward the latter.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Preserving a dark chapter in Virginia history:</strong> The News &amp; Advance, having conceded defeat in its fight to keep open some version of the Central Virginia Training Center, which, it notes, served &#8220;some of Virginia’s most severely intellectually and physically challenged residents,&#8221; says it&#8217;s also critically important to preserve the history of the site as the state and localities decide its future.</p>
<p>&#8220;CVTC was ground zero of the American eugenics movement in the late 1910s and 1920s,&#8221; the paper wrote in an editorial <a href="https://www.newsadvance.com/opinion/editorials/preserve-the-history-and-legacy-of-cvtc/article_c8c1170d-e44f-5100-bb8e-4a77c06909b4.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.newsadvance.com/opinion/editorials/preserve-the-history-and-legacy-of-cvtc/article_c8c1170d-e44f-5100-bb8e-4a77c06909b4.html">that recounts the chilling story</a> of Carrie Buck, a young woman who was forcibly sterilized after losing a legal case that went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>
<p>&#8220;The building in which Buck was operated on against her will still stands, empty and forlorn on an almost-deserted campus. It’s slowly rotting away and with it a chapter of Virginia and American history,&#8221; it says, adding that thousands of Virginians later shared Buck&#8217;s fate.  &#8220;Reading Virginia’s law and paying attention to Virginia’s actions was an Austrian veteran of World War I, living in the German city of Munich: Adolf Hitler.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Letter of the week</strong>: <a href="https://www.winchesterstar.com/winchester_star/letter-to-the-editor-have-you-no-shame-sir/article_1bf724fa-848a-5d5f-8d1a-064e2d123b55.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.winchesterstar.com/winchester_star/letter-to-the-editor-have-you-no-shame-sir/article_1bf724fa-848a-5d5f-8d1a-064e2d123b55.html">A frustrated reader lets fly</a> at the The Winchester Star&#8217;s pro-Trump editorial page. &#8220;Mr. O&#8217;Connor, have you no shame, sir? Your editorials and letters are biased so far right that they&#8217;re gonna topple over any day now, and you will be spitting ashes out of your mouth for many moons,&#8221; wrote David Locke of Winchester. &#8220;You need to sell your black soul and buy into a moral conscience, before the country and, yes, the world turn to nuclear dust. &#8230; P.S. I already know you don&#8217;t have the b&#8212;s to publish this. Your reputation is putrid.&#8221;</p>

(Ned Oliver/ Virginia Mercury)</p><p>Virginia was among three states that showed marked improvement in public health from 2018 to 2019, according to a report by a national health nonprofit that ranks states based on a host of factors.</p>
<p>The commonwealth&#8217;s rank rose from 20th to 15th, joining Alaska and Wyoming as the only states to improve by five spots.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.americashealthrankings.org/learn/reports/2019-annual-report" target="_blank">America&#8217;s Health Rankings</a>, which has been published every year since 1990, bills itself as the &#8220;longest running state-by-state analysis of the nation&#8217; health&#8221; and compares states based on dozens of data points, from rates of suicide, smoking, obesity and sexually transmitted disease to infant mortality, drug overdoes, violent crime and air pollution, among others.</p>
<p>Among the findings:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the past three years, drug deaths increased 52% from 10.1 to 15.4 deaths per 100,000 population.</li>
<li>Since 2012, smoking decreased 29% from 20.9% to 14.9% of adults.</li>
<li>Since 2003, air pollution decreased 49% from 13.5 to 6.9 micrograms of fine particles per cubic meter.</li>
<li>In the past year, chlamydia increased 6% from 473.2 to 500.3 cases per 100,000 population.</li>
<li>In the past four years, frequent mental distress increased 21% from 10.0% to 12.1% of adults.</li>
<li>Since 1990, infant mortality decreased 44% from 10.6 to 5.9 deaths per 1,000 live births.</li>
</ul>
<p>In a statement, the Virginia Hospital and Health Care Association said the gains are &#8220;a testament to the work of many stakeholders who are dedicated to improving public health and wellbeing,&#8221; adding that Virginia’s hospitals and health systems &#8220;have been among the leaders in this effort and are committed to the goal of making the commonwealth the healthiest state in the nation.&#8221;</p>

November 19, 2019. (Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>The irony is lost on them, apparently.</p>
<p>For years, as they successfully argued to block new gun restrictions in the GOP-controlled General Assembly, gun rights groups talked about the horrific injustice that would be perpetrated on <a href="https://wtvr.com/2017/01/16/gunowners-lobby-for-less-gun-control-others-lobby-to-end-gun-violence-1/" target="_blank">&#8220;law-abiding&#8221; gun owners</a> by the passage of any new gun law, including the onerous imposition that they be required to report firearms lost or stolen or ensure that a person they might sell a gun to<a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/08/29/virginia-explained-wanna-buy-a-gun-heres-what-i-dont-have-to-before-i-sell-it-to-you/" target="_blank"> actually is allowed to buy it</a>.</p>
<p>Now, in cramped county meeting rooms across the commonwealth, mostly rural denizens are having stunning success in bullying their boards of supervisors <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/11/20/were-going-to-have-to-defend-ourselves-after-democratic-victories-rural-virginia-counties-rush-to-declare-themselves-gun-sanctuaries/" target="_blank">into declaring their counties</a> &#8220;Second Amendment sanctuaries,&#8221; an attempt at preemptive defiance of new gun laws expected after Democrats captured the General Assembly last month. Turns out they just won&#8217;t abide new laws.</p>
<p>The parents of murdered TV reporter Alison Parker couldn&#8217;t even get a word in before the Henry County Board of Supervisors vote.</p>
<p>“To declare Henry County a Second Amendment sanctuary is to say, ‘Sorry for your loss, but freedom for anyone to have access to guns without any restriction is more important than your child’s life,’” Barbara Parker told the board after the fact, <a href="https://www.martinsvillebulletin.com/news/local/henry-county-supervisors-quickly-stand-up-for-guns-in-sanctuary/article_9bd79324-ab2b-5f83-baee-d0faaac440af.html" target="_blank">per The Martinsville Bulletin</a>. “I’ve been here 22 years, and for the first time, I feel like it’s not my home anymore.”</p>
<p>Supporters will tell you they&#8217;re merely pledging fealty to a higher law, the U.S. Constitution, but that is of course utter nonsense. As <a href="https://www.roanoke.com/opinion/editorials/editorial-second-amendment-sanctuary-advocates-and-anti-pipeline-activists-have/article_377cb2a1-a49c-5a63-a0bc-272c71d11292.html" target="_blank">The Roanoke Times</a> pointed out, even the U.S. Supreme Court&#8217;s landmark Heller decision, which affirmed the individual right to &#8220;possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia,&#8221; said firearms regulation and the Second Amendment are compatible.</p>
<p>&#8220;Like most rights, the right secured by the Second Amendment is not unlimited,&#8221;<a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/07pdf/07-290.pdf" target="_blank"> Justice Antonin Scalia wrote</a>. &#8220;From Blackstone through the 19th-century cases, commentators and courts routinely explained that the right was not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose.&#8221;</p>
<p>Many of these local elected officials, in kowtowing to the gun mob, know that their resolutions are largely symbolic. But that doesn&#8217;t mean they&#8217;re meaningless. They are only the latest example of an increasing and dangerous fracturing in our society.</p>
<p>“We need to send a signal to Richmond about Northern Virginia. We don’t want their influence to affect us down here. We’re very different people,” Clay Scott, a 25-year-old construction project manager from Amelia, told The Washington Post. Elected sheriffs and commonwealth&#8217;s attorneys — whose job description is quite literally enforcing Virginia law — also <a href="https://www.godanriver.com/news/local/what-will-second-amendment-sanctuary-enforcement-look-like/article_7b86d324-3770-51fb-bafe-924bebc05fde.html" target="_blank">joining in on the craze</a> is far more troubling.</p>
<p>Del. Jay Jones, D-Norfolk, was only being slightly hyperbolic when he <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/va-lawmaker-asks-ag-for-formal-opinion-on-second-amendment-sanctuary-trend/" target="_blank">wrote in his letter</a> requesting a formal opinion on the sanctuaries from Attorney General Mark Herring that allowing localities and elected officials to flout laws duly passed by the legislature is &#8220;indicative of the same mindset that nearly 150 years ago led this country to dissolve into a civil war.&#8221;</p>
<p>And here&#8217;s the thing: Gun rights groups aren&#8217;t doing themselves or their members any favors. Despite their ability to flood county and city meeting chambers with delusional people who are convinced their 30-round magazines and AR-15s are the only thing standing between the citizenry and a tyrannical federal government, they are actually in the minority.</p>
<p>The majority, in fact, has already spoken by giving Democrats, who ran on an explicit agenda of new gun restrictions, control of the legislature. And a Roanoke College poll released Tuesday <a href="https://www.roanoke.edu/about/news/rc_poll_politics_general_assembly" target="_blank">shows wide support</a> for several of the key pieces of gun regulation Democrats are pushing.</p>
<p>Rather than engage with well-meaning lawmakers who may not be steeped in rural traditions like hunting and shooting to tweak regulations that could prove burdensome for young hunters, such as<a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+sum+SB18" target="_blank"> bills</a> restricting access to firearms by minors and raising age requirements for purchases of long guns, this kind of defiance only makes it easier for the new Democratic majorities to brush those concerns aside, just as Republicans have done for years to gun control advocates.</p>
<p>It also probably won&#8217;t help them get a seat at the table in what promises to be a thorny debate over a<a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/06/09/is-there-a-way-past-gun-gridlock/" target="_blank"> potential red flag law</a> and the <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+ful+SB16+pdf" target="_blank">assault weapon ban</a> proposed by new Senate Majority Leader Dick Saslaw, D-Fairfax, which would affect a huge number of guns in the state.</p>
<p>And the <a href="https://twitter.com/AlissaSkelton/status/1202062777629790209" target="_blank">histrionics on display</a> in Virginia Beach Tuesday night, where the &#8220;Guns Save Lives&#8221; throngs had the audacity to demand a gun sanctuary resolution from the city still grieving victims of the municipal building shooting there in May, likewise won&#8217;t likely earn a sympathetic ear from Democratic lawmakers come January.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a shame more local elected officials haven&#8217;t found the guts to resist these needlessly divisive resolutions. Look to the Roanoke City Council, though, for an example, where Del. Chris Head, R-Botetourt, was trying to coax the council along with a version of the &#8220;everyone else is doing it&#8221; argument, noting that resisting a gun sanctuary declaration was “really sort of swimming upstream,&#8221; <a href="https://www.roanoke.com/news/local/citing-u-s-virginia-constitutions-roanoke-council-rebuffs-call-for/article_c5956f5d-11f7-5ea3-9e6e-39d5fe33f1a5.html" target="_blank">The Roanoke Times reported</a>.</p>
<p>“Sometimes when we govern, it’s important to swim upstream,” Vice Mayor Joe Cobb replied.</p>

<p><strong>By the numbers: </strong>The Roanoke Times broke down some figures from the elections earlier this month and what they<a href="https://www.roanoke.com/opinion/editorials/editorial-the-numbers-to-know-from-the-november-elections/article_984e4f1d-dad9-5a7f-9ec7-02a33172ef27.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.roanoke.com/opinion/editorials/editorial-the-numbers-to-know-from-the-november-elections/article_984e4f1d-dad9-5a7f-9ec7-02a33172ef27.html"> say about Virginia&#8217;s electorate now.</a> Also writing in the Times, Washington and Lee professor Chris Gavaler <a href="https://www.roanoke.com/opinion/commentary/gavaler-no-the-polls-didn-t-get-it-wrong-in/article_c8002694-daf2-5f41-9f75-f95d185b9657.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.roanoke.com/opinion/commentary/gavaler-no-the-polls-didn-t-get-it-wrong-in/article_c8002694-daf2-5f41-9f75-f95d185b9657.html">disputes the notion</a> that no one saw President Donald Trump&#8217;s 2016 victory coming: &#8220;I’ve heard it so many times from both Democrats and Republicans that it has the seeming credibility of encyclopedic knowledge: 2016 was an upset that no poll saw coming.&#8221; he wrote. &#8220;Except it’s not true. Look at the actual numbers.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Politics and Thanksgiving</strong>: Everett L. Worthington Jr., a professor at Virginia Commonwealth University, writes on how to keep political bloodsport from ruining relationships with members of your family. Step 1: <a href="https://www.richmond.com/opinion/columnists/everett-l-worthington-jr-column-how-to-handle-political-discussions/article_ab21b759-86aa-5c85-8f68-d75101e28458.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.richmond.com/opinion/columnists/everett-l-worthington-jr-column-how-to-handle-political-discussions/article_ab21b759-86aa-5c85-8f68-d75101e28458.html">Forgive ahead of time</a>, he says in a piece in the Richmond Times-Dispatch. &#8220;Perhaps your experience with Uncle Huck has shown that he just can’t control inflicting extreme opinions on everyone. Or Grandma seems very feisty in the past couple of years,&#8221; he wrote. &#8220;Tell yourself, I might get triggered. It’s happened in the past. I don’t want to lose this close relationship. My family member doesn’t either.&#8221;</p>
<p>InsideNoVa contributor Harvey Gold says Thanksgiving<a href="https://www.insidenova.com/opinion/columnists/gold-thanksgiving-celebrations-have-changed/article_e4c43e7e-0b16-11ea-b487-efcb9073be2d.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.insidenova.com/opinion/columnists/gold-thanksgiving-celebrations-have-changed/article_e4c43e7e-0b16-11ea-b487-efcb9073be2d.html"> should be a unifying holiday</a>. &#8220;There is no question that our country remains a work in progress. But having the ability to change under rules, when properly administered, that brings blessings to more folks is the blessing that remains special and worthy of celebration.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>More money, authority for localities</strong>: Richmond Mayor Levar Stoney says giving localities more funding and authority should be high on the list of the new Democratic majorities in the Capitol. &#8220;Democrats can finally lead and support the needs of localities that have been overlooked and underfunded for years,&#8221; <a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/opinion/columns/vp-ed-column-stoney-1117-20191117-tdgfbdyzinh4lfcqwz2g5juivu-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.pilotonline.com/opinion/columns/vp-ed-column-stoney-1117-20191117-tdgfbdyzinh4lfcqwz2g5juivu-story.html">he wrote in The Virginian-Pilot</a>. &#8220;Leadership is about more than just campaigning and now we need our new leaders to deliver on their promises.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Public need and the pipeline:</strong> Writing in The Roanoke Times, Irene Leech and Roberta Bondurant, two ardent opponents of the controversial Mountain Valley Pipeline, says the idea that anyone urgently needs the gas it would deliver <a href="https://www.roanoke.com/opinion/commentary/bondurant-and-leech-the-public-need-argument-for-the-mvp/article_c139b078-7918-5d5c-ae2b-b405b89ae5c5.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.roanoke.com/opinion/commentary/bondurant-and-leech-the-public-need-argument-for-the-mvp/article_c139b078-7918-5d5c-ae2b-b405b89ae5c5.html">is increasingly undermined by some inconvenient facts</a>.  &#8220;On Halloween night, EQT announced it would sell its interest in the MVP, and shortly after, Consolidated Edison reported it would cap its investment. The house of cards appears to be falling, with no true demographic of constitutional need, and not even a purported “construct” of need in affiliated shipper contracts.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>As the revolving door spins:</strong> RTD columnist Jeff Schapiro <a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/plus/schapiro-va-s-revolving-door-spins-a-bit-faster-these/article_f28248e1-f7e1-593d-b08b-9cf2e8d943a3.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.richmond.com/news/plus/schapiro-va-s-revolving-door-spins-a-bit-faster-these/article_f28248e1-f7e1-593d-b08b-9cf2e8d943a3.html">charts the resetting</a> of the landscape for the lobbyists who shape big decisions in Richmond in the wake of the Democrats&#8217; wins earlier this month. &#8220;Despite elevated sensitivities over ethics because of the Bob McDonnell scandal — and tighter restrictions on freebies for officials — there are few barriers to members of the political class moving between the public and private sectors,&#8221; he wrote. &#8220;The switch from public to private trough is an enduring tradition in Virginia.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Who will be the &#8216;fulcrum&#8217;? </strong>Del. Chris Jones, R-Suffolk, one of the most powerful Republicans in the House, was, &#8220;in recent years, the fulcrum, pivot point and hinge to all things requiring state support,&#8221; for Hampton Roads, <a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/opinion/columns/vp-ed-column-morse-1124-20191124-f2tcdwrqb5d5vcg5tffqwibbcq-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.pilotonline.com/opinion/columns/vp-ed-column-morse-1124-20191124-f2tcdwrqb5d5vcg5tffqwibbcq-story.html">writes Virginian-Pilot columnist Gordon S. Morse</a>. With his defeat earlier this month, Morse wonders, &#8220;who’s volunteering for fulcrum duty now? Who will — quite literally — tend to business?&#8221;</p>
<p>The Pilot&#8217;s editorial board also worried about the implications of the new power dynamic (with Northern Virginia largely in the driver&#8217;s seat) in the legislature. &#8220;The consternation over this power shift is legitimate and its potential implications are deeply worrisome,&#8221; <a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/opinion/vp-ed-editorial-regional-representation-1124-20191124-itoh2g5ravfvbhvsoriur5lzj4-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.pilotonline.com/opinion/vp-ed-editorial-regional-representation-1124-20191124-itoh2g5ravfvbhvsoriur5lzj4-story.html">the paper wrote</a>. &#8220;Hampton Roads lawmakers, regardless of party, have done well in recent years to speak with a unified voice on a handful of issues each session, recognizing that delivering on transportation initiatives or funding for the Port of Virginia were essential responsibilities of representing this area.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Foster care:</strong> The Fredericksburg Free Lance-Star<a href="https://www.fredericksburg.com/opinion/editorial-more-virginia-kids-in-foster-care/article_83ade330-3289-5342-a20a-c7f3f75e3920.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.fredericksburg.com/opinion/editorial-more-virginia-kids-in-foster-care/article_83ade330-3289-5342-a20a-c7f3f75e3920.html"> takes note of a troubling trend</a>. Virginia&#8217;s foster care numbers are up even as they are on the decline nationwide. &#8220;If child welfare is the goal, keeping as many children out of the foster system as humanly possible, while making sure that the family issues that precipitated the crisis are resolved, should be the state’s top priority.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Radford&#8217;s missing papers:</strong> &#8220;Something doesn’t feel right here. And by here, we mean Radford University,&#8221; <a href="https://www.roanoke.com/opinion/editorials/editorial-questions-about-radford-s-missing-questions/article_6913a84d-9694-526b-90a2-00ef530f8b9e.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.roanoke.com/opinion/editorials/editorial-questions-about-radford-s-missing-questions/article_6913a84d-9694-526b-90a2-00ef530f8b9e.html">The Roanoke Times wrote in an editorial</a>. &#8220;Let’s review what we know in the case of the missing student newspapers and then pose some questions we haven’t seen asked.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Redistricting: </strong>The Danville Register &amp; Bee <a href="https://www.godanriver.com/opinion/editorials/virginia-don-t-tarry-on-redistricting-reform/article_624fc20d-4a0e-51a9-8f18-9a630d2e6d0d.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.godanriver.com/opinion/editorials/virginia-don-t-tarry-on-redistricting-reform/article_624fc20d-4a0e-51a9-8f18-9a630d2e6d0d.html">also added its voice</a> to the chorus of editorial boards warning Democrats against reversing course on redistricting reform. &#8220;Virginia has a chance to end partisan redistricting forever, but it depends on the long-out-of-power Democrats re-passing the constitutional amendment. No doubt, some may be rethinking their support for redistricting reform now that they’re the ones with the power of the maps, but we have some advice for any wavering Democrat: Rise above your partisan leanings, do what’s right for this commonwealth and pass this amendment. It’s good policy and good politics. History will take note of what you do with this opportunity.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Letter of the week:</strong> Tscharner D. Watkins III of Richmond, chairman of the Virginia Agricultural Council, <a href="https://www.richmond.com/opinion/letters-to-editor/letter-to-the-editor-nov-general-assembly-enables-overfishing-of/article_a4e6983c-9767-515b-a623-a23fbca44a62.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.richmond.com/opinion/letters-to-editor/letter-to-the-editor-nov-general-assembly-enables-overfishing-of/article_a4e6983c-9767-515b-a623-a23fbca44a62.html">takes on Omega Protein</a>, the masses of menhaden it pulls from the Chesapeake Bay, and the company&#8217;s special relationship with the General Assembly in a letter to the Times-Dispatch. &#8220;This is the only fish in Virginia still managed by our state legislature. Why? Lobbying and campaign money keep it this way.&#8221;</p>

(Ned Oliver/ Virginia Mercury)</p><p>At a time when involuntary admissions to state mental hospitals are spiking, a review by state inspectors found that nearly half of the state&#8217;s 13 facilities do not have an approved policy that limits hours or consecutive days of overtime for increasingly overworked nurses and other staff. The report also says more than half of the hospitals were not properly staffed, among other findings.</p>
<p>“With the increase in certain patient populations and patient turnover at the facilities, more medical personnel are being asked to provide patient services for which they have not received direct training,” said state Inspector General Michael Westfall in a news release. “Not having staff members cross-trained puts the employee and patients at risk for not effectively providing and receiving the patient-specific care needed.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.osig.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/office-of-the-state-inspector-general/pdf/2020-PA-002-Unannounced-Inspections-at-DBHDS-Facilities.pdf" target="_blank">The 32-page report</a> by the Virginia Office of the State Inspector General recommends the Department of Behavioral Health and Development Services implement a policy that limits overtime hours per week and consecutive shifts that direct care nursing staff are allowed to work.</p>
<figure id="attachment_13067" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:1098px;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-13067" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/TDO_ADMISSIONS.png" alt="" width="1098" height="732" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/TDO_ADMISSIONS.png 1098w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/TDO_ADMISSIONS-300x200.png 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/TDO_ADMISSIONS-768x512.png 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/TDO_ADMISSIONS-1024x683.png 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/TDO_ADMISSIONS-696x464.png 696w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/TDO_ADMISSIONS-1068x712.png 1068w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/TDO_ADMISSIONS-630x420.png 630w" sizes="(max-width: 1098px) 100vw, 1098px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  The surge in involuntary admissions, called temporary detention orders, to state mental hospitals came after a 2014 law. (Office of the State Inspector General)</p></figure>
<p>&#8220;By not placing a limit on the number of overtime hours per week and consecutive shifts or consecutive hours of overtime worked by direct care nursing staff at facilities, DBHDS runs the risk of staff working excessive amounts of time and becoming too fatigued to carry out their duties,&#8221; the report says. &#8220;This could lead to lapses in adherence to safety policies or health care standards, which in turn will lead to substandard conditions and care for patients at DBHDS facilities.&#8221;</p>
<p>A response from the agency&#8217;s management, included in the report, blamed the overtime on 2014 legislation that required state hospitals to serve as the &#8220;facility of last resort&#8221; for people under <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/12/03/you-have-no-control-as-psychiatric-admissions-rise-virginia-grapples-with-a-hospital-crisis-that-threatens-care-and-safety/" target="_blank">temporary detention orders</a>, issued when patients are deemed to pose a risk to themselves or others. The law also mandated that they &#8220;admit incompetent individuals within 10 days of receipt of a court order.&#8221;</p>
<p>And though the department <a href="https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/item/2019/1/HB1700/Chapter/1/316/" target="_blank">got a boost</a> from the General Assembly in this year&#8217;s budget, including additional money for hospitals operating at 90% capacity or greater, &#8220;the state hospitals continue to consistently operate well above their funded and staffed levels and these census trends are projected to continue at a 2% growth rate annually.&#8221;</p>
<figure id="attachment_13068" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:1023px;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-13068" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/overtime_hours.png" alt="" width="1023" height="682" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/overtime_hours.png 1023w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/overtime_hours-300x200.png 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/overtime_hours-768x512.png 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/overtime_hours-696x464.png 696w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/overtime_hours-630x420.png 630w" sizes="(max-width: 1023px) 100vw, 1023px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Overtime hours are climbing at state mental facilities for nursing staff. (Office of the State Inspector General)</p></figure>
<p>The department also says it&#8217;s working to improve recruitment and retention.</p>
<p>&#8220;The conditions observed and recommendations as stated infer that overtime and safety issues will be ameliorated with an umbrella OT policy for all state facilities; however, each facility’s unique staffing needs must be recognized and managed accordingly,&#8221; DBHDS said.</p>
<p>The agency said it would convene a workgroup that would recommend guidelines and that it would &#8220;ensure that each facility has a policy, tailored to its unique needs and funded staffing levels that provides guidance on the number of overtime hours worked within a week, the number of consecutive hours worked and the amount of time between shifts.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>The Fredericksburg Free Lance-Star</strong><a href="https://www.fredericksburg.com/opinion/editorial-is-northam-still-for-campaign-finance-reform/article_a47eb2fc-b4d2-5ae6-8306-5efcfcced5db.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.fredericksburg.com/opinion/editorial-is-northam-still-for-campaign-finance-reform/article_a47eb2fc-b4d2-5ae6-8306-5efcfcced5db.html"> wonders whether</a> Gov. Ralph Northam, who as a candidate called for an end to corporate donations, still cares about campaign finance reform. &#8220;The problem (is) that, with some exceptions, the folks who raise the most money tend to win the elections, which means they will have more clout to decide whether to come up with stricter contribution limits.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>The Roanoke Times</strong> <a href="https://www.roanoke.com/opinion/editorials/editorial-letter-to-the-general-assembly-s-new-democratic-leaders/article_5a57462d-7479-5035-8d07-7c60ace6d3a6.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.roanoke.com/opinion/editorials/editorial-letter-to-the-general-assembly-s-new-democratic-leaders/article_5a57462d-7479-5035-8d07-7c60ace6d3a6.html">penned a letter</a> of introduction to the state&#8217;s new Democratic leaders on behalf of Southwest Virginia. &#8220;It’s you in Northern Virginia who have the privilege — the privilege of wealth, the privilege of education, the privilege of economic opportunity, the privilege of not watching your sons and daughters move away because there are no jobs for them. And now you have the privilege of political power. We hope you use it wisely. And we hope you use some of it to help parts of the state that didn’t elect any of you.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>The News &amp; Advance </strong>in Lynchburg also had some unsolicited advice for Democrats: &#8220;<a href="https://www.newsadvance.com/opinion/editorials/advice-to-va-democrats-all-glory-is-fleeting/article_2c841803-912c-5db1-b91a-3381abe9f34d.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.newsadvance.com/opinion/editorials/advice-to-va-democrats-all-glory-is-fleeting/article_2c841803-912c-5db1-b91a-3381abe9f34d.html">Sic omnia gloria transit</a> … &#8216;All glory is fleeting.&#8217;” And <strong>New York Times columnist</strong> Jamelle Bouie says <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/08/opinion/sunday/virginia-election-democracy.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/08/opinion/sunday/virginia-election-democracy.html">opening up access </a>to voting should be the party&#8217;s main priority here in the wake of its win.</p>
<p><strong>Beware Dominion&#8217;s wind project:</strong> Former State Corporation Commission Chairman Hully Moore sees a potential pig in a poke in Dominion Energy&#8217;s large proposed offshore wind project. &#8220;The General Assembly can encourage environmentally friendly projects including offshore wind, but it must not forget that ratepayers pay the bill,&#8221; <a href="https://www.richmond.com/opinion/columnists/hullihen-williams-moore-column-ratepayers-beware-on-dominion-s-offshore/article_e2399c31-f34d-5832-80b4-84b766bb9df4.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.richmond.com/opinion/columnists/hullihen-williams-moore-column-ratepayers-beware-on-dominion-s-offshore/article_e2399c31-f34d-5832-80b4-84b766bb9df4.html">Moore wrote in the Richmond Times-Dispatch</a>. &#8220;The assembly should not take over regulation and prohibit the SCC from determining whether plans and expenditures are prudent and in the public interest. &#8230; The SCC must be able to determine whether spending over $7 billion of ratepayer money for 78 cents /kWh is in the public interest.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>More solar PPAs</strong>: Also in the Times-Dispatch, Robert W. Lazaro Jr., executive director of the Northern Virginia Regional Commission,<a href="https://www.richmond.com/opinion/columnists/robert-w-lazaro-jr-column-now-is-the-time-to/article_63349f8a-cac1-5ad2-a16d-8ff756a098d6.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.richmond.com/opinion/columnists/robert-w-lazaro-jr-column-now-is-the-time-to/article_63349f8a-cac1-5ad2-a16d-8ff756a098d6.html"> says it&#8217;s time </a>for Virginia to raise the cap on solar power-purchase agreements in Dominion Energy&#8217;s territory. &#8220;By all measures, the PPA Pilot Program has been a success, creating jobs, reducing costs and bringing more clean power to Virginia. Now is the time to keep a good thing going and permanently approve an increase to the cap,&#8221; he wrote.</p>
<p><strong>Speaking of Dominion</strong>, RTD columnist Jeff Schapiro <a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/plus/schapiro-va-s-legislature-as-parallel-universe/article_da2368ef-83a5-56da-bfb4-4101c635841c.html?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=user-share" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.richmond.com/news/plus/schapiro-va-s-legislature-as-parallel-universe/article_da2368ef-83a5-56da-bfb4-4101c635841c.html?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=user-share">explores the new political landscape</a> for the utility, long accustomed to getting its way in the General Assembly. &#8220;Politics is about parsing,&#8221; he wrote. &#8220;With Dominion, Democrats will be doing a lot more in January, when they install new majorities in the House of Delegates and the Virginia Senate. There is a restless progressive vote demanding immediate accommodation. There is, too, an establishment wing that believes compromise makes for a long game.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>The Virginian-Pilot </strong>says the State Crime Commission, which issued a three-page report with no legislative recommendations on new gun laws,<a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/opinion/vp-ed-editorial-crime-commission-guns-1115-20191115-hhg3ufejurf4nmuafsolgcx7ym-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.pilotonline.com/opinion/vp-ed-editorial-crime-commission-guns-1115-20191115-hhg3ufejurf4nmuafsolgcx7ym-story.html"> let the state down</a>. &#8220;This game of Whac-A-Mole being played by legislators and the commission is unbecoming, especially considering gun violence kills more than a thousand Virginians each year,&#8221; the paper wrote. <strong>The Daily Progress</strong> <a href="https://www.dailyprogress.com/opinion/opinion-editorial-commission-s-gun-bill-reply-provides-no-help/article_4749ebe9-39a1-54fd-8841-eb40ed252cdd.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.dailyprogress.com/opinion/opinion-editorial-commission-s-gun-bill-reply-provides-no-help/article_4749ebe9-39a1-54fd-8841-eb40ed252cdd.html">likened the episode</a> to a &#8220;clumsy game of soccer.&#8221;</p>
<p><em><strong>Letter of the week</strong></em>: &#8220;Paris, Nov. 11, 1951,&#8221; Robert Huston of Yorktown <a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/opinion/letters/vp-ed-lets-1113-20191113-wsg5fyyqbbcbpbjovl6g53fovy-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.pilotonline.com/opinion/letters/vp-ed-lets-1113-20191113-wsg5fyyqbbcbpbjovl6g53fovy-story.html">wrote to The Virginian-Pilot.</a> &#8220;I stood on the top of the Eiffel Tower. I had watched the fountains below shut down and wondered. The street sounds faded, and then silence. A cab driver exited his vehicle and stood beside it. I looked at my watch. It was 11 a.m.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>The aftermath:</strong> Tuesday saw a seismic election for Virginia, giving Democrats full control of state government for the first time since 1993. Commentary on what it means and what comes next dominated opinion pages in the ensuing days.</p>

<p><strong>The Virginian-Pilot</strong> noted that the &#8220;blue wave&#8221; was <a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/opinion/vp-ed-editorial-local-elections-1108-20191108-47sjzylwszdf5pprch6rid3ag4-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.pilotonline.com/opinion/vp-ed-editorial-local-elections-1108-20191108-47sjzylwszdf5pprch6rid3ag4-story.html">more like a ripple </a>in Hampton Roads:  &#8220;A funny thing happened on the way to the majority.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>The Daily Progress </strong>theorized that the GOP&#8217;s abrupt adjournment on the gun control special session <a href="https://www.dailyprogress.com/opinion/opinion-editorial-state-localities-move-more-strongly-left/article_db3a35b3-a6d4-5a5b-886e-ac6c1631d1f0.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.dailyprogress.com/opinion/opinion-editorial-state-localities-move-more-strongly-left/article_db3a35b3-a6d4-5a5b-886e-ac6c1631d1f0.html">was a key factor.</a> &#8220;We suspect that the terminated gun control session became the final straw for liberals who had watched most of their legislative proposals come to grief in the GOP-dominated legislature,&#8221; the paper wrote.</p>

Ralph Northam leads a chant of "Blue! Wave!" at a watch party downtown Richmond, Va., November 5, 2019. (Parker Michels-Boyce/ For the Virginia Mercury)</p><p>What a world of a difference nine months and an election make.</p>
<p>In February, Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam was fighting for his political life, with the blackface revelation and his <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/02/02/in-his-own-words-northam-describes-moonwalking-in-blackface-denies-appearing-in-kkk-photo/" target="_blank">less-than-inspiring response</a> prompting widespread calls for his resignation from many in his party, which captured control of the General Assembly Tuesday for the first time in more than two decades.</p>
<p>On Wednesday morning, there was Northam and his cabinet <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/11/06/five-things-northam-says-he-will-and-maybe-wont-do-with-a-democratic-majority/" target="_blank">before the media</a> in a scripted bit that appeared aimed at completing Northam&#8217;s climb back into the saddle atop the party&#8217;s agenda.</p>
<p>It was foreshadowed by his <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=727454957660450" target="_blank">PAC last</a> month, which, in an ad and news release that was remarkable for its timing at a critical juncture in the election, proclaimed that Democrats were running &#8220;directly on the policy priorities and accomplishments of the Northam administration, including Medicaid expansion, common sense gun safety legislation, public teacher pay raises and economic growth.&#8221;</p>
<p>Republicans are licking their wounds and Democrats are <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/11/06/how-will-democrats-govern-race-for-speaker-could-be-an-early-test/" target="_blank">already jostling</a> to pick a leader in the House. Who Democrats select will be a major early indicator of how far they intend to go with their new majorities. Expect tension, if not outright conflict, when the General Assembly convenes again here in January between the centrists, wary of going too far too fast and jeopardizing those hard-earned gains, and the progressives, who see a broad mandate from voters on health care, guns, LGBT rights, labor laws and climate change and the environment.</p>

<p>“It’s very easy to be in the minority party and criticize the majority,&#8221; Alex Keena, a political science professor at VCU, told me before the election. &#8220;But once you have the reins of government, all your warts and scars start to show and you have to find a way to keep the party united.”</p>
<p>What it will likely all boil down to, though, is how far Northam is willing to go, meaning the man who was in a hell of a political doghouse not long ago now occupies the catbird seat.</p>
<p>Not entirely undeservedly, some political observers said.</p>
<p>&#8220;While the governor had an extremely difficult year two, it is important to remember he had an extraordinary year one — the passage of Medicaid expansion is a very, very big deal to many families struggling with health care costs around the state,&#8221; said Stephen Farnsworth, a political science professor at the University of Mary Washington.</p>

Ralph Northam held a public cabinet meeting Wednesday to lay out his policy goals for the coming legislative session — bills that have failed in past years but are now likely to pass under Democratic control of the General Assembly. (Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p>“You can try as much as you want to sideline a governor or make them irrelevant, but the truth is they have a lot of power,&#8221; Keena said, citing the special session on guns Northam called in the wake of the Virginia Beach municipal building mass shooting. &#8220;That&#8217;s a perfect example of something that played into the hands of General Assembly candidates,” he added, noting that it put GOP suburban candidates in an “uncomfortable position.”</p>
<p>Reading the tea leaves, it looks like something of a mixed bag. For example, Northam looks like he&#8217;ll push for the <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/the-8-bills-northam-wants-passed-in-the-special-session/" target="_blank">full slate of gun</a> bills he introduced in the special session. He also talked about ratifying the Equal Rights Amendment, raising the minimum wage, marijuana reform and letting localities decide the fate of Confederate monuments.</p>
<p>&#8220;He could certainly be the brake on some of the progressive tendencies in the Democratic Party right now,&#8221; said veteran Virginia political commentator Bob Holsworth. &#8220;At the same time, my sense is there&#8217;s a pretty large consensus agenda that will emerge in the next few months.&#8221;</p>
<p>On utility regulation, discussion of which appeared to be largely absent from his public cabinet meeting Wednesday, Northam seems squishier.</p>
<p>The governor and the state&#8217;s largest utility, Dominion Energy — which, with its donations, over earnings and environmental controversies, has become the bête noire of Democratic politics — sure look they&#8217;ve been singing from the same hymnal over the past few months.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re certainly talking to Dominion more than they&#8217;re talking to us,&#8221; one conservation lobbyist grumbled to me last week about the Northam administration.</p>
<p>Let us count the ways:</p>
<p>• Last month, Northam and Dominion<a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/renewable-energy-will-power-almost-half-of-virginia-government-by-2022/" target="_blank"> announced a deal</a> to meet nearly half of state government electric demands with renewable power by 2022, with the governor&#8217;s office calling it a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/virginia-strikes-deal-to-purchase-renewable-energy-for-use-in-state-facilities/2019/10/18/ac45ff98-f1b6-11e9-b648-76bcf86eb67e_story.html" target="_blank">&#8220;bargain&#8221;</a> for state taxpayers.</p>
<p>• In September, Northam published an executive order <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/northam-calls-for-carbon-free-electric-grid-by-2050/" target="_blank">calling for</a> a carbon-free electric grid in Virginia by 2050. The same day, at a clean energy summit in Richmond, a Dominion executive said the governor’s goals are “aligned” with the utility’s own. A company spokesman had an enthusiastic <a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/local/government-politics/northam-lays-out-renewable-energy-goals-for-virginia-calls-for/article_fdfc6afc-d41c-5024-8074-c4f381934a4a.html" target="_blank">&#8220;challenge accepted&#8221;</a> response for the Richmond Times-Dispatch. If you think all that happened without a consultation between the governor&#8217;s office and Dominion, may I interest you in a certain bridge over the East River?</p>
<p>• Northam signaled he&#8217;s not interested in the push to open up Virginia to more electric competition, a move pushed by an <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/05/07/coalition-takes-aim-at-virginias-vampire-squid-how-much-will-it-make-it-squirm/" target="_blank">unusual liberal-conservative coalition</a> that was rolled out with the help of former Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli before he took his current job as the face of the Trump administration&#8217;s immigration policies. While full deregulation may be a long shot, large companies with big renewable energy goals <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/102419-REBA-Launch-Virginia.pdf" target="_blank">are losing patience </a>with Dominion and are no longer content to sit on the sidelines during the session. With that as the backdrop, here&#8217;s what Northam said about utility regulation last month to S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence <a href="https://www.baconsrebellion.com/wp/northam-opposes-coming-retail-choice-bill/#more-53380" target="_blank">(h/t to Bacon&#8217;s Rebellion)</a>: “I think right now as we move forward, we’re going to work with the system that we have,” he said. “That doesn’t mean it’s a perfect system, but it is a system that we can work with.”</p>
<p>What does it all mean? At a time when large numbers of Democrats are holding Dominion fully at arm&#8217;s length — Clean Virginia, among the groups behind the deregulation push, <a href="https://augustafreepress.com/clean-virginia-touts-success-of-candidates-refusing-dominion-energy-money/" target="_blank">says 50 winning General Assembly candidates</a> rejected utility contributions, along with <a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/virginia/democratic-party-of-virginia-rejects-political-dollars-from-dominion/article_d47bd616-46f1-5186-836d-b2af1f1dd091.html" target="_blank">the state party </a>— the governor is keeping the utility very close, it seems. (He also<a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/plus/northam-names-grant-neely-of-dominion-as-his-new-communications/article_c5424cff-de47-5233-9862-1ffd3d72b1e3.html" target="_blank"> hired</a> a former Dominion official to join his communications office).</p>
<p>It could mean that the company will be able to count on the governor&#8217;s pull (and perhaps his veto pen) during a session that promises to be an energy policy melee with Democrats newly in control of the all-important commerce and labor committees and an array of interests — solar developers, energy efficiency types, environmental groups and large companies like Walmart and Costco, among others — seeking to bust open the doors that Dominion has been able to keep largely shut until now.</p>
<p>After all, Northam&#8217;s shown he&#8217;s been willing to pull <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/12/05/northams-struggle-to-explain-air-board-move-suggests-its-exactly-what-it-appears-to-be/" target="_blank">strings for Dominion before</a>.</p>
<p>Holsworth, for one, says he doesn&#8217;t see Northam taking a hard line with Dominion.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s never been somebody who has easily joined the anti-Dominion chorus,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Certainly this is one big source of tension between him and the other Democrats who have made in some ways Dominion the poster child for their regulatory agenda.&#8221;</p>
<p>On the whole, Holsworth thinks there&#8217;s enough consensus on many issues among Democrats to avoid major fighting between progressives and centrists.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;They&#8217;ll go largely on the agenda on which most of them campaigned,&#8221; he said. &#8220;T</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">hey can only go so far because of the governor.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><strong>CORRECTION:</strong> <em>This post had been edited to correct the characterization of the discussion of energy and environmental issues at the governor&#8217;s cabinet meeting Wednesday and to add the hiring of a former Dominion official who joined the governor&#8217;s communications team. </em></p>

(Parker Michels-Boyce/ for the Virginia Mercury)</p><p>After all the ugly mailers, the deluge of money and the nonstop loop of nasty attack ads, Election Day is here.</p>
<p>Virginia voters will elect all 140 members of the General Assembly today, with Republicans hoping to defend razor-thin majorities in the House and Senate and Democrats aiming to capture control of state government for the first time in 26 years. Other local races, including school board and city council, and issues, like meals and sales taxes and gaming referendums, are also on some ballots.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what you need to know as you head to the polls.</p>
<h2><strong>Where, when and how to vote: </strong></h2>
<p>Polling places open doors at 6 a.m. and will stay open until 7 p.m. If you&#8217;re in line at 7 p.m., you&#8217;ll be allowed to cast a ballot. To find what&#8217;s on your ballot and your polling place, check out the Department of Elections&#8217; <a href="https://vote.elections.virginia.gov/VoterInformation" target="_blank">citizen portal</a> or the Virginia Public Access Project&#8217;s <a href="https://www.vpap.org/local-politics/" target="_blank">local politics tool</a>. Hopefully, you&#8217;re already registered, because otherwise <a href="https://www.elections.virginia.gov/new-releases/tuesday-oct-15-is-the-deadline-for-virginians-to-register-to-vote-in-the-nov-5-election.html" target="_blank">you&#8217;re out of luck</a>. A photo ID<a href="https://www.elections.virginia.gov/registration/photo-ids-required-to-vote/" target="_blank"> is also required, </a>though if you show up without one you can cast a <a href="https://www.elections.virginia.gov/casting-a-ballot/in-person-voting/" target="_blank">provisional ballot</a>.</p>

<h2><strong>What&#8217;s at stake:</strong></h2>
<p>With two years left of Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam&#8217;s term (Virginia governors cannot serve consecutive terms) Democrats are within striking distance of taking the House and Senate. Though all 140 seats are up, the election will <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/09/04/cheat-sheet-the-house-and-senate-races-most-likely-to-decide-control-of-virginias-statehouse/" target="_blank">likely hinge on a relative handful</a> of House and Senate seats in the suburbs of Richmond and Hampton Roads.</p>
<p>There are lots of unknowns.</p>
<p>Will <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/09/09/will-the-anti-trump-wave-that-powered-two-years-of-democratic-wins-flow-into-virginias-unusual-off-off-year-elections/" target="_blank">the anti-Trump fervor</a> that nearly swept away the Republican majority in the House two years ago be enough to carry the day for Democrats,<a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/10/28/a-once-in-a-generation-reboot-election-heightens-stakes-in-va-house-senate-races/" target="_blank"> especially given</a> that the state&#8217;s off-off year elections have historically been characterized by low turnout?</p>
<p>What issues will drive voters? Republicans have been campaigning hard on the governor&#8217;s blackface scandal and a controversial abortion bill that was defeated in the House this past session. Democrats are urging voters <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/10/31/democrats-want-voters-to-give-them-control-of-the-statehouse-tuesday-what-will-they-do-if-they-get-it/" target="_blank">to give them</a> the keys to state government, pledging action on long-stalled initiatives like gun control and raising the minimum wage. In the battlegrounds, both parties are promising <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/10/28/five-ways-healthcare-is-and-isnt-shaping-debate-in-this-years-general-assembly-elections/" target="_blank">health care solutions</a>.</p>
<p>Will the GOP&#8217;s <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/07/10/how-will-gops-get-out-of-dodge-move-play-in-november/" target="_blank">duck-and-cover</a> move during the special session on guns Northam called this summer come back to haunt them?</p>

From mailers to TV spots, the mud is flying fast and furious, spurred by sky-high levels of campaign spending. It&#8217;s all a reminder of what&#8217;s at stake Tuesday: control of the Capitol.</p>
<p>Mercury columnist Bob Lewis, a veteran former AP statehouse reporter, <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/10/28/a-once-in-a-generation-reboot-election-heightens-stakes-in-va-house-senate-races/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">explained in his first column for us </a>why this year is different than Virginia&#8217;s usually sleepy off-off year elections. Mercury guest columnists, including Brian Chiglinsky, <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/10/28/prediction-it-will-be-another-health-care-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">who predicted</a> another health care election, and James Parrish, who <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/10/29/lgbt-virginians-want-leaders-to-champion-virginia-values/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">highlighted the concerns</a> of LGBT people in Virginia, also examined factors that could play a role in the races for all 140 General Assembly seats. The Richmond Times-Dispatch&#8217;s Jeff Schapiro has<a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/plus/schapiro-some-things-to-look-for-on-election-night/article_837b2383-d5c5-5571-8728-71fc51607817.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> a useful primer</a> on what to look for on Tuesday .</p>
<p><strong>Remembering Gov. Baliles</strong>: Several Virginia columnists and editorial boards eulogized former Gov. Gerald Baliles, who died last week of cancer at 79. He was &#8220;a progressive, but not of the sort that defines the word today,&#8221; <a href="https://www.winchesterstar.com/winchester_star/editorial-gerald-baliles-was-progressive-in-a-true-sense/article_7b8a6af6-c416-5d76-9e89-e41dca83c3ef.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Winchester Star wrote.</a> &#8220;He was, in his Democratic way of the 1980s, truly a progressive governor, one who moved the Old Dominion ahead rather than diminish it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Times-Dispatch<a href="https://www.richmond.com/opinion/plus/editorial-gerald-l-baliles-served-with-distinction/article_3c8681d4-9597-5a5d-b091-2116e446f2db.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> said he would be remembered</a> as &#8220;one of the commonwealth’s most visionary leaders.&#8221; The RTD&#8217;s Schapiro takes a comprehensive look at his career<a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/plus/former-virginia-gov-gerald-baliles-credited-with-historic-investments-in/article_a0ae52d5-620e-5394-a7ad-1d9f0a0ea956.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> here</a>. And his former speechwriter, Gordon Morse, <a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/opinion/columns/vp-ed-column-morse-1103-20191103-jcha52ohrvdbrj4r3d4eins4si-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">has some poignant thoughts about Baliles</a> and being a governor in The Virginian-Pilot, drawing some parallels to Gov. Ralph Northam.</p>
<p><strong>Halloween tricks and treats:</strong> The Roanoke Times got into the Halloween spirit with <a href="https://www.roanoke.com/opinion/editorials/editorial-who-s-giving-out-what-for-halloween/article_6890b35b-1f14-5aa4-8b04-458658d1cf80.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">some delightfully wicked barbs</a> for politicians of all stripes, including President Donald Trump (&#8220;Best not to wear a witch costume, either. We hear he has strong feelings about witch hunts) and Gov. Ralph Northam: &#8220;He’s handing out copies of his reading list on African-American history. He’ll also tell you that you need to go carbon-free by 2050; just pay no attention to the construction equipment out back for the Mountain Valley Pipeline. He says he can’t do anything about that. We’re pretty sure you know which costumes not to wear here — or anywhere, for that matter. But definitely no Michael Jackson outfits.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>PFAS:</strong> The Pilot says <a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/opinion/vp-ed-editorial-pfas-cleanup-1101-20191101-3iyjznsojbbgdbxbqasi6b7rpm-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">there&#8217;s no excuse</a> for continuing delays in cleaning up toxic chemicals known as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) long used in firefighting foams on military bases and on ships. &#8220;The men and women who volunteer for our military put their lives on the line to defend our country. They should not have to worry about endangering their health, and that of their families, simply by drinking water.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Our divisions</strong>: Writing in The Roanoke Times, Mike Ellerbrock, a Catholic deacon and a faculty member at Virginia Tech, calls for an end to &#8220;our bitter divisiveness.&#8221;  <a href="https://www.roanoke.com/opinion/commentary/ellerbrock-remembering-our-better-angels/article_4307eaf1-b6a9-5852-892f-bdcc3db477dc.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">He writes</a>: &#8220;A fractured people, we are dismembered. Will we let America’s better angels touch our mystic memory, re-membering the unified nation we once modeled to the world?&#8221; The Pilot<a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/opinion/vp-ed-editorial-polarization-1103-20191103-xd2rnxdltbdqtbw4ksflj3bqfe-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> called on all of us to do more</a> to build bridges: &#8220;It means talking to the dyed-in-the-wool, unwavering Trump supporter or the far-left progressive Democrat and trying to understand their positions. It means consuming a diverse media diet, including those with whom you disagree, and trying to separate fact from fiction.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>&#8216;Very wrong&#8217;: </strong>In a wrenching column for the RTD, the brother of a woman killed by Henrico Police in her own home during a welfare check says police <a href="https://www.richmond.com/opinion/columnists/bob-bostock-column-questions-for-henrico-county-police/article_5dde1fb1-5939-572d-966c-aaeff520fe67.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">have left many questions about the shooting unanswered</a>.  &#8220;Four shots later, their &#8216;welfare check&#8217; ended in the most tragic way possible — the death of the person they were supposed to be helping,&#8221; he wrote. &#8220;By definition, when a welfare check turns into a homicide, something has gone very wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Bob and jobs</strong>: Writing in the Pilot, former Gov. Bob McDonnell<a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/opinion/columns/vp-ed-column-mcdonnelll-1030-20191030-tjp25ro7azcbzg6t3ymo72pnj4-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> warns against</a> fiddling with the state&#8217;s Right to Work law, which prohibits compulsory union membership as a condition of employment. &#8220;Alarmingly, many candidates for the General Assembly are advocating for the repeal of Virginia’s Right to Work statute, which would make the commonwealth a “forced union” state. It is a recipe for economic decline and a much less competitive Virginia,&#8221; he wrote.</p>
<p><strong>The Free Lance-Star </strong>says predictions of the death of cars were wildly exaggerated and policymakers <a href="https://www.fredericksburg.com/opinion/editorial-death-of-cars-prediction-was-premature/article_23277cdc-7f48-5628-97ec-9e23441b228f.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">should adjust accordingly</a>. &#8220;Most people still choose to drive, even in urban centers where mass transit and ride-sharing are ubiquitous. And in more suburban and rural areas, cars are still the number one mobility choice for the vast majority of Virginians, and will likely continue to be so for a long time to come.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>&#8216;Long overdue&#8217;: </strong><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/opinion/vp-ed-editorial-womens-monument-1028-20191028-uddh2jkctnchdgw2fq5yxgvvpq-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Pilot said </a>Virginia&#8217;s Women&#8217;s Monument, unveiled last month matters &#8220;because whom we honor in public spaces says a lot about our values. That’s why we spend so much time arguing about Confederate monuments in Hampton Roads and across the state, and what, if any, place they should have in society.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Letter of the week:</strong> Lester Gabriel of Stafford, <a href="https://www.fredericksburg.com/opinion/letters_to_editor/letter-politics-has-changed-a-lot-over-last-years/article_37a6e455-6bbe-5b11-9c03-91ad1be598d6.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">writing to The Free Lance-Star</a>, laments what he says is a rapid and seismic shift in debate on issues of religious freedom, transgender rights and immigration. &#8220;They are presented on a take-it-or-leave-it basis, and the consequence of leaving it is to be written out of polite society and labelled a racist or other pejorative of the day,&#8221; he wrote.</p>

<p><strong>&#8216;Beware the mail&#8217;:</strong> Writing in The Washington Post, Norman Leahy calls the slick attack fliers <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/10/23/virginia-election-season-draws-close-beware-mail/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/10/23/virginia-election-season-draws-close-beware-mail/">filling mailboxes across Virginia</a> &#8220;the raging ids of campaigns, jammed with garish colors, jarring headlines and wild accusations.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Drones and scooters: </strong>The Richmond Times-Dispatch<a href="https://www.richmond.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-the-limits-of-convenience/article_f5cd17b5-bffc-58a2-8f25-53e8e67cf67f.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.richmond.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-the-limits-of-convenience/article_f5cd17b5-bffc-58a2-8f25-53e8e67cf67f.html"> tackled regulation of drone deliveries</a>: &#8220;As unmanned aircrafts lift common household items to our doors, government must lift its efforts to make sure laws keep pace.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Virginian-Pilot <a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/opinion/vp-ed-editorial-scooters-1027-20191027-5zdzhyhnlbgafcb7eoeebok7ge-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.pilotonline.com/opinion/vp-ed-editorial-scooters-1027-20191027-5zdzhyhnlbgafcb7eoeebok7ge-story.html">called for regional cooperation</a> on regulating another emerging transportation trend: dockless scooters. &#8220;For Hampton Roads, taming the lawless landscape for scooter companies to operate should also mean agreeing with one another on some basic ground rules that span the region, since consistency across jurisdictions makes practical sense and serves the public interest,&#8221; the paper wrote.</p>
<p>And someone at The Roanoke Times <a href="https://www.roanoke.com/opinion/editorials/editorial-the-future-will-arrive-the-same-way-your-pizza/article_18950d62-8ee4-53d2-b73d-8328ab2ec54b.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.roanoke.com/opinion/editorials/editorial-the-future-will-arrive-the-same-way-your-pizza/article_18950d62-8ee4-53d2-b73d-8328ab2ec54b.html">really likes</a> the 2010 movie &#8220;Scott Pilgrim vs. the World,&#8221; noting that even with the dawn of drone delivery approaching, &#8220;technically, any Scott Pilgrim in Christiansburg could still meet his Ramona Flowers.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Deaths of despair:</strong> News Leader columnist Mike Radoiu, a Harrisonburg optometrist, says politics as usual <a href="https://www.newsleader.com/story/opinion/columnists/2019/10/22/deaths-despair-primarily-rural-affecting-middle-aged-white-males/4062280002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.newsleader.com/story/opinion/columnists/2019/10/22/deaths-despair-primarily-rural-affecting-middle-aged-white-males/4062280002/">won&#8217;t result in a solution</a> to the increasing numbers of deaths by suicide, overdose and alcohol among rural whites.</p>
<p>&#8220;The recent &#8216;deaths of despair&#8217; are at the intersection of public health, economics and psychology. Stopping this trend will take an understanding of all three issues and their interrelationship,&#8221; he wrote. &#8220;Cynical political tricks, divisive tweets and political smoke and mirrors won&#8217;t work.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Education funding</strong>: Pilot columnist Gordon C. Morse <a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/opinion/columns/vp-ed-column-morse-1027-20191027-oq3l7g6ck5gbzo7skujjanp5ay-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.pilotonline.com/opinion/columns/vp-ed-column-morse-1027-20191027-oq3l7g6ck5gbzo7skujjanp5ay-story.html">says it&#8217;s time</a> to give education funding a boost, with the state Board of Education making the case for a $1 billion per year increase for public schools in Virginia. &#8220;Just breathe deeply and know that public education has always been costly and anyone who suggests otherwise, well, never went to school,&#8221; he wrote.</p>
<p><strong>Redistricting:</strong> Citing the Mercury&#8217;s reporting on the subject, the Danville Register &amp; Bee fires its own shot across the bow of politicians who back away from redistricting reform. &#8220;Power is intoxicating, and Republicans and Democrats are vulnerable to its charms,&#8221; <a href="https://www.godanriver.com/opinion/editorials/redistricting-reform-no-matter-the-nov-outcome/article_456f6247-6302-59b4-b02e-cca62cc19f1a.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.godanriver.com/opinion/editorials/redistricting-reform-no-matter-the-nov-outcome/article_456f6247-6302-59b4-b02e-cca62cc19f1a.html">the paper wrote</a>. &#8220;We will also call out any Assembly member who backs away from reform simply because his or her party takes power in Richmond. Count on it.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Kids these days: </strong>The Free Lance-Star <a href="https://www.fredericksburg.com/opinion/editorial-differences-between-capitalism-socialism/article_3b4d2c6c-b2fd-5276-ab34-746b148c6243.html" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.fredericksburg.com/opinion/editorial-differences-between-capitalism-socialism/article_3b4d2c6c-b2fd-5276-ab34-746b148c6243.html" target="_blank">walked readers through capitalism v. socialism</a> and explains the current U.S. model: &#8220;Private individuals here own the means of production and markets provide the capital they need, but the government heavily regulates many if not most aspects of economic activity. From time to time, due to changing political winds, the American public has clamored for either more economic freedom or more government intervention,&#8221; the editorial board wrote in a lament about a lack of understanding of economics among young people.</p>
<p>&#8220;But citizens, especially young people who will have to live longer with the consequences than their elders, should at least know what they’re voting for.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>On endorsements:</strong> With Election Day approaching and get-out-the-vote efforts surging, RTD columnist Jeff Schapiro <a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/plus/schapiro-endorsements-elevate-a-candidate-s-profile-problems/article_d58e6fa6-099a-5131-9bbd-a6068024d8ec.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.richmond.com/news/plus/schapiro-endorsements-elevate-a-candidate-s-profile-problems/article_d58e6fa6-099a-5131-9bbd-a6068024d8ec.html">takes a look </a>at the positives and negatives. &#8220;When it comes to endorsements, be careful what you ask for. You just might get it — in the neck, that is,&#8221; he writes.</p>
<p><strong>About that actually</strong>: Speaking of endorsements, the RTD announced last year it would stop doing them. Instead, the paper&#8217;s opinion pages offered up <a href="https://www.richmond.com/opinion/election-special-report-a-q-a-with-rva-legislative-candidates/article_aad64871-9d46-5331-a093-0206fce3d47d.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.richmond.com/opinion/election-special-report-a-q-a-with-rva-legislative-candidates/article_aad64871-9d46-5331-a093-0206fce3d47d.html">a Q&amp;A with area candidates here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Trump and Syria: </strong>The Winchester Star wonders<a href="https://www.winchesterstar.com/winchester_star/star-editorial-why-the-uproar/article_a122f96c-1b1d-57e1-bb48-12beccd3a0fe.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.winchesterstar.com/winchester_star/star-editorial-why-the-uproar/article_a122f96c-1b1d-57e1-bb48-12beccd3a0fe.html"> why all the furor </a>over Trump&#8217;s Syria withdrawal. &#8220;When you read the back story, which dates at least to 2014, the continuing uproar over President Trump’s withdrawal of a couple of dozen troops from Northern Syria is baffling,&#8221; the paper wrote. &#8220;True enough, we are leaving Kurds to fend for themselves, but these are hardly the Kurds of historical comity.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Living and dying</strong>: <a href="http://www.alexandriagazette.com/news/2019/oct/23/opinion-column-maturation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="http://www.alexandriagazette.com/news/2019/oct/23/opinion-column-maturation/">Writing in the Alexandria Gazette Packet</a>, cancer patient Kenneth Lourie chronicles the challenges of living with his illness. &#8220;When you&#8217;re diagnosed with a &#8216;terminal disease,&#8217; you want to live, but it&#8217;s extremely difficult not to think about dying. It dominates your brain and preoccupies your mind,&#8221; he wrote. &#8220;I know I&#8217;m afraid of dying. What these more recent pains and subsequent visits to the doctors have also shown me is that I can&#8217;t be afraid of living.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica neue, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Letter of the week:</strong><em> </em>Writing to The Daily Progress, John Booker of Albemarle <a href="https://www.dailyprogress.com/opinion/opinion-letter-school-names-should-avoid-people-names/article_f3ae4fb2-a43a-5fbc-8d11-48b13d392f0e.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.dailyprogress.com/opinion/opinion-letter-school-names-should-avoid-people-names/article_f3ae4fb2-a43a-5fbc-8d11-48b13d392f0e.html">has a solution for naming controversies</a>. &#8220;Keep it simple (which we should have done for the Charlottesville parks, by the way). Name the school for the street it is on or the neighborhood it is in. No arguments, debates, etc. Why does it need to be named for a person?&#8221; he asks. &#8220;Am I making too much sense?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><strong>Mercury commentary this week that you might have missed:</strong> If there&#8217;s a tie election this year in a House of Delegates or Senate race, we&#8217;re still going to the bowl (a random drawing). <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/10/16/remember-that-bowl-we-still-might-need-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">But that needs to change</a>, I argue.</p>
<p>Roger Chesley says <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/10/18/excising-racial-designations-on-marriage-licenses-a-tiny-step-toward-progress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a judge&#8217;s decision striking down</a> Virginia&#8217;s requirement to identify by race on marriage licenses is a small step toward progress in Virginia, which too often remains &#8220;stuck in the past, on the wrong side of history, holding out to the bitter end.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/10/18/preserving-access-to-safe-legal-abortion-in-virginia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In a guest column</a>, Paulette McElwain of the Virginia League for Planned Parenthood wrote that, with U.S. Supreme Court taking up a crucial abortion case, &#8220;having elected officials who champion safe reproductive health could ensure abortion access is protected in Virginia regardless of what the Supreme Court does.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>&#8216;Rapidly thinning ranks:&#8217;</strong> Veteran RTD political columnist Jeff Schapiro <a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/plus/schapiro-thinning-ranks-of-old-timers-is-reminder-of-change/article_c776bfcf-9860-50ce-abf3-702bf9ddf429.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">walks readers through the life and career </a>of longtime Newport News Del. Alan Diamonstein, who died last week at 88. The Daily Press also <a href="https://www.dailypress.com/opinion/dp-ed-alan-diamonstein-1018-20191018-l3qvwiaaknbchlb7wvptpycj6m-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">eulogized him here</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;A centrist Democrat leery of the extremes, Diamonstein was business-friendly but not to the exclusion of his party’s most reliable friends: minorities and women who had felt the sting of the intolerance he sometimes endured as a Jew coming up in the 1960s in a General Assembly that was largely white, Anglo-Saxon and Protestant,&#8221; Schapiro wrote.</p>
<p>&#8220;Diamonstein was of that post-World War II generation of political figures whose rapidly thinning ranks are a reminder of the dramatic change remaking a legislature that so often resists it.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t tell them<em> that</em> history</strong>: Using the gruesome history of the Tower of London as an example, The Roanoke Times <a href="https://www.roanoke.com/opinion/editorials/editorial-why-are-some-people-so-upset-by-history/article_8e94045b-524a-50a7-9d5b-dd4f51e6fb5e.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">questions people who prefer a moonlight and magnolias version </a>of plantation home tours and don&#8217;t want to hear about the ugly reality of slavery. &#8220;Why are some visitors visiting these grand Southern houses so upset to hear about slavery? Those houses didn’t exactly build themselves,&#8221; the paper wrote.</p>
<p><strong>&#8216;Instructive and provocative:&#8217; </strong>Virginian-Pilot columnist Gordon C.

<p><strong>On guns:</strong> Former RTD editor Tom Kapsidelis, who wrote a book about the Virginia Tech massacre,<a href="https://www.richmond.com/opinion/columnists/thomas-p-kapsidelis-column-reform-gun-laws-and-make-our/article_a26d4608-fd10-563b-af1a-9d72433bbf0e.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> </a><a href="https://www.richmond.com/opinion/columnists/thomas-p-kapsidelis-column-reform-gun-laws-and-make-our/article_a26d4608-fd10-563b-af1a-9d72433bbf0e.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">questions whether Virginia&#8217;s ready</a> to do something about guns. &#8220;While there is no one law or policy that can eliminate mass killings — and the daily homicides that plague our neighborhoods — measures taken together can make an impact without infringing on the rights of gun owners,&#8221; he wrote.</p>
<p><strong>&#8216;Woe to any lawmaker&#8217;:</strong> In an editorial, The Virginian-Pilot, citing the Mercury&#8217;s reporting on the fate of redistricting reform,<a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/opinion/vp-ed-editorial-redistricting-reform-1020-20191020-srnqn2mx75gitcvyfzjp6xlg3u-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> issues a warning </a>to lawmakers thinking about waffling.</p>
<p>&#8220;This isn’t the time for second guessing or cynical political calculations, but rather a moment for courage and an opportunity to do what’s right for all of Virginia,&#8221; the paper wrote. &#8220;Redistricting reform will be a top priority next session. Woe to any lawmaker who pledges support now and fails to back it up once elected.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>&#8216;Gubbins&#8217;:</strong> <a href="https://www.martinsvillebulletin.com/opinion/the_stroller/the-stroller-this-is-a-space-for-nonviolence/article_31c7ce0e-8b83-5352-8186-aa9ddc50820c.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Martinsville Bulletin&#8217;s &#8220;Stroller&#8221; column</a>, the type of regular round-up of local odds and ends that used to be more common at papers, is almost always edifying. &#8220;Friday&#8217;s word was gubbins. The parts of a fish that generally are thrown away while the fish is being prepared for a meal. Example: After Jack’s fishing trips, his wife faithfully skinned and prepared the fish for supper, throwing the gubbins to the far edges of the yard for the cats.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Impeachment: </strong>The RTD editorial board calls for more transparency in the impeachment process playing out in the House of Representatives. &#8220;There is no question that so far, this investigation has been shrouded in secrecy and irregularity,&#8221; <a href="https://www.richmond.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-impeachment-inquiry-must-be-transparent-to-americans/article_ca821f3d-dec6-51a7-a133-30f8493a602e.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the paper wrote in an editorial.</a> &#8220;The star-chamber-like inquiries and interviews House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff is holding bear little resemblance to impeachment processes exercised in the past.&#8221;</p>

The slips of paper were placed inside old film cannisters and drawn from the bowl to decide a tied race between the two candidates. Yancey's name was pulled from the bowl and Republicans retained control of the Virginia House of Delegates. (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)</p><p>For a little while, the bowl was all anyone could talk about.</p>
<p>The blue-and-white stoneware vessel handcrafted by a Virginia Museum of Fine Arts potter <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/republican-yancey-picked-in-random-lottery-declared-winner-of-pivotal-va-house-race/2018/01/04/9c9caa5a-f0a1-11e7-b390-a36dc3fa2842_story.html" target="_blank">got a starring turn in a memorable episode of Virginia politics </a>a little less than two years ago when the name on the slip of paper plucked from within, concealed in a film canister, was revealed to be David Yancey, not Shelly Simonds.</p>
<p>Yancey, a Republican incumbent, and Simonds, his Democratic challenger for the 94th House District in Newport News, had ended their race in a tie <a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/government/virginia/article_0b5de9f9-e898-5f6d-a5f6-5d3ebbdd1448.html" target="_blank">after a recount, court challenge and some stunning legal drama</a>.</p>
<p>National media descended on the Virginia Board of Elections that day for the rare spectacle of a legislative race and control of the lower chamber — a Simonds win would have resulted in a 50-50 split in the House — determined by the luck of the draw.</p>
<p>Many, including me, thought there surely had to be a better way to resolve an electoral tie.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, Simonds, who is waging a rematch with Yancey and said it remains difficult to talk about the drawing, is one of them.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think there’s been a lot of inaction in Richmond on things like voting rights and making it easier for people to vote,&#8221; she said. “I think leaving an election up to a random drawing sends a terrible message.” Yancey&#8217;s campaign office did not respond to a voicemail and an email seeking comment.</p>
<p>And yet, with all 140 seats in the General Assembly on the ballot next month, in the (admittedly unlikely) event that one or more ends in a tie, a drawing from bowl — or vase, mug, football helmet or some other container — is how we&#8217;ll settle things again.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s because in the intervening two years legislation to allow voters to make the final decision, not a random drawing, has gone nowhere.</p>
<p>&#8220;Robert, you are correct. There haven&#8217;t been any changes made in the current law,&#8221; a spokeswoman for the Department of Elections responded when I asked if a tie would still come down to a drawing of lots.</p>
<p><a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?181+sum+HB1581" target="_blank">A bill</a> by Del. Cia Price, D-Newport News, which would call for a special election to be held in the case of a tie after a &#8220;recount court finds that each party to the recount has received an equal number of votes&#8221; has been<a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+sum+HB1993" target="_blank"> left in the Privileges and Elections Committee</a> in each of the past two sessions. The bill wouldn&#8217;t apply to elections for governor, lieutenant governor or attorney general, offices for which the state Constitution sets out processes for resolving a tie.</p>
<p>&#8220;A special election does not rely on luck, but with people,&#8221; Price said <a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/government/virginia/article_ef05cec2-1274-5853-aeab-29191c1ee58a.html" target="_blank">in 2018 to The Virginian-Pilot</a>, which reported that &#8220;the committee was worried about the cost, timing and staffing a second election in less than three months.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We have not solved concerns of voters,&#8221; Price added. &#8220;As to the cost of event&#8230; it&#8217;s rare&#8230; there is also a cost when people walk away from an election feeling like their vote doesn&#8217;t matter.&#8221;</p>
<p>James Alcorn, the former chairman of the State Board of Elections, said there was a lot going through his mind when he pulled the film canister containing Yancey&#8217;s name out of the bowl in front of both campaigns, party officials and the local as well as parachute press.</p>
<p>“We wanted to make it as transparent as possible and professional as possible,&#8221; he told me this week. “It’s really important that people trust that the process is fair and nonpartisan.”</p>
<p>Whether the random drawing is the best way to do things, though, is a decision for the legislature and the governor, he said.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s about striking a balance, said Alcorn, who was appointed to the Board of Elections by Gov. Terry McAuliffe in 2014, between filling a seat quickly and allowing the voting population in a given race to weigh in.</p>
<p>Alcorn said that in preparation for the Simonds-Yancey drawing he researched how other states handle ties, discovering there are essentially three methods: drawing lots, requiring an elected official or political body to cast the deciding vote and conducting a runoff election.</p>
<p>I think we can all agree that we don&#8217;t want &#8220;an elected official or political body&#8221; making the decision.</p>
<p>And barring a &#8220;Ninja Warrior&#8221; skills contest or a &#8220;Billy Madison&#8221;-style <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BcjIestFVOc" target="_blank">academic decathlon</a>, (which I could be persuaded to support) giving the voters another bite at the apple makes the most sense. Another reason to change the law: It currently allows losers of the lot drawing to <a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title24.2/chapter6/section24.2-674/" target="_blank">petition for a recount,</a> something that Simonds opted not to pursue but which, if she had, could have dragged the drama out longer. (<a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+sum+HB1424" target="_blank">A bill in 2018</a> to eliminate the possibility of an endless loop of recounts after lots are drawn passed the House but died in the Senate)</p>
<p>Given how unusual ties are — Alcorn said his review found a handful of examples in Virginia&#8217;s long electoral history — the costs and time arguments don&#8217;t outweigh the importance of making sure the voters, not random chance, decide who represents them here in Richmond, even if they need a second go-round to do so.</p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>Autumn? Fall? Samhain?</p>
<p>Nah. There&#8217;s only one name for the time between Labor Day and Election Day: <a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/plus/schapiro-there-s-a-reason-it-s-called-the-silly/article_e7d01eb1-8647-5e8e-b319-9413f45530f0.html" target="_blank">the Silly Season</a>. Once, it referred largely to the <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/silly%20season" target="_blank">news desert doldrums of August</a>, but it&#8217;s more or less applicable to our politics year-round these days.</p>
<p>Flacks of all persuasions and affiliations are aggressively shopping what&#8217;s know as &#8220;oppo,&#8221; the seeds of what they hope will blossom into damaging stories about political opponents. Groups are trumpeting the obscene amounts of money they&#8217;re pouring into campaigns. And incumbents and challengers are getting in the habit of making wild promises or invoking certain doom if their opponents prevail.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/09/04/cheat-sheet-the-house-and-senate-races-most-likely-to-decide-control-of-virginias-statehouse/" target="_blank">control of the General Assembly</a> hanging in the balance, the stakes are high this year. No shortage of fur is flying, and the campaigns are counting on voters being too busy or ill-informed to look under the hood of the mailers, television ads and other mudslinging that is roaring into high gear just about now.</p>
<p>Fighting for his life against Democrat Ghazala Hashmi, State Sen. Glen Sturtevant, R-Chesterfield, <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/09/03/republican-state-senator-pushes-back-on-richmonds-proposals-to-increase-diversity-at-its-whitest-schools/" target="_blank">is vowing</a> to use the heavy hand of the state to make local school zoning changes tougher, apparently a move to court skittish Richmond parents who are opposed to merging elementary schools in the name of a more balanced racial mix.</p>
<p>In her bid to knock off House Speaker Kirk Cox, R-Colonial Heights, his opponent, Sheila Bynum Coleman, <a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/plus/bynum-coleman-releases-first-ad-includes-error-about-speaker-s/article_882a54a8-36fa-5d9f-ae78-718722864e89.html" target="_blank">aired an ad that falsely claimed</a> that Cox voted against a budget bill that granted teacher raises, apparently confusing him with another delegate with the same last name.</p>
<p>But nothing has had me shaking my damn head more than a news release issued last week by Cox, Del. Terry Kilgore, R-Scott, and two GOP House candidates. The would-be broadside took aim at the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, deriding the Democrat-favored &#8220;energy tax scheme&#8221; they said would raise electric bills 10 percent a year, citing the State Corporation Commission.</p>
<figure id="attachment_11512" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:625px;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-11512 size-full" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/KILGORE_NEWS_RELEASE.png" alt="" width="625" height="496" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/KILGORE_NEWS_RELEASE.png 625w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/KILGORE_NEWS_RELEASE-300x238.png 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/KILGORE_NEWS_RELEASE-529x420.png 529w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  House Republicans blasted the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative as an &#8220;energy tax scheme&#8221; in a news release last week.</p></figure>
<p>Virginia&#8217;s entry into the network of carbon-trading states, which was intended to happen via a state regulation two years in the making that was approved by the State Air Pollution Control Board earlier this year, is hobbled for now. (Republicans should know, <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/05/02/northam-wont-touch-budget-language-that-could-cripple-carbon-capping-plan/" target="_blank">because they inserted the budget language</a>, which Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam opted not to veto, that knee-capped it).</p>
<p>The costs of joining RGGI for electric ratepayers are very much in dispute, <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/04/09/whos-right-in-fight-over-carbon-compliance-costs/" target="_blank">as I wrote in April</a>. The SCC has stuck to its guns in claiming that linking to RGGI will on average add $7 over 25 years to the typical monthly residential bill of customers of Dominion Energy, Virginia’s largest utility. Meanwhile, the Department of Environmental Quality, which projects that RGGI would cause a modest decrease (54 cents) in electric bills between 2020 and 2030, pointed out that the SCC&#8217;s numbers rely on &#8220;modeling that was conducted in private by Dominion, the state’s largest utility and one of the parties to be regulated by the proposed electricity sector cap.&#8221;</p>
<p>The biggest part of the dispute hinges on the SCC&#8217;s insistence that RGGI will force the closure of coal-fired power plants already paid for by Virginia ratepayers that would otherwise continue running absent carbon regulation. This, however, is a dubious assumption given the thrashing coal is taking at the hands of natural gas and renewables, according to William Shobe, a professor of public policy and economics at UVA who helped design the carbon allowance auctions for the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative.</p>
<p>“Ratepayers are already paying more for the low capacity factors at these plants. That will almost certainly get worse without RGGI,” Shobe told me in April. “It is possible that the year of actual retirement will be moved up a little bit due to RGGI, but much of the reduction in the use of these plants, and hence much of the costs to ratepayers of not using them to capacity, is completely independent of whether Virginia joins RGGI or not.”</p>
<p>Which brings us to Kilgore, <a href="https://www.vpap.org/offices/house-of-delegates-1/elections/" target="_blank">who doesn&#8217;t face a challenger this year</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a fundamental difference between the two parties,” he said in that news release. “This energy tax scheme known as RGGI would not only raise electric bills for residential customers, but will also close power plants costing us jobs. Virginia Democrats tried to force Virginia into this program unilaterally earlier this year and Virginia Republicans were the only thing standing between higher electric bills and our constituents. We are going to continue to support policies that ensure electricity is affordable for Virginia families.”</p>
<p>Whoa boy.</p>
<p>Stiffing Virginia electric ratepayers has long been a bipartisan exercise (<a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/07/23/as-democrats-debate-campaign-finance-reform-an-intimate-mountain-retreat-with-corporate-lobbyists-continues/" target="_blank">though the fault lines are changing</a>), and no one knows that better than Kilgore.</p>
<p>Both Kilgore and Cox, along with many other members of the legislature, voted for the 2015 <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?151+sum+SB1349" target="_blank">&#8220;rate freeze&#8221;</a> bill that halted the ability of the State Corporation Commission to issue customer refunds on utility overearnings.</p>
<p>However, Kilgore, as chairman of the House Commerce and Labor Committee, has done more than probably anyone in the House to ensure that utilities get to hold onto ratepayer money that they otherwise would have to give back. He and Dominion <a href="https://www.dailypress.com/news/dp-nws-wire-dominion-donations-20150822-story.html" target="_blank">have a long and mutually beneficial relationship</a>. The company remains his top donor, to the tune of nearly $186,000 over the years, according to the Virginia Public Access Project.</p>
<p>Last year, during the House&#8217;s &#8220;Sensitivity Caucus&#8221; mock awards, Kilgore&#8217;s colleagues bestowed upon him the &#8220;Overdog&#8221; award for his enthusiastic championing of the &#8220;big boys&#8221; in Dominion&#8217;s latest electric regulatory overhaul, called the Grid Transformation and Security Act.</p>
<p>As the bill was winding its way through a thorny legislative process, <a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/virginia/government-politics/general-assembly/state-regulators-say-proposed-utility-overhaul-still-limits-ability-to/article_d18a068d-7f26-5f7f-b1e6-35c787c56332.html" target="_blank">the commission warned</a> that it would impose &#8220;limits on the SCC’s authority to return a utility’s excess earnings to customers through refunds and base rate reductions and limits on the SCC’s authority to ensure that customers do not overpay for utility-owned renewable and other projects if and when there are less costly alternatives available.” The SCC staff added that by deeming certain capital projects in the public interest, such as distribution line burial programs that the SCC had previously rejected as too expensive, the bill&#8217;s provisions “could result in billions of dollars in additional costs that will be paid by customers in higher rates.&#8221;</p>
<p>In June, after it approved Dominion&#8217;s most recent long-term plan, the commission <a href="https://www.scc.virginia.gov/newsrel/r_domirp_19.aspx" target="_blank">said that the legislation Kilgore helped carry</a> &#8220;will cost customers more than $6 billion in extra costs above the least-cost plan, not including lifetime financing costs.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you had spent much of your 25 years in the General Assembly building a glass house by working to enrich corporate monopolies at the expense of their captive customers, you&#8217;d probably avoid throwing stones about potential increases in electric rates.</p>
<p>If your colleagues — Democrat and Republican — <a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/virginia/governor-must-act-on-utility-bill-friday-reverse-robin-hood/article_abf19d86-df04-5028-a822-eddfaa9de97a.html" target="_blank">had given you a trophy stuffed with fake cash</a> with Dominion&#8217;s logo on it, complete with a new &#8220;Reverse Robin Hood&#8221; nickname for your skill at steering ratepayer money to utility shareholders, you might want to avoid assuming the mantle of electric affordability champion.</p>
<p>That, of course, would be silly.</p>

(Office of the Governor)</p><p>A former Old Dominion University administrator will be Virginia&#8217;s first-ever director of diversity, equity and inclusion, the governor&#8217;s office announced Monday.</p>
<p>Janice Underwood, ODU&#8217;s former director of diversity initiatives, will be the first person to fill the position Gov. Ralph Northam <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/we-need-some-help-governors-office-will-hire-first-chief-equity-officer/" target="_blank">created in May</a> amid his pivot to addressing racial equity following his blackface scandal.</p>
<p>She will develop &#8220;a sustainable framework to promote inclusive practices across Virginia state government; implement a measurable, strategic plan to address systemic inequities in state government practices; and facilitate ways to turn feedback from state employees, external stakeholders and community leaders into concrete equity policy,&#8221; the governor&#8217;s office said in a news release.</p>
<p>“I am deeply honored to serve the commonwealth in this inaugural position,” Underwood said in a statement.</p>
<p>“As I embark on this role I will be relying on my many personal and professional experiences as a teacher, an educational researcher, a parent and wife and a diversity leader. I am dedicated to working with Virginians to promote lasting, institutional change at all levels of state government, and I look forward to working closely with Governor Northam and the rest of his administration to make the commonwealth more diverse, equitable and inclusive for all who live here.”</p>
<p>Underwood holds bachelor’s and master’s degrees from Hampton University and earned a doctorate in curriculum and instruction from Old Dominion University in 2015.</p>
<p>“Dr. Underwood’s background as an educator, leader and collaborator, as well as her experience promoting inclusive policies and directing a variety of diversity initiatives, make her the perfect person to fill this role,&#8221; Northam said. &#8220;I’m thrilled to welcome Dr. Underwood to our administration, and I look forward to having her as a partner in this important work.”</p>
<p>Underwood&#8217;s salary &#8220;will be commensurate with other senior positions in the administration,&#8221; Northam spokeswoman Alena Yarmosky wrote in an email in response to a question about her pay and the budget for the position. &#8220;Details on her team will be finalized in the coming weeks and months.&#8221;</p>

(Creative Commons via Pixabay)</p><p>Experts predict more than a third of Virginia&#8217;s beaches and dunes will see &#8220;some level of erosion&#8221; from Hurricane Dorian, the U.S. Geological Survey said Friday.</p>
<p>Virginia will be much harder hit than Maryland, with about 34 percent of the commonwealth&#8217;s dunes experiencing erosion compared to only 2 percent in its northern neighbor, the agency says.</p>
<p>“The bases of Maryland and Delaware dunes sit higher above ocean levels than the base of Virginia dunes,” said research oceanographer Kara Doran, who leads the USGS&#8217; Coastal Change Hazards Storm Team. “Additionally, the Maryland and Delaware dunes are also generally taller than Virginia dunes. This is important, because the increased elevation of the base of the dunes reduces the amount of time strong waves and surge can impact and erode them, and the taller height of the dunes requires higher surge levels before they are overtopped.”</p>
<p>The agency also says about 6 percent of Virginia beaches are &#8220;very likely&#8221; to experience overwash — when waves and storm surge exceed the tops of sand dunes, pushing sand inland.</p>
<p>The storm predictions are based on the survey&#8217;s eight year old Coastal Change Forecast model, which uses National Hurricane Center storm-surge predictions and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration&#8217;s wave forecast combined with beach slope and dune height data to predict how waves and storm surge will affect beaches.</p>
<p>A real-time map is available at the USGS’ <a href="https://marine.usgs.gov/coastalchangehazardsportal/" target="_blank">Coastal Change Hazards Portal</a>. The forecast helps local and state officials flag places where storm surge might be the most severe, informing decisions on evacuations and where to place equipment, the USGS says.</p>
<p>Emergency managers can use the coastal change forecast to help identify locations where coastal impacts might be the most severe and this data can assist them as they make critical decisions on which areas to evacuate, which roads to use, and where to position heavy equipment for post-storm clean-up.</p>
<p>As of 2 p.m., Dorian was about 125 northeast of Capt Hatteras, North Carolina, and heading out to sea with maximum sustained winds of 90 miles per hour, according to the NHC. Hampton Roads remains under a <a href="https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/text/refresh/MIATCPAT5+shtml/061754.shtml?" target="_blank">storm surge warning.</a></p>

<p class="wordsection1">Kaine said &#8220;the well-being of American troops is the core responsibility of every commander in the military, yet the commander-in-chief is shirking that duty so he can advance his own political agenda.&#8221;</p>

(Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)</p><p>Say that I&#8217;ve got a gun for sale.</p>
<p>I have a few options. I can sell it to a licensed gun dealer or place it on consignment with one, in which case that dealer would be required to perform a background check on anyone who wants to buy it. I could take it to a gun show, like the one in Richmond this past weekend, and sell it to one of the vendors or patrons there.</p>
<p>Just like with a car, though, my best bet for the most cash is to cut out a middle man and make a private sale to another person. Unlike a car, however, there&#8217;s no title to transfer, no need to get the equivalent of license plates, an inspection sticker or demonstrate proof of insurance before the new owner takes it for a spin.</p>
<p>In fact, if this an unfamiliar world for you, you might be wondering what responsibilities the law imposes on me, the seller of a deadly weapon, to ensure the person I give the gun to in exchange for cash is eligible to own one.</p>
<p>Hardly any is the short answer.</p>
<p>Just to be sure I was right, here are the questions I posed to Corinne Geller, a spokeswoman for the Virginia State Police:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is it correct that private sellers are under no affirmative obligation to ensure that the buyer of a firearm is lawfully allowed to purchase the gun? (In other words, while it&#8217;s illegal to knowingly sell a gun to someone who is barred from owning one, there is no requirement for the seller to verify that&#8217;s the case)</li>
<li>Under the same scenario (a private sale) is there any affirmative obligation of the seller to create a bill of sale or otherwise track the purchase? (I see on the VSP site that it&#8217;s recommended but does not appear to be required)</li>
<li>There is no requirement to report firearms lost or stolen in Virginia, right?</li>
</ul>
<p>Here&#8217;s Geller&#8217;s response: &#8220;Hi, Robert: Correct, correct and correct.&#8221;</p>
<p>This means that I can meet you in a parking lot and hand you a gun as long as you have the agreed-upon money. I am not required to find out whether you have any number of criminal convictions that would bar you from owning a gun. I am not even required to get your name, it seems.</p>
<p>Some responsible gun owners will tell you they would never do something like this, but that doesn&#8217;t change the fact that in Virginia we are essentially on the honor system for private sales. Even after Gov. Terry McAuliffe and lawmakers patted themselves on the back for a 2016 compromise that put the State Police at every gun show in Virginia to perform voluntary background checks,<a href="https://www.roanoke.com/virginia-s-voluntary-background-checks-for-gun-sales-are-almost/article_7e265a29-207f-5dd7-82c6-f46ff5799122.html" target="_blank"> hardly any sellers have availed themselves of the option</a>.</p>
<p>The legislature could and should require that I meet that buyer at a licensed Virginia firearms dealer, which could perform a background check for private sales for a fee. (Some gun shops I called said they will do this now, others said they don&#8217;t).</p>
<p>Politicians who remain resistant to universal background checks only allow gaping holes to remain in a system that clearly allows people who shouldn&#8217;t be able to acquire guns to do so easily. <a href="https://lawcenter.giffords.org/gun-laws/policy-areas/background-checks/universal-background-checks/" target="_blank">It costs lives</a>, as well as defying common sense and the will of the<a href="https://iop.harvard.edu/get-involved/harvard-political-review/vast-majority-americans-support-universal-background-checks" target="_blank"> majority of Americans</a>, including <a href="https://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2018/mar/02/tammy-baldwin/mostly-target-claim-97-percent-gun-owners-support-/" target="_blank">gun owners</a> like me. It&#8217;s the epitome of the least we can do to stem gun violence.</p>
<p>Because there is no tracking of private sales, it&#8217;s hard to know how many happen. But a look at a firearms classified website <a href="https://www.armslist.com/classifieds/virginia" target="_blank">like this one</a> can give you a sense of how much hardware is on offer. Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/news/crime/article_82cf9f7a-3ea1-11e9-9b4e-4f7805b7d9d7.html" target="_blank">a former Norfolk sailor was sentenced to 2 1/2 years</a> in prison for re-selling guns he bought with a military discount, including to &#8220;a juvenile, a drug-addicted armed robber, a drug dealer trafficking in stolen firearms and many others,&#8221; The Virginian-Pilot reported. But who he sold them to wasn&#8217;t necessarily his problem from a legal standpoint.</p>
<p>The primary charge against him, and <a href="https://casetext.com/case/united-states-v-pino-10" target="_blank">the one he pleaded guilty to</a>, was that he was dealing firearms without a license. The defendant &#8220;purchased at least 60 firearms, posted 146 times on firearms-marketplace website www.VAguntrader.com, advertised at least 50 firearms on firearms-marketplace website www.armslist.com and resold at least 23 firearms at a profit,&#8221; the court documents state.</p>
<p>During the State Crime Commission meetings this month, <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/08/19/three-gun-laws-that-could-cut-homicides-36-percent-and-more-numbers-on-guns-in-virginia/" target="_blank">some alarming data</a> from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms was presented:</p>
<ul>
<li>10,021 firearms recovered by police as part of a criminal investigation were traced to a legal purchase in Virginia, the seventh highest number for any state.</li>
<li>Those guns go from purchase to crime scene quicker than nearly any other state, according to 2017 data from ATF. We have the third quickest turnaround of any state, behind only Missouri and Wisconsin, with 2,079 guns purchased here traced back to crimes in the first year after their purchase.</li>
</ul>
<p>That&#8217;s indicative of trafficking and straw purchase activity, an ATF representative told the commission, which should hardly have come as shock, since gun traffickers have boasted about the ease with which they acquire firearms in Virginia.</p>
<p>“The illegal firearms sold during this investigation amount to a sizable arsenal,” said New York City Police Commissioner James P. O’Neill <a href="http://nypdnews.com/2017/03/22-virginia-residents-many-with-gang-ties-indicted-for-gun-trafficking-weapons-purchased-in-virginia-to-be-sold-on-the-streets-of-brooklyn/" target="_blank">after officers busted</a> a massive Virginia-based gun-running ring in 2017. &#8220;When 24 individuals can readily engage in interstate trafficking of 217 handguns, rifles and assault-type weapons, this nation has a serious gun-control problem.”</p>
<p>The failure to bring back the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/mcauliffe-attempts-to-revive-virginias-one-gun-a-month-law/2017/03/27/fc07ec8c-1336-11e7-9e4f-09aa75d3ec57_story.html" target="_blank">one-gun-a-month law</a> also is a boon to gun runners.</p>

<p>How do so many legally purchased guns wind up in the hands of criminals? While Virginia and the federal government makes straw purchasing a crime, they don&#8217;t do much as they could to inhibit it.</p>
<p>There is a box you&#8217;re required to check stipulating that you&#8217;re not buying a gun for someone else: &#8220;Are you the actual transferee/buyer of the firearm(s) listed on this form? Warning: You are not the actual transferee/buyer if you are acquiring the firearm(s) on behalf of another person,&#8221; <a href="https://www.atf.gov/firearms/docs/4473-part-1-firearms-transaction-record-over-counter-atf-form-53009/download" target="_blank">the form says</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://lawcenter.giffords.org/gun-laws/policy-areas/gun-owner-responsibilities/reporting-lost-stolen-firearms/#state" target="_blank">But because there is no requirement to report guns lost or stolen</a> or track private sales, it&#8217;s clearly tough for police to bust straw purchasers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Without reporting laws, straw purchasers can simply claim that a gun they bought and gave to a prohibited person was lost or taken in an unreported theft,&#8221; the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence notes.</p>
<p>Another jaw-dropping stat from the commission&#8217;s meetings: Police in Virginia made just nine arrests for straw purchases between 2012 and 2018, despite the thousands of guns that go from legal sale here to a crime.</p>
<p>The old canard among the pro-gun crowd is that only law-abiding people follow gun laws (which ignores the fact that weak gun laws in some states undercut tougher restrictions in others).</p>
<p>In Virginia, though, we sure make it easy for criminals to avoid them.</p>

(Public Domain via Wikimedia)</p><p>Recreational anglers will see their allowable catch of striped bass curtailed this fall, an effort by state regulators to protect a diminishing stock they say is being overfished.</p>
<p>The Virginia Marine Resources Commission on Tuesday unanimously approved emergency regulations that will limit fishermen to a single fish between 20 and 36 inches long per day during the coming fall recreational season.</p>
<p>Deputy Commissioner Ellen Bolen said the commission&#8217;s staff found that 2018 was the lowest estimate of the harvest of striped bass since a moratorium was placed on the fishery in 1990.</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor management of striped bass over the past decade has caused significant economic harm to Virginians who depend on healthy fisheries for their livelihoods and has reduced opportunities for recreational anglers,” said Virginia Secretary of Natural Resources Matthew J. Strickler.</p>
<p>“We need other states to follow our example and help rebuild the striped bass population starting immediately. Delay is unacceptable and the Atlantic State Marine Fisheries Commission must take decisive action that will ensure restoration of this fishery up and down the coast.”</p>
<p>In April, <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/04/28/striped-bass-in-chesapeake-bay/" target="_blank">the state canceled</a> the trophy striped bass season as part of an effort to guard against overfishing.</p>
<p>&#8220;The recent stock assessment shows that immediate action is needed to slow the decline and restore this fishery to sustainable levels,” Virginia Marine Resources Commissioner Steven G. Bowman said in a statement. “Restoring this fishery to its full potential will require further actions for the commercial and recreational fisheries in the coming months.”</p>
<p>Though the recreational striped bass fishery is closed right now, Bolen said the commission issued the emergency regulations to give anglers advance notice as the Oct. 4 start of the fall recreational season approaches. Previously anglers were allowed to keep two fish: one between 20 and 28 inches and one allowed to exceed 28 inches with no maximum size.<strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p>The new restrictions also require a maximum gill net size (the size of the gap in the mesh) of 9 inches in the coastal commercial fishery and 7 inches in the Chesapeake Bay fishery. The commission says the measures will &#8220;lower overall mortality of striped bass and protect the large breeding fish that are critical to the health and future of the population.&#8221;</p>
<p>The regulations will be revisited by the commission at its September meeting, which will include public comment.</p>
<p>“With the reduced numbers of striped bass found by the recent coastwide stock assessment, Virginia should be commended for taking decisive action at this time,&#8221; said Chris Moore, a scientist with the Chesapeake Bay Foundation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Strong conservation-minded decisions such as this are needed all along the East Coast to bring back a thriving population of this iconic fish. The VMRC’s proactive measures to help improve the striped bass population is another positive sign that Virginia is serious about ensuring a healthier fishery in the future.”</p>
<p>Capt. Alan Alexander, who runs York River Charters out of Gloucester Point, said the new restrictions weren&#8217;t unexpected, though he said they would likely make some customers think twice before booking a trip.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not going to help us business-wise,&#8221; he said. He reiterated a common complaint among sport fishermen: the menhaden-reduction fishery operated by Omega Protein out of Reedville sucks up too much of the stripers&#8217; food supply.</p>
<p>&#8220;If they would focus as much on the menhaden fishing in the bay as they would the striped bass I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;d have a striped bass problem,&#8221; he said, adding that it&#8217;s hard to overstate the importance &#8220;of that stinky, oily fish as forage.&#8221;</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no more politically fraught fish in Virginia then menhaden, <a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/virginia/government-politics/general-assembly/fish-fight-governor-s-bill-on-menhaden-catch-limits-advances/article_97fae3c3-280f-5e3b-9f75-aa2320488cc9.html" target="_blank">the only species regulated by the General Assembly</a> instead of the Marine Resources Commission.</p>
<p>Conservationists and sport fishermen have squared off in legislative committee meetings against the politically muscular commercial fishing operation over catch quotas in the Chesapeake Bay, where Omega&#8217;s boats can pull in plenty of fish without having to burn the fuel it takes to get out to the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>Virginia <a href="http://www.asmfc.org/uploads/file/5c5c6f03pr06VA_MenhadenCompliance.pdf" target="_blank">evaded a sanction</a> earlier this year for failing to adopt new menhaden catch limits imposed for the bay by the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission, which said it will avoid action as long as the fishery remains below a new, lower cap of 51,000 metric tons set for the bay.</p>
<p>&#8220;If the cap is exceeded, the board can reconsider the issue of compliance,&#8221; the commission said in a statement. &#8220;While the bay cap was established as a precautionary measure given the importance of menhaden as a prey species, additional information stemming from the development of ecological-based reference points may be informative to the bay cap issue.&#8221;</p>
<p>The commission&#8217;s menhaden management board says it will consider modifying the cap after those studies are in, which is projected to be next year.</p>
<p>&#8220;The bottom line is, it&#8217;s not rocket science. If you have forage, you will have predators; if you don&#8217;t, you won&#8217;t,&#8221; Alexander said.</p>
<p><em>UPDATE:</em></p>
<p>Mike Avery, president of the the Virginia Saltwater Sportfishing Association, said the group, which is generally supportive of measures to preserve striped bass numbers, took issue with the commission acting before receiving public comment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our opinion is VMRC is abusing their authority,” Avery said, adding that the restrictions are &#8220;feel-good&#8221; measures since Virginia anglers account for such a small percentage of striped bass caught along the Atlantic coast.</p>
<p>Between 2016 and 2018, Maryland took in about 42 percent of all striped bass harvested along the Atlantic coast. New Jersey and New York had the next biggest harvests, accounting for about 19 and 15 percent, respectively. Virginia accounted for about 3 percent of the overall harvest.</p>
<p>&#8220;These fish are in trouble and we have to start now in protecting the fish. Most of the anglers want to see these fish conserved and brought back and everyone’s willing to tighten the belt and do their part,&#8221; Avery said. &#8220;We just want the other states to do their part too.”</p>
<p>The Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission, the regional group that manages more than two dozen species, <a href="http://www.asmfc.org/uploads/file/5d5c081eStripedBassDraftAddVI_PublicComment_Aug2019.pdf" target="_blank">is considering changes</a> to the management plan for striped bass to address overfishing.</p>
<p>UPDATE: <em>This article has been updated to add comment from Mike Avery, president of the Virginia Saltwater Sportfishing Association.</em></p>

CCO Creative Commons via Pixabay. https://ecigarettereviewed.com/</p><p>Three cases of a severe lung illness associated with vaping have been reported in Virginia, the state Health Department reported Monday in a warning about the risks of e-cigarettes.</p>
<p>As of last week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had identified 193 potential cases of the vaping-related lung illness in 22 states.</p>
<p>&#8220;Symptoms of this illness have included gradual onset of cough, shortness of breath or fatigue that gets worse over a period of days or weeks, until the patient has to be admitted to the hospital for treatment,&#8221; the state Health Department <a href="http://www.vdh.virginia.gov/news/2019-news-releases/virginia-department-of-health-warns-of-new-danger-of-vaping/" target="_blank">said in a news release.</a> &#8220;Some patients have also reported vomiting, diarrhea and fatigue.&#8221;</p>
<p>Since 2014, e-cigarettes have been the most commonly used tobacco product among American middle and high school students, the health department said, with the number using vaping products increasing by 1.5 million nationwide between 2017 and 2018.</p>
<p>This year, the Virginia General Assembly passed legislation, <a href="https://www.nbc12.com/2019/02/22/virginia-governor-signs-ban-people-under-buying-tobacco/" target="_blank">signed by Gov. Ralph Northam</a>, that raised the age to buy tobacco or nicotine vapor products from 18 to 21, largely driven by concern about the number of teenagers vaping.</p>

(Ned Oliver/ Virginia Mercury) </p><p>Sooner or later, this was bound to happen.</p>
<p>When Virginia&#8217;s own Ken Cuccinelli — the former attorney general famous for attempting to<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/23/science/earth/23virginia.html" target="_blank"> prosecute climate change research</a>, covering up <a href="https://pilotonline.com/news/article_36f89ba4-ca4a-529a-be8f-31e8c1736068.html" target="_blank">Virtus&#8217; bareness</a>, suing to <a href="https://www.dailypress.com/government/dp-nws-cuccinelli-0220-20140219-story.html" target="_blank">overturn Obamacare</a>, defending <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/cuccinelli-loses-his-long-war-against-sodomy" target="_blank">anti-sodomy laws</a> and other conservative windmill-tilting that even rolled the eyes of many a Republican here — joined the Trump administration as a top immigration official, it was only a matter of time before he stepped in it.</p>
<p>This week, the inevitable occurred, when <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/08/13/750727515/rule-would-penalize-immigrants-to-u-s-for-needing-benefits" target="_blank">Cuccinelli observed to NPR</a> that &#8220;The New Colossus,&#8221; the famous poem on the Statue of Liberty about the wretched refuse of teeming shores and huddled masses yearning to breath free, really meant: &#8220;Give me your tired and your poor who can stand on their own two feet and who will not become a public charge.&#8221;</p>
<p>Later, on CNN, he made things worse.</p>
<p>&#8220;That poem was referrring back to people coming from Europe where they had class-based societies, where people were considered wretched if they weren&#8217;t in the right class,&#8221; Cuccinelli told a coiled-and-ready-to-strike Erin Burnett in a wholly uneccessary detour, a product of his penchant for pedantry that blew up in his face.</p>
<p>He attempted to go on to explain that the public charge rule, which had been part of U.S. immigration policy for years prior, was expanded in 1903, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/08/14/ken-cuccinelli-statue-liberty-poor/" target="_blank">the same year the &#8220;Colossus&#8221; poem was inscribed on the Statue of Liberty. </a></p>
<p>But after his comments were sucked into the social media machine, where outrage never sleeps, the takeaway was this:</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/brianschatz/status/1161446212194557952" target="_blank">https://twitter.com/brianschatz/status/1161446212194557952</a></p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/RepDonBeyer/status/1161443128257196035" target="_blank">https://twitter.com/RepDonBeyer/status/1161443128257196035</a></p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/StephenAtHome/status/1161438109915078669" target="_blank">https://twitter.com/StephenAtHome/status/1161438109915078669</a></p>
<p>Ouch.  It&#8217;s an awkward spot for the Cooch to be in for sure, defending policies from a president <a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/virginia/government-politics/virginia-delegation-joins-short-lived-convention-revolt-over-rnc-rules/article_6e9c2aba-6eed-5ce5-9eba-2aca6db25ca8.html" target="_blank">he fought to keep off the ballot</a>. He had also sought recently to refashion himself as something of a bi-partisan reformer, lending his, um, name recognition <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/05/07/coalition-takes-aim-at-virginias-vampire-squid-how-much-will-it-make-it-squirm/" target="_blank">to a push to break</a> Dominion Energy and Appalachian Power&#8217;s chokehold on Virginia electric customers.</p>
<p>But, unfortunately, it&#8217;s also no surprise that Cuccinelli would be out front on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/12/us/politics/trump-immigration-policy.html" target="_blank">a draconian policy</a> that would penalize legal immigrants who avail themselves of public benefits, a needlessly cruel move that, when taken with this administration&#8217;s demonization of the other and persecution of desperate asylum seekers, sure looks like they only want a certain kind of immigrant in this country.</p>
<p>Since his elevation to his new federal post, Cuccinelli&#8217;s past remarks <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2013/10/14/did-cuccinelli-compare-immigration-policy-to-exterminating-rats/" target="_blank">likening rat control</a> to immigration policy have also been thrust back into the spotlight, a callous and cavalier comparison that underscore <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/what-ken-cuccinelli-brings-to-trumps-hardline-push-on-immigration" target="_blank">his true hardline immigration stance</a>.</p>
<p>Which is sad and hypocritical, because, once upon a time, government officials in this country<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/02/opinion/illegal-immigration-italian-americans.html" target="_blank"> officially concluded</a> that “certain kinds of criminality are inherent&#8221; in people with names like Cuccinelli&#8217;s and mine.</p>
<p>And though many Italian-American families like to tell themselves their ancestors came over legally, worked hard and became model citizens right away, that, of course, wasn&#8217;t always the reality. It certainly wasn&#8217;t <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/11/02/the-ugly-face-of-nativism-is-on-full-display-with-a-modern-twist/" target="_blank">in the case of some of my relatives</a>.</p>
<p>I said it last year, as the president outrageously, cynically and shamelessly stoked fears about migrants in the run-up to the midterms, and I&#8217;ll say it again: The descendants of immigrants who came here looking for a better life should be the first to champion a humane, thoughtful and inclusive immigration policy.</p>
<p>Sadly, too many of the children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren of the Irish, Italian, Polish, Slovak, Hungarian and other European immigrants who were subjected to prejudice and abuse when they arrived in droves on these shores <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2019/08/13/danger-vilifying-poor-immigrants/" target="_blank">seem to favor</a> drawing up the ladder behind them.</p>
<p>I would be remiss, though, if I didn&#8217;t point out that Cuccinelli was not the only prominent Italian-American to give a poor accounting of himself this week.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NAwowhwi9c" target="_blank">Witness CNN anchor Chris Cuomo</a> do his best impersonation of a guido auditioning for &#8220;Jersey Shore,&#8221; (only missing the &#8220;<a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=COME%20AT%20ME%20BRO" target="_blank">Come at me bro</a>&#8221; bit) when faced with a heckler who called him &#8220;Fredo,&#8221; a reference to the hapless second son from &#8220;The Godfather&#8221; book and movies.</p>
<p>To be fair, and to quote another genre classic, the guy did <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcwxobtNRFQ" target="_blank">&#8220;insult him a little bit.&#8221;</a></p>
<p>But Cuomo went way overboard (as did CNN in trying to defend him) in trying to claim that calling him &#8220;Fredo&#8221; was an &#8220;ethnic slur&#8221; akin to the N-word.</p>
<p>There are lots of ethnic slurs for Italians, as Cuomo surely knows, most of them packed into a single line in the first &#8220;Godfather,&#8221; delivered by the movie producer who later finds a prized horse&#8217;s head in bed with him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care how many dago, guinea, wop, greaseball, goombas come out of the woodwork,&#8221; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4N_UkHyBvc" target="_blank">Jack Woltz tells Corleone</a> crime family consigliere Tom Hagen.</p>
<p>Fredo? Not so much.</p>
<p>Taken with the re-emergence of Anthony Scaramucci, who claims to have suddenly discovered a conscience and <a href="https://www.wdel.com/news/national/scaramucci-says-spicer-is-right-about-this/video_af877cad-ff8b-5c30-9f56-e262593b5fdf.html" target="_blank">is now speaking out</a> about his former boss, the president, and former White House press secretary Sean Spicer (who, in a cringey moment, the Mooch called &#8220;Liar Spice from the Spice Girls&#8221;) after his blink-and-you-missed-it turn as White House communications director in 2017, we&#8217;re not doing our ancestors proud.</p>
<p>No one&#8217;s chanting to send us back yet.</p>
<p>But I couldn&#8217;t necessarily blame them just now if they did.</p>

<p>From the Flannagan Reservoir in Dickenson County to parts of Lake Anna, you check where advisories have been posted <a href="http://www.vdh.virginia.gov/environmental-epidemiology/harmful-algal-blooms-habs/algal-bloom-surveillance-map/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Be aware of algae blooms and avoid water that smells, is discolored or where there are dead fish present,&#8221; the state warns. You can report blooms and fish kills<a href="http://www.vdh.virginia.gov/environmental-epidemiology/waterborne-hazards-control/" target="_blank"> here</a>.</p>
<p>A Wilmington, N.C., couple<a href="https://www.starnewsonline.com/news/20190812/after-wilmington-dogs-die-awareness-of-algal-blooms-grows" target="_blank"> who lost three dogs</a> last week hours after playing in a pond contaminated with the algae have drawn national attention to the dangers the bacteria pose to pets.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is the most horrific death that you could ever experience. Our dogs did not die peacefully,&#8221; said Melissa Martin, the dogs&#8217; owner, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/videos/news/2019/08/12/3-dogs-die-hours-after-playing-pond-toxic-algae/1993036001/?fbclid=IwAR3fWYAgDaBfWZ3O9bb7klj47rd5HJeMJ0FWbVoav7vs-hoQP87d8XOsgh8" target="_blank">says in a video</a> posted by USA Today. &#8220;That water was completely clear.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cyanobacteria are microscopic organisms found naturally in all types of water, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The blooms create cyanotoxins, which the CDC says &#8220;are among the most powerful natural poisons known&#8221; that can sicken people, pets and other animals. There are &#8220;no remedies to counteract the effects&#8221; and it&#8217;s impossible to tell if a bloom has toxins by looking at it. The blooms themselves can be tough to see.</p>
<p>&#8220;They sometimes stay below the water’s surface, they sometimes float to the surface,&#8221; the CDC says. &#8220;Some cyanobacteria blooms can look like foam, scum, or mats, particularly when the wind blows them toward a shoreline. The blooms can be blue, bright green, brown, or red.&#8221;</p>
<p>The CDC <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/09/10/whats-causing-toxic-algae-blooms-in-lake-anna/" target="_blank">also says climate change</a> can make the blooms worse.</p>

<p>My past thoughts on the numbing frequency of mass shootings and guns are <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/06/09/is-there-a-way-past-gun-gridlock/" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/07/08/the-good-guy-with-a-gun-an-all-around-recipe-for-disaster/" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/05/14/its-not-too-late-to-reverse-our-shameful-collective-impotence-on-mass-shootings/" target="_blank">here</a>. And I haven&#8217;t made a secret of how I feel about Donald Trump&#8217;s <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/07/29/really-dangerous-trump-and-our-national-division/" target="_blank">fitness for office</a> or what he <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/11/02/the-ugly-face-of-nativism-is-on-full-display-with-a-modern-twist/" target="_blank">says about immigrants</a> and others who don&#8217;t fit in his MAGA vision.</p>
<p>Rather, I would have you think about Jordan and Andre Anchondo, heading to the Walmart in El Paso with their 2-month-old baby to buy school supplies and party decorations for their children, one of those mundane moments we all take for granted in our daily lives, preparing for something else, looking forward to a coming happy occasion.</p>
<p>That would be the last moment they would ever have, shot to death as they attempted to shield their infant from yet another American mass killer, armed with a semiautomatic rifle and extended magazines, apparently motivated by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/03/us/patrick-crusius-el-paso-shooter-manifesto.html" target="_blank">white supremacist fears of &#8220;a Hispanic invasion.&#8221;  </a></p>
<p>“From the baby’s injuries, they said that more than likely my sister was trying to shield him,” Leta Jamrowski told <a href="https://www.apnews.com/eb1ac95c2cc24d08a8a03d89b1acb0de" target="_blank">the Associated Press</a>. “So when she got shot she was holding him and she fell on him, so that’s why he broke some of his bones. So he pretty much lived because she gave her life.”</p>
<p>Think of 6-year-old Stephen Romero,<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/29/us/gilroy-festival-shooting.html" target="_blank"> one of two children killed</a> in the mass shooting at the Garlic Festival in Gilroy, Calif., playing near a bounce house before he was shot in the back.</p>
<p>Then, turn to Dayton, Ohio, where the motives of the man who killed nine people and wounded more than two dozen more with a semi-automatic rifle equipped with a 100-round drum are still murky. That&#8217;s where an angry crowd <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/08/05/do-something-dewine-dayton-ohio-mass-shooting-vigil/" target="_blank">shouted down</a> Republican Gov. Mike DeWine&#8217;s post-massacre platitudes with a two-word chant that we all should adopt: &#8220;Do something.&#8221;</p>
<p>If your reaction to the mass killings of innocents is to continue to paper over the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/18/republicans-seek-to-alarm-trumps-base-in-midterm-campaign-ads.html" target="_blank">virulent fear and loathing</a> of &#8220;the other&#8221; poisoning conservativism; to twist yourself into knots defending our president&#8217;s <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2019/08/05/dayton-el-paso-donald-trump-republicans-wont-fix-gun-laws-column/1917594001/" target="_blank">incessant attempts</a> to stoke division; to continue to spout nonsense about &#8220;<a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/8/5/20755047/dayton-mass-shooting-timeline-good-guy-with-a-gun-myth" target="_blank">good guys with guns,&#8221;</a> gun-free zones and defending against tyranny; or to stand at a rally in a red hat and shout &#8220;send her back,&#8221; stop and take a deep breath.</p>
<p>Most importantly, just stop.</p>
<p>We live in a time and place where men, women and children are gunned down in public places with horrific regularity, where some of the El Paso victims were reportedly afraid of seeking medical treatment <a href="https://twitter.com/atrupar/status/1157803228530188289" target="_blank">because of their immigration status</a>, where white nationalist violence is so alarmingly ascendant that the editors of the conservative National Review published an editorial Sunday exhorting Americans to &#8220;<a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/08/el-paso-shooting-white-supremacy-evil-ideology/" target="_blank">crush this evil</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>A society that countenances so many atrocities can no longer even pretend to consider itself civilized.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re OK with it, I probably can&#8217;t convince you to change your mind. If you can&#8217;t bear to part with your 30-round magazine, even if there&#8217;s a chance a ban might spare another parent from having to gaze upon the bodies of their children perforated with bullets, as happened at Sandy Hook, or submit to mandatory reporting of lost and stolen firearms if it might help prevent the straw purchases and trafficking that <a href="https://lawcenter.giffords.org/gun-laws/policy-areas/gun-owner-responsibilities/reporting-lost-stolen-firearms/" target="_blank">fuel gang killings and other gun crime</a>, so be it.</p>
<p>But I suspect there are more people like me than you. And because of your obstinacy, our patience with politicians who continue to sit on the wrong side of the fence is running out. The proffered solutions — universal background checks, high capacity magazine bans, red-flag laws, safe storage, mandatory reporting of lost and stolen guns, among others — are imperfect.</p>
<p>However, because they cannot prevent every conceivable instance of gun violence is no reason to do nothing. Thoughts, prayers and hearts going out into the empty ether of social media have long since become a joke, especially for politicians <a href="https://twitter.com/AJFriedenberger/status/1158393229689204743" target="_blank">who can&#8217;t be bothered</a> to come up with new ways to phrase their empty gestures for each mass shooting.</p>
<p>Do something.</p>
