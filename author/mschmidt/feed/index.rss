(Pixabay/Creative Commons license)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia lawmakers are preparing to reintroduce bipartisan legislation aimed at creating a regulated and taxed adult-use cannabis marketplace in the state. The renewed push comes after Gov. Glenn Youngkin vetoed a similar proposal earlier this year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Paul Krizek, D-Fairfax, and Sen. Aaron Rouse, D-Virginia Beach, are once again spearheading the effort, planning to bring forward the same proposal that previously passed both chambers of the General Assembly with bipartisan support. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB448" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The measure</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as sent to Youngkin’s desk at the time, would establish a legal framework to regulate the sale and taxation of cannabis for adults 21 and older, marking a significant step toward implementing the retail market many advocates have long championed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re trying to start with the same bill since we were able to get both chambers aboard, including a couple Republicans. I think there’s a good chance that a few more Republicans will join in this time, especially in the Senate,” Krizek said in a phone interview earlier this week. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While several GOP lawmakers supported the proposal at various points as it moved through the legislature during the 2024 session, only Sen. Christie New Craig, R-Chesapeake, voted for the bill’s final version in the state Senate. In the House, freshman Del. Chris Obenshain, R-Montgomery County, a former assistant attorney general, was the sole Republican to back the measure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia was the first southern state to legalize public possession of up to one ounce of marijuana by adults 21 and over and allow them to grow up to four plants of marijuana in a private residence. However, the General Assembly has yet to create a framework for a legal marketplace for cannabis products in the commonwealth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without a legal market in place, residents can grow small amounts at home or possess cannabis, but buying or selling it remains illegal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the proposed plan, the state would license cannabis retailers, establish clear rules for production and sales, and tax products to generate new revenue. Lawmakers argue that a regulated market would also curtail illegal cannabis sales and provide consumer protections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this year, the General Assembly approved a version of the bill that would have established a market, only for Youngkin to veto the legislation, citing concerns over enforcement and the state’s role in managing cannabis commerce. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The proposed legalization of retail marijuana in the commonwealth endangers Virginians’ health and safety,” </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/101RteYQu09LrjbzzSqiFu9EIxyw7jMcCEnRvwRap-NA/edit?tab=t.0" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">he said in a statement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in March. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“States following this path have seen adverse effects on children’s and adolescent’s health and safety, increased gang activity and violent crime, significant deterioration in mental health, decreased road safety, and significant costs associated with retail marijuana that far exceed tax revenue.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin has since repeatedly expressed skepticism about expanding legal cannabis in Virginia, and his spokesman Christian Martinez said on Wednesday that this hasn’t changed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Krizek remains hopeful that in his final year as governor, Youngkin may be open to negotiating with Democrats as he looks to solidify his legacy.</span></p>

Paul Krizek, D-Fairfax (courtesy of Krizek campaign)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I can’t get into his head, obviously, but I think it’s for that reason it’s worth trying, it’s worth putting this out as an opportunity for a compromise in some other capacity,” Krizek said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">”I think it&#8217;s very possible, because he’s already a lame duck and this is it for him, and if he wants to have one of his legacies be an unregulated cannabis free-for-all, then that will be his legacy. Or he could choose a rational marketplace with safe, tested and taxed products.”</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.roanoke.edu/documents/rcpoll/RC%20Poll%20Topline%20Feb2024.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A poll</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> conducted by the Institute for Policy and Opinion Research at Roanoke College and released during the legislative debate found that 63% of Virginians strongly or somewhat support measures to help small businesses compete with pharmaceutical companies and existing medical cannabis dispensaries, while only 15% are somewhat or strongly opposed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And advocates believe there is growing momentum to push the legislation forward again. Supporters highlight the potential for tax revenue, job creation, and investments in addiction treatment and restorative justice programs funded by cannabis taxes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Greg Habeeb, a former Republican member of the House of Delegates from Salem and a lobbyist for the Virginia Cannabis Association who helped draft Rouse’s bill earlier this year, said in an interview Thursday that Youngkin’s veto of the legislation caused an explosion of illegal corner marijuana stores, pop up shops and street dealers across the state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Everybody who was trying to engage in this market in a proper way, some of the people selling hemp products, some of the people selling CPD products, they’ve almost all been wiped out of business,” Habeeb said. “That’s exactly what we said would happen if the government vetoed the bill to the extent there was a legally operating market in which this is essentially destroyed, and yet every day there are stories about raids and busts and illegal stores.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eventually Virginia is “going to have to wake up and create a regulated system, so we can get rid of these illegal stores and get this stuff out of the hands of our dealers and kids,” Habeeb said, adding that Republicans will continue to say its  Democrats fault for legalizing cannabis in the first place, and both Democrats and Republicans will continue to blame each other for the status quo, if it remains unchanged.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How that plays out for their individual legacies will have to be seen, but collectively creating a system where it’s legal to possess, legal to share, legal to grow, but illegal to sell in a regulated way, has created this system. It is completely unacceptable and I think history will tell us that it was a disaster.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The discussion around creating a legal marketplace for adult-use cannabis in Virginia is reignited as the Virginia Cannabis Control Authority (CCA) — the state agency created in 2021 to oversee the regulation and enforcement of cannabis laws in Virginia — unveiled its </span><a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/664229cd06b6f9326d1e815c/t/675708223e9a06386996e75e/1733756963828/2024-Virginia-Statewide-Impaired-Driving-Survey-report.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">latest survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on marijuana-impaired driving. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Between August and September, the CCA surveyed 783 Virginia residents aged 16 or older with a driver’s license, including 310 who identified as past three-month marijuana users. The results, which build on the inaugural 2022 study, were released as part of National Impaired Driving Prevention Month this December.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The survey revealed nearly one-third of Virginia drivers believe those who consume marijuana are typically safe drivers. Furthermore, 22% of respondents admitted to driving while high a few times a year or more, and 34% acknowledged riding as passengers with drivers under the influence of marijuana. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forty-six percent of marijuana users reported they do not always plan for a sober ride home. These figures remain unchanged or have increased since the 2022 survey, underscoring the need for continued education and awareness campaigns, the CCA said in a statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite these concerns, the survey also pointed to progress. The percentage of drivers who believe they are likely to be pulled over for driving under the influence of marijuana increased to 29%, up from 24% in 2022. Additionally, 47% of marijuana users said they always plan for a sober ride home, up from 42% last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This survey shows that while we’ve made some progress, there’s still considerable work to do,” said Jeremy Preiss, acting Head and Chief Officer of Regulatory, Policy, and External Affairs at the CCA. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Driving under the influence of marijuana is illegal in Virginia. State law prohibits using cannabis while driving or as a passenger in a vehicle. Violations can result in fines, license suspension, or even jail time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the survey still found that 1 in 10 Virginia drivers (9%) incorrectly assume that there is no penalty for driving under the influence of marijuana.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite enforcement concerns and Youngkin’s previous resistance, Krizek and Rouse — who is seeking his party’s nomination for lieutenant governor in 2025 — remain optimistic that a renewed effort can succeed, especially with continued bipartisan backing and public support for a regulated market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their proposal is expected to be introduced when the General Assembly reconvenes in January. It will likely reignite debate over cannabis reform in Virginia, as lawmakers weigh economic benefits, public health concerns, and the political landscape leading up to the 2025 gubernatorial elections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’d never say never, but I also realize that the governor has been pretty adamantly against the bill,” Krizek said. “I still think we have to do it, it would be legislative malpractice to not give it another try.” </span></p>

Glenn Youngkin presents his proposed amendments to the state's biennial budget before a joint meeting of the Virginia General Assembly's money committees in Richmond on Wednesday. (Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the cusp of his last full year in office, Gov. Glenn Youngkin on Wednesday unveiled a sweeping budget proposal that he hopes will define his legacy as Virginia’s 74th governor. Focused on tax cuts, infrastructure, education, and public health, the plan sets the stage for what could be a high-stakes 2025 legislative session as lawmakers weigh his ambitious priorities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We reopened Virginia’s economy after a global pandemic all while delivering surplus after surplus,” Youngkin said during a joint meeting of the General Assembly’s money committees in Richmond. “Virginia is growing, Virginia is leading, and Virginia is winning. And this morning I ask you to join me in continuing that work together.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin emphasized the state’s strong economic performance, pointing to job growth, corporate investment, and robust revenue increases. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The stock market is strong, and the Federal Reserve appears poised to reduce interest rates over the next year,” he said. “This backdrop further supports Virginia’s ongoing strong performance, with year-to-date revenues up 7.3% over 2024.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Highlighting more than $5 billion in tax cuts already delivered to Virginians over the last three years, Youngkin proposed additional measures to lower the cost of living. “Together, the commonwealth can make a clear statement that reducing tax burdens so Virginians can keep more of their hard-earned money in their pockets is not a Republican idea, it’s not a Democrat idea, it’s just common sense,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A cornerstone in Youngkin’s proposed revisions to the two-year budget is a renewed push to eliminate the locally imposed personal car tax, an issue that he first came to embrace earlier this year after two Democrats campaigning for legislative seats in Southwest Virginia </span><a href="https://cardinalnews.org/2023/10/13/two-virginia-democrats-embrace-a-former-republican-governors-signature-policy-eliminate-the-car-tax/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">adopted it</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as part of their platforms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The car tax has been a Republican rallying point since 1997, when GOP gubernatorial nominee Jim Gilmore successfully campaigned on repealing the unpopular levy. However, without a clear plan during the 2024 legislative session, the proposal quickly fizzled. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Wednesday, Youngkin once again urged the General Assembly to abolish what he called Virginia’s “most hated tax since the tax on tea” that he said cost the average Virginia family of four about $290 annually. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Standing here today, I will renew my call for us to work to fully eliminate the car tax, but recognizing that this might not be possible in this short session, there is an incremental step that we should take together to provide additional car tax relief,” Youngkin said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the new proposal, the state would deposit $1.1 billion into a car tax credit fund to provide income tax rebates to nearly 1.9 million taxpayers earning up to $50,000 in adjusted gross income for individuals or $100,000 for couples filing jointly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eligible taxpayers would receive up to $150 for individual returns or $300 for joint returns annually for the next three years. After the fund is exhausted, the state would see a permanent reduction of $360 million in tax revenues each year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin also is asking the legislature to extend the standard deductions for state income tax returns — currently set at  $8,500 for individuals and $17,000 for joint filers — that are set to expire at the end of next year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Failure to make the standard deduction permanent before Jan. 1, 2026, would result in tax increases of $57 million in fiscal year 2026 and $1.2 billion in fiscal year 2027, the governor said. “My friends, there is no reason to raise taxes on Virginians. We are running surplus after surplus after surplus.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic lawmakers responded cautiously to Youngkin’s budget plan Wednesday, emphasizing the need to review the details before committing to any initiatives. With the legislative session set to begin in January, both the House and Senate are preparing to roll out their own budget amendment proposals, signaling potential negotiations ahead.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our focus will remain on targeted investments that benefit all Virginians,” said House Appropriations Chair Del. Luke Torian, D-Prince William. “We will explore how we can work across the aisle to ensure K-12 schools are fully funded, higher education is accessible, and affordable housing becomes a reality for more families. These are areas where we can and should find common ground.”</span></p>

(Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, in a statement thanked Youngkin for presenting his budget and for “initiating this important conversation.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Now, our responsibility is to evaluate these proposals thoughtfully and collaboratively to ensure they reflect the priorities of all Virginians. We can craft a budget that strengthens our schools, supports our communities, and provides real solutions for working families,” Scott said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And Sen. Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, the Senate’s president pro tempore, said that while her chamber will consider his proposal, the Democrats’ amendments will look different. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Senate budget will provide relief to working families and individuals and invest in their education and well-being, while maintaining the commonwealth&#8217;s long-term fiscal health,” Lucas said. “Here in the Senate, we look beyond elections and talk-show appearances and budget for the long-haul.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other key initiatives in Youngkin’s proposed budget amendments:</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘No tax on tips’</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The administration is also proposing </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/12/16/youngkin-pitches-tax-relief-for-tipped-workers-in-budget-plan/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to eliminate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> state taxes on tips for service industry workers, a policy similar to one championed by President-elect Donald Trump. If approved, the measure would allow tipped workers to claim a deduction on their state tax returns, with compliance monitored through IRS data and employer-reported W-2 forms. The proposal could benefit an estimated 250,000 Virginians. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Virginia has an incredible hospitality, restaurant and service industry, and hardworking Virginians should keep every penny of the tips they earn through their exceptional service. My proposal is very simple — no more taxes on tips,” Youngkin said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the move is being framed as a win for workers, its broader implications remain unclear. Economists warn that some employers might exploit the policy by shifting more of a worker’s compensation to tips rather than wages, a concern </span><a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/trump-and-harris-say-theyll-kill-taxes-on-tips-how-would-that-work" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">also raised</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> around similar federal legislation. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Education </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin is proposing nearly $1 billion in new education funding, including a $50-million Virginia Opportunity Scholarship Program to provide $5,000 annual grants for private school expenses like tuition and transportation. About 10,000 K-12 students from families earning up to twice the federal poverty limit to qualify for free school meals would qualify, with funding coming from revenue growth, not existing education budgets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The plan includes $25 million for lab school partnerships with historically Black colleges and universities and nearly $500 for higher education capital projects. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, there is no new funding for college operating expenses, and Youngkin is pushing for a 2.5% cap on tuition increases. “It’s time for our colleges to cut administrative bloat and handle costs without asking taxpayers for more,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additional proposals include $290 million for school construction, $550 million in direct aid, $6.8 million for school resource officers, and $50 million to support underperforming schools. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">VMSDEP</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Military Survivors and Dependents Education Program </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/07/jlarc-review-of-vmsdep-no-evidence-of-peak-or-decline-in-participation-levels/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">(VMSDEP)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which provides tuition waivers to spouses and children of military members killed or permanently disabled in service, would receive $60 million from a surplus in the state’s 529 college savings program to address a funding shortfall.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers scrutinized the program last year after it was initially excluded from budget negotiations. Concerns over its sustainability arose as participation surged by nearly 350%, growing from about 1,400 participants in 2019 to about 6,400 in 2023. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The allocation would come without any new policy proposals.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Withholding funds to quash ‘sanctuary cities’ </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin further echored national Republican rhetoric by declaring that “every state has become a border state” as he unveiled plans to </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/youngkin-wants-to-restrict-funding-for-localities-that-dont-comply-with-immigration-enforcement/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cut funding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to localities that limit or refuse compliance with U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement (ICE). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposal aligns with a broader GOP push against “sanctuary city” policies, which vary but often involve local governments choosing not to inquire about immigration status or declining full cooperation with ICE. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But with Virginia’s legislature under Democratic control, this proposal is expected to face significant opposition during the upcoming budget negotiations.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Boosting maternal health outcomes</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin and Democratic lawmakers are prioritizing </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/momnibus-package-aims-to-close-maternal-health-gaps-across-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">maternal health</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in their legislative and budget </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/12/17/in-bipartisan-push-virginia-lawmakers-target-rural-healthcare-crisis/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">proposals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, increasing the chances that some measures will make it through budget negotiations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s plan </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/youngkin-unveils-plan-to-improve-maternal-health-in-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">includes $2.5 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for perinatal health hubs, expanded funding for OB-GYN residencies, and a $500,000 education campaign to help parents recognize life threatening conditions like heart attacks or eclampsia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also proposes $1 million to support workforce development for midwives and doulas, both crucial professions in addressing care gaps and advocating for patients, particularly those of color impacted by racial health disparities. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Mental health support</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Virginia enters its third year of its Right Help, Right Now initiative, Youngkin’s latest budget request includes </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/12/13/meet-people-where-they-are-special-teams-aid-va-s-efforts-to-expand-mental-health-care-services/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$35 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to improve crisis response involving law enforcement. The funding would support hiring </span><a href="https://www.dcjs.virginia.gov/licensure-and-regulatory-affairs/special-conservators-peace" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">special conservators of the peace</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or “s-cops,” as Youngkin calls them.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These intermediaries would assist with individuals awaiting hospital admissions after mental health crises, aiming to de-escalate situations where people in crisis might unintentionally harm  officers and face jail time. Youngkin envisions the “s-cops” fostering better outcomes for those in crisis while allowing law enforcement officers to focus on their regular duties.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Disaster relief</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The administration proposes allocating $127 million toward a permanent </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/09/20/after-hurley-and-whitewood-floods-virginia-considers-state-relief-fund/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">disaster relief fund</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to aid victims of natural disasters beyond what the federal assistance, insurance and private donations cover. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Southwest Virginia has faced repeated flooding in recent years, most recently from Hurricane Helene in September, which claimed three lives and caused $4.4 billion in </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/12/03/va-dept-of-transportation-estimates-hurricane-helene-debris-cleanup-will-take-3-to-6-months/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">damage</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Youngkin said $25 million could come from the general fund, with $102 million sourced from the latest round of revenues of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin had previously </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/20/judge-deems-youngkins-actions-to-withdraw-virginia-from-rggi-unlawful/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sought to withdraw</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Virginia from RGGI, despite praise from environmental groups for its funding for flood resilience and energy efficiency programs. “I fully expect that the General Assembly will work constructively together in this next short session to appropriate funds specifically for Hurricane Helene relief,” he said on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Mamie Locke, D-Hampton, questioned the governor’s proposal, pointing to his approach of using RGGI revenues. “Why not just put us back in RGGI?” she asked, while noting uncertainty about the fund’s legislative support.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Don’t know yet,” she said in an interview. </span></p>

(Courtesy of Luther Cifers campaign). </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Luther Cifers, a businessman from Prince Edward County, emerged victorious in the Republican nomination contest for Virginia’s 10th Senate District during a mass meeting at the Goochland Rec Center.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The meeting, which drew hundreds of Republican voters, began Friday evening and stretched into the early hours of Saturday as participants navigated a lengthy multi-ballot process to select a nominee from a crowded field of seven candidates. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cifers secured the majority needed to clinch the nomination, defeating a mix of seasoned politicians and newcomers in three rounds of voting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cifers will now face Democrat Jack Trammel in the Jan. 7 special election to fill the vacancy left by Sen. John McGuire, R-Goochland, who resigned after his recent election to Congress. The winner of the special election will serve the remainder of McGuire’s term, which runs until 2027.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other contenders included runner-up Duane Adams, the chairman of the Louisa County Board of Supervisors who previously ran for the Republican nomination in the district in 2023 but was defeated by McGuire​, and Amanda Chase, a former state senator from Chesterfield County who served in the Virginia Senate for eight years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were four other bids for the seat by Shayne Snavely, a veteran and former Chase aide, Jean Gannon, a Powhatan County real estate appraiser, Alex Cheatham, a recent college graduate, and Bryan Hamlet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Luther emerged from a field of seven outstanding candidates who sought the nomination. The Republican Party of Virginia and I look forward to marching in lockstep with Luther and his team over the next three weeks in ensuring that he is victorious on January 7th and takes the oath of office on January 8th,” said Rich Anderson, the chairman of the Republican Party of Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given the district’s strong Republican lean — with 62.8% of voters supporting former President Donald Trump and 67.8% backing Gov. Glenn Youngkin — Cifers is seen as the favorite in the upcoming election.</span></p>

(Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans in Virginia’s 10th state Senate District will convene for a mass meeting on Friday to select their nominee in an upcoming special election. The vacancy was prompted by the resignation of Sen. John McGuire, R-Goochland, who is set to leave his post after being elected to Congress​. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The meeting will take place at the Goochland Rec Center, with registration running from 4:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m., and proceedings beginning at 6:30 p.m. A total of seven candidates are vying to succeed McGuire. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Organized by local party committees, mass meetings require party members to gather at a designated time and place to publicly select a candidate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike secret ballots, voting is often conducted through a show of hands, voice vote, or other public method. Participants must remain present for multiple rounds of voting until one candidate secures a majority — typically more than 50% of the votes — to be declared the winner. This process can be lengthy, especially in races with a crowded field of candidates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the GOP nominee is selected, they will face Democrat Jack Trammel in a special election on Jan. 7 set by Sen. Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, the Senate president pro tempore. The winner will serve out the remainder of McGuire’s term in the Senate, which ends in 2027.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the first Republicans to declare their candidacy for McGuire’s seat was Amanda Chase, a former state senator from Chesterfield County who served in the Virginia Senate for eight years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chase previously ran for re-election in 2023 but lost the GOP primary for her Chesterfield-based seat to Sen. Glen Sturtevant. To qualify for the 10th District race, Chase moved to Appomattox County, as Virginia law requires state legislators to live in the district they represent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joining the race is Shayne Snavely, an Amelia-based entrepreneur, veteran who was a former aide to Chase and worked on her failed 2021 gubernatorial campaign. Jean Gannon, a Powhatan County real estate appraiser and long-time Republican activist, has also thrown her hat into the ring. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Duane Adams, the chairman of the Louisa County Board of Supervisors, is making a bid for the seat as well. Adams previously ran for the Republican nomination in the district in 2023 but was defeated by McGuire​.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other contenders include Alex Cheatham, a recent college graduate aiming to make his political debut, and two late entrants: Luther Cifers, a businessman from Prince Edward County, and Bryan Hamlet, chairman of the Cumberland County Board of Supervisors​.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have a pretty good selection among the group there. I don’t know everybody, but I think that they will all be competitive candidates in that district,” Rich Anderson, chairman of the Republican Party of Virginia, said in a phone interview. “Obviously as a conservative Republican leading the conservative party, I want to get a conservative Republican nominated.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anderson said that the mass meeting could last late into the evening.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The process will probably require multiple ballots with that many people on the docket, so we’ll just see how it all turns out. I can’t predict who will walk away with all the marbles, but one of them will.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">David Richards, a political science professor at the University of Lynchburg, said that of the Republicans who have thrown their names in the ring for the special election to replace McGuire, “Chase is perhaps the best known or most notorious.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Richards doubts that Chase will get her party’s nod. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The mass meeting nomination process caters to party members, and Chase has little credibility with the local party after being expelled by the Chesterfield GOP and being noticeably absent from the one candidates forum already held. And she has little credibility with local Republicans, which will hurt her chances.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the remaining six candidates, Adams has been very active beginning with his unsuccessful bid for the nomination in 2023, which McGuire won, Richards said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The key to these mass meetings is name recognition in a positive way. Aside from the candidate forum held in late November, there has not been much opportunity or time for candidates to get their message out. Their pre-existing connections will tip the scale, which is why I expect Adams to win the nomination.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adams will still “get a run for his money” from Snavely, who also has a lot of party experience working for Chase earlier in his career, Richards added. “The other candidates have very low profiles, but Jean Gannon has been active in local GOP politics, which might help her.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McGuire, who in June defeated incumbent U.S. Rep. Bob Good, R-Farmville, in one of the most viciously fought and expensive GOP primary battles nationwide this year, had kept Republicans </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/25/mcguire-still-hasnt-resigned-his-state-senate-seat-weeks-after-congressional-win/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">on edge for weeks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after winning his election against Democrat Gloria Witt on Nov. 5. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Typically, elected officials who win a new position resign from their current office within days to allow for a special election to be called promptly, ensuring the seat isn’t left vacant when the next legislative session begins in early January. However, McGuire delayed his departure, formally stepping down on Wednesday​.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his official resignation letter, McGuire called his brief stint in the state Senate “the privilege of a lifetime” and said he hoped voters would choose “a strong candidate who loves We The People,” works well with others and who has “never wavered on our core Republican values.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, McGuire stopped short from publicly backing one of the seven candidates vying to succeed him. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I was not too surprised that McGuire has not endorsed anyone, especially Adams,” said Richards. “When McGuire announced he was primarying Bob Good, Adams was very vocal about McGuire’s decision, calling him a liar, so there does not seem to be much love lost there.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 10th Senate District, which spans 11 localities from Lynchburg in the west to the suburbs of Richmond in the east, leans heavily Republican. The district backed President-elect Donald Trump with 62.8% of the vote last month and gave Republican Glenn Youngkin an even stronger 67.8% support during his successful 2021 gubernatorial campaign.</span></p>

Glenn Youngkin's proposal to invest another $290 million for school construction needs during the upcoming legislative session which begins in January. (Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Glenn Youngkin on Tuesday announced that he is asking the legislature for an additional $290 million to support school construction and modernization efforts across Virginia. This latest investment would bring the total funding for the current biennium to $700 million and raise the state’s overall contribution under Youngkin’s administration to nearly $2 billion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s funding request is included in his proposed budget amendments, which he plans to present next week at a joint meeting of the General Assembly’s money committees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the governor’s office, the state’s financial commitments have spurred an estimated $3.4 billion in total funding for school construction. The additional support would be made possible through a combination of local government contributions and federal matching funds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Over the last three years, we have invested historic amounts in our education system, including our public school facilities,” Youngkin said in a statement. “Our record economic growth and the resulting surplus allows us to make this critical investment to ensure every Virginia student has access to high-quality school facilities that support academic success.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin plans to use the newly announced $290 million in non-general funds to expand competitive grant opportunities for school divisions, particularly in high-need areas. The money would also address critical infrastructure issues, supporting the construction and renovation of schools in urgent need of repair.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State officials say the increased funding will provide K-12 students with safer, more conducive learning spaces, a move that has been welcomed by educators and community leaders alike. Local school divisions will be able to apply for grant support to fast-track modernization projects that may have been delayed due to funding shortfalls.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Youngkin administration has framed the initiative as part of a broader effort to support Virginia&#8217;s educational system and improve outcomes for students. As schools across the state face aging infrastructure and capacity challenges, this investment aims to reduce disparities in facility quality, especially in underserved areas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One of our guiding principles since day one of the Youngkin Administration has been to provide safe, vibrant, and healthy learning environments for all of our students,” said Secretary of Education Aimee Guidera. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This investment in supporting new and refurbished school buildings makes it possible for every community in the commonwealth to have the means to provide a best-in-class education that prepares every student for success in our increasingly demanding knowledge- and skills-based economy.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Candi Mundon King, D-Prince William, a member of the Commission on School Construction and Modernization, said that while she welcomed Youngkin’s proposal, she needed more information. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have been screaming from the rooftops about more money for school construction and ensuring that localities have what they need, so I’m glad to see that he&#8217;s trying to get on board,” Mundon King said. </span></p>

Candi Mundon King, D-Prince William, is a member of the Commission on School Construction and Modernization (Courtesy Candi Mundon King).</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is clear that we need to put more money into school construction, but I can’t say more without seeing a fully fleshed out plan. So I’m looking forward to his presentation next week with the joint money committees so we can fully evaluate what this proposal actually is, and not just some slick press release that doesn’t go into detail.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2022, Youngkin’s first year in office, the General Assembly in a bipartisan effort approved a historic $1.2 billion investment in school construction, aiming to modernize aging facilities and reduce funding disparities among school divisions. The sweeping plan combined grants and loans to support renovations, new construction, and capacity expansion for K-12 schools across the commonwealth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of the $1.2 billion, about $850 million was allocated for grants. This included $400 million in formula-based grants, which provided each of Virginia’s 134 school divisions with a $1 million base allocation. The remaining $266 million was distributed based on the Local Composite Index (LCI) — a state funding formula that considers factors like property values, taxable sales and population data to assess a locality’s financial ability to support its schools.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another $450 million was funneled into the newly created School Construction Fund and Program, a competitive grant program designed to assist divisions with the most critical infrastructure needs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">School systems with poor building conditions and limited financial capacity could apply for these funds to support construction, renovation, or expansion projects. This program is primarily funded by 98% of gaming revenue from Virginia’s four new casinos in Bristol, Danville, Portsmouth, and Norfolk. The fund is administered by the Virginia Board of Education.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia faces a mounting crisis with school infrastructure. Data released by the Virginia Department of Education in 2022 revealed that nearly 1,000 school buildings across the state are at least 50 years old. Replacing these facilities would cost more than $25 billion — a figure far beyond the capacity of most localities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traditionally, local governments have shouldered the financial burden of school construction, relying on local tax revenue. But for economically distressed areas, particularly in Southwest Virginia and Southside, this has become an increasingly difficult challenge due to population decline and economic hardship.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But in April, Youngkin </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/04/11/youngkin-vetoes-measure-to-let-va-localities-increase-sales-tax-to-pay-for-school-construction/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">vetoed a bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> lawmakers sent to his desk that would have allowed localities to implement a 1% sales tax to help cover the costs of school construction and modernization.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB14" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">proposal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> required voter approval through a referendum before the tax could be enacted by local governments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin acknowledged that school construction is a “worthy cause” but argued that Virginia has already taken substantial steps to address those costs. He contended that citizens should not face additional taxes, particularly the $1.5 billion annually that would have been raised by the 1% sales tax.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The commonwealth should pursue a tax policy that unleashes economic development and prioritizes job and wage growth through innovative reforms,” Youngkin said in his </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+amd+SB14AG" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">veto</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “These reforms must allow hardworking Virginians to keep more of their money, not less; any proposal that increases the cost of living and the cost of business is not a policy we should pursue.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prior to 2022, state assistance for school construction was limited, with much of it coming from the Literary Fund, a state-managed pool of money established in Virginia’s Constitution. Funded by sources such as unclaimed lottery winnings, criminal fines, and unclaimed property, the Literary Fund historically provided low-interest loans to support school construction and debt service for technology. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, in recent years, much of the fund’s revenue was redirected to cover teacher retirement costs, leaving fewer resources for school building projects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2022 legislative session retooled the Literary Fund’s loan program, significantly increasing its impact. Lawmakers raised the maximum loan amount from $7.5 million to $25 million and capped the interest rate at 2%. These changes made it more feasible for school divisions to finance major construction projects at a lower cost.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the state’s total contribution now approaching $2 billion, education advocates are hopeful the increased funding will lead to long-term improvements in school facilities and better learning conditions for students throughout the commonwealth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Board of Education President Grace Creasey said Tuesday that the panel will prioritize “those school divisions in greatest need that have missed out on prior grant opportunities,” especially rural divisions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We also know that school divisions are eager to adopt seat time flexibility and competency-based models which requires us to design learning environments and spaces differently. This new investment will make this possible,” Creasey said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The city council is now calling on the Richmond Electoral Board to review the findings and issue a response.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Richmond City Council strives to ensure that taxpayer resources are used in an efficient and effective manner. The Richmond Office of Inspector General’s findings of the use of public resources in the Richmond Office of Elections raises serious concerns,” the council said in a joint statement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richmond’s Inspector General James Osuna </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/16/richmond-inspector-general-investigating-citys-elections-office/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">launched the probe</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in May after one of his investigators contacted the Department of Elections last year to seek assistance with complaints from a former employee of Balmer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to documents obtained by The Mercury earlier this year through a Freedom of Information Act request, the employee had shared unverified allegations of management issues, including “hiring family and friends,” questionable spending, and other concerns within the Richmond election office.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Osuna declined to comment for this story, and Balmer did not respond to phone calls and emails. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_37663" class="wp-caption alignright" style="max-width:100%;width:300px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/keith-balmer-cropped_provided/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-37663" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Keith-Balmer-cropped_provided--300x244.png" alt="" width="300" height="244" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Keith-Balmer-cropped_provided--300x244.png 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Keith-Balmer-cropped_provided--1024x832.png 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Keith-Balmer-cropped_provided--768x624.png 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Keith-Balmer-cropped_provided-.png 1076w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Keith Balmer, General Registrar of the City of Richmond. (Courtesy of Keith Balmer)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">City officials initially believed the State Board of Elections should address the complaints due to its statewide oversight of registrars. However, state officials determined the matter was a local issue, because the allegations did not directly involve election policy or voting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Claims of nepotism in the Richmond election office had surfaced publicly on another occasion. Earlier this year, the Richmond Times-Dispatch </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/government-politics/richmond-registrar-keith-balmer-nepotism-accusations-brother-wife-office-of-elections/article_e0eb9052-d738-11ee-9abd-7bef8c0bbd32.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that Balmer hired his brother and paid $2,300 to his wife’s company for training election workers on accommodating voters with disabilities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Osuna&#8217;s investigation confirmed that Balmer violated procurement policies and misused government resources by hiring a security company between January and May without proper authorization. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Originally contracted to provide a $50-per-hour security guard for early voting, the agreement expanded to include personal protection services at $85 per hour, emergency training, and equipment purchases. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In total, the company billed the city more than $200,000, depleting the Office of Elections’ budget and prompting Balmer to seek additional funding from Richmond City Council.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Osuna also found that Balmer misused public funds by hiring a private security firm to investigate alleged election interference, violating Virginia law. The registrar allegedly authorized the firm to probe claims that two former employees tried to discourage election officers from participating in future elections, costing the city more than $4,400 for services like background checks and evidence review.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Balmer falsely claimed that the city attorney had approved the investigation, but it was later determined that the latter had not been consulted. He also bypassed law enforcement and other relevant authorities, using city funds for a private investigation instead.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Between August and November 2023, Balmer violated procurement policies by approving a remodel of a leased building without following required bidding procedures, the investigation found. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The project, which included carpet and flooring replacement, wall repairs, electrical work and a remodeled bathroom, was done using a contractor preferred by the landlord, bypassing the necessary competitive bidding process. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the city’s lease agreement, which places maintenance responsibility on the landlord, Balmer approved the project without proper documentation, including quotes from multiple vendors, Osuna wrote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The work was divided into 21 separate purchase orders, each under the $50,000 threshold to avoid triggering a competitive bidding requirement, totaling $229,969. This strategy violated city policies governing small purchases and split purchases.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The remodel was done without the landlord’s approval or building permits, and the project cost exceeded the amount allowed for non-competitive bidding. The Deputy General Registrar, who oversees the budget, was unaware of the total cost of the work, the investigation found. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On July 5, 2023, Balmer failed to report a workplace domestic violence incident involving two city employees, the probe confirmed. The incident occurred at the annual Voter Registrars Association of Virginia Conference, where one temporary employee was arrested for domestic assault against their partner, a full-time city employee. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon returning from the conference, the victim was unreachable, prompting a welfare check. The Office of Elections received notice of the incident, and the Employee Relations manager reached out to Balmer for assistance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite Balmer’s awareness of the situation — which included prior reports of domestic conflict in the workplace — he did not take action, as required under the city code, Osuna found. Instead, he pressured the assaulted employee to resign, claiming safety concerns, without consulting Human Resources or the city attorney, which led to the alleged victim being denied unemployment benefits. </span></p>
<a href="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Report-Office-of-ELections.pdf" class="pdfemb-viewer" style="" data-width="max" data-height="max" data-toolbar="bottom" data-toolbar-fixed="off">Report Office of ELections</a>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Balmer also violated city regulations by spending $7,500 to hire three Virginia Commonwealth University students to paint murals in the lobby of a city-leased facility and by purchasing more than $8,700 worth of artwork without proper authorization, according to the investigation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The murals, completed between February and December of last year, were paid for using invoice payment forms, with each student receiving $2,500. Additionally, Balmer used a government P-Card to buy 12 art pieces from a local art center, with prices ranging from $175 to $1,800. None of the purchases followed the required Department of Procurement Services (DPS) procedures for exempted artwork.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One allegation claimed that Balmer improperly purchased a Ford Explorer for the Office of Elections in February 2023 without Fleet Management authorization and removed city logos from the vehicle in violation of policy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the investigation confirmed that the purchase followed proper city procedures, and the city’s fleet manager approved the removal of the logos at the General Registrar’s request due to safety concerns.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Balmer still violated city policies when he used a city vehicle for personal errands, transporting non-city personnel, and as a take-home vehicle without authorization, according to the investigation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Balmer assumed control of the Richmond election office after former registrar Kirk Showalter </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/richmond-electoral-board-votes-to-remove-citys-top-election-official-after-tense-public-hearing/article_ff22c0fd-1ceb-5e40-8458-9db8430d9605.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">was removed in 2021</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, partly due to pressure from the Democratic Party of Virginia. While the Richmond Electoral Board is now under Republican control following Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s 2021 victory, the shift in power did not affect Balmer’s position.</span></p>

(Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Three weeks after being elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, Virginia state Sen. John McGuire, R-Goochland, has yet to resign his seat in the Virginia Senate, an unusual delay that has raised questions about the transition of power and the scheduling of a special election to fill his vacancy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McGuire, who defeated Democrat Gloria Witt in Virginia’s 5th Congressional District earlier this month after unseating U.S. Rep. Bob Good, R-Farmville, in one of the most expensive GOP primaries nationwide this year, is slated to be sworn into Congress in January. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, his continued hold on his Senate seat, representing the 10th District, is drawing attention because most state lawmakers resign soon after winning federal office to allow for a smooth succession process. The State Board of Elections is set to certify the results of the Nov. 5 election on Dec. 2.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title24.2/chapter2/section24.2-216/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">state law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a special election date must be set within 30 days of a vacancy or notification of it, whichever occurs first. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Senate President Pro Tempore Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, is expected to set a date for a special election to fill McGuire’s seat once his resignation is official. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re still waiting for a formal resignation letter so we can go ahead and call for a special election,” JoNathan Collins, a spokesman for Lucas, told The Mercury Monday.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McGuire did not respond to several phone calls and text messages seeking comment. Senate Minority Leader Ryan McDougle, R-Hanover, said Monday that he expects a special election to be set for Jan. 7, the day before the General Assembly convenes for its 20205 session. He did not elaborate further. </span></p>
<p>Democrats hold a slim 21-19 majority in the Senate. If McGuire’s vacant seat remains unfilled by the start of the legislative session in January, Republicans will face an additional loss in their numbers.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">David Richards, a political science professor at the University of Lynchburg, said that he doesn’t see a strategic reason for why McGuire would delay resigning his seat. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m chalking this up to ‘paperwork delays’ or something like that,” Richards said. “I’m not going to pretend to know what McGuire is thinking, but this does seem to fall in line with the fairly loose way he ran his campaign, both in the primary and in the general election.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McGuire, Richards said, often seemed to be using “a different playbook than the normal one, whether because he has his own ideas or simply is unfamiliar with what he needs to do, it wasn’t clear. My hope is that he gets up to speed once he gets to D.C. in 2025 and will figure out how to be an effective voice in Congress for the 5th District.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 10th Senate District, which spans 11 localities, stretching from Lynchburg in the west to the Richmond suburbs in the east, leans Republican. McGuire’s departure has set the stage for a hotly contested race, particularly among Republican hopefuls eager to retain the seat in the GOP column. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, District Republicans </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/elections/virginia-mcguire-senate-seat-mass-meeting-amanda-chase/article_fb3c01c6-a758-11ef-b8c4-dfc06f5ac715.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced the process</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for selecting their nominee in the upcoming special election. The local GOP committee scheduled a mass meeting for Dec. 12 at 5:30 p.m. to choose the party’s candidate. Unlike a firehouse primary, the mass meeting format allows registered Republicans in attendance to vote directly. The location for the meeting has yet to be finalized.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the first of the six Republicans to announce their bids for McGuire’s seat was former state senator Amanda Chase, who had served in the body for eight years and lost her 2023 GOP primary for her Chesterfield-based seat to Sen. Glen Sturtevant. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because the law requires state legislators reside in the district they represent, Chase has moved from her former home in Chesterfield County to Appomattox County. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shayne Snavely, Chase’s former aide who worked on her bid for the Republican nomination for governor three years ago, has also declared his intention to run. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And so have Jean Gannon, a Powhatan County real estate appraiser and longtime Republican activist, and Duane Adams, the chairman of the Louisa County Board of Supervisors, who ran for the Republican nomination in the district in 2023 but lost to McGuire. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In more recent weeks, Luther Cifers, a businessman from Prince Edward County, and Bryan Hamlet, the chairman of the Cumberland County Board of Supervisors, have also launched their campaigns in District 10.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lone Democrat who has filed to run in the Republican-leaning district is Jack Trammel, a college professor from Louisa County who in 2014 unsuccessfully ran against Republican Dave Brat in Virginia’s 7th Congressional District. </span></p>

(Courtesy of Google) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares has joined the U.S. Department of Justice and a coalition of 38 state attorneys general in proposing sweeping remedies to dismantle Google’s unlawful monopoly over internet search engines and restore competition in the digital marketplace.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The push follows </span><a href="https://www.oag.state.va.us/media-center/news-releases/2807-november-21-2024-virginia-justice-department-seek-limits-to-google-business-practices-to-end-search-engine-monopoly" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a landmark ruling</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in August 2024 by a federal district court in Washington, D.C., which found that Google violated federal antitrust laws by maintaining a monopoly in online search and search advertising through anticompetitive practices. The court’s decision marked a significant win in the ongoing efforts to curb Big Tech dominance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The remedies proposed are reasonable, measured steps to restore competition and protect consumers,” Miyares said in a statement Thursday. “Virginia is proud to help produce a balanced resolution that benefits consumers and competitors alike.”</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_30211" class="wp-caption alignright" style="max-width:100%;width:300px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/ga-2022-4-3/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-30211" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/GA-2022-4-3-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/GA-2022-4-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/GA-2022-4-3-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/GA-2022-4-3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/GA-2022-4-3.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Attorney General Jason Miyares (Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia initially joined the fight against Google in December 2020, alleging in a lawsuit that the tech giant used illegal contracts and other conduct to suppress competition and secure its monopoly power. That case complemented a similar federal antitrust lawsuit filed by the Justice Department in October of that year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A multi-day hearing to consider the proposed remedies is scheduled for April 22, 2025, and is expected to conclude by May 2, 2025, according to a news release by the attorney general’s oOffice.The outcome of this case will likely have far-reaching implications for competition in the tech industry and consumer choice in digital services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kent Walker, Google’s chief legal officer, sharply criticized the Justice Department’s latest move, accusing the agency of pushing “a radical interventionist agenda” that would harm Americans and America’s global technology leadership. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“DOJ’s wildly overbroad proposal goes miles beyond the court’s decision. It would break a range of Google products — even beyond Search — that people love and find helpful in their everyday lives,” Walker wrote </span><a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/doj-search-remedies-nov-2024/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in a blog post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Thursday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://oag.dc.gov/sites/default/files/2024-11/2024.11.20%20Google%20Plaintiffs%20Initial%20PFJ%20%281%29.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">proposed final judgment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or PFJ, filed with the courts seeks to dismantle Google’s dominance by prohibiting its lucrative search distribution contracts and revenue-sharing agreements. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the legal challenge proves successful, Google would no longer be allowed to pay manufacturers, device makers, or browsers to make Google Search the default search engine. Additionally, the company would be required to share data and information obtained through its monopoly with competitors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The PFJ also calls for Google to divest Chrome, its popular browser that accounts for a substantial share of the portal’s search traffic and powers its targeted advertising to users. Furthermore, the judgment opens the door to additional divestitures, including Google’s Android operating system, if the company fails to comply with remedies or if the proposed measures prove ineffective.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The judgment further prohibits Google from leveraging its ownership of Android to stifle competition. The company specifically would be barred from mandating the use of Google Search or Google AI on Android devices, degrading the performance of rival services, or using its control over distributors to favor its products.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a measure proposed solely by the states, Google would also be required to fund a public education campaign to inform consumers about the company’s anticompetitive practices, the resulting legal action, and the alternatives available to them for search engines and digital tools.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The order establishes a five-member technical committee tasked with overseeing the implementation, monitoring and enforcement of these remedies over a ten-year period.</span></p>

(Wyatt Gordon/The Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">S&amp;P Global Ratings has upgraded the city of Petersburg’s general obligation (GO) bond rating to AA- from A+, a move that highlights the city’s strengthened financial health and steady progress toward fiscal stability. The upgrade underscores Petersburg’s success in building reserves, improving liquidity, and achieving a secure financial position after years of turmoil.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Petersburg’s GO bonds are backed by the city’s full faith and credit pledge, affirming its reliability to meet debt obligations. The proceeds from the city’s 2024 GO bond issuance are set to fund several critical projects, including a new courthouse facility, the renovation of a police station, the construction of an animal care center and $1.3 million to refinance older bonds for net savings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">City Manager March Altman said in a statement that the upgraded bond rating reflects continued growth and economic recovery.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Petersburg has a fund balance of approximately $50 million, which gives it the flexibility to move forward with needed capital projects,” Altman said. “I commend the city council and Petersburg’s Department of Finance for making decisions based on sound fiscal management and best practices.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The enhanced credit rating not only reflects Petersburg’s financial stability but also unlocks key advantages, including lower interest rates, greater borrowing capacity for vital projects, expanded economic development opportunities, and increased appeal to potential investors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It further signals to investors that the city’s creditworthiness has improved, potentially reducing borrowing costs for future projects. It also highlights the city’s steady recovery from a financial crisis that left it on the brink of insolvency less than a decade ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Petersburg’s financial woes reached a breaking point in 2016, when the city faced a staggering $7.7 million deficit, unpaid bills piling up to $18 million, and critical services at risk of interruption. Poor fiscal oversight, structural deficits and mismanagement led to the crisis, which garnered statewide attention. At the time, the city teetered on the verge of state intervention.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To address the dire situation, Petersburg implemented aggressive reforms, including staff reductions, tighter spending controls and measures to increase revenue. The city also partnered with outside financial advisors to help restore fiscal discipline.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By 2019, Petersburg reported a budget surplus for the first time in years and began rebuilding its financial reserves. The turnaround has since been bolstered by sustained economic growth, improved tax collection efforts, and successful community partnerships.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mayor Sam Parham said that the city’s goal is to achieve a firm AAA rating.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With the growth of the Pharmaceutical Campus, the recent approval of the Destination Resort Casino, and the many other economic development and tourism projects, the city is positioned to continue to grow its tax base and fund balance while addressing much-needed capital projects,” Parham said. </span></p>

(Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former President Donald Trump’s return to the White House following the Nov. 5 election is already sending ripples through Virginia politics and setting the stage for an intense 2025 election cycle in the commonwealth. With control of the governorship and the House of Delegates on the line, both parties are strategizing to leverage the shifting political landscape to their advantage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think we’re in a crucial moment in Virginia’s history, this is a moment where every single vote, every election and every voice can make a lasting difference, especially after the election of Donald Trump,” Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, said on a video call with reporters on Friday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2017 elections in Virginia offer a compelling precedent. That year — Trump’s first in office —  galvanized the Democratic base, leading to a stunning 15-seat gain in the House and leaving the Republicans with a razor-thin 50–49 advantage. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suburban districts that had long been Republican strongholds, including in the Richmond area and in Northern Virginia, flipped blue as many moderate voters reacted against the president’s divisive rhetoric and policies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, Democrat Ralph Northam’s decisive victory in the gubernatorial race — he defeated Republican Ed Gillespie by a 9-point margin (54-45%) — underscored the state’s shift toward progressive politics, fueled by high turnout among women, young voters, and minorities united by their dislike for an incumbent president whom Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee, had defeated in the commonwealth with 49.75-44.43%. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two years later, in 2019, Democrats picked up six more seats in the House, marking the first time that the party held control of both legislative and executive branches in Virginia since 1993.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following Trump’s recent win, Virginia Democrats are hoping for a similar wave in 2025, betting that the Republican’s polarizing presidency will once again energize their coalition. With abortion rights, climate policy, and education likely to be central issues, Democrats believe they can maintain their control of the legislature and win back the Executive Mansion by appealing to suburban and urban voters alarmed by Trump’s policies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One of the things about Virginia is that you can never really predict what will happen, because Virginia voters are so in tune and aware of what’s going on. They don’t go for a lot of BS, which is why Virginia rejected Donald Trump three times,” Scott said, referring also to the presidential elections in 2020 and 2024, which Trump lost in the commonwealth. </span></p>

(Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginians, Scott said, pay “very close attention to what happens in DC right now,” and they will take note if Trump keeps his promise to abolish the U.S. Department of Education or eliminate federal jobs in Northern Virginia — actions that could fire up the Democratic party’s base.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans, on the other hand, are hoping for a reverse dynamic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump’s successful third White House bid has emboldened Virginia conservatives, particularly in rural areas where his support remains robust, and the GOP campaigns of next year are likely to focus on economic issues and a law-and-order message to woo suburban voters who have drifted toward Democrats in recent cycles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Republican Party of Virginia and Trump very handily carried a number of Virginia House of Delegates districts that either Republicans lost by a small amount last year or won by a small amount,” Rich Anderson, the chairman of the Virginia GOP, said in a recent phone interview. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So it’s going to be vital for us next year to take those Republicans who showed up for President Trump and to get them out in the 2025 election cycle. We will work hard in doing that because next year is a crucial year for us in the House of Delegates elections, and the Democrats only have a one seat margin. If we work hard, then we can flip it back, and that, of course, helps our nominees for governor, lieutenant governor and attorney general.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">David Richards, a political science professor at the University of Lynchburg, said that the current Democratic majorities in the House of Delegates (51-49) and the state Senate (21-19) are too close for either party to relax. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If Virginia acts like 2021, where it voted against the party in power in Washington, then the GOP will have an uphill climb,” Richards said. “The question is how far along Trump’s agenda will be by the fall of 2025. If things are going well, the GOP could draft on that success, but if things are chaotic, then that will be a problem.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deputy House Minority Leader Israel O’Quinn, R-Washington, said that Republicans plan to seize on a lagging enthusiasm among Democratic voters this year in order to flip the House in 2025. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_30127" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:300px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022-ga-2-6/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-30127" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2022-GA-2-6-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2022-GA-2-6-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2022-GA-2-6-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2022-GA-2-6-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2022-GA-2-6.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Del. Israel O&#8217;Quinn, R-Washington, speaks on the floor of the House of Delegates. (Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These races are going on a race-by-race and a candidate-by-candidate basis, that’s why you have to put the work into the recruitment of quality candidates and make sure that you’re competitive in these really tight 50-50 House districts,” O’Quinn said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020, Democrat Joe Biden won 60 out of 100 House of Delegates seats, and in the following year Democrats were able to capitalize on 51 of those, O’Quinn added. “I think Kamala Harris won 59 this year, so they’re going to have to run the table on all 51 to be able to continue to hold on to the majority, and I think we’re going to be very competitive there.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And less than one year before Virginia’s 2025 gubernatorial election and more than six months before the party primaries, the contest is effectively set, with two high-profile candidates leading the major-party tickets. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the Democratic side, U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger, D-Prince William, was the first </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/spanberger-virginia-governor-candidacy-c19ade683ab0dfaef67051b36791d30a" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to announce</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> her bid in November of last year, positioning herself as a centrist with a focus on pragmatic leadership. Outgoing Richmond Mayor Levar Stoney, followed suit one month later, but in April he opted to pursue the lieutenant governor’s seat instead, streamlining Spanberger’s path to the nomination.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_36863" class="wp-caption alignright" style="max-width:100%;width:300px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/?attachment_id=36863" rel="attachment wp-att-36863"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-36863" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/DSCF6603-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/DSCF6603-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/DSCF6603-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/DSCF6603-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/DSCF6603-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/DSCF6603-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  U.S. Rep.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Republicans, Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears emerged as the party’s standard-bearer after Attorney General Jason Miyares </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/18/miyares-to-seek-second-term-as-virginia-attorney-general/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">declared on Monday</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> he would seek reelection rather than enter the governor’s race. Earle-Sears, who </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/06/lt-gov-winsome-earle-sears-announces-run-for-virginia-governor/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">launched her campaign</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in September, is set to carry the GOP banner unopposed, benefiting from Miyares’ decision to focus on being reelected into his current role.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But despite her re-embrace of Trump as the Republican presidential nominee, the lieutenant governor’s campaign may still be haunted by her remarks from November 2022, when she publicly urged Americans to move on from the former president.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A true leader understands when they have become a liability. A true leader understands that it’s time to step off the stage. And the voters have given us that very clear message,” Earle-Sears </span><a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/politics/virginia-lt-gov-earle-sears-time-to-move-on-from-trump/3205900/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said in a TV interview</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richards, the political science professor, said that he expects the damning remarks to be brought up by political action committees aligned with Spanberger during the gubernatorial election cycle as a way to undermine Earle-Sears with Republicans.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“She will need to make up quickly with Trump. Had Trump lost she would have been able to brush off her previous comments, but now she will need his support,” Richards said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I suspect she will try to make nice. Her bigger hurdle will be convincing independent voters in Virginia she is not too extreme. Virginia is a purple state, and when it votes for the GOP it likes moderate-facing candidates, which is why Youngkin was careful to present himself that way in 2021.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A spokesman for Earle-Sears’ campaign declined to provide comment for this story. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_30208" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:300px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/05/25/virginia-lg-scheduled-to-speak-at-nra-fundraising-event-in-texas-this-week/ga-2022-4-4/" rel="attachment wp-att-30208"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-30208" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/GA-2022-4-4-300x200.jpg" alt="Lt.

Gov. Winsome Sears presides over the Senate. (Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is little doubt that the match-up between Spanberger and Earle-Sears promises to be a defining battle of contrasting visions for Virginia’s future. Spanberger’s track record as a moderate in Congress and Earle-Sears’ bold embrace of conservative policies ensure the race will draw national attention.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spanberger’s “2025 campaign will continue to be laser-focused on the priorities that all Virginians share — stronger schools, safer communities, and lower costs,” campaign spokesman Connor Joseph said “And following the election of former President Trump, she also knows that Virginia must have a governor who is committed to protecting the rights and fundamental freedoms of all Virginians.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ernest McGowen, an associate professor at the Department of Political Science at the University of Richmond, said that Earle-Sears will likely face an uphill battle in a state that has increasingly voted for Democrats in statewide elections. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Earle-Sears may be a little too far right. If you look at Tim Kane and the kind of people that he had to run against, I think it may be kind of a similar situation,” McGowen said, referring to the Democratic U.S. senator from Virginia who has won his two reelection bids by fending of challenges from Republican nominees whose far-right positions have helped their primary campaigns but hurt their chances of winning a general election. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Also, Spanberger is more of a known commodity,” McGowen said. “If the Democrats in their election postmortem decide that their current ideological median isn’t isn&#8217;t where they thought it should be, I could see them actually really get behind Spanberger as not the new face of the party, but as someone to show the diversity of thought in the party.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2025 race for Virginia’s attorney general is also starting to take form, with three candidates having officially declared their bids. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After securing Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s </span><a href="https://x.com/glennyoungkin/status/1858574435449446657?s=46&amp;t=uQxq3EX7p3bygcqVfUnstg" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">endorsement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> just moments after his announcement Monday, Miyares is unlikely to face a challenger for his party’s nomination. If reelected, the incumbent has vowed to focus on public safety and his record combating fentanyl and violent crime during a second term.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Democrats, the field features a competitive primary between former Del. Jay Jones, who previously ran in 2021, and Henrico County Commonwealth’s Attorney Shannon Taylor. Jones has criticized Miyares for what he calls a “partisan agenda,” while Taylor has emphasized her decades of experience as a prosecutor dedicated to justice and public safety.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lieutenant governor’s contest, however, remains wide open almost one year out. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">James City County business consultant and U.S. Navy veteran John Curran — who </span><a href="https://www.dailypress.com/2023/09/23/majority-of-jcc-supervisor-seats-up-for-grabs/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ran unsuccessfully for the Board of Supervisors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2023 — is the only Republican </span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2024/09/27/james-city-county-business-consultant-to-run-for-lieutenant-governor-as-republican/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">who has filed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> his paperwork to date, but the Democratic field is more crowded. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides Stoney, three additional candidates are vying for their party’s nomination: state Sens. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Chesterfield, and Aaron Rouse, D-Virginia Beach; and Babur Lateef, the former chairman of the Prince William County School Board. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But officials from both parties agree on one thing — the 2025 elections will likely serve as a referendum on Trump’s second term and provide a key barometer for the 2026 midterms and beyond.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It goes without saying that the Democrats will definitely be energized, because they have an intense dislike for President Trump,” said Anderson, the RPV chair. “The challenge for Republicans next year is being smarter and better equipped in 2025 than maybe we were in 2017, when we lost all those seats in the House of Delegates.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And House Speaker Scott expressed confidence in his party’s ability to harness its base’s enthusiasm and channel it into meaningful action.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We will stand up and we will fight, and I think the majority of Virginians will stand with us and push back against this administration,” Scott said. “I think that next year’s election will be that type of referendum on Donald Trump’s administration.” </span></p>

Charlotte Rene Woods/ Virginia Mercury</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares announced Monday that he will seek reelection in 2025, putting to rest speculation that he might enter the Republican primary for governor. His decision effectively clears the way for Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears to secure her party’s nomination for the state’s top job.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I serve as the people’s protector,” Miyares said of his role as the state’s top lawyer in an </span><a href="https://x.com/JasonMiyaresVA/status/1858570888251404777" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">X post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> announcing his reelection campaign. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Highlighting his aspirations for another four years as attorney general, Miyares pointed to key public safety initiatives he has championed, including the “One Pill Can Kill” campaign to raise awareness about fentanyl overdoses and his office’s work with “Ceasefire Virginia,” a program that combines prosecution efforts with community engagement to combat crime.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this year, Miyares </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/article_2b71d3a4-e6d7-11ee-8831-93f7ac7b8121.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">celebrated crime reductions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> associated with the initiative. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Miyares’ campaign launch comes roughly a week after Democratic candidate </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/12/former-virginia-delegate-jay-jones-launches-second-bid-for-attorney-general/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jay Jones announced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> his latest bid for the position. Jones lost a Democratic primary to former Attorney General Mark Herring in 2021, who later went on to lose to Miyares later that year in the general election. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though Miyares hadn’t officially announced yet, Jones took a jab at Miyares last week — accusing him of using his office to “attack Virginians’ freedoms, pander to the fringes of his own party and side with corporate price gougers and polluters” at the cost of Virginia families. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moments after Miyares’ announcement, Gov. Glenn Youngkin also turned to X to endorse the attorney general and Earle-Sears for next year’s Republican ticket. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As attorney general, Jason vigorously defends the laws of the commonwealth, stands with law enforcement every single day while leading our shared fight to end the free flow of opioids and fentanyl into our communities, and has been a constant advocate for victims of human trafficking and domestic violence,” Youngkin wrote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He has never backed down when it comes to standing up for Virginians. He is an exceptional attorney general.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin also hailed Earle-Sears — a U.S. Marine Corps veteran who </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/06/lt-gov-winsome-earle-sears-announces-run-for-virginia-governor/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">declared her bid</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the state’s highest office in September and would likely face U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger — as “an outstanding” lieutenant governor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“She will be a great governor. She has been an outspoken advocate for commonsense conservative principles and policies, a passionate voice for our military and veterans, and a relentless advocate for educational freedom and economic opportunity. She brings the fighting spirit of a Marine to the office every single day.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earle-Sears said in a statement that she was “deeply honored” to receive Youngkin’s endorsement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Together with our outstanding attorney general, Jason Miyares, we will continue championing common-sense safety and security policies that keep Virginia the ‘Number 1 Best State for Business,’” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Miyares is so far the only Republican candidate vying for the seat, Jones will face Henrico Commonwealth Attorney Shannon Taylor in a primary. Miyares took aim at both on social media last week after Jones announced his bid. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Both of the announced (democratic) candidates for Attorney General are far-left, anti-police, criminal rights progressives who will make Virginia less safe. They will support the same criminal first, victim last policies that lead to a surge in violent crime,” Miyares wrote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He reiterated similar messaging in his re-election campaign launch video Monday, and said that in a second term he will continue to press for more tough-on-crime policies. Also during his time in office, Miyares has signed onto legal briefs with other Republican attorneys general </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/03/virginia-attorney-general-joins-efforts-to-fight-back-against-title-ix-changes/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">challenging</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> President Joe Biden administration’s </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2024/08/01/biden-titleix-courts-gender-identity-discrimination/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Title IX rules</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> meant to protect LGBTQ+ students from discrimination.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In her pushback to Miyares, Taylor noted her over 25 years of experience as a prosecutor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Every day of every one of those years has been spent working with law enforcement to keep people safe and seeking justice for victims of crime and their families,” </span><a href="https://x.com/ShannonTaylorVA/status/1856481762563465512" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">she wrote on X</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with a repost of Miyares’ post. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And Democratic Party of Virginia Chair Susan Swecker in a statement called Miyares “a MAGA mouthpiece in pushing an extreme agenda,” referring to President-elect Donald Trump’s Make America Great Again campaign motto. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Virginians deserve an attorney general who will stand up for their rights and freedoms, not someone who is constantly trying to take them away,” Swecker said. “It is clear that, if re-elected, Miyares would use his office as a partisan tool to serve the interests of the Trump administration, rather than the needs of hard-working Virginians.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stephen Farnsworth, a political scientist at the University of Mary Washington, said it was “a smart move” by Miyares to put his gubernatorial ambitions on hold and run for reelection next year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There was no guarantee that he would prevail in a contest with the lieutenant governor. He can run for reelection now and legitimately claim the right to be first in line in 2029 for the party&#8217;s gubernatorial nomination,” Farnsworth said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Republican attorneys general end up running for governor consistently and sometimes have been able to prevail over Republican lieutenant governors because they are more explicitly conservative, that is not the case this time, Farnsworth said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The current lieutenant governor is not an ideological moderate the way some Republican lieutenant governors have been in the past,” he said of Earle-Sears. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats would likely have preferred a competition for the GOP’s gubernatorial nomination among the two Republican statewide office holders, Farnsworth added.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If nothing else, a fight between Miyares and Winsome Earle-Sears would have put a lot of Republican money into the primary that otherwise would have been spent on a general election.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Connor Joseph, a spokesman for Spanberger’s campaign, said that no matter who her eventual opponent is, the Democrat’s vision for Virginia remains the same. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Her 2025 campaign will continue to be focused on the priorities that all Virginians share — stronger schools, safer communities, and lower costs,” Joseph said. “Additionally, Abigail knows that Virginia must have a governor who is committed to protecting the rights and fundamental freedoms of all Virginians.”</span></p>

Marcia Price, D-Newsport News, flanked by House Majority Leader Charniele Herring, D-Alexandria (left) and Del. Elizabeth Bennett-Parker, D-Alexandria, at a news conference in Richmond on Nov. 13, 2024. (Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Democratic-led House of Delegates panel on Wednesday advanced three proposed constitutional amendments, including a revised measure seeking to enshrine abortion rights in the state’s highest law. The new proposal would also require third-trimester abortions to be approved by one doctor instead of three, as the law currently mandates. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 22-member House Privileges and Elections Committee further backed amendments to extend constitutional protections to marriage equality and the automatic restoration of voting rights for felons who have served their time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The right to love, the right to vote, the right to bodily autonomy and privacy, these are the very rights and freedoms that are crucial to the foundation of this commonwealth and this nation,” committee chair Del. Marcia Price, D-Newport News, said in a brief news conference Wednesday afternoon. “We showed up today to do our jobs and to do everything within our power to protect these rights and freedoms for all Virginians.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The revised abortion amendment language in </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20251/HJ1" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HJ1</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> shocked the committee’s Republican members, who only saw the changes after the meeting was already underway. Price called a  five-minute recess to allow lawmakers to review the new language before deliberations and voting proceeded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I think we’re still trying to figure out what happened today,” a visibly frustrated House Minority Leader Del. Todd Gilbert, R-Shenandoah, said after the three-hour hearing. “Something this important and impactful — literally life-and-death decisions — I don’t think I’ve ever seen anything pushed through this fast where we didn’t get a chance to see it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gilbert warned that Price’s decision to not allow the committee more time to review the revised legislation would set a precedent for the way the House conducts its business in the future. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We were literally given five minutes to huddle and look at it before we had to decide what we were grappling with, and I think we still don’t know, other than it’s pretty clear that this is a pretty extreme version of efforts to protect abortion that goes well beyond what has been done in other states,” Gilbert said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price, however, defended her decision to move forward with taking a vote on the proposal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have an entire legislative process just like any other committee, and [the resolution] will go to the floor where (Republicans) will also have a chance to either put forward amendments or have their voice heard as well,” she said at the news conference.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amending the state Constitution takes several years in Virginia. The proposed amendment must be approved by the legislature in two separate years, with a General Assembly election occurring in between. Only then can the amendment proceed to a statewide referendum for voters to decide. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because the next election in Virginia is in November 2025, the earliest the three amendments that the committee advanced Wednesday could be put on the ballot is November 2026 — if the measures pass in the 2025 and 2026 legislative sessions. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The abortion rights amendment</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under current Virginia law, third-trimester abortions require approval from three doctors. The new amendment would reduce this requirement to just one doctor when a late-term abortion is deemed necessary to protect the life of the pregnant individual, or their physical or mental health, or when a physician determines the fetus is not viable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Wednesday’s hearing, dozens of abortion opponents lined up to speak against the proposal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among them was Olivia Turner, president of the Virginia Society for Human Life, who told the panel that her group opposed both the original amendment and its substitute. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We don’t know what’s going on with this new version, and how it will impact our ability as the people of Virginia to pass rational and reasonable protective laws in the future,” Turner said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And Gilbert, the House Minority Leader, said that the amendment capsized Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court case that established abortion as a constitutional right and that was repealed in 2022. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Roe v. Wade has within it a compelling state interest in protecting the life of the unborn at a certain point in the pregnancy. This amendment doesn’t contain that protection at all, it leans in the other direction,” Gilbert said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The legislation we just saw, which was dropped on us literally today without any ability to look at it, reflect on it, think about it, compare notes, talk to experts, only leans into the protection of the patient, which is the mother. And so there is no more protection for the unborn, which was envisioned and embodied in Roe (v.) Wade.”</span></p>

(Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But House Majority Leader Charniele Herring, D-Alexandria, the sponsor of HJ1, said that in her amendment both the state interest in protecting the unborn and life of the mother are considered. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The parameters are set out so if there is a live fetus, there are protections. But if there is a miscarriage, then the physician and the mother will be able to make a decision to abort and to complete a miscarriage. So they do coexist,” Herring said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abortion rights advocates urged the committee to vote in favor of the amendment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This amendment will protect Virginians’ rights to make their own reproductive health care decisions, including access to abortion, contraception, fertility treatment and miscarriage care,” said Jamie Lockhart, executive director of Planned Parenthood Advocates of Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Right now, with no state or federal protections in place, Virginians face the constant risk that anti-abortion politicians could restrict or ban essential care. No one is more qualified than an individual and their health care provider to make these complex personal decisions.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After defeating a Republican motion to kill the proposed amendment, the committee moved to advance the measure by a 12-9 party-line vote.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Restoration of rights amendment </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20251/HJ2" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HJ2</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, sponsored by Del. Elizabeth Bennett-Parker, D-Alexandria, seeks to automate the process of restoring voting rights to people convicted of felony crimes who have served their sentences. The proposal comes in response to a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/03/23/youngkin-administration-now-requires-felons-to-apply-to-get-their-voting-rights-back/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2023 policy change</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> implemented by Gov. Glenn Youngkin that requires people with felony convictions to proactively apply to regain their voting rights upon release from prison and is not automatically restoring rights for any group of offenders — a shift from Virginia’s three previous governors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bennett-Parker told reporters Wednesday that her amendment proposes automatic restoration of voting rights for individuals who have been released from incarceration, which she said would foster “a more just and bare” society.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The disenfranchisement of people with all convictions is a relic of Virginia’s Jim Crow past and was intentionally inserted into the 1902 Virginia Constitution to disenfranchise as many Black voters as possible,” Bennett-Parker said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She added that the right to vote is fundamental and the amendment ensures that if a person has served their time they deserve to have their rights to participate in democracy restored.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Virginia is the only state to permanently disenfranchise all individuals with felony convictions unless they individually petition the governor for rights restoration. The current system has no transparency and changes every four years, so no one knows what steps to take to get their rights restored. This amendment creates a process that is bound by transparent rules and criteria that will apply equally to everybody.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The committee backed HJ2 with a 12-9 party-line vote.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Marriage equality amendment</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the U.S. Supreme Court granted same-sex couples the right to marry in the Obergefell v. Hodges ruling in 2014, the state Constitution still includes the 2006 Marshall-Newman Amendment, which defines marriage as solely between one man and one woman and bans recognition of any legal status that approximates “the design, qualities, significance, or effects of marriage.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because it could become law again should the Supreme Court overturn its 2014 ruling one day, Del. Mark Sickles, D-Arlington, sponsored </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20251/HJ9" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HJ9</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in an effort to repeal the current constitutional provision and enshrine marriage as a “fundamental right inherent in the liberty of persons,” unrestricted by factors like sex, gender or race. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeff Caruso, executive director of the Virginia Catholic Conference, told the committee that his group has opposed efforts to repeal the Marshall-Newman Amendment for more than 16 years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We affirm the dignity of every person, we also affirm that marriage has an original design and purpose, which predates any nation, any religion and any law, and we urge you to uphold that principle today.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Narissa Rahaman, executive director of Equality Virginia, pushed back against that notion and reminded the panel that today there are more than 20,000 same-sex couples in Virginia who have more similarities than differences with couples in traditional marriages.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Here in Virginia we have seen how a state has evolved in its thinking about same-sex couples, and LGTBQ people overall. Now it’s time for our state to fully complete our evolution and finish the job in protecting marriage equality for all,” Rahaman said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The committee advanced the amendment on a bipartisan 16-5 vote, with four Republicans joining Democrats. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think our straightforward amendment will be welcomed by Virginia citizens and I’m really appreciative of the vote today in the committee,” Sickles said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All three amendments are now set to be voted on by the General Assembly during its 2025 session, which begins in January. </span></p>

(Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jay Jones, a Democratic former state delegate from Norfolk, on Tuesday announced his bid for Virginia attorney general at two separate events in Norfolk and Richmond. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Jones, who represented the 89th District in the House of Delegates from 2019 to 2021, it marks his second run for his party’s nomination for attorney general. In 2021, he lost the Democratic primary to then-incumbent Mark Herring, despite an endorsement from former Gov. Ralph Northam.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Last week we awoke to an uncertain future and a president-elect who openly flouts the rule of law,” Jones said before a small crowd of supporters that had gathered at Maggie L. Walker Memorial Plaza in Richmond Tuesday afternoon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With an incoming administration, families now face the threat of higher healthcare costs as (Donald) Trump seeks to kick tens of thousands of working Virginians off Medicaid and end the protections of the Affordable Care Act,” Jones said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also accused Attorney General Jason Miyares, the Republican incumbent and his potential opponent, of using his office “to attack Virginians’ freedoms, pander to the fringes of his own party and side with corporate price gougers and polluters” at the cost of Virginia families. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He’s used his office to advance his own radical, personal, partisan-political agenda,” Jones said of Miyares. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, Jones is one of two declared candidates in the 2025 attorney general’s race, alongside Henrico County Commonwealth’s Attorney Shannon Taylor. Miyares responded to Jones’ announcement Tuesday by calling out his potential opponents on social media. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Both of the announced Democrat candidates for attorney general are far-left, anti-police, criminal rights progressives who will make Virginia less safe,” Miyares wrote on X, formerly Twitter. “They will support the same criminal first, victim last policies that lead to a surge in violent crime.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Miyares has yet to declare whether he will run for reelection or seek his party’s nomination for governor.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During his Richmond appearance, Jones declined to comment on the attorney general’s response to his announcement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You have to ask him why he said that,” he said. “We’re focused on this campaign, whatever he says and whatever he tweets out, that’s him, and his campaign’s business.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jones’s pre-legislature career includes a stint at Goldman Sachs in New York, where he specialized in risk management and credit advisory for natural resources and tech companies. After two years, he returned to Virginia, earning his law degree from the University of Virginia School of Law in 2015. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While in law school, Jones interned for Del. Algie Howell, who represented the 90th House District from 2004 until 2014. Jones was elected to the body himself in 2017 after winning a competitive Democratic primary and defeating Libertarian candidate Terry Hurst in the general election, succeeding then-Del. Daun Hester, D-Norfolk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jones said on Tuesday that he is running because Virginians need an attorney general who is focused on keeping the commonwealth safe instead of following a partisan agenda. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As your attorney general, I will protect Virginia’s families, our children, and our most vulnerable,” he said. “We will crack down on those who would do our kids harm by working with law enforcement to get illegal guns off our streets, shut down drug traffickers and hold to account the gun manufacturers whose weapons of war are used to commit mass shootings and crimes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jones vowed to “go after the criminals that prey on children and our families and put them where they belong — behind bars,” and he promised to take on social media companies “fueling a mental health crisis among our young people” and corporations that pollute air and water. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And if the Trump administration again tries to raise the health care cost by taking apart the Affordable Care Act, I’ll be the first to take him to court to stop it,” Jones said, adding that he would always fight back against “any attempt to undermine abortion rights in Virginia” and use “the full weight of the office” to protect women and medical professionals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The House Privileges and Elections Committee is set to meet Wednesday to consider several proposed constitutional amendments, including one to guarantee access to abortion in Virginia and another to remove outdated language defining marriage solely as a union between a man and a woman. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I will join the fight to enshrine these rights in our Constitution today,” Jones said. </span></p>

(Courtesy of Getty Images) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Glenn Youngkin on Monday unveiled the Virginia Veterans Network (VVN), a new comprehensive </span><a href="https://vesa.dvs.virginia.gov/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">online resource</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> designed to support the state’s veterans, transitioning service members and their families. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking at the Hampton Roads Council of Veterans Organizations’ (HRCVO) annual Veterans Day Luncheon in Virginia Beach, Youngkin praised the military community and highlighted the commonwealth’s commitment to being a leader in veteran support services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“On Veterans Day and every day, we celebrate the service and sacrifice of all the men and women who have served our Nation,” Youngkin said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Virginia is the proud home of nearly 700,000 military veterans. We go to work every day to ensure that Virginia is the best state in America for veterans, military service members, and their families to live, work, and raise a family.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The VVN platform consolidates hundreds of organizations and services into a single portal, providing veterans with streamlined access to disability benefits, job opportunities, medical and legal services, education and training, and peer support. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is also designed to make it easier for veterans and their families to schedule appointments with the Department of Veterans Services, access free federal, state, and local benefits, and find tailored support at every stage of life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new platform was built by veterans for veterans, Youngkin said. “VVN is truly the gold standard of service for Virginia veterans and delivers on our promise to give Virginia veterans the best available resources.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chuck Zingler, commissioner of the Virginia Department of Veterans Services (DVS), noted that the platform was developed in response to veterans’ requests for a simplified way to access diverse resources. “The goal for VVN is to make life easier for our veterans, military service members, and their families,” Zingler said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Veterans asked for a simple solution for finding a variety of resources in the Commonwealth and beyond, and we made it happen. VVN offers real solutions in real time, connecting the right people to the right resources at the right time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And Virginia Secretary of Veterans and Defense Affairs Craig Crenshaw called the online portal “another example of how Virginia is committed to providing an excellent quality of life for veterans and their families.” </span></p>

Glenn Youngkin's proposal to invest another $290 million for school construction needs during the upcoming legislative session which begins in January. (Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following Tuesday’s general election, in which Virginians sent two state senators to Congress, the commonwealth is preparing for special elections to fill the seats vacated by John McGuire, R-Goochland, and Suhas Subramanyam, D-Loudoun. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McGuire, who is set to succeed U.S. Rep Bob Good, R-Farmville, in Virginia’s 5th Congressional District, and Subramanyam, who was elected in the 10th Congressional District, have left a void in the Virginia Senate that each party will urgently work to fill. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These vacancies could have a significant impact on the state’s legislative balance, where Democrats currently hold a narrow 21-19 majority. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the governor calls special elections in Virginia during recess of the legislature, Christian Martinez, a spokesman for Gov. Glenn Youngkin, said in a text message that because the General Assembly remains in special session from last May, the authority to call special elections rests with the leaders of each respective chamber — which in the case of the Senate is Sen. Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, the body’s President Pro Tempore. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The governor strongly believes all Virginians should be represented during the legislative session and trusts that Democratic leadership will call those elections in time to ensure all Virginians are represented,” Martinez said. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title24.2/chapter2/section24.2-216/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">State law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> requires that a date for a special election to fill a vacancy  be set within 30 days of the vacancy or receipt of notification of the latter, whichever comes first. If the vacancy occurs between Dec. 10 and March 1, “the writ shall order the special election to be held no more than 30 days from the date of such vacancy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Senate District 10, which includes 11 localities and extends from Lynchburg in the west to the Richmond suburbs in the east, former state senator Amanda Chase, who had served in the body for eight years and lost her 2023 GOP primary in her Chesterfield-based seat to Sen. Glen Sturtevant, has already announced her bid. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because the law requires state legislators reside in the district they represent, Chase has moved from her former home in Chesterfield County to Appomattox County. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shayne Snavely, Chase’s former aide who worked on her bid for the Republican nomination for governor three years ago, has also declared his intention to run. And so have Jean Gannon, a Powhatan County real estate appraiser and longtime Republican activist, and Duane Adams, the chairman of the Louisa County Board of Supervisors, who ran for the Republican nomination in the district in 2023 but lost to McGuire. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">David Richards, a political science professor at the University of Lynchburg, said that Chase may be the top contender among the Republican candidates in the 10th District.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Chase has made waves, but local GOP officials say she is no longer in the party, which would really complicate things,” Richards said, referring to an </span><a href="https://dailyprogress.com/news/local/government-politics/is-amanda-chase-still-in-the-gop-intraparty-feud-risks-her-state-senate-ambitions/article_e36769a4-7f54-11ef-87ee-57ebfcd982f3.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">intra-party controversy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over allegations that the former senator had violated state party rules. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No Democrat has announced a bid in the Republican-leaning district to date. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the 32nd District, Del. Kannan Srinivasan, D-Loudoun, formally announced his bid on Wednesday, along with Hurunnessa Fariad, the director of outreach at Multi-Faith Neighbors Network (MFNN) and the secretary of the board of directors at the Virginia Interfaith Center for Public Policy. Buta Biberaj, a former commonwealth’s attorney for Loudoun County, has also announced her bid for the seat, as well as Ibraheem Samirah, a former state delegate, also from Loudoun. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other Democratic candidates include Sree NagiReddi, an Ashburn-based IT professional and small business owner, and Puja Khanna, a Loudoun County mental health advocate who ran unsuccessfully for the county’s board of supervisors in 2023.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The name I see mentioned most often is Srinivasan, which would then involve a special election in House District 26 later on,” Richards said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Lots of other Democrats are emerging in this blue district,” he added, “but I expect some Republicans to throw their names in after the relatively good showing of the GOP statewide last Tuesday. The GOP might be looking for a pickup here, not sure they will get it.”</span></p>
<p><em>Editor&#8217;s note: Ommair Butt, a Republican, announced his candidacy for the 32nd District state Senate seat on TV news station <a href="https://www.wjla.com/news/local/2024-special-elections-virginia-senate-district-32-lodoun-county-former-commonwealths-attorney-buta-biberaj-race-senator-suhas-subramanyam-delegate-kannan-srinivasan-republican-democrat-ibraheem-samirah-puja-khanna-sreedhar-nagireddi-governor-youngkin" target="_blank">WJLA</a> on the evening of Nov. 7, after the above story was reported. No further details on Butt<span style="font-weight: 400;">’</span>s background or campaign were immediately available, but The Mercury will offer continuing coverage of all the candidates and the special election in the weeks to come.</em></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican officials in Virginia celebrated the former president’s national victory, hailing it as a mandate for their party’s agenda. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The American people have spoken overwhelmingly to return common sense, strength, and leadership back to the White House. Through the Trump presidency, we will pave the way for an economic revival, a secure border, and a stronger America on the world stage,” Gov. Glenn Youngkin said in a statement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin did not comment on </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/05/harris-triumphs-over-trump-in-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harris’s victory in Virginia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The Democrat defeated Trump by a 5-point margin, winning 51.8% to Trump’s 46.5%, a spread of nearly 225,000 votes from a total of about 4.3 million cast, according to unofficial data from the Virginia Department of Elections. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump claimed victory nationwide by securing 292 electoral votes to Harris’s 224, also winning the popular vote by a 4.8 million margin — the first Republican nominee to do so since President George W. Bush won reelection in 2004.  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the few party leaders to address Virginians directly within hours after the Associated Press </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/06/dc/ap-former-president-donald-trump-wins-second-term/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">called the race</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for Trump was Virginia House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, who despite the Democrats’ defeat in the race for the White House and the U.S. Senate expressed optimism about his state and how Democrats and Republicans can work together at the state level. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“All politics are local, and I think we&#8217;ve begun to see that here in Virginia,” Scott told reporters outside the state capital in Richmond on Wednesday afternoon. “I think Virginians expect us to do everything that we can to protect their freedoms, and then to work where we can, with the governor and with the federal government.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But in reference to some voter demographics and polarizing factors about Trump as a candidate, he said “I think we learned some lessons about what’s acceptable and unacceptable for whole lot of American people.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats and activists have continually stressed concern over Trump’s rhetoric that often disparages people of color, immigrants and women. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think the country made a bet on Donald Trump that some of the things that he has said he didn’t mean, and they’re going to trust him,” Scott said. “I hope they’re right, because we want him to be successful, because it’s good for the entire country.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The economy was “a huge issue” during the 2024 election cycle, Scott added as a reason some Virginia voters turned to Trump. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think inflation is real. There are people who still feel some pain around inflation. Even though inflation is down, prices are down, we’re back moving in the right direction… I think that that message didn’t resonate with voters, and I think that ended up hurting us at some point,” he said. </span></p>

(Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., whose seat was not up for reelection this year, said that he was committed to “working with President-elect Trump to get things done for Virginians, just as I did during his first term.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Americans made their choice on Tuesday, and while it wasn’t my favored candidate, I respect the democratic process and the outcome of this election,” Warner said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many Democratic leaders had anticipated a strong showing for Harris in the state, but her smaller-than-expected margin of victory reflects a shift in Virginia’s political landscape, particularly in rural areas that saw increased GOP turnout, political analysts say. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In Virginia and nationally, red areas became more red and blue areas became less blue nearly everywhere,” said Stephen Farnsworth, a political scientist at the University of Mary Washington. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump’s obvious liabilities — his felony convictions, his chaotic administration and rhetoric driven by his white-hot anger — didn’t seem to matter to voters who were in a mood to reject the status quo, Farnsworth said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In the commonwealth, where abortion was protected by existing state law, the abortion issue was less relevant. In a number of states where abortion was on the ballot, abortion measures were far more popular than the Democratic candidates who supported them.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And voters were clearly unhappy with the Biden administration&#8217;s record, particularly as it related to economic anxiety, the border and racial and cultural politics, Farnsworth added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The national dimensions of this frustration were seen in all areas — nearly everywhere we saw that Harris won by less or lost by more than Biden did four years ago.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Republicans hailed Trump’s victory as a win for the commonwealth while remaining silent on the former president’s defeat in the state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Minority Leader Todd Gilbert, R-Shenandoah, said in a statement that Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, will return to Washington with “a clear mandate” from the American people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Across Virginia, and indeed the entire nation, voters shifted to the right in record numbers. Working class Americans stood up and said they&#8217;re tired of being told the economy is fine, and that they should just buy off brand peanut butter to deal with inflation,” Gilbert said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Groups long “taken for granted by the left” rejected claims that their schools are fine and their children are safe in their communities, he added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Tens of millions of Americans decided they’d had enough of being called Nazis for simply having a different political opinion. Americans will no longer ignore what they can see right in front of them, no matter how much Democrats insist that reality is wrong.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rich Anderson, the chairman of the Republican Party, said that he was pleased with the results both nationally and in Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re obviously pleased with the national race, the American people have spoken and President Trump has been reelected to a second term,” Anderson said in a phone interview Wednesday. “Here in Virginia, he did not carry it, but we worked very hard and took the 10.1% lead that Biden had in 2020 and shaved it down to just under 6% this year. I feel very good about that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">None of the “swings of the party pendulums” happen in a revolutionary way, Anderson added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s usually evolutionary, and we’re now in the process of trying to take that pendulum and swing it as far and as fast as possible back toward the right.” </span></p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most Republicans, however, limited their post-election commentary to social media, offering a mix of reflection and Monday-morning quarterbacking with a hint of ridicule. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It looks like over 300 electoral votes, the popular vote, taking the Senate and keeping the House, and gosh, who could have predicted that calling over half of the country a bunch of bigoted misogynists if they didn’t vote for your candidate wasn’t a good campaign strategy? Who could have predicted that?” Del. Nick Freitas, R-Culpeper, a social media influencer, told his 1.3 million Instagram followers <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DCCJJQ7uY4z/?igsh=MWN3MnV3MjQyZWFkbw==" target="_blank">in a video</a> he posted Wednesday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, state Sen. Glen Sturtevant, R-Chesterfield, asked for suggestions for “some of the action items for Virginia as we move forward” from the 2024 election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Identify the 200k Virginia Biden voters who didn’t show up for Harris. Figure out what’s going on with some of the pollsters that appear to have been completely divorced from reality,” Sturtevant listed among his own action items. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Susan Swecker, the chairwoman of the Democratic Party of Virginia, declined to comment Wednesday, stating that she was waiting for Harris to address the American people later on Wednesday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But DPVA spokeswoman Kelsey Carolan said that Virginia Democrats fared well in the presidential election compared to other eastern states — despite Republican gains across the board. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carolan cited election data from Connecticut, where Trump gained 8.9% of voters compared to 2020, New York (10.6%), New Jersey (10.9%) and Maryland (10.3%).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In Virginia, Trump currently has a gain of 4.8%” Carolan said. “That is the most apples-to-apples analysis, because all of these states are states where neither campaign spent money on TV ads. This was a wave election and we’ve held our own.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few Democratic lawmakers  took their post-election sorrows to social media. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a </span><a href="https://x.com/jackie4norfolk/status/1854158831162454269" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lengthy thread</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on X, Del. Jackie Glass, D-Norfolk, said that Tuesday evening reminded her of the night when Trump was first elected eight years ago. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">She recalled how her then 10-year-old son asked her if his Latino and Hispanic classmates in school might be &#8220;taken away.&#8221; She added that she had once again woken up with a &#8220;familiar sense of dread.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Glass still left her fellow Democrats with a message of hope and optimism.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Grab your pen, your pocketbook, your protest sign, your petition, and above all, your purpose. Remember, we are Lovers — no matter who we love, where we’ve been, or how we’ve lived. And if there’s one thing I know as a woman and a mother, it’s this: Lovers make the best fighters. Let’s fight for Virginia. Let’s go.”</span></p>

Tim Kaine, D-Va., defeated Republican Hung Cao on Nov. 5, winning a third term. (Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., on Tuesday secured a decisive victory over his Republican challenger Hung Cao that earned him a third term on Capitol Hill. Kaine defeated Cao, a retired U.S. Navy captain, with 53-47% of the votes, according to unofficial numbers from the Virginia Department of Elections. The Associated Press called the race at roughly 11:20 p.m.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During his re-election campaign, Kaine consistently championed the policies of President Joe Biden, aligning himself with key legislative achievements that he argued were vital for Virginia’s growth and prosperity, including the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, a $1.2 trillion package that has been heralded as a major win for modernizing America’s transportation and infrastructure systems. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine also is an avid supporter of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which he has repeatedly hailed as a crucial step toward addressing economic and environmental concerns. The act aims to reduce the deficit, tackle rising inflation and lower healthcare costs, while also making historic investments in clean energy and climate change mitigation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Throughout the year, Kaine emphasized how these measures would benefit Virginians, from creating jobs in infrastructure to supporting the state’s transition to renewable energy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think ‘make, build, grow’ is the right message. We make it here, we build it here, we grow it here,” Kaine told The Mercury in a recent interview. “That takes advantage of the bills that we passed, but it also is a reflection of the fact that manufacturing jobs are up, we are doing infrastructure in a major way, so why not lean into what is actually happening on the ground?” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pre-election polls had consistently shown Kaine, a Harvard-educated lawyer, </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/harris-kaine-ahead-in-virginia-by-comfortable-margins-new-poll-says/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">leading</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by double-digit points, reflecting his enduring popularity in the commonwealth, where he previously served as governor, lieutenant governor and Richmond’s mayor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cao, who won his party’s nomination during a five-way primary election on June 18, ran a spirited campaign that focused on conservative values like curbing government spending and bolstering national defense. Cao also supported former President Donald Trump’s sweeping proposal to deport all undocumented immigrants. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While his background as a Vietnamese immigrant and military veteran brought a unique perspective to the race, despite Trump’s endorsement Cao struggled to overcome Kaine’s strong name recognition and deep ties to Virginia’s electorate — and, at times, his own rhetorical fumbles on the stump. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cao’s campaign marked the Republican’s second attempt at running for public office. In 2022, he unsuccessfully challenged U.S. Rep. Jennifer Wexton, D-Loudoun County, in Virginia’s 10th Congressional District, losing by 53-47%. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even before seizing the Republican nomination for one of Virginia’s two seats in the U.S. Senate, Cao often found himself stumbling over his own remarks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a conservative podcast in May, Cao pushed back against allegations in a story published by the Staunton News Leader that the political action committee he had launched to support Republican candidates in 2023 mostly benefited his own Senate bid, </span><a href="https://www.newsleader.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/05/22/cao-says-he-didnt-promise-super-pac-money-to-virginia-2023-candidates/73792102007/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">calling the allegations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “a hit job” and referring to the News Leader as a “podunk local newspaper.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cao also suggested that it was “ridonkulous” to drive from his home in Purcellville to Abingdon for a campaign forum, and also appeared to grapple with Virginia geography </span><a href="https://cardinalnews.org/2024/07/19/senate-candidate-cao-says-that-anything-south-of-loudon-and-fairfax-is-southern-virginia/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">when he told</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Brian Kilmeade of Fox News in July that “anything south of Loudoun and Fairfax is Southern Virginia.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And at their sole </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/07/kaine-faces-off-against-gop-challenger-cao-in-high-stakes-u-s-senate-race/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">candidates debate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at Norfolk State University, Cao’s attempts at articulating his policy platform were overshadowed by his remarks suggesting that the Navy uses drag queens as recruitment tools and his stereotyping of Asians as being good with math. </span></p>

Bob Good, R-Farmville, in the June 18 primary election, McGuire managed to unite enough of the party’s base to win Tuesday’s general election with 56-43.5% of the votes, according to unofficial numbers by the Virginia Department of elections</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The Associated Press called the race at 10:58 p.m.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McGuire, a former U.S. Navy SEAL who announced his bid for the Republican nomination in the 5th District just one week after winning his seat in the 10th state Senate District — a move that angered many of his fellow Republicans in the district — overcame months of tension between his supporters and loyalists of Good, who had held the seat since 2021. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A staunch conservative with deep backing from religious and hardline right-wing groups, Good lost the GOP nomination to McGuire in a heated primary that was one of the most expensive and most watched nomination contests nationwide this year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The loss led to a fractured Republican base, with some of Good’s supporters initially refusing to back McGuire and vowing to write in the incumbent, who became nationally known for his role in ousting former Speaker Kevin McCarthy and as the chairman of the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, McGuire’s strong conservative platform on issues like gun rights, economic growth and national security — and his endorsement by former President Donald Trump, who disavowed Good after the congressman openly backed Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ presidential bid — resonated with voters in the 5th District, Virginia’s largest. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But McGuire’s victory over Witt was by a much smaller margin than Good’s 56-42% win against Democrat Josh Throneburg two years ago — a fact that the ousted incumbent will likely seize on if he decides to seek the Republican nomination again in 2026. </span></p>

Morgan Griffith, R-Salem, on Tuesday easily won reelection in Virginia’s 9th Congressional District, which he has represented since 2011. The Republican incumbent fended off a challenge by Democratic Karen Baker in a race that centered on health care access and representation in the largely rural, mountainous region.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Associated Press called the race at 9:17 p.m. as Griffith led Baker with 73.5%-26.5% of the votes, ensuring his eighth term in Congress. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Griffith’s victory solidifies his stronghold in the conservative-leaning district, which stretches across Southwest Virginia, an area known for its rural communities and economic challenges.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Throughout her campaign, Baker, a healthcare advocate and former administrative law judge for the Social Security Administration, focused on expanding access to health care services in the district, particularly in its remote areas. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She also criticized Griffith for not doing enough to address the health care needs of his constituents, arguing that the region’s residents have been underserved. Baker also claimed that Griffith had failed to show up for the people of the 9th District, asserting that his focus had drifted away from the issues impacting local communities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“People sometimes go, who’s that? And generally, I would say 80 to 90% of the time, people say, ‘he doesn’t do anything for us,&#8217;” Baker </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/27/in-the-fightin-ninth-baker-seeks-to-end-griffiths-13-year-tenure/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said of her opponent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in an interview with The Mercury in September. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Griffith, however, defended his record, emphasizing his efforts to bring jobs and federal resources to the district. He also highlighted his work on energy and coal industry issues, which remain central to the district’s economy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m a big supporter of the telehealth concepts, of our federally qualified health centers, and of trying to make sure that we continue to pay our health care providers enough that they can make it,” Griffith told The Mercury in an interview. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The race underscored the ongoing divide in Southwest Virginia between conservative and progressive approaches to policy, particularly on issues like health care, jobs, and government spending. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Griffith’s win signals continued Republican dominance in the 9th District, Baker ran a more efficient campaign than Democrat Taysha DeVaughan, who two years ago lost her bid to oust the Republican incumbent by 26.5-73%.  </span></p>

(Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Elections Commissioner Susan Beals confirmed Tuesday that no voters have been removed from the state’s voter rolls under Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/governor-of-virginia/pdf/eo/EO-35-Comprehensive-Election-Security-Ensuring-Legal-Voters-and-Accurate-Counting---vF---8.7.24.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">executive order</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> since Oct. 15 — the deadline for Virginians to register to vote online or apply for absentee ballots.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think the figure that has been out there is the figure that stands, there has not been any additional work done on that,” Beals said at an Election Day news conference at Richmond’s Capitol Square, referring to 1,600 individuals purged under Youngkin’s directive since August. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The last time that records were sent to registrars was October 14th, which is the close of books, and … that’s normally when we close out our maintenance practices,” Beals said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pause in removals comes amid a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/14/voter-purge-lawsuits-add-to-disenfranchisement-allegations-against-youngkin-administration/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">high-profile legal battle</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over the state’s efforts to manage its voter rolls. The U.S. Supreme Court </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/30/u-s-supreme-court-grants-stay-in-challenge-to-youngkins-voter-purge-order-allowing-removal-of-thousands-from-rolls/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">granted a stay</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last week on a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/22/youngkin-blasts-doj-lawsuit-that-trust-virginias-voter-roll-removals-into-national-spotlight/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lower court’s ruling </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">that would have required the commonwealth to restore the voting rights of the 1,600 removed Virginians. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares had already acknowledged the end of a voter purge in a court filing from Oct. 22,  without providing a date for the cut-off.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The defendants have already ceased their allegedly unlawful removal process, as they always planned to do, which means there is no ongoing alleged violation,” the filing said.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And the Youngkin administration has not said publicly that they were no longer removing individuals from the rolls — even after last week’s Supreme Court ruling. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s order had instructed the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) to send records of people thought to be non-citizens to local election registrars for potential removal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the order’s timeline became a point of contention, with critics arguing it led to eligible voters being mistakenly removed too close to Election Day, a  violation of the so-called 90-day quiet period before an election, which is mandated by the </span><a href="https://www.justice.gov/crt/national-voter-registration-act-1993-nvra" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Voter Registration Act of 1993</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beals on Tuesday pushed back against allegations that Youngkin’s order prevented some citizens from exercising their right to vote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“First, in Virginia, we want every eligible voter to vote in this election,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beals underscored that the removal process has been in place since 2006, when the law was signed by then-Gov. Tim Kaine, a Democrat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It has been managed and processed the exact same way by every administration since 2006 when the law was enacted. Nothing has changed in the way that that process is managed by the department,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Beals, the DMV sends information to the Department of Elections, where it is checked against the department’s list of registered voters. For any voters who marked on their DMV paperwork that they are not U.S. citizens, their information is forwarded to local registrars, who then send notifications by mail to these individuals, informing them they may be at risk of removal from the voter rolls, unless they provide proof of citizenship within 14 days. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If they return the form, nothing happens to the voter, (but) if they fail to return the form after 14 days, they are sent an additional notice where they are advised that they are being canceled because of non-citizenships status,” Beals said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Anyone who is canceled for non-citizenship status and feels as though it is in error can go to their polling location today on election day and same-day-register to vote and cast a ballot in this election.” </span></p>

Glenn Youngkin's political action committee. (Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One day before the presidential election, early voting turnout in Virginia is falling short of the historic highs seen in 2020, the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of Sunday, more than 2.29 million Virginians have already cast their ballots — a 525,000 decrease from the unprecedented 2.82 million early votes cast by Nov. 3, 2020, during the last presidential election, </span><a href="https://www.vpap.org/elections/early-voting/2024-november-general-election/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the Virginia Public Access Project. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In-person was the most popular option for early voters this year. On Saturday alone — the last day for early in-person voting during this election cycle — 139,376 cast their ballot. In total, 1.856 million  early voters did so in person, with just 437,173 voting by mail.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite an initial wave of early voting in the southern and western parts of the state, the pattern of early ballot casting is about the same as some elections in more recent years, said David Richards, a political science professor at the University of Lynchburg. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Northern Virginia and Hampton Roads seem to have had higher percentage rates of early voting, but there were some interesting things as urban areas, cities, and towns seemed to often, but not always, have higher turnout rates,” Richards said. That could reflect that it’s easier to mobilize people if you have a denser population base to organize, he added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Overall rates are down compared to 2020, but that was the pandemic election, so the early voting rate is actually pretty decent. Most precincts have rates above 10%, many in the mid-40s, and at least a couple hit 50%, which is pretty impressive.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Democrats celebrate early voting turnout, Republicans see state in play amid mixed messaging from Trump</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As early voting numbers in Virginia show strong turnout from both Democrats and Republicans, both parties remain optimistic heading into Election Day. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the state’s nonpartisan voter registration system keeps early vote totals from revealing party affiliation — adding an element of suspense for both sides as they each express confidence in their momentum — Republicans have remained vocal in their belief that the state remains in play, despite </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/01/harris-expands-her-lead-over-trump-to-10-points-in-virginia-new-roanoke-college-poll-says/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">consistent polling</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> showing Vice President Kamala Harris with a comfortable lead over former President Donald Trump.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richards, the political scientist, noted how early voting in Virginia’s 9th Congressional District in far Southwest Virginia, a GOP stronghold where Rep. Morgan Griffith, R-Salem, faces Democratic challenger Karen Baker, was particularly noteworthy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That district came out blazing hot but has settled down. They are closest to the 2020 turnout compared to other house districts, but in the previous election, they had the lowest turnout for early voting, so perhaps the bar was set low,” Richards said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, this development might also reflect the GOP’s effort to turn out the vote in an area of the state where Gov. Glenn Youngkin stressed the need for Republicans to vote early, Richards said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It seems like they responded. I think the Democrats may have taken a more leisurely approach, which is why we see Northern Virginia surging later in the early voting period.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because voters in Virginia don’t register by party affiliation, early-voting data offers little certainty about which way the election will go, but also looking at numbers in more partisan localities might offer hints. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Susan Swecker, the chair of the Democratic Party of Virginia, said in a statement that with over 2.3 million early votes cast — led by Democratic strongholds — Virginians have already made their voices heard that they choose the Harris ticket over Trump’s. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Late-deciding voters are breaking toward Vice President Harris by double digits, especially among independent women and seniors who are done with Trump. Kamala Harris and Tim Walz will resoundingly win Virginia’s 13 electoral votes,” Swecker said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Republican voters, previously hesitant to vote early, have shown increased participation in recent weeks, possibly due to GOP-led efforts highlighting the convenience and security of early voting — and despite or maybe because of Trump’s mixed messaging on the benefits of early voting. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/23/trump-youngkin-urge-early-voting-during-tele-rally/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">telephone rally</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> hosted by Youngkin in September, the Republican nominee urged his supporters to use “every appropriate tool to beat the radical left Democrats” and to not wait until Election Day to cast their ballots. “You’ve heard a lot about voting by mail, but that’s what we have right now.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But only hours later, at a rally in Indiana, Penn., Trump </span><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/09/23/trump-tells-supporters-to-vote-early-even-as-he-still-criticizes-the-practice-00180650" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reversed course</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, calling early voting “stupid.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia GOP Chairman Rich Anderson still pushed back against the assumption that Republicans are still weary of early voting — despite the former president’s flip-flopping on this issue. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve worked really hard to increase turnout and to encourage people to show up and vote early. Obviously, the Democrats started that much earlier than we did, they are further along, but I&#8217;m very pleased, and I know that the governor is, too, that we’ve been able to make progress on that and change our culture,” Anderson said in a phone interview Monday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So the early voting looks very good, and I’m glad to hear there are banked votes, but we’re also working very hard to turn out voters tomorrow to make a winning difference and we&#8217;ll see how it comes out tomorrow night.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While a larger early turnout might seem advantageous for Democratic candidates, Republican strategists argue that their base traditionally turns out in higher numbers on Election Day itself, meaning they still anticipate strong performance as the final ballots are cast. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The results may ultimately depend on whether early voting enthusiasm from Democrats translates to similar turnout on Election Day, said Richards, the political scientist.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Just under 4.5 million people voted in 2020, again during the pandemic. I would expect to see higher vote totals this year despite somewhat lower early voting rates, as more people will feel comfortable voting in person on Tuesday,” he said.</span></p>

(Jonathan Ernst/Scott Olson/Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the presidential race, Vice President Kamala Harris holds a 10-point lead over former President Donald Trump (51-41%) in Virginia, according to </span><a href="https://www.roanoke.edu/news/rc_poll_politics_election_2024" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a new poll</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> released Friday by the Institute for Policy and Opinion Research at Roanoke College. Independent Cornel West and Libertarian Chase Oliver both poll at 2%, and Jill Stein, the Green Party candidate, takes 1% of the vote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the U.S. Senate race, Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine leads his Republican challenger Hung Cao, a retired U.S. Navy captain, with 51-40%, the poll found.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Friday’s survey marks a significant expansion of Harris’ advantage compared to a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/08/20/harris-holds-slim-lead-over-trump-in-virginia-roanoke-college-poll-says/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">previous Roanoke College poll</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Aug. 20, when the Democratic nominee edged her Republican opponent by just three points (47-44%) in a head-to-head matchup in Virginia. Kaine’s 11-point lead over Cao lead remains unchanged. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new poll isn’t good news for the Trump campaign, which is set to hold a high-stakes rally </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saturday at the Civic Center in Salem, where the Republican nominee plans to make his case to Virginians for the last time before Tuesday’s election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In recent weeks, some leading Republicans have claimed that because of a fired up base and a tightening of the poll numbers, Virginia </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/01/trump-plans-rally-in-salem-saturday-despite-polls-showing-harris-on-top-in-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">could be in play for Trump</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who lost in the commonwealth in both 2016 and 2020. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But according to Friday’s survey, only 2% of likely voters say they are still undecided four days before the election, and another 2% say they will vote for someone other than the five candidates on the ballot. Just less than half (47%) say they are almost certain to vote, while 40% report they have already voted. Almost one-fourth (24%) still plan to vote prior to Election Day. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Kamala Harris has increased the slim lead she held in the August Roanoke College Poll,” said Harry Wilson, senior political analyst for IPOR and Professor Emeritus of Political Science at Roanoke College. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“She is claiming 95% of Democrats and leads 49%-36% among independents. Trump is supported by 90% of Republicans, but that might not be enough for him to win in Virginia.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With so few undecided voters, it’s a “tough uphill climb for Trump,” Wilson said. “Democrats continue to take advantage of early voting. Republicans are catching up, but they need massive turnout on Election Day.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The poll also found that a large majority (85%) of those who have not yet voted are very certain of their vote choice, and another 9% are somewhat certain. Two-thirds (66%) said they are very enthusiastic about voting, and another 17% are somewhat enthusiastic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The economy was named as the most important issue by 43% of respondents. Abortion (20%) and immigration (12%) were cited as most important more frequently than foreign affairs (8%) and crime (3%). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The survey further says that likely voters trust Harris to do a better job on abortion (57%, compared to 36% for Trump), but the candidates are viewed about equally on other issues (tied at 48% on immigration; Harris favored 49-45% on both crime and foreign policy; and Trump seen as doing a better job on the economy 49%-46%).    </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asked if the candidate understands and cares about people like them, only 37% think that Trump understands and cares compared to 46% for Harris. Respondents are closely divided regarding the impact of the federal government, with 44% thinking the government makes their life worse and 40% thinking it makes their life better.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The results of the Roanoke College poll are consistent with an </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/harris-kaine-ahead-in-virginia-by-comfortable-margins-new-poll-says/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oct. 7 poll</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the Wason Center for Civic Leadership at Christopher Newport University that had Harris leading Trump by 11 points (52-41%) among Virginia likely voters. The survey found that 4% of voters remained undecided four weeks before the election, while 3% said they will vote for someone else.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For its survey, the Institute for Policy and Opinion Research interviewed 851 likely registered </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">voters in Virginia between Oct. 25 and Oct. 29, 2024.The survey has a margin of error of 4.6%. </span></p>

(Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former President Donald Trump’s decision to hold a last-minute rally in Salem, Virginia, on Saturday, just days before the Nov. 5 election, has raised eyebrows, as most polls show Vice President Kamala Harris — who has not campaigned in the commonwealth since becoming the Democratic nominee last summer — with a comfortable lead.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The event will mark a nostalgic moment for Rich Anderson, chairman of the Republican Party of Virginia, who attended a gathering with President Richard Nixon at the same venue over half a century ago. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A little tidbit for you,” Anderson shared in a phone interview Thursday, “when I was a little kid, and I remember it like yesterday, I went to the rally in 1969 where President Nixon came to the same Civic Center and campaigned for (former Virginia Gov.) Linwood Holton, who was elected governor that year.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nixon’s visit 55 years ago, Anderson said, reverberated through the Roanoke Valley at the time, and he — and other high profile Republicans — hope that Trump’s event will have a similar effect. </span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Polls vs. perception</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/10/26/harris-trump-virginia-voters-poll/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Washington Post-Shar survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> released Saturday — one of the most recent presidential polls available for Virginia — Harris holds a six-point edge over Trump, similar to her eight-point advantage in a previous poll from September.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.roanoke.edu/news/rc_poll_politics_election_2024" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A new poll</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> released Friday by the Institute for Policy and Opinion Research at Roanoke College shows Harris with a 10-point lead over former President Donald Trump (51%-41%). Independent Cornel West and Libertarian Chase Oliver both poll at 2%, and Jill Stein, the Green Party candidate, takes 1% of the vote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And an </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/harris-kaine-ahead-in-virginia-by-comfortable-margins-new-poll-says/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">earlier poll</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Oct. 7 by the Wason Center for Civic Leadership at Christopher Newport University had the Vice President up by 11 points (52-41%) among likely Virginia voters. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Republicans insist that a victory remains within reach in the commonwealth, where no GOP candidate has won a presidential race since George W. Bush in 2004 and where Trump lost in both 2016 and 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Virginia, I believe, is in play,” said Anderson. “While the polling generally has Harris up, a lot of it is within the margin of error.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What I’ve told people is, don’t get fixated on these polls, regardless (of) where they are. If it shows Trump in a comfortable position, then the danger is that people start relaxing on our side. And if it&#8217;s not good news for us, then people get demoralized,” Anderson said. “Just work like we’re 10 points down and that’s the surest path to victory.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeff Ryer, a spokesman for the Trump campaign in Virginia, cited a Republican-leaning poll from Monday, which has Harris at 48% and Trump at 46% and is within the margin of error. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whether you’re looking at polling showing a margin-of-error race or Republicans’ strong showing in early voting, it’s clear that Virginia is a battleground,” Ryer said. “President Trump is holding a rally in Virginia because Virginia is in play.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Democrats have pushed back against the notion that the presidential race in Virginia has become more competitive in recent weeks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Donald Trump has been soundly defeated every time he’s run in Virginia, and while he’s welcome to waste his time campaigning here, Virginians are going to once again reject his extreme plans to roll back our rights and freedoms, wreck our economy, and raise taxes by nearly $4,000 for hardworking families,” said Aaron Fritschner, a spokesman for the Harris campaign. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And Susan Swecker, the chair of the Democratic Party of Virginia, in a text message suggested that Trump’s choice to visit the commonwealth this close before the election might reflect his campaign’s dwindling options for large rallies, especially in competitive states where his standing is uncertain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The planned Salem rally, Swecker said, was “another tired Trump gimmick to counter that his show has grown stale in the core battlegrounds, as his crowd sizes have plummeted and exhausted people walk out of his rallies.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump is looking for “fresh crowds” in New Mexico and Virginia to “rant and rave about conspiracies like Youngkin’s false conspiracy theories about voting,” Swecker added. “Trump has done the same last-minute stunts in places like New Mexico in 2016 and Minnesota in 2020, only to get crushed.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Trump has never shied away from campaigning in Democratic-leaning areas — as his recent visits to Monterey, California, and New York City have demonstrated — political analysts are also skeptical, noting that Trump lost Virginia in two previous elections and that the state has become more solidly Democratic in recent years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some suggest Trump’s visit could be an attempt to create the appearance of momentum in the commonwealth, while others speculate it might serve as a rallying cry for his base in case he contests the results after a potential defeat. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As recently as last week Trump said on the Joe Rogan Show that he </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/25/us/politics/trump-joe-rogan-podcast.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">doesn’t trust the polls</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but I cannot imagine his campaign thinks that Virginia is in play, especially since the most recent polls I have seen show Harris with a small, but outside-the-margin lead in the commonwealth,” said John Aughenbaugh, an associate political science professor at Virginia Commonwealth University. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I have to wonder if there are other reasons why he would spend valuable campaign time in Salem, when he could be visiting the truly competitive battleground states Pennsylvania, Wisconsin or Michigan.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Aughenbaugh said, in 2016 most experts stated that Trump did not have a chance in either Pennsylvania or Wisconsin, yet he ended up winning there in part because his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton stopped campaigning in those states.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aughenbaugh added that the Trump campaign also may be seizing on the heightened tensions over Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s recent executive order, which led to the removal of thousands of Virginians from the voter rolls and sparked legal challenges and national scrutiny. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The controversy culminated Wednesday, when the U.S. Supreme Court </span><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/103024zr_f2ah.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">granted a temporary stay</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the ongoing legal dispute over the governor’s order — a ruling in the Republicans’ favor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Political forecaster Larry Sabato, the director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia, said that with Trump’s rally in Salem — a Republican stronghold — the former president might not have a rational purpose and that he was simply playing to his base by projecting strength through crowd size. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Trump is in part a creation of TV and ‘The Apprentice,’” Sabato said, referring to NBC’s reality television series which Trump hosted for 14 seasons. “He knows that actual reality can be shaped by the projection of his preferred version of reality. His version right now is, ‘We’re going to win in a landslide and that includes Virginia.’ His MAGA troops will certainly buy it, and it will whip them up even more than they already are.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And while Salem is a four-hour drive from Washington, D.C., it is close enough to the networks so that coverage will be extensive on the final weekend, Sabato said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Rural areas are Trump’s greatest strength, far more than urban-suburban territory. But Virginia is not competitive. If it was, we’d be flooded with TV ads and boasts from the campaigns.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Anderson, the RPV chair, said he suspected that the Trump campaign may be trying to win Virginia by replicating Youngkin’s strategy during the 2021 gubernatorial election. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“President Trump has not been to Southwest Virginia, which is obviously a major Republican enclave that must be turned out in order to offset the blue areas of the state, principally the urban crescent that runs from Fairfax all the way down to Richmond and then turns east toward Norfolk,” Anderson said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2021, Youngkin successfully aimed at losing Northern Virginia by fewer voters than some Republicans before him while focusing on increasing GOP turnout in Southwest Virginia, Southside and other Republican areas, Anderson said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And Youngkin — who during his gubernatorial bid managed to flip the commonwealth red by skillfully balancing his stance on a former president who remained highly unpopular with a significant portion of Virginia voters — has now become one of Trump’s biggest cheerleaders, willing to reiterate the campaign’s message that the state is in play.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Virginia is far more competitive than any of the pundits would believe,” Youngkin told Fox News’s Bret Baier on Wednesday, vowing to attend the Salem rally. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The court’s six conservative justices supported the stay, with the three liberals dissenting. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin in a statement hailed the court’s decision as “a victory for commonsense and election fairness.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am grateful for the work of Attorney General Jason Miyares on this critical fight to protect the fundamental rights of U.S. citizens. Clean voter rolls are one important part of a comprehensive approach we are taking to ensure the fairness of our elections,” Youngkin said, adding that the ruling would ensure a secure election on Nov. 5.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Virginians can cast their ballots on Election Day knowing that Virginia’s elections are fair, secure, and free from politically-motivated interference,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The order comes after the Virginia Republican Party filed </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/29/virginia-gop-calls-on-u-s-supreme-court-to-reinstate-youngkins-voter-purge-order/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an amicus brief</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Tuesday supporting Youngkin’s efforts, arguing that removing noncitizens from the voter rolls should not be delayed due to the federally mandated “quiet period” — a buffer period around elections meant to avoid disruptions to voter records. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Republican brief argues that the governor’s order was based on data from the Department of Motor Vehicles and focused on noncitizens, and thus does not constitute a “systematic” voter purge restricted by the quiet period.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Opposition to the order has come from various groups, including former GOP lawmakers such as Barbara Comstock, Denver Riggleman, and Adam Kinzinger, who filed </span><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24A407/330589/20241029151116178_333985%20Amicus%20on%20Application.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a separate brief </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">urging the Supreme Court to deny the stay. They argue that hastily removing voters could lead to eligible citizens losing their rights, citing concerns over the potential exclusion of legitimate voters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Miyares and Youngkin’s administration maintain that the executive order is a necessary step for election security. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement released Wednesday, Miyares called the Supreme Court ruling a win for election integrity and the rule of law. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While I am gratified the court moved so quickly, I remain deeply concerned and alarmed that the Biden-Harris administration chose to execute this maneuver just 25 days before an election,” he said of </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/14/voter-purge-lawsuits-add-to-disenfranchisement-allegations-against-youngkin-administration/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the lawsuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> filed earlier this month by the Justice Department that challenges Youngkin’s executive order. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Critics, however — including the Virginia Center for Immigrant Rights and the League of Women Voters’s Virginia chapter, who are suing Youngkin and the state — argue that the purge risks disenfranchising Virginians and disproportionately impacts minority voters, calling the move part of a larger trend of restrictive voting policies. Representatives of the groups and their lawyers said they were “disappointed” with the Supreme Court’s decision in a virtual press conference held Wednesday afternoon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ryan Snow, counsel with the Lawyers Committee For Civil Rights Under Law, called the decision by the nation’s highest court an “abuse of power.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bert Bayou with African Communities Together said that the state’s and high court’s actions </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are &#8220;sending a disturbing message that (immigrant’s) voices are not valued, not wanted, and not American.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are living in a political climate that is fanning the flames of xenophobia,” he added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Orion Danjuma, counsel with Protect Democracy, noted how a similar situation was also recently settled in Alabama. A federal judge </span><a href="https://alabamareflector.com/2024/10/16/federal-judge-blocks-alabama-secretary-of-states-voter-removal-plan/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">blocked </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alabama’s voter roll purge program after the Department of Justice had filed a similar suit last month as it did to Virginia. When Virginia requested its stay to the U.S. Supreme Court, Alabama’s Attorney General </span><a href="https://www.alabamaag.gov/alabama-joins-25-state-coalition-urging-u-s-supreme-court-to-grant-emergency-motion-so-virginia-is-not-forced-to-add-noncitizens-to-its-voter-rolls/#:~:text=(Montgomery%2C%20Ala)%20%E2%80%93%20Alabama,rolls%20for%20the%20upcoming%20election." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">signed onto an amicus brief</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in support of the request. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Danjuma stressed that the programs “disenfranchise eligible voters” and that organizations like his will continue to challenge them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While this is a serious setback to voters for this election, we want to make clear that we will be continuing to expose problems with the state&#8217;s program so that they can be corrected in the future,” he said. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">State lawmakers react</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s statehouse leaders shared a variety of responses to the news on Wednesday, reflecting both support for SCOTUS’ decision and dismay due to it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, who has been outspoken in his opposition to Youngkin’s executive order, posted to X that the stay SCOTUS granted “does not equal a win.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Unfortunately, The Governor&#8217;s scheme to block legal eligible (Virginia) voters has temporarily worked. It&#8217;s a sad day for the Commonwealth and the country,” he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement, state Sen. John McGuire, a member of the body’s Privileges and Elections subcommittee and a candidate for Virginia’s 5th Congressional District seat, commended the Youngkin administration for &#8220;leading the charge to keep our elections secure.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “This is simple: noncitizens shouldn’t be able to vote, and I’m glad the Supreme Court agrees,&#8221; McGuire stated. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As chair of the Senate Privileges and Elections Committee, Sen. Aaron Rouse, D-Virginia Beach had written a letter to Commissioner of Elections Susan Beals on Sep. 27, seeking more information on how the removals were handled under Youngkin’s Aug. 7 executive order and whether non-citizens were facing prosecution for attempting to register.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his letter Rouse referenced a Fox News </span><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6360067628112" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">interview</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Youngkin did the day of his executive order where he claimed that his order would lead to “immediate” removal of people and subsequent prosecution. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rouse asked Beals if registrars were referring people to commonwealth&#8217;s attorneys. In her Oct. 8 response to Rouse, Beals did not answer whether registrars had referred non-citizens to local prosecutors.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="DoFiHerc2c"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/over-1600-people-removed-from-voter-rolls-under-youngkin-order-groups-seek-court-injunction/">Over 1,600 people removed from voter rolls under Youngkin order; groups seek court injunction</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Over 1,600 people removed from voter rolls under Youngkin order; groups seek court injunction&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/over-1600-people-removed-from-voter-rolls-under-youngkin-order-groups-seek-court-injunction/embed/#?secret=eOvHIIJRpF#?secret=DoFiHerc2c" data-secret="DoFiHerc2c" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plaintiffs in the case against the state argue there has been no evidence of people being prosecuted for attempting to vote illegally. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I have tried to get straight answers from this Administration,” Rouse said Wednesday. “It took the U.S. Department of Justice filing suit and a federal judge forcing the Youngkin administration to disclose the names of those removed and confirm what we feared: that in fact eligible Virginia voters have been stripped from the rolls.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He added that he and members of his committee will “work to ensure that these disenfranchised voters are educated as to the procedures for casting a valid provisional ballot.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What the situation could mean for Virginia voters, on Election Day and beyond</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the stay in place, the case is likely to continue drawing national attention as the election nears, spotlighting debates over voting rights, citizenship and electoral integrity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It could also lead to confusion at the polls next Tuesday, because it remains unclear what information voters who have been purged would need to show for same-day registration, said Henry Chambers, a professor for constitutional law at the University of Richmond School of Law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The administration is claiming that there is sufficient evidence to knock someone off the rolls. If that’s true, and if a registrar has said this person shouldn’t be on the roll, I’m not sure what kind of information would convince the registrar that the person should be on the rolls and should have their provisional ballot counted. And that’s a tricky issue.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chambers added that it also remains unclear what the Supreme Court ruling means for the federal </span><a href="https://www.lwv.org/newsroom/press-releases/lawsuit-challenges-recent-voter-roll-purges-virginia-preventing-eligible-us" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">suit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> filed by the Virginia Coalition for Immigrant Rights and the League of Women Voters of Virginia earlier this month which alleges that the process used to purge the rolls violates the 90-day quiet period and therefore disenfranchises eligible voters while raising concerns over transparency and accuracy in the state’s voter registration system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In theory, the case goes back to the drawing board and you need to run it as a sort of a regular merits case as opposed to just an injunction case. But the problem with that is that the point of the case is that the 90-day quiet period is going to be over once election day is done,” Chambers said. “Then the question becomes, is the purge program in and of itself unlawful in general?’”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some state lawmakers have signaled they are ready to tackle that question, and </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/30/should-legislators-tweak-virginias-2006-voter-roll-law-for-more-clarity/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that undergirds it.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="3YaBAvmhuV"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/30/should-legislators-tweak-virginias-2006-voter-roll-law-for-more-clarity/">Should legislators tweak Virginia’s 2006 voter roll law for more clarity?</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State Sen. Travis Hackworth, R-Tazewell County, said in a phone interview Wednesday that in the 2025 legislative session, he would “be open to looking at anything” in the 2006 law that would limit potential confusion at the polls. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The bottom line is, if you are a U.S. citizen, we want you to vote, it’s your right and duty to vote,” said Hackworth, a member of the Senate Privileges &amp; Election who was “very disheartened” when the lower court ruled to halt Youngkin’s order.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If any among the affected 1,600 Virginians believe they have been removed from the voter rolls in error, Hackworth urged them to still cast a provisional ballot bringing documentation proving their citizenship status and let the local electoral board “figure that out.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think that maybe we are kind of overcomplicating this process, because anybody still has the right on the day of to say, ‘I have been purged from the voter rolls, I am a citizen of the United States, and I want to vote.’ If you have that much conviction to go to the polls and vote provisional, you will bring something that’s going to back up your claim that you are a citizen.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In </span><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24A407/330552/20241029131746854_24A407%20Beals_SCOTUS_Amicus_FINAL.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">its filing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the state GOP argues that the removal of illegally registered non-citizens from Virginia’s voter rolls should not be restricted by the “quiet period,” a federally mandated time frame close to an election during which systematic changes to the voter rolls are limited. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, in a </span><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24A407/330589/20241029151116178_333985%20Amicus%20on%20Application.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">separate amicus brief</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> also filed on Tuesday, a group of prominent Republicans who formerly served in Congress and are outspoken critics of the GOP’s presidential nominee Donald Trump – including Denver Riggleman, Barbara Comstock and Adam Kinzinger — are urging the Supreme Court to deny Virginia’s request for an emergency stay and uphold the lower court’s ruling. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In their filing, the former lawmakers argue that while the </span><a href="https://www.justice.gov/crt/national-voter-registration-act-1993-nvra" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (NVRA)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> authorizes “truly individualized removals” of voters from the rolls at any time, the law specifically seeks to prevent sweeping purges that could disenfranchise eligible voters rather than targeted removals of ineligible individuals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“To protect the right to vote from the inherent errors, vagaries, and bureaucratic swamp of last-minute systematic removals, Congress imposed the quiet period provision to protect voters in the immediate run-up to elections — at which point it might be impossible or impractical to correct a wrongfully terminated registration status,” the brief said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The “daily systematic removal program” recently undertaken by Virginia is precisely what the NVRA’s quiet period provision forbids, the filing continues.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is not a close case; it is instead a paradigmatic violation of Congress’s design. The fact that this last-minute systematic program has in fact disenfranchised eligible Virginia voters only confirms the wisdom of the NVRA’s plan and the illegality of this scheme. To hold otherwise would thwart the bipartisan congressional consensus underlying the NVRA.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Republicans argue in their own filing from Tuesday that even if the NVRA applies to efforts to remove illegally registered noncitizens from the voter rolls, Virginia’s process is “sufficiently individualized” and that it does not constitute the kind of “systematic” effort to remove individuals from the voter rolls prohibited during the “quiet period.”</span></p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Over 1,600 people removed from voter rolls under Youngkin order; groups seek court injunction&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/over-1600-people-removed-from-voter-rolls-under-youngkin-order-groups-seek-court-injunction/embed/#?secret=5TifZ8PSwI#?secret=PaMid6TgIU" data-secret="PaMid6TgIU" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The GOP filing claims that the Virginia Department of Elections’ practice of comparing voter rolls with data from the Department of Motor Vehicles to identify non-citizens is selective enough to sidestep the restrictions imposed by the quiet period.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Courts have correctly interpreted ‘systematically remove’ to mean programs that make decisions about voters’ eligibility based on mass information collected by third parties rather than individualized information or investigation,” the brief said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, the Republicans contend that allowing the lower court’s ruling to stand would cause “irreparable harm” as the Nov. 5 election nears. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The consequence of that order is that non-citizens — who all agree cannot legally vote — will be added back on the voter rolls at the last minute, diluting legitimate votes and exposing those non-citizens to a substantial risk of criminal prosecution should they misunderstand the lower courts’ order as a greenlight for them to vote unlawfully,” the filing said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The GOP also asserts that there is no risk of harm to eligible voters if the executive order remains in effect. Virginia law allows same-day registration, providing an alternative for those erroneously removed to cast a ballot on Election Day. According to the amicus brief, “no legal voters could or would be disenfranchised” if the executive order is upheld.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Monday, Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares filed the commonwealth’s appeal to Chief Justice John G. Roberts, seeking a stay on federal Judge Patricia Tolliver Giles’ Oct. 25 order requiring the reinstatement of individuals removed from Virginia’s voter rolls. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Giles had ruled that Youngkin’s order, issued in August, may have inadvertently included eligible voters. The order directed the Department of Motor Vehicles to send daily lists of individuals identified as noncitizens to the State Board of Elections for immediate removal from voter rolls. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the 2006 state law on which Youngkin’s directive is based calls for this process to occur on a monthly basis.</span></p>

(Parker Michels-Boyce/For the Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Five Waynesboro voters have filed a lawsuit to prevent the majority of the Waynesboro Board of Elections from following through on their controversial pledge to refuse certification of the November 2024 election results, a move they argue would violate Virginia state law. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The plaintiffs — Jennifer Lewis, Ann Criser-Shedd, Greg Fife, Chris Graham and Andrea Jackson — are seeking a court order to compel the election officials to certify the city’s votes.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://advancementproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024.10.21-Waynesboro-Complaint-File-Stamped.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lawsuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, filed in Waynesboro Circuit Court on Oct. 21, comes after two GOP officials from Waynesboro  filed </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/15/waynesboro-gop-officials-sue-over-va-s-voting-system-threaten-to-block-election-certification/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">their own lawsuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> challenging Virginia’s voting system ahead of the Nov. 5 presidential election while threatening to not certify the results.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In their complaint, Curtis Lilly, the chairman of the Waynesboro Electoral Board, and Scott Mares, the board’s vice chair, expressed their concerns over the reliability of electronic voting systems, which they argue are prone to inaccuracies. Instead, they demanded that all ballots be counted by hand. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, state law does not currently require a mandatory hand-count unless irregularities are proven, and all paper ballots are required to be counted by optical scanning machines, which help speed up the counting process and reduce the risk of human error. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before each election, the scanners undergo rigorous testing using a predetermined sample of votes to ensure accurate tallying before any real votes are counted. Additionally, it is illegal to connect ballot scanning machines to the Internet at any point, further safeguarding the integrity of the voting process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of the scanners used in Virginia’s elections are certified to meet both state and federal standards and are handled under a strict chain of custody to ensure security and accuracy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In their counter-suit, the five Waynesboro voters ask the court to require the election officials to certify the election results unless they prevail in their own suit. The plaintiffs further argue that the election officials’ stance violates the Virginia Constitution, which mandates that election results be certified in accordance with established procedures, including the use of legally authorized voting equipment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The chairman and vice chairman should do their job; instead they are purposely misinterpreting what they are charged to do. I cast my vote and have every right to expect that it will be counted on Election Day,” said Lewis, one of the plaintiffs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jackson, another plaintiff, said that voting in the 2024 election was “very important” to her. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am frustrated that the election officials are not doing what they take an oath to do, which is to make sure the election runs smoothly and every vote counts. Instead they are distracting us from our local elections by filing nonsensical court cases,” Jackson said. </span></p>

Glenn Youngkin speaks to reporters outside the Capitol near the end of the 2024 General Assembly session. (Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s executive order to remove more than 6,000 Virginians from the voter rolls has come under intense national scrutiny after the Department of Justice (DOJ) </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/14/voter-purge-lawsuits-add-to-disenfranchisement-allegations-against-youngkin-administration/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">filed a lawsuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> challenging its legality. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With just weeks until the Nov. 5 election, the suit has amplified concerns over voter disenfranchisement and the integrity of the state’s election process mirrored in other states leading up to the presidential contest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Fox News Sunday, Youngkin defended his move, arguing that it was based on a law signed in 2006 by then-Gov. Tim Kaine, a Democrat.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“To be clear, this is not a purge,” he told host Shannon Bream. “To describe this as something that’s a purge is completely inaccurate, it’s wholly consistent with the U.S. Constitution, the Virginia Constitution and Virginia law.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Monday, a federal judge in Alexandria </span><a href="https://www.wvtf.org/news/2024-10-21/federal-judge-orders-release-of-names-impacted-by-voter-rolls-purge" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ordered</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the Virginia Department of Elections to disclose the names of individuals removed from the state’s voter rolls by the Youngkin administration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ruling came in response to </span><a href="https://www.lwv.org/newsroom/press-releases/lawsuit-challenges-recent-voter-roll-purges-virginia-preventing-eligible-us" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an earlier lawsuit </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">from the League of Women Voters and the Virginia Coalition of Immigrant Rights, which challenged Youngkin’s </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/governor-of-virginia/pdf/eo/EO-35-Comprehensive-Election-Security-Ensuring-Legal-Voters-and-Accurate-Counting---vF---8.7.24.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Executive Order 35</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> signed in August, authorizing “daily” updates to Virginia’s voter rolls. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These updates involved comparing the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles’ list of individuals identified as non-citizens to the list of registered voters. Local registrars were then required to notify voters whose citizenship status was challenged, informing them that their registration would be canceled unless they confirmed their citizenship within 14 days. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The governor’s response to the DOJ lawsuit</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The DOJ’s lawsuit argues that the voter removals disproportionately affected minority communities and may have wrongfully removed eligible voters without adequate notice or due process less than 90 days before a presidential election — placing Youngkin’s executive order at the center of a growing national debate about voting rights and election security. On Sunday, Youngkin sought to clarify how his administration handled the process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It starts with a basic premise that when someone walks into one of our DMV’s and self-identifies as a noncitizen, and then they end up on the voter rolls, either purposely or by accident, that we go through a process individualized, not systematic, an individualized process based on that person&#8217;s self-identification as a noncitizen, to give them 14 days to affirm they are a citizen and if they don&#8217;t, they come off the voter rolls,” Youngkin told Fox News’ Shannon Bream.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, Youngkin also talked with CNN anchor Jake Tapper, who </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/14/politics/video/the-lead-immigration-misinformation-border-voter-registration-2024-jake-tapper" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pointed out</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the issue with the executive order wasn’t the program itself but approving it within 90 days of the election — the so-called quiet period — which the DOJ suit argues is prohibited under federal law. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Why is it that anyone could argue that a process that removes non-citizens off of our voter rolls is anything other than common sense and constitutional?” Youngkin asked, adding that he was “frustrated” with the department’s decision to sue 25 days before the presidential election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They could have started it a long time ago, we would have sorted this out, because I firmly believe they are wrong. But this seems far more political than otherwise, simply because of the fact that this has been going on since 2006, according to law, and they chose 25 days before an election in Virginia in order to assert something which really is inconsistent with the process that we are doing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tapper’s interview with Youngkin further caused a stir because of their heated exchange over  </span><a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4931778-donald-trump-national-guard-military-enemy-from-within/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recent comments</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that former President Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, made about the U.S. military.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During a Fox News appearance, Trump suggested deploying the National Guard or military on Election Day to prevent potential unrest, citing the threat of “the enemy from within,” which he described as “radical-left lunatics.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tapper asked Youngkin, “Is that something you support?” In response, the governor </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/15/politics/video/glenn-youngkin-jake-tapper-interview-trump-digvid" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">shifted the focus</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to border issues.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What former President Trump is referring to are the individuals crossing the border who are committing crimes, bringing drugs, trafficking humans, and turning every state into a border state.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin emphasized that, although Virginia is not a border state, it still feels the effects of “10 million people illegally crossing the border every single day.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tapper countered that while the problems at the border are real, that’s not what Trump was referring to. “He was talking about sick people, radical-left lunatics who should be handled by the National Guard or the military.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Later on in that same speech, Trump said that one of “the lunatics” he addressed was U.S. Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Ca., Tapper added. “That’s who he was talking about using the National Guard and military against, radical-left lunatics, the enemy from within, people like Adam Schiff.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response, Youngkin said he “can’t speak” for Trump. Instead, he said he believed the CNN anchor misinterpreted the former president’s rhetoric and was “misrepresenting his thoughts.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stephen Farnsworth, a political scientist at the University of Mary Washington, said that the legal fallout over Youngkin’s executive order and the subsequent debate in the national media  will likely benefit the governor’s desire to remain in the public discourse. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think Governor Youngkin is available to the national media because he wants to keep Republicans thinking about Glenn Youngkin. With the one consecutive term limit, Youngkin’s political fortunes may be improved with greater national media visibility.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the courts will ultimately rule on the governor’s actions, Youngkin’s continued participation in the national discourse is a win-win, according to Farnsworth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If he wins, it boosts his popularity with Republicans, and if he loses, he can still gain favor with the GOP base. The worst thing for a Virginia governor with national ambitions is to be ignored,” Farnsworth noted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a divided legislature likely to cause gridlock in the coming year and a gubernatorial election to pick Youngkin’s successor, Farnsworth added that, regardless of the presidential election outcome, there is “little downside in being combative” with the legislature.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Voter removal challenges elsewhere</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the fallout from the DOJ and League of Women Voters lawsuits continues, other states are also addressing concerns about voters being removed from rolls within the “quiet period.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A federal court order temporarily halted the Alabama Secretary of State’s “plan to ‘inactivate’ people the office suspected of not being U.S. citizens,” the Alabama Reflector </span><a href="https://alabamareflector.com/briefs/alabama-secretary-of-states-office-posts-news-release-required-by-court-order/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Oct. 21. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another legal battle may be on the horizon in Ohio. Several voting rights groups, led by the American Civil Liberties Union, on Oct. 3 </span><a href="https://www.acluohio.org/sites/default/files/oh_nvra_notice_letter_2024.10.03.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sent a letter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose, a Republican, raising concerns about mass voter removals in several counties. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The groups argue that the removals did not comply with the requirements of the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) and have warned they are prepared to take legal action if corrective measures are not implemented within 20 days.</span></p>

John McGuire, R-Goochland, and Democrat Gloria Witt at the 5th Congressional District candidates debate at Hampden-Sydney College in Farmville on Oct. 17, 2024. (Courtesy of ABC13/WSET) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrat Gloria Witt and her Republican opponent, state Sen. John McGuire, faced off in a respectful but spirited debate Thursday for the first and only time, offering sharply contrasting visions for Virginia’s 5th Congressional District as the race enters its final stretch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 45-minute discussion, hosted by WSET Lynchburg at Hampden-Sydney College in Farmville, provided a stark contrast between both candidates as they sparred over topics like immigration, education, foreign policy, political polarization and their faith in the electoral system. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With just 18 days until the Nov. 5 election, McGuire defended his presence at the Stop the Steal rally at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, as his constitutional right. On that day, a group of rioters stormed the Capitol in an attempt to halt the certification of the election that Republican Donald Trump lost to Democrat Joe Biden. At least </span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/donald-trump-says-absolutely-pardon-jan-6-rioters-rcna164565" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">140 police officers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> were injured in the violent event and over 1,400 people have been criminally charged in connection to it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s nothing wrong with that,” McGuire said of his right to protest. “The Democrats have weaponized that for political purposes, and it&#8217;s just a terrible thing about the division in our country.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McGuire also did not provide a clear response to the question by moderator Richard Pantele if he would accept the outcome of the presidential contest between Vice President Kamala Harris and Trump.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Let’s see what the elections are, and if it’s fair, it’s fair, and I’ll totally support that,” McGuire said, after defending Trump’s attempt to overturn the results of the 2020 election, which  Biden won by more than seven million votes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Over the years, even people remember Hillary Clinton challenged her election,” he said of the former Democratic presidential nominee, who conceded to Trump one day after losing the 2016 election. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There is nothing wrong with challenging irregularities until you are satisfied. And you think about this, we had this pandemic, some people called it the ‘Plandemic,’” McGuire said — referring to a trilogy of conspiracy theory films that promoted misinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic — earning him groans from the audience. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Under the guise of the ‘Plandemic’ or the pandemic, they came up with election season in Virginia, not Election Day, but 45 days,” McGuire said, an apparent reference to the state’s early voting period. “In one state, California, they said, if you want to have a voter ID, you should be arrested for that. So they changed the rules and if they were only for the pandemic, then after the pandemic, they should change it back, and they didn’t.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McGuire, a former U.S. Navy SEAL and state delegate from Goochland County who announced his congressional bid just one week after being elected to represent the 10th state Senate District last year, faced his own election challenge after the June 18 GOP primary, in which he defeated U.S. Rep. Bob Good, R-Farmville, by a razor-thin 0.6% margin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the election, Good asked for a recount, which eventually confirmed that McGuire had won the nomination contest by 366 votes out of more than 62,000 cast. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But internal divisions remained after some of the district’s conservative hardliners refused to accept McGuire as their nominee, vowing to instead write in Good on Nov. 5. The divide has led to fractures among local Republicans, with concerns that internal disagreements could weaken party unity ahead of the general election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Witt, who for the first time </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/16/democrat-gloria-witt-surpasses-5th-district-gop-rival-john-mcguire-in-latest-fundraising/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">has outraised</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> her opponent during the third quarter according to the latest fundraising data, has seized on the district GOP’s intra-party feud. At Thursday’s debate, she made the Nov. 5 election a referendum on the preservation of democracy and individual liberties. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Most of the GOP still cannot accept the fact that Donald Trump lost the election,” Witt said. “We’re at a serious point, so when you go to vote, it&#8217;s not about Republicans and Democrats and independents. It’s a test of your belief in the Constitution.  We are fighting for the Constitution of America.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Witt secured the Democratic nomination in the June 18 primary after defeating two opponents: Gary Terry, a Kentucky native and West Point graduate, and Paul Riley, a U.S. Army veteran and intelligence analyst.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since announcing her candidacy in the spring, she has been crisscrossing the district that spans 11,000-square-miles and encompasses the majority of Southside, including Danville, and the cities of Charlottesville and Lynchburg. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ve used this campaign to let folks know I’m a country girl,” Witt said. “I grew up without running water, we processed all our meats, we grew all our vegetables, we preserved them, pretty much lived off the land. You all would think of it as being organic right now, but we call it living. My values are faith, family, justice and community.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Throughout the debate, Witt positioned herself as a voice for change, accusing McGuire of being out of touch with the needs of everyday people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you care about having affordable healthcare, social security, affordable childcare, you want to think about voting for me,” Witt said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I want to be your voice in Congress because I am District 5, because I understand corporate and business, and I understand rural America. So I want you to leave here thinking because this is the pivotal election, this is not about Democrats and Republicans. We’re testing our belief in the Constitution and our rights and freedoms.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The candidates shared contrasting views on immigration and foreign policy. McGuire promoted Trump’s plan to deport all undocumented immigrants while building a wall at the southern border instead of funding Ukraine’s defense against Russia’s invasion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m not sure what the best solution is, but I do know that four years ago we didn’t have the problems in Ethiopia, Ukraine and Israel,” McGuire said. “These things were not going on, and statistics just came out that </span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/investigations/13000-immigrants-convicted-homicide-living-freely-us-ice-data-rcna173125" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">13 to 15,000 murderers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> had been released into our country with this open border. It’s crazy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Witt countered that Republicans have used immigration as a “political pawn” by rejecting the bipartisan Secure the Border Act of 2023, which would have allocated more resources for border protection and the construction of a wall. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For me, it&#8217;s about fixing the problem with resources, with technology; you evaluate, you assess, and you get (the immigrants) working so that they can be tax-paying people for those who qualify when it comes to the asylum question,” Witt said. “Let’s get them in and process them quickly and get them out if they don’t qualify.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most contentious moments of the debate came when Pantele, the moderator, asked both candidates about their views on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), which is a policy framework for promoting fairness and full participation for all people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I support equity as a goal,” Witt said. “You know, we got to where we are as a people, African American people of color, because of civil rights and the efforts to create equality after starting from a handicap of enslavement. Without diversity, equity and inclusion you end up with our power broker in charge.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McGuire said that while he believed in equal opportunity for all Americans, he does not agree with an equal outcome. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m against that, it should be meritocracy,” McGuire said, calling DEI a “marxist idea.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If a plane goes down in the jungle and there’s one direction you go to save your whole team, do you want someone who’s never been in the jungle or do you want a Navy SEAL who is an expert on survival to keep the team alive? It should be based on merit and I don’t care if you’re pink or blue.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But both candidates found some common ground when they vowed to work with their colleagues from across the aisle, if elected. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I would want to work bipartisan to move the country forward, it’s one of the reasons I decided to run for this role,” Witt said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McGuire touted his record of passing bipartisan legislation in both the Virginia House of Delegates and the state Senate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If we treat each other with respect and work as a team, we can turn a no into a yes, we can turn the impossible to a possible,” he said. </span></p>

John McGuire. (Photos courtesy of respective congressional campaigns) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a significant fundraising boost, Democrat Gloria Witt for the first time has outpaced her Republican opponent, state Sen. John McGuire, R-Goochland, in Virginia’s 5th Congressional District, with only weeks until the Nov. 5 election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Witt’s campaign reported having pulled in $218,627 in the third quarter ending Sept. 30, as opposed to McGuire, who raised $198,577 during the same time, according to the latest finance disclosure data released by the Federal Elections Commission Wednesday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In total, Witt has raised $276,755 since launching her campaign in March. McGuire, who was engulfed in a vicious primary battle with U.S. Rep. Bob Good, R-Farmville, for much of the year, has raised $1.15 million during this election cycle. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But after McGuire’s expensive recount following the June 18 primary, where he narrowly defeated Good by just 366 votes out of 62,792 cast, his campaign funds have dwindled to $121,562. For the first time, Witt has surpassed him, reporting $163,905 in cash on hand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic Party of Virginia Chairwoman Susan Swecker said in a statement Wednesday that while “Republicans are in disarray” in the 5th District, Witt is “laser-focused on running a winning” campaign. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Her impressive surge in fundraising is proof that Virginians in the 5th District know that she will stand up for them. There’s a reason John McGuire isn’t raising money — he still doesn’t have the support of his own party.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A spokesman for McGuire’s campaign did not respond to a text message seeking comment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fifth District Republicans have been grappling with </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/30/four-top-5th-district-gop-officials-ousted-for-not-supporting-mcguire/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">internal divisions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as infighting intensifies ahead of the upcoming election. The close primary race, followed by the recount in August, has deepened rifts within the party, with factions backing either McGuire or Good’s hardline conservative platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These internal struggles have raised concerns about the GOP&#8217;s ability to present a united front against Witt, leading to anxiety among some party insiders that the lingering tensions could weaken McGuire’s campaign and give Democrats an opening in a district which Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, won with 53% of the votes in 2016 and 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">David Richards, a political science professor at the University of Lynchburg, said that Democrats have been raising “a lot of cash” statewide during the 2024 election cycle. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Witt seems to have benefitted from this, possibly also the fact that her odds, although long, seem better in the 5th than Karen Baker’s do in the 9th District,” Richards said, referring to the Democratic nominee who is </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/27/in-the-fightin-ninth-baker-seeks-to-end-griffiths-13-year-tenure/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">seeking to unseat</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> U.S. Rep. Morgan Griffith, R-Salem, who has represented the district since 2011.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lack of national money being directed at McGuire “is not surprising,” since the 5th District is seen as a safe GOP seat, Richards added. “But if the GOP is fractured enough in the 5th, Witt may squeak in. I’m still not betting rent money she does win, but her odds are better than before.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite running a strong ground game in the neighboring 9th District, Baker has been struggling to catch up to the Republican incumbent in the money race. According to the latest FEC filings, she  raised $93,503 in the third quarter, and a total of $174,419 during this election cycle, with just $78,727 cash on hand. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Griffith, however, raised $164,299 between July and September, bringing in a total of $907,204, mostly from corporate donors. His campaign currently has $559,895 cash on hand. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats, however, have kept their cash advantage in other competitive House districts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/10/tight-race-in-virginias-7th-congressional-district-as-derrick-anderson-eugene-vindman-face-off/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">7th District</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Democrat Eugene Vindman has significantly out-raised Republican Derrick Anderson during the third quarter, bringing in $6.4 million compared to Anderson&#8217;s $781,321. Overall, Vindman has raised $13.8 million for his campaign and holds nearly $3 million in cash on hand, while Anderson has raised a total of $1.9 million, with just over $1 million in cash reserves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And in the </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/30/northern-virginias-10th-congressional-district-race-pits-clancy-against-subramanyam/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">10th District</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, state Sen. Suhas Subramanyam, D-Loudoun, out-raised Republican nominee Mike Clancy between July and September, bringing in $1.1 million compared to Clancy&#8217;s $205,219. Subramanyam has raised a total of $2.4 million for his congressional campaign, with $674,396 in cash on hand. Clancy, meanwhile, has raised $793,748 this election cycle and holds $563,699 in cash reserves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/07/kaine-faces-off-against-gop-challenger-cao-in-high-stakes-u-s-senate-race/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia&#8217;s U.S. Senate election</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Republican nominee Hung Cao out-raised incumbent democratic U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine in the third quarter with $3.3 million compared to Kaine’s $3 million, despite trailing the senator </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/harris-kaine-ahead-in-virginia-by-comfortable-margins-new-poll-says/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">by double digits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the polls. However, Kaine still leads in overall fundraising, with a total of $13.1 million raised this election cycle and more than $7 million cash on hand. In contrast, Cao has raised $6.2 million in total, with $2.2 million available.</span></p>

(Parker Michels-Boyce for the Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two GOP officials from Waynesboro have filed a lawsuit challenging Virginia&#8217;s voting system ahead of the Nov. 5 presidential election while threatening to not certify the results.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In their complaint, Curtis Lilly, the chairman of the Waynesboro Electoral Board, and Scott Mares, the board’s vice chair, are raising concerns about the validity of future results while echoing unmerited claims that the 2020 election, in which Democrat Joe Biden defeated then-President Donald Trump with more than 7 million votes, was stolen.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Filed on Oct. 4 at the Waynesboro Circuit Court against Virginia Department of Elections Commissioner Susan Beals and State Board of Elections Chairman John O’Bannon, the suit alleges that the voting machines used in the state are unverifiable and could potentially be manipulated. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The plaintiffs further claim the machines may be connected to the internet, allowing for external tampering, though this is illegal under state law and no evidence has been provided to support this allegation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When reached by phone Tuesday, Lilly declined to be interviewed for this story. Mares did not respond to several calls seeking comment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lilly and Mares argue that under the current legal regime, local electoral board members are unable to personally review and verify that the voting machine program being used to count the ballots “is keeping and recording a true and accurate count,” and that the device’s record tape accurately represents the ballots cast.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Consequently, the plaintiffs believe that the voting machine is counting the votes in secret, because neither the program counting the votes recorded on the ballots nor the ballots themselves can be examined,” the complaint says. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lilly further stated in an affidavit attached to the complaint that he “cannot ensure that the machines do not connect to the internet, allowing for vote counting algorithm manipulation, nor can I ensure with any certainty that the electronic ballot scanners are presenting results which are consistent with the contents of the ballot box.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Henry Chambers, a professor for constitutional law at the University of Richmond School of Law, said in a phone interview Tuesday that the lawsuit appears to be based on long debunked conspiracy theories circulating after the 2020 presidential election that claimed vote counting machines had been programmed to get votes wrong and to flip votes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s not really a serious thing, but some people have bought into it and it sounds like these folks have bought into it, too,” Chambers said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Their notion is that vote counting that is done by a machine is done in secret, and therefore you have to hand-count the votes, presumably in public, in order to have a real tally of the actual vote count,” Chamber continued. “That would suggest that voting that is not done by hand and in public qualifies as counting in secret, which in theory would violate the state Constitution.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, voters cast paper ballots, which are then counted by optical scanning machines — as required </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title24.2/chapter6/section24.2-626/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">by state law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — to expedite the process and avoid human error. Ballot scanning machines are certified to meet both state and federal standards and are maintained under a controlled chain of custody.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before every election, the scanners are tested using a predetermined sample of votes to ensure they are tallied accurately before any actual votes are cast, and it is against the law to connect a ballot scanning machine to the Internet at any point. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beals, who was appointed as Virginia’s top elections official in March 2022, did not respond to text messages seeking comment Tuesday, and a spokeswoman for the Department of the Elections said in an email that the department does not comment on pending litigation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But in </span><a href="https://cardinalnews.org/2024/08/08/virginias-top-elections-official-says-shes-confident-about-the-accuracy-of-results/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an interview</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in July, Beals said that hacking the scanning machines was impossible. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Period. They cannot be,” she said, adding that after the testing of the devices ahead of the election and on Election Day, officials also conduct risk-eliminating audits, which she called the back-end check.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So we have three different checks throughout the system just to make sure that the machines are reporting accurately.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chambers, the UR professor, called the plaintiffs’ argument that the machine counting of ballots happened in secrecy “an odd thing,” because the machine itself is doing the counting in a public space, supervised by election officials. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The problem with counting being done in public is that one can’t necessarily explicitly see what’s going on. But the fact is, we have lots of things that count things and we just agree that it’s being counted correctly, like ATM machines,” Chambers said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No one would say that the ATM machine is spitting out money in secret, but it’s spitting out money in response to a request. Here, a voting machine is counting votes in response to a ballot being fed through a machine.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By asking for ballots to be hand-counted instead of being tabulated by machines, the plaintiffs could really be asking for a slow-down of the count, Chambers added, which “can introduce additional problems with a valid count — and that is the whole point of feeding the ballots through during the day and having a continuous count is so that you can have results in a reasonable and fair time. Hand counting is used only when necessary when you&#8217;re talking about things like absentee ballots or ballots that can’t be read by the machine.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also remains unclear why the GOP election officials who filed the suit would threaten to not certify the presidential election, in a county that leans Republican and where Trump won with 51-46% in 2020. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rich Anderson, the chairman of the Republican Party of Virginia, underscored that the lawsuit was a lone effort by a small group of GOP officials from one locality. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As far as I know it’s only happening in this one jurisdiction out of 133, but it’s all going to get settled in the courts anyway,” Anderson said in a phone interview. “What they’re asking is the court to render its opinion, which it will do, and the opinion will likely be on the side of Virginia law, which says that ballots are counted through the optical scanners, not by hand.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The counting of ballots by optical scanning machines has been proven as safe and reliable, Anderson said. </span></p>

Glenn Youngkin speaking with reporters outside the Capitol Building on March 7, 2024. (Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Long before becoming a lawyer, state lawmaker and Virginia’s first Black House Speaker, Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, was, for years, unable to vote. After a previous felony conviction, it wasn’t until former Republican Gov. Bob McDonnell restored his rights that Scott could participate in democracy again — eventually paving the way for his own run for office.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Justice Department on Friday filed a lawsuit against Virginia, alleging that a state program aimed at removing people from the voter rolls, which Gov. Glenn Youngkin touted in an </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/governor-of-virginia/pdf/eo/EO-35-Comprehensive-Election-Security-Ensuring-Legal-Voters-and-Accurate-Counting---vF---8.7.24.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">executive order</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in August, was implemented too close to the Nov. 5 elections and wrongfully included eligible voters. Scott said it’s another example of Youngkin’s administration restricting voting access. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I would not be where I am today if I had to depend on somebody like Glenn Youngkin to help me get my rights restored,” Scott said in an interview Monday. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_37471" class="wp-caption alignright" style="max-width:100%;width:300px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/img_4042/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-37471" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/IMG_4042-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/IMG_4042-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/IMG_4042-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/IMG_4042-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/IMG_4042-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/IMG_4042-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth (left), with former Republican Gov. Bob McDonnell, who restored his voting rights after a felony conviction, at the state Capitol in January. (Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a memo in response to the suit obtained by The Mercury over the weekend, Richard Cullen, a counselor to Youngkin, wrote that Virginia’s process for removing noncitizens from the voting rolls has taken place under both Democratic and Republican governors. It also outlines how Youngkin believes he is not violating a federal policy to have purged rolls by a set time that would allow a buffer to resolve any errors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Federal law does not prohibit the removal of noncitizens from the voting rolls,” the memo said, adding that the 90-day “quiet period” under the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) is “not relevant to this process since Virginia conducts an individualized — not systematic — review per Virginia law in order to correct registration records.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin on Friday called the lawsuit “unprecedented,” underscoring that his executive order simply was “appropriately enforcing a 2006 law” signed by then-Gov. Tim Kaine, a Democrat, which requires Virginia to remove noncitizens from the voter rolls. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With the support of our attorney general, we will defend these common sense steps that we are legally required to take, with every resource available to us,” Youngkin said in a statement. “Virginia’s election will be secure and fair, and I will not stand idly by as this politically motivated action tries to interfere in our elections, period.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Scott commended the Justice Department for taking action (it also recently filed a similar </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/09/27/justice-department-alabama-lawsuit-voting/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">suit against Alabama)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The reason that we have this 90-day rule is that we don’t want citizens to be accidentally removed,” Scott said. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Related lawsuit stresses potential effect on naturalized citizens</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The DOJ suit also isn’t the only litigation that Youngkin faces over his Executive Order 35. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A federal </span><a href="https://www.lwv.org/newsroom/press-releases/lawsuit-challenges-recent-voter-roll-purges-virginia-preventing-eligible-us" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">suit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> filed by the Virginia Coalition for Immigrant Rights and the League of Women Voters of Virginia earlier this month alleges that the process used to purge the rolls violates the </span><a href="https://www.justice.gov/crt/national-voter-registration-act-1993-nvra" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Voter Registration Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, disenfranchising eligible voters while raising concerns over transparency and accuracy in the state’s voter registration system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legal action by the two nonprofits came after reports surfaced that Virginians were being removed from the voter rolls due to alleged inaccuracies and outdated information. Many of these removals, the suit argues, were done without proper notification or investigation, leaving eligible voters unaware that they could no longer cast their ballots.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lawsuit also claims that the purges disproportionately affect minority communities, low-income voters, and those who may not have easy access to the internet to check their voter status. It further asserts that the Youngkin administration has failed to adequately confirm whether a voter is ineligible, potentially silencing their voice in the democratic process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Naturalized citizens serve in our armed forces, pay taxes, and show their patriotism daily with their acts and contributions to our society,” Monica Sarmiento, executive director of the Virginia Coalition for Immigrant Rights, said in a statement earlier this month.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Forcing new American communities to carry undue burden that no other community is required to comply with is discrimination, and does not represent the values that our commonwealth stands for,” Sarmiento said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under Youngkin’s executive order, the Virginia Department of Elections is now required to send just one notice to individuals at risk of being removed from the voter rolls. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This notice is based on information from the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV), but there is no requirement for the accuracy of that information to be verified by either the Department of Elections or local election officials before action is taken. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State Sen. Bill Stanley, R-Franklin County, said Monday that the law referenced in Youngkin’s executive order relates to persons who self-identify as “non-citizens” on DMV forms that are turned over to the State Board of Elections, which then checks the information against the voter rolls and notifies those persons of pending removal from the state’s voter registration list, giving them 14 days notice of removal and the right to challenge.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And there are failsafe measures to this,” Stanley said. “Even if they are subsequently removed from the rolls, let’s say, in error, those persons can still register to vote on Election Day under our ‘same day’ registration law. So I fail to see why the federal government is doing this but for no other reason but to try to upset our otherwise sound voter registration process here in Virginia for political purposes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And Rich Anderson, the chairman of the Republican Party of Virginia, said in a phone interview Monday afternoon that Youngkin’s executive order “brought together a lot of operating practices and standards that may have been scattered over a number of other places, put it together in one document and demonstrated to the commonwealth that the governor took this seriously and was exercising his responsibilities as the chief executive.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the responsibilities of the executive branch, working with the legislative branch, is to “ensure confidence in our electoral processes and systems, and that was the whole intent of this, I think,” Anderson said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Elections Commissioner Susan Beals, whom Youngkin appointed as Virginia’s top elections official just weeks after assuming office in early 2021, said </span><a href="https://cardinalnews.org/2024/08/08/virginias-top-elections-official-says-shes-confident-about-the-accuracy-of-results/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in an interview</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> one week before the governor issued his executive order that a process to prohibit non-citizens from voting was already in place. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Anybody who comes to the DMV and shows documents that indicate they are a non-citizen — whether it is a visa or residency — their name is sent to the Department of Elections on a monthly basis so we can double check to make sure that they did not make their way on our voter rolls. If we find them on the rolls, we cancel them,” Beals said in the interview. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Previous election access issues</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two lawsuits are the latest in a string of voting access issues during Youngkin’s tenure.</span></p>

In October 2023, more than 3,000 people had been mistakenly </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/11/01/voting-rights-advocates-blast-youngkin-admin-over-error-affecting-3400/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">removed from voter rolls</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McDonnell, the Republican governor who restored Scott’s rights, along with democratic Govs. Terry McAuliffe and Ralph Northam, had streamlined the process and eventually made it automatic.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia chapter of the NAACP took Youngkin to court last year to get answers but a </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/judge-finds-for-youngkin-administration-in-naacps-foia-case/article_210d11ec-9936-11ee-a87e-138606562546.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">judge ruled that most details are exempt from being shared</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> through a provision in the Freedom of Information Act. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though Youngkin’s changes to the process aren’t going against the law, Democratic lawmakers feel it’s being used as a way to limit who can vote. The latest executive order falls amid </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/10/12/nx-s1-5147789/voting-election-2024-noncitizen-fact-check-trump" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">continued allegations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump that illegal immigrants are trying to vote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a recent </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/23/trump-youngkin-urge-early-voting-during-tele-rally/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">telephone rally</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with Trump, Youngkin touted the purge of over 6,000 people as noncitizens. But a Washington Post review of records and interviews with election officials </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/10/09/youngkin-noncitizen-voters-virginia/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">found that most of the purge stemmed from paperwork errors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, like people forgetting to check a citizenship box. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also noted that of Virginia’s three illegal voting prosecutions to occur since 2022, none involved a question of citizenship.</span></p>

The findings echo earlier research from JLARC that found VMSDEP has grown by nearly </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/10/at-task-force-meeting-military-families-rip-ugly-side-of-virginias-government/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">350% </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">since 2019, from about 1,400 students that year to 6,400 in 2023. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the veterans population in the United States has seen a decline from 22 million to 18 million in the past decade according to Veterans Affairs Annual Benefits reports, the number of veterans with a 100% disability rating — the highest rating a veteran can receive for service-connected disabilities — has grown from from 400,000 in 2014 to 1.3 million in 2023, the review found.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“On the one hand, the number of veterans has been declining and is declining. So if you look at it just in terms of that, you can make the case that maybe this program is going to start trending down and maybe we’re seeing a peak,” Justin Brown, JLARC’s senior associate director, told the panel. </span></p>

(Courtesy of Joint Legislative Audit &amp; Review Commission)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But a “more powerful factor”  may be the rise in veterans with a higher disability rating, Brown said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You don’t know which of these trends is going to prevail, but clearly there’s upward pressure on the disability side, while the big number of veterans is going down. So that complicates how you think about what might happen to the program in the future.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some lawmakers have expressed concern that the program is financially unsustainable, prompting them to implement eligibility changes during the 2024 General Assembly session. However, those changes were repealed in July, and in response, a Senate work group, a governor’s task force, and a study were established to review the program.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The JLARC review found that the number of relatives eligible to receive benefits has grown substantially since 2019, when the legislature approved a change that added added dependents of veterans whose death or disability due to military service in general — not just combat-related — to those who qualify.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brown said that until these more recent changes to VMSDEP, the program enrollment was small enough “that it just didn’t represent really anything in the general fund budget, and it wasn’t really on the institutions’ radar from the financial perspective, because it was pretty small.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of 2022-23, undergraduate students accounted for about 89% of all VMSDEP participants.  Graduate students, though, have been increasing over time as a proportion of students benefiting from the program.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2023-24 alone, VMSDEP enrollment in four-year colleges and universities has grown by 32%, JLARC data shows. In two-year colleges, it has increased by 47% during the same period. About half of total VMSDEP enrollment at four-year institutions is at Old Dominion University (20.6%), Virginia Commonwealth University (16.7%) and George Mason University (14.9%). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The data also found that 82% of beneficiaries are biological children of veterans, with 15% of them being spouses and 3% adopted children. Nearly all (96%) receive benefits because of a veteran’s disability — only 1% are related to a veteran who was killed or missing in action or was declared a prisoner of war. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With beneficiaries essentially receiving a free college education, some Virginia universities have raised concerns about the increasing costs of enrolling more students under the program without tuition payments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Let’s go back to Fiscal Year 2023, this was the year prior to when you started the process of providing general funds,” Brown told the committee. “In that year, it becomes a pretty large percentage of total revenue, and it’s just revenue that they&#8217;re not collecting due the waiver.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The JLARC review found that several institutions are using various means to compensate for forgone revenue, mostly by raising tuition and fees for other students, reducing or controlling operational spending, tapping into their general funds or institutional revenue. But quantifying the impact of VMSDEP on tuition remains “extremely difficult.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To offset some of the forgone revenue impact on public colleges and universities, the General Assembly earlier this year appropriated $20 million in general funds for fiscal year 2025 and 2026, with an additional $45 million each year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The State Council of Higher Education for Virginia (SCHEV), the commonwealth’s coordinating agency for higher education, began allocating new general funds to institutions in August, Brown said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, when CNU reported that the forgone revenue caused by the program was 3.5% of the university’s total revenue, SCHEV filled that shortfall by providing available general funds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moving forward, the JLARC study recommends that the General Assembly appropriate “sufficient general funds to cover 100% of institutions’ forgone revenue.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alternatively, the program could be maintained at its current general fund level and the legislature could either distribute funds to institutions proportionally according to their percentage of total VMSDEP enrollment or according to institutions’ relative ability to absorb the forgone revenue. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There will be winners and losers in that, I guarantee it, but that’s another way to do it. And we can help you think through that if you would like,” Brown said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers could also follow a model from Texas and create a new fund with a combination of one-time and ongoing appropriations and apportion funds to institutions. In recent years, the fund in the Lone Star State has covered about 15% of its program cost, leaving the institutions on the hook for the remaining costs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brown warned lawmakers that when contemplating changes to the funding of the program, they would be advised to consider that many future participants in VMSDEP have already been certified eligible and several thousand are already certified, but not yet using the benefit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Depending on what you do, if you do anything, you’ll need to think about when something is effective,” Brown said. “I also think that there’s some minor changes in here that we’re going to give you as options that you could maybe do a little bit more quickly, bigger changes you might want to give some more lead time. But that’s just critically important for this particular program.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kayla Owens, co-founder of Friends of VMSDEP, called Monday’s JLARC presentation “disappointing, yet somewhat expected.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Owens asked for the JLARC data to be made publicly accessible, and for the group submit to an audit of its research process. She also challenged the state to commit to an independent study of VMSDEP.</span></p>
<p>Mitch Rubenstein, commander of the Veterans of Foreign Wars Department of Virginia, said in a text message Monday that the VFW is reviewing the JLARC report.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The VFW urges all involved to put aside partisan politics and create a long term, sustainable path forward for this important program,” Rubenstein said.</span></p>

(Jonathan Ernst/Scott Olson/Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, leads Republican Donald Trump by 11 points (52-41%) among Virginia likely voters, according to </span><a href="https://cnu.edu/wasoncenter/surveys/archive/2024-10-07.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a new poll</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> released Monday by the Wason Center for Civic Leadership at Christopher Newport University. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The survey found that 4% of voters remain undecided four weeks before the Nov. 5 election, while 3% say they will vote for someone else. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the U.S. Senate race, Democrat Tim Kaine leads Republican Hung Cao by 20 points, or 55% to 35%, with 8% saying they are undecided and 2% saying they will vote for someone else.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Top-of-mind issues for Virginia likely voters include inflation and the economy (29%), threats to democracy (18%), immigration (11%), followed by abortion (10%). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the survey, voters think Harris would do a better job than Trump handling an array of policy issues, with a narrow lead on inflation and the economy (49% to 48%), a moderate advantage on threats to democracy (54-40%) and a large advantage on abortion (60-32%), racial inequality (61-31%) and climate change (61-29%). Trump has a narrow advantage over Harris on handling immigration (49-48%). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, Harris has a +9 favorability rating (51-42%) in Virginia, with 8% indicating they have no opinion or don’t know. Trump is underwater with a -22 favorability rating (36-58%); 6% say no opinion or don’t know.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harris’ running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, has a +12 favorability rating (47-35%), with 19% indicating no opinion or don’t know. Ohio Sen. JD Vance, the Republican vice presidential nominee, has a –16 favorability rating at 34 to 50%, with 16% indicating no opinion or don’t know.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine has a +23 favorability rating (53-30%) with 17% saying they have no opinion or don’t know. Cao has an even favorability rating (23-23%); however, he is less well known, with a majority of likely voters indicating no opinion or don’t know (54%). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With early voting underway in Virginia since Sept. 20, likely voters are “fairly enthusiastic” to vote in the elections, with 82% indicating they are either very enthusiastic (64%) or somewhat enthusiastic (18%). Democratic voters have an enthusiasm advantage with 75% indicating they are very enthusiastic compared to 68% of Republicans and 46% of Independents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While most Virginia likely voters surveyed have yet to cast their ballots, a higher percentage of Democrats say they have voted when compared to Republicans and Independents (22-11-9%). In past elections Democrats have been more likely to vote early than Republicans, though Gov. Glenn Youngkin made a push in the 2022 General Assembly elections for Republicans to vote early and has </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/20/as-early-voting-starts-in-virginia-political-parties-rally-their-bases/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">advocated for early voting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the current election cycle. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The results of the Wason poll are based on 800 interviews with registered Virginia voters who are likely general election voters, including 211 on landline and 589 on cell phone, conducted Sept. 28 to Oct. 4, 2024. The margin of error for the whole survey is +/-4.4%</span></p>

Tim Kaine, D-Va., at an interview in Richmond (Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury) and Hung Cao (courtesy of Hung Cao campaign)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The morning of Monday, April 16, 2007, is forever etched in Virginia Democratic U.S. Rep. Tim Kaine&#8217;s memory.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On that tragic day, Seung-Hui Cho, an undergraduate student at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, killed 32 people and wounded 17 others in a mass shooting before taking his own life. The incident, carried out with two semi-automatic pistols, remains one of the deadliest school shootings in U.S. history.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I still have a lot of almost PTSD kind of scar tissue about that,” said Kaine in a recent interview. At the time, he was in the second year of his four-year term as Virginia’s governor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, 17 years later, Kaine is seeking a third term in the U.S. Senate. The Democrat faces a challenge from Republican Hung Cao, a retired Navy captain and political newcomer. With </span><a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2024/virginia/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">polling data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> showing Kaine holding a comfortable lead, both candidates are ramping up their campaigns as they approach the final stretch.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="A3R7TVJDVd"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/02/kaine-and-cao-clash-on-immigration-the-economy-in-heated-debate-at-norfolk-state-university/">Kaine and Cao clash on immigration, the economy in heated debate at Norfolk State University</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Kaine and Cao clash on immigration, the economy in heated debate at Norfolk State University&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/02/kaine-and-cao-clash-on-immigration-the-economy-in-heated-debate-at-norfolk-state-university/embed/#?secret=VJiTIC8JOO#?secret=A3R7TVJDVd" data-secret="A3R7TVJDVd" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the Minnesota-born, Harvard-educated lawyer, who began his career in public service as a civil rights attorney before moving into politics, sensible gun regulations are one of the key issues defining Kaine’s campaign and setting him apart from his opponent. If reelected, it’s an area that he wants to continue to work on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We haven’t done enough yet to reduce gun violence,” Kaine said in the interview. “I had a teacher tell me not long ago, ‘when we do that moment of silence at the beginning of every day, I know every adult in the building is thinking, let today not be that day.’”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s children, parents, and teachers shouldn’t have to worry every day, Kaine added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So I do feel like there is more that can be done. Virginia has done some good things, and with the NRA headquarters here, we ought to be able to pass some of these gun safety laws in Congress,” he said, referring to universal background checks, closing loopholes in gun sales, and banning assault weapons, measures he has advocated for in his time on Capitol Hill.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Throughout his 12-year tenure in the Senate, Kaine has been a steadfast advocate for progressive policies, focusing on healthcare, education, and climate change. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His bipartisan efforts relating to military issues — such his role in sponsoring the War Powers Consultation Act, which seeks to clarify the role of Congress in war decisions, and his support of the expansion of the GI Bill and improving mental health services for military personnel — have also helped solidify his reputation in a state with a significant military presence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine’s incumbency gives him a distinct advantage, not only due to name recognition but also thanks to his deep ties across the commonwealth. As the husband of Anne Holton — the daughter of former Republican Gov. Lindwood Holton — he has positioned himself as a champion of Virginia’s diverse demography, from residents of urban centers like Northern Virginia to the rural regions of the Shenandoah Valley and the Blue Ridge Mountains.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Showing up is part of the job, and I tell people if somebody won’t show up for it, they’re never gonna stand up for you,” Kaine said about his strategy for remaining a popular contender in Virginia, a state that has leaned Democratic in more recent times, but that still remains open to electing Republicans, as Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s 2021 victory has shown.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I want people to know that I will stand up for them and you do that by being everywhere. Plus I enjoy it. I mean, I love the job, but more than the 36 weeks a year I’m in D.C., I love the 16 weeks when I’m in Virginia, and figuring out ways I can help with whatever challenges or aspirations people have.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine’s opponent Cao, who immigrated to the U.S. as a child after fleeing communist Vietnam, presents a sharp contrast to the Democratic incumbent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a platform closely aligned with former President Donald Trump — who endorsed him earlier this year — the Loudoun County resident has focused heavily on issues like immigration and national security, echoing Trump&#8217;s “America First” rhetoric. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cao declined to be interviewed for this story, but he has openly supported Trump’s plan to deport all undocumented immigrants that are currently in the country. Cao also supports the former president’s effort to build a border wall, which he began during his first term in the White House.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We will build the wall, we will secure the border through advanced technology, we will support the Border Patrol and border states, and we will repel this invasion,” Cao said on </span><a href="https://www.hungforva.com/border/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">his website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Republican has also echoed Trump’s calls for imposing more tariffs for imports from countries like China, which </span><a href="https://www.hungforva.com/economy/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">he called </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">“an existential threat” to the United States. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There is no excuse for American exports to be taxed at a higher rate than Chinese imports,” Cao said on his website. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a former Navy special operations officer who has served in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Somalia, Cao has lamented the drop in the U.S. military’s recruitment numbers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since 2013, male enlistments have decreased by 35%, going from 58,000 men enlisting in 2013 to 37,700 in 2023, according to the </span><a href="https://www.military.com/daily-news/2024/06/14/armys-recruiting-problem-male.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">service data.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Meanwhile, female recruitment has hovered around 10,000 recruits each year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our military must have the resources it needs to face growing instability around the world. Right now, we face abysmal recruiting numbers and deficits in overall readiness. This is a leadership problem first and foremost and our active duty servicemembers deserve better,” Cao said on his website. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking ahead to the Nov. 5 election, Kaine conceded in the interview that at least the presidential contest will be close, in part because Democrats have failed to communicate what he called the economic victories of President Joe Biden’s administration. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among these accomplishments, Kaine named the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which authorized $1.2 trillion for transportation and infrastructure spending with $550 billion of that figure going toward new investments and programs, such as the Green New Deal, and the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I do blame Democrats’ messaging, because if you ask people, ‘If you see a Republican ad on TV, what are they talking about?’ Maybe inflation, something about the economy,” Kaine said. “When they see a Democrat on TV, what Democrats talk about is access to abortions, a really important issue, but you often don’t see Dems really leaning into the economy. That’s why our first ad, which is up on TV, is an economy ad.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine said that his positions on the economy contrast sharply with those of Cao, his Republican opponent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He opposes the infrastructure bill, and he opposed the inflation Reduction Act, including all these clean energy investments,” Kaine said. “I mean, we’re going to have a vote on reauthorizing the infrastructure bill in 2026. I’ll vote, yes, he’d vote no. For those who care about infrastructure investments, like roads, rail, bridges, ports, broadband, you know, electric transmission, offshore wind, I’m going to keep these.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At their only </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/02/kaine-and-cao-clash-on-immigration-the-economy-in-heated-debate-at-norfolk-state-university/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">televised debate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at Norfolk State University last week, the two candidates clashed over a variety of positions, including abortion rights.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Kaine said that he has introduced legislation that would codify Roe v. Wade in order to statutorily protect women’s access to abortion, Cao accused his opponent of supporting “unlimited abortion” up to and including after birth.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What he wants to do is take it out of the hands of voters,” Cao said at the debate. “I want to keep it back in the hands of voters because I don’t want a senator from California or a congressman from Idaho making decisions for Virginians.”</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="606MQASWXl"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/17/they-dont-like-abortion-but-kaines-gop-challengers-say-they-wont-seek-a-federal-ban/">They don’t like abortion, but Kaine’s GOP challengers say they won’t seek a federal ban</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;They don’t like abortion, but Kaine’s GOP challengers say they won’t seek a federal ban&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/17/they-dont-like-abortion-but-kaines-gop-challengers-say-they-wont-seek-a-federal-ban/embed/#?secret=zKPQ5Q9lBa#?secret=606MQASWXl" data-secret="606MQASWXl" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cao also said that Kaine has had a 99% failure rate in passing legislation, claiming that only three out of the 220 bills Kaine has introduced during his time in the Senate have been successful.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Kaine challenged the accuracy of this claim, Cao responded with a remark that drew a reaction from the audience: “There are two truths in the world — never walk into a Target store wearing a red shirt, and never go against an Asian when it comes to math.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Larry Sabato, the director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia, said that although Virginia’s Senate race “isn’t even vaguely competitive,” Kaine has shown no fear of running tough races. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“His first for the city council in Richmond wasn’t easy. Same for lieutenant governor in 2001, and governor in 2005. Kaine’s first race for the Senate was against a former governor and senator — George Allen — who had barely been ousted in 2006. He won them all,” Sabato said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine’s contest against Cao is more like 2018, when Kaine defeated Corey Stewart, his Republican challenger, with 57-41% of the votes, Sabato added, “though 2024 isn’t as Democratic a year as 2018 was.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cao could only have a chance if he were running a “vigorous first-rate campaign” while Trump was winning Virginia, Sabato said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Neither precondition applies. Even Republicans complain that Cao hasn’t been seen enough on the trail. And despite a questionable poll or two, Trump isn’t winning Virginia.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Kaine could be considered lucky given these circumstances, in politics and other parts of life, “you still make your own luck to a great degree,” Sabato said. “Kaine is smart, hard-working, and reflects the state’s values and partisan lean. That’s why he’s on his way to a third term.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine also has a significant fundraising advantage, having raised almost $16 million for his reelection bid, as opposed to Cao, who has raised just a little over $3 million, </span><a href="https://www.vpap.org/elections/us-senate/?year_and_type=2024regular" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the Virginia Public Access Project, a nonprofit tracking candidates and campaign money in Virginia politics. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Cao vowed at the NSU debate to certify the presidential election if Harris won on Nov. 5 — “If she won, then she won,” he said — Kaine warned the  audience that his opponent had affirmed in a recent </span><a href="https://virginiaconservatives.net/candidate-survey-2022#results_anchor" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Constitutional Conservatives survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that if elected, he would sponsor legislation to release and seek compensation for the offenders jailed for their role in the violent riot at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I have experienced January 6th, I’ll never forget this, I&#8217;ll never forget,” Kaine told The Mercury. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I never want it to be repeated, whether I’m in the Senate or not, it should never be repeated. But we certainly saw it, and we could see it again. I do not expect Donald Trump to lose this race and do anything other than raise hell. If we win, I still think he’ss going to raise hell and pretend that he won. So we have to be prepared for that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine said that with the 250th anniversary of the United States around the corner, there is also a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">forward looking aspect to the debate around the events of Jan. 6. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Every generation has to carry the mantle of putting the torch of a functioning democracy in the hands of the next generation,” Kaine said. And by stepping aside, Biden had done just that, he added. “The president made a patriotic decision, and those of us who are in leadership positions now, we have to be able to put the torch of democracy in the hands of the next generation.”</span></p>

(Photos courtesy Kaine for Virginia and Hung Cao for Congress campaigns)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a high-stakes faceoff on Wednesday at Norfolk State University, U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., and his Republican challenger Hung Cao, a retired Navy captain, drew stark contrasts in a debate that underscored their divergent views on the economy, immigration, green energy and the role of government in education. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lively, one-hour debate at the historically Black university marked the first and only televised encounter between the two candidates less than five weeks ahead of the Nov. 5 election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cao was the first to dodge a question when co-moderator Deanna Allbrittin of Richmond TV news station WRIC asked him what kind of deal he would try and broker with members of the International Longshoremen’s Association (ILA) who went on strike Tuesday, leaving cargo in limbo at East and Gulf Coast ports, including at the Port of Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The economy is hitting us all the same way, that’s exactly why the ILA is doing the boycott right now and going on strike,” Cao said. “The only people better off today than ever four years ago are illegal aliens, criminals, and senators like Tim Kaine.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cao said that the U.S. is spending “billions of dollars a day to house and feed illegal aliens” — money that he believes would be better spent supporting local economies and benefitting American workers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Again, they’re hurting because of the immense inflation that is going on right now,” Cao said of the longshoremen when pressed again by Allbrittin about what “a good deal” between the ILA and the the United States Maritime Alliance would look like.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Just like with the hurricane that&#8217;s going on right now, where&#8217;s the leadership? Joe Biden is on the beach, Kamala Harris is with a bunch of billionaires doing a fundraiser, and Tim Kane is at a pig roast. If it has to do with Ukraine, or if it’s about illegal aliens, they’re all over it. But if you’re an American, you’re on your own.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Responding to Allbrittin’s question, Kaine said that the longshoremen haven’t had a new contract in six years, and that they were entitled to better treatment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s what I would be urging if I was in the room,” he said, adding that he was on the phone earlier on Wednesday with acting U.S. Secretary of Labor Julie Sue. “If you’re in the room, what you’re doing is you&#8217;re trying to get the sides to come closer, and that&#8217;s what they’re doing. We are narrowing the differences, and I think we’re gonna find a deal.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine, who is seeking a third term in the U.S. Senate, has previously served as the mayor of Richmond from 1998 to 2001, lieutenant governor from 2002 to 2006, and governor of Virginia from 2006 to 2010. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the Senate, Kaine has focused on issues such as national security, education, and healthcare — a background that he touted repeatedly at Wednesday’s debate and used to position himself as the best choice for continued leadership in the Senate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The choice is pretty clear for Virginians: do you want results or you want extremism?” Kaine said. “When I was governor, we were the best state for business, the best educated and best managed state. In the Senate, I’ve worked on powerful legislation so that we are building again with infrastructure, we’re making again with manufacturing, and we’re innovating.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In return, Cao, a former special operations officer in the Navy who served in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Somalia before his first unsuccessful run for political office challenging U.S. Rep. Jennifer Wexton, D-Loudoun, in 2022, used his background as an immigrant to proclaim his patriotism.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When Vietnam fell, we had nowhere to run to. But this great country called the United States took us in and gave us an opportunity and gave us life,” Cao said. “But this country has taken a dark turn and the Democrats are turning this country into whatever I ran away from.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both candidates presented different visions for how to improve economic conditions in a country still struggling with inflation, price gouging and a cost of living that remains higher than at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic more than four years ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Cao, the answer lies in American energy independence, which he called “the crux of everything.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats under the administration of President Joe Biden have made the United States dependent on oil “from countries that hate us, you know, Iran and Venezuela and the Middle East,” Cao said. “We need to be energy independent in this country, and that means unleashing all the energy we can get in order to bring forth American power.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cao also said that he would support former President Donald Trump’s plan for slapping new tariffs — basically important taxes — on foreign goods entering the United States, which he said would create more factory jobs, shrink the federal deficit and lower food prices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What we need to do is not tax our industries here, what we need to do is tax other countries bringing in goods, because our people are getting tax here and when they bring abroad as well,” Cao said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine countered that under the Biden administration, the United States is producing more domestic energy than at any time in the nation’s history. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The good news is the production is nuclear, which I support, natural gas, which I support, but also wind and solar, and that is making a huge difference in the economy right here in Hampton Roads, with the Chesapeake announcement of GreenLink building a manufacturing facility here,” Kaine said, referring to the plans by a subsidiary of South Korea-based LS Cable &amp; System to spend over $680 million to build a submarine cable manufacturing facility.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine added that the U.S. economy has rebounded faster than any other nation after the pandemic, which he said was owed, in part, to the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the Inflation Reduction Act signed by Biden in 2021 and 2022. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Fed just dropped rates and they are signaling that they’re gonna do it again,” Kaine said. “What would I do? Let’s continue to invest in clean energy that’s affordable.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine and Cao both clashed on their views of immigration, when the Republican nominee skirted a question by co-moderator Tom Schaad of WAVY-TV whether he supports a plan proposed by former president Trump to mass-deport all undocumented immigrants. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you come here illegally, then you need to leave, especially if you’re a violent crime person,” Cao said, adding that Immigration and Customs Enforcement data recently provided to Congress showed that more 13,000 immigrants convicted of homicide are living outside of ICE detention.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine responded that he had supported “strong immigration policies” since he was first elected to the Senate, including a proposal that included $45 billion in border security investment which was blocked by Senate Republicans. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In 2018, I cobbled together a bill with $25 billion for border security in exchange for protection for Dreamers. President Trump said that he would support it, but when the Senate introduced the bill in a bipartisan fashion, he told them to kill it,” Kaine said. “As soon as we can get Republicans to work for common sense immigration reform, we can keep folks from coming here illegally and we can also have the workforce that America needs.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Schaad asked both candidates whether they supported “some form” of reparations for the descendants of enslaved Americans, Kaine and Cao agreed in a rare moment of bipartisanship that the best way to try and eliminate persistent inequalities is to focus on education. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I have been a proud backer of funding for HBCUs like Norfolk State, helping this university to get funding for STEM careers for students, helping HBCUs start medical schools, and training the next generation of classroom teachers,” Kaine said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cao concurred, calling education the “only equalizer out here.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our country needs to heal, and we cannot heal if we continue picking at the scabs. That’s why I want to make sure that all Americans have the ability to go to school,” he said. </span></p>

John McGuire, shown here campaigning with Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene in Louisa County in May, won his first election in Virginia's 5th Congressional District earlier this month. (Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a sign of deepening divisions among Republicans in Virginia’s 5th Congressional District, at least four members of the district’s 37-member GOP Committee, including the vice chair, were ousted over the weekend, and another resigned after refusing to sign renewed loyalty pledges for state Sen. John McGuire, R-Goochland, the party’s nominee. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The four purged members and the resignee were among 25 Republican officials who in early June signed </span><a href="https://cardinalnews.org/2024/06/06/top-gop-leaders-in-the-5th-district-urge-trump-to-reconsider-mcguire-endorsement/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an open letter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> urging former President Donald Trump to reconsider his endorsement of McGuire, advocating instead for Trump’s support of U.S. Rep. Bob Good, R-Farmville, the incumbent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jim Herring, who has served as the committee’s vice chair for two years and the former chair of the Goochland County GOP, told members in an email Sunday that the Republican Party of Virginia’s decision to demand the renewed pledges was “unwarranted, unprecedented and unauthorized.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After consulting with Chris Marston, the RPV’s official legal counsel, other attorneys and past Republican officials, his belief was confirmed, Herring wrote in the email, which was obtained by The Mercury.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In fact, it is very similar to the actions of prosecutors against Donald Trump. They make up allegations, find a politically weaponized judge, and then convict him knowing that all of this will probably be overturned on appeal,” Herring wrote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McGuire has been a source of contention within the party since he announced his bid for Congress just one week after winning his seat in the 10th state Senate District last year — particularly among those backing Good, who went on to lose to McGuire in the June 18 primary election by a mere 366 votes out of more than 62,000 cast.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even after McGuire’s narrow victory was confirmed by a recount, which Good requested, and an </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/08/28/outcome-of-5th-district-gop-primary-unchanged-after-further-review-of-ballots/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">additional review</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the results, some Republican hardliners in the district have refused to accept the former Navy SEAL as their party’s nominee, instead turning to social media to launch </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/03/a-growing-number-of-5th-district-republicans-vow-to-write-in-good-on-nov-5/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a write-in campaign</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on behalf of Good, who has not publicly supported this effort.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At a Sept. 14 meeting of the executive committee of the RPV’s State Central Committee, the party’s 80-member governing body in Virginia, Jeff Ryer, chairman of the 1st Congressional District Committee and the spokesman for the Trump campaign in Virginia, expressed concern that McGuire lacked “fulsome support” in the 5th District, RPV Chair Rich Anderson said in a phone interview Monday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consequently, Ryer made a motion for the committee to require a renewed loyalty pledge from the 25 party officials who had signed the letter to Trump.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s an affirmation statement, I don’t call it a loyalty statement,” Anderson said. “It just reaffirms that they will support the eventual nominees that would come out of these contests, whether they are a primary or a party run process. And with all the contention down in the 5th District because of a hotly contested race, a number of our congressional district committee chairs were concerned that perhaps not all were going to support McGuire.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But in his email to committee members, Herring, the former vice chair, alleged that top party officials decided to “dictate to the 5th District Committee” members who had signed the Trump letter that they would have to “sign a loyalty oath or get kicked out” of the Republican Party.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This decision was NOT brought to the (whole) State Central Committee for review or approval, and most were not even aware of this action,” Herring wrote, adding that the committee then agreed to “send a letter to those affected” and set a deadline by which they had to return their signed pledges for Sept. 27 at 5 p.m.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The form they sent in their letter was similar to the loyalty oaths they had required before, with the exception of one part … the naming of specific candidates you pledge to support. To my knowledge, this action has not been done before, at least in the over four decades that I have been involved,” Herring wrote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ryer said Monday that he made the motion to ask for the renewed pledges because based on several news accounts it had become apparent that what he believed to be “a false narrative was developing that leaders in the party were not fully supportive of our nominees.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ryer pushed back against allegations that the loyalty pledges had been used to force 5th District Republicans on the record in an effort to get them removed from the party as a punishment for asking Trump to reconsider his endorsement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was my hope — and the hope of the executive committee — that all who had signed the June 6 letter would fulfill their previously professed pledge to support all our nominees, as required by the party plan,” Ryer said, adding that he had made his motion solely in the capacity of his role as the 1st District chair and a longtime member of the State Central Committee. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Rick Buchanan, the chairman of the 5th District GOP Committee, in an email to Anderson and State Central Committee leadership sent after the deadline had passed on Friday afternoon pointed out that members had already signed similar pledges of support earlier this year, as a requirement under the RPV’s party plan to attend mass meetings and conventions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although he “immediately” forwarded the request for the renewed affirmations to the entire committee, Buchanan also said that no member of the State Central Committee had reached out to him directly or any of the district’s 24 unit chairs “to inquire about the necessity of this action as a remedy,” suggesting that the distrust between the two fractions was based on miscommunication.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hearsay and assumption lead directly to dysfunction. The truth can only be found by going straight to the source, and the SCC and RPV have yet to reach out to develop an understanding. Mr. Chairman, this is not the way to work together as brothers in our political fight against our common enemies,” Buchanan wrote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Singling out Republican officials from the 5th District for supporting the candidate “we felt was the best candidate in a primary is more than an overreach,” Buchanan said in the email. “This action is pay-back for sending the letter to President Trump. Though some question the veracity of the letter, we firmly stand behind everything the letter says.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buchanan declined to comment for this story Monday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In their letter to Trump, the district’s top GOP officials had hailed Good, the chairman of the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus, as a champion of America First policies “by introducing legislation to codify policies defunding chain migration and requiring that immigrants are self-sufficient.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During his time in Congress, Good also offered multiple bills that would build upon Trump’s regulatory relief for businesses across the country, the party officials wrote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We the undersigned leaders of the 5th District Republican Congressional Committee strongly urge President Donald Trump to reconsider his endorsement of Congressman Bob Good’s opponent in the Republican Primary,” they concluded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After receiving the request for his renewed loyalty pledge, at least one 5th District Committee member — Glenn Mozingo of Cumberland County — handed in his resignation on Thursday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am writing to advise that I will not sign the pledge form that was enclosed with your letter dated September 16, 2024, and I am resigning as a member of the Cumberland County Republican Committee with immediate effect. I understand that my membership on the 5th District Congressional Committee will lapse as well,” Mozingo wrote in an email to RPV Executive Director Ken Nunnenkamp which was obtained by The Mercury. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mozingo wrote that he wasn’t aware of any reservations among 5th District Committee members regarding their loyalties to Trump or Hung Cao, the Republican nominee for U.S. Senate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Consequently, it is apparent that this is a transparent attempt to coerce each committee member to publicly go on record in support of John McGuire, which I will not do.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although he signed the pledge, James Hankins, another 5th District vice chair, also lashed out against RPV leadership. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“On a personal leave I feel insulted by being asked to sign this,” Hankins wrote in an email to Anderson. “I am signing this form this one time. If I am ever asked to do this again, I will resign from all posts I hold with the Republican Party and I will never raise another dollar for the 5th.”</span></p>

But for the last 13 years, Republican Morgan Griffith has held the seat with little opposition, solidifying his status as the incumbent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That could change this election cycle as Democrat Karen Baker hopes to unseat the lawmaker from Salem. A native midwesterner who moved to Floyd County from South Carolina in 2014, she has spent the last seven months traveling thousands of miles criss-crossing the deeply rural and mountainous district. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_39967" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:1476px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/va09_supreme-court-of-virginia/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-39967 size-full" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/VA09_Supreme-Court-of-Virginia.png" alt="" width="1476" height="1000" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/VA09_Supreme-Court-of-Virginia.png 1476w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/VA09_Supreme-Court-of-Virginia-300x203.png 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/VA09_Supreme-Court-of-Virginia-1024x694.png 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/VA09_Supreme-Court-of-Virginia-768x520.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1476px) 100vw, 1476px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  (courtesy Supreme Court of Virginia)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Baker’s campaign centers on a nonpartisan message focused on improving access to health care — an issue critical to the region’s residents, which is why she believes she can appeal to voters across the political spectrum and break Griffith’s long-standing hold on the seat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Baker takes pride in her decades-long record as a public servant — first as a trial lawyer for the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and as an administrative law judge for the Social Security Administration — she has never run for public office before, “except for treasurer in 11th grade, which I won,” she told The Mercury in a recent interview.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Baker decided to challenge Griffith in Virginia’s most Republican district after being approached by “some concerned Democrats who felt it was important to have a credible candidate on the ballot. And so I said, well, if not me, then who?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 9th District, Virginia’s second largest, is a mostly sprawling and rugged region in the southwestern part of the state covering a large swath of rural and mountainous terrain, including the Appalachian region, stretching from Lee County in the west all the way to Bedford County in the east. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Known for its deep-rooted cultural ties to coal mining, agriculture, and manufacturing, the 9th has historically been a battleground for political power. But in recent years, it has leaned solidly Republican since Griffith flipped it in 2010, defeating Democratic U.S. Rep. Rick Boucher after 28 years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This district is a fascinating place, because it was the last stronghold for Southern Democrats and did not fall to the GOP until that year,” said David Richards, a political science professor at the University of Lynchburg. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“People there respond to in-person retail politics, they want to see and speak to their candidates,” Richards added. “I think Baker can capitalize on this and she has the right idea by campaigning hard on the ground. But because Griffith has regularly won with over 60% of the vote, it will be a very steep climb for her.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By campaigning on access to health care, Baker brings her own experience in the field to the table. After her law career, she went to nursing school at Greenville Technical College in South Carolina. She became a registered nurse in 2011 and spent several years at a small rural hospital.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There were rural hospitals before that may have been struggling in terms of their budgets, but now those hospitals either are closed, or they’ve become urgent cares, so we have maternity deserts where people have to drive hours over twisting mountains and secondary roads to get care,” Baker said.</span></p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Rural health committee hears from maternal health, dental specialists in Farmville&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/rural-health-committee-hears-from-maternal-health-dental-specialists-in-farmville/embed/#?secret=U0eXwJI6Nn#?secret=ASPTVc7Fqv" data-secret="ASPTVc7Fqv" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many residents in the district are unsatisfied by the services provided by </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/03/25/after-appalachian-hospitals-merged-into-a-monopoly-their-ers-slowed-to-a-crawl/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ballad Health</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a chain of hospitals that has a monopoly on medical care in Southwest Virginia, Baker said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“People are upset about the quality of care because Ballad underpays its staff. It’s been a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/sen-warner-hopes-to-boost-funding-to-rural-hospitals-amid-obstetrics-closures/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">revolving door</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in terms of professionals coming fresh out of medical school, getting a couple of years under their belt and leaving for greener pastures.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To address this problem, Baker proposes scaling up the Program of All-inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE), a Medicare and Medicaid program that provides health care services for adults 55 and older with chronic health conditions or disabilities. In addition, she wants to utilize the community health care centers in the district. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The majority of people in the district are already on Medicaid, so we have a template for creating better conditions with fairly simple enabling legislation to spread these two programs throughout,” Baker said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other issues on Baker’s campaign platform include the creation of a better jobs market that she hopes will retain more younger people in the district, and expanding access to public education.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since launching her campaign in March, Baker said she has talked to thousands of voters in the district. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I go to concerts, flea markets, I’m looking for the people that wouldn’t automatically think to vote for me. In other words, leaning Republicans or Republicans. Those are the people that I need to get to know me and to like me in order for me to win, and so that’s where I am.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But despite the excitement among Democrats over Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential bid, Baker said she isn’t running on a national ticket. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s not my campaign, because nobody expects Harris to win in the 9th, and I can win because I am for everybody in this district. I tell people I’m a Democrat, but I don’t run out yelling I’m a Democrat. I run out saying, ‘I’m here for you, I will work for you.’”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When talking to voters, Baker said she always asks them about Griffith, her opponent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“People sometimes go, who’s that?  And generally, I would say 80 to 90% of the time, people say, ‘he doesn’t do anything for us.’”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Griffith, however, insists that he hasn’t become complacent in a district where he has previously run for reelection unopposed, underscoring that he takes Baker’s challenge seriously.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Am I doing more than when I don’t have an opponent? Yes,” he told The Mercury in a phone interview earlier this week. “But I generally work the district pretty hard anytime I have an opponent. We’ve had about 350 stops in the last term in the district, averaging about four events on the days that I am here.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Philadelphia native who grew up in Salem and returned home after graduating from Washington and Lee University School of Law in 1983, Griffith first ran for public office in 1993, when he was elected to the Virginia House of Delegates, where he served as the House Majority Leader for 10 years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2010, he ousted Boucher, the 13-term Democratic incumbent in the 9th Congressional District, by 51-46%. In the most recent congressional election in 2022, Griffith was reelected to his sixth term after defeating Democrat Taysha DeVaughan by a staggering 73-27%. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a legislator, Griffith said he was proud of his role in advocating for the Abandoned Mine Land Economic Revitalization Program (AMLER) to implement strategies that return former coal mining sites to productive uses. Since its creation in 2016, the program has brought more than $10 million to the district every year, Griffith said. </span></p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Data centers, proliferating statewide, could soon be built on mined lands in Southwest Virginia&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/07/15/data-centers-proliferating-statewide-could-soon-be-built-on-mined-lands-in-southwest-virginia/embed/#?secret=xA3zMQtvhq#?secret=SxopI0zG6W" data-secret="SxopI0zG6W" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During his time in Congress, Griffith has also sponsored or supported legislation to push back against what he called high taxes, unnecessary regulation, and an over-reliance on foreign industry that have strangled private businesses in our communities and prevented job growth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He has also introduced the </span><a href="https://morgangriffith.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=258609" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">EPA Regulatory Relief Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to reduce what he considered burdensome regulations on hospitals, manufacturers, and other businesses in the district. The measure failed in the Senate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rebuking his opponent’s claims that he had done little to help expand health care in the 9th, Griffith said he has been a strong supporter of federally qualified health centers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have more than any other in the state of Virginia,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Griffith also was part of a bipartisan effort to expand care options for people who experience strokes by introducing the </span><a href="https://morgangriffith.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=398682" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthering Access to Stroke Telemedicine ACT (FAST) Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2017, which helps stroke victims gain faster access to high-quality care through remote evaluation and treatment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m a big supporter of the telehealth concepts, of our federally qualified health centers, and of trying to make sure that we continue to pay our health care providers enough that they can make it,” Griffith said in the interview. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In June, Griffith touted his role in securing a $1.6 million federal grant benefitting the Piedmont Planning District’s Commission’s Route 122 Regional Corridor Plan, which was funded under the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act in 2021 — which he voted against.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the interview, Griffith explained this contradiction by stating that as a congressman, he had two jobs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One is to legislate, and the other is to act like an ombudsman. On my legislative side, I still think it was bad policy. But on my ombudsman&#8217;s side, on the side that says I’m supposed to help the district, once it’s passed into law, I would be failing to do my job if I didn’t then advocate for those federal monies to come to the 9th District.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If reelected on Nov. 5, Griffith vows to continue advocating for what he considers issues that are in the best interest of the people in his district, such as “fighting for medicine, making sure that rural health is getting a fair shake,” and leading the charge against regulations trying to eliminate coal, among other priorities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want to get broadband finished up, and that&#8217;s an important issue. I’m hopeful that that will actually happen in the next couple of years. But we just have to keep moving forward and I want to make sure that our tax rates are low,” Griffith said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Jan. 6, 2021, Griffith was one of </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/01/07/us/elections/electoral-college-biden-objectors.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">147 House Republicans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who voted against certifying the 2020 presidential election, which Democrat Joe Biden won by more than 7 million votes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Almost four years later, Griffith said that he never took the position that fraud was an issue during that election. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Some people did, but I believe fraud is a purview of the states and not the federal government,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead, he said that he had concerns with changes that bureaucrats in states like Arizona and Georgia had made to their election laws within 30 days of the election that had not been approved by the respective state legislatures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That is in violation of the federal law, therefore, those elections are subject to not being certified,” Griffith said, adding that he doesn’t foresee this happening again after this year’s election. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t know that we’ll have the same problems that we had in the 2020 election.”</span></p>

(Courtesy of National Weather Service)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Glenn Youngkin on Wednesday </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/governor-of-virginia/pdf/eo/EO-37---Declaration-of-a-State-of-Emergency-Due-to-Hurricane-Helene.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">declared</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a state of emergency for the commonwealth of Virginia in anticipation of impacts from Hurricane Helene later this week. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the current storm path places its center west of Virginia, </span><a href="https://www.weather.gov/media/jax/briefings/nws-jax-briefing.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">forecasts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the National Weather Service and the National Hurricane Center suggest that the western parts of the state could face significant rainfall and flooding from Friday into Saturday, compounded by earlier rain events expected in the coming days.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Cz6YWOTfK6"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/24/health-department-urges-preparedness-ahead-of-peak-storm-season/">Health department urges preparedness ahead of peak storm season</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Health department urges preparedness ahead of peak storm season&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/24/health-department-urges-preparedness-ahead-of-peak-storm-season/embed/#?secret=swZSjsI6SN#?secret=Cz6YWOTfK6" data-secret="Cz6YWOTfK6" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Even though the largest impacts of Helene are predicted to the south and west of us, we cannot ignore the fact that we have had significant flooding events arise from pre-cursory rain events and outer bands from tropical systems that drop locally heavy rainfall leading to flooding, especially in our southwestern region,” Youngkin said in a statement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is critical that we remain vigilant, understanding that tracks and impacts can shift. As high winds and heavy rains are predicted for parts of Virginia, we urge everyone to stay informed through trusted resources and follow the direction of your local officials.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The governor’s state of emergency declaration gives Virginia greater flexibility to mobilize resources and equipment to respond to the storm, including activating Virginia’s Emergency Operations Center and the Virginia Emergency Support Team, putting into effect anti-price gouging measures and authorizing up to $350,000 in response and recovery funding. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Hurricane Helene approaches Florida, search and rescue teams from Northern Virginia and suburban Maryland have been deployed to assist. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Task Force 1 </span><a href="https://wtop.com/local/2024/09/virginia-and-maryland-searchers-and-rescuers-heading-to-the-hurricane/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">was dispatched</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Tuesday afternoon and is already en route to the storm, while Maryland Task Force 1 departed for Florida on Wednesday afternoon. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) activated the teams in response to a request from the state of Florida.</span></p>

Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears and U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger, D-Prince William, the two leading declared candidates for governor, are tied at 39% support each, according to a </span><a href="https://www.umw.edu/news/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2024/09/UMW-Survey-Topline-Two-1.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">new statewide poll</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the University of Mary Washington’s Center for Leadership and Media Studies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The remaining 22% of respondents in the survey of 1,000 adult Virginians said they were undecided, did not plan to vote,  would back another candidate or refused to answer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The poll is in line with the results from </span><a href="https://www.umw.edu/news/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2024/09/UMW-Survey-Topline-One-1-1.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">another UMW survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that also found Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump locked in a tight contest in Virginia, with the Democrat edging her Republican opponent by 48-46%. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spanberger, who has represented Virginia’s 7th Congressional District since 2019, was the first candidate </span><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/11/13/abigail-spanberger-virginia-governor-00126815" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to announce</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> her gubernatorial bid in November 2023. Earle-Sears, the first Black woman in the commonwealth to hold statewide office, and the first woman to attain such a role since Mary Sue Terry’s tenure as attorney general in the 1990s, </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/06/lt-gov-winsome-earle-sears-announces-run-for-virginia-governor/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">launched her campaign</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> earlier this month. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attorney General Jason Miyares, another potential Republican candidate for his party’s gubernatorial nomination, would be equally competitive in a general election, the poll found. In a possible match-up between Spanberger and Miyares, 40% of survey respondents backed Spanberger while 39% favored Miyares, well within the survey’s margin of error.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Miyares has not yet announced his intentions for 2025, but Virginia attorney generals often either run for re-election to the commonwealth’s top legal office or campaign to become governor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican Glenn Youngkin, the current governor, cannot run for re-election next year because of Virginia’s one consecutive term limit for governors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Virginia elections are often close, and the look ahead to next year suggests more of the same in the campaign for governor,” said Stephen J. Farnsworth, a political scientist at the University of Mary Washington and director of UMW’s Center for Leadership and Media Studies. “The big challenge for these potential candidates is becoming better known across the commonwealth.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginians were more negative about the direction of the nation than about the direction of the commonwealth, with 24% saying Virginia was headed in the right direction and 26% saying it was headed in the wrong direction. The rest offered mixed views. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the nation overall, 51% of those surveyed said that things in the country were headed in the wrong direction, with only 16% saying the nation was on the right track.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginians in this new survey said they approved of Youngkin’s job performance by a 46 to 34% margin. As for President Joe Biden’s job performance, 37% of survey respondents approved while 53% disapproved.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Elections never stop in Virginia, and 2025 looks to be another very interesting electoral year in the commonwealth,” Farnsworth said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The UMW poll was conducted by Research America Inc. between Sept. 3 and 9, 2024. The survey included a total of 1,000 Virginia residents, consisting of 870 registered voters and 774 likely voters. The margin of error is +/- 4.1%. </span></p>

(Scott Olson/Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the aftermath of the recent </span><a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/georgia-school-shooting-suspect-gun-backpack-hid-bathroom/story?id=113622880" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">school shooting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Winder, Georgia, that left four students and teachers dead, and the threats of violence made online in various Virginia school districts, the NAACP Virginia State Conference has pushed for increased action on social media education, mental health services and a renewed commitment to addressing racism and inequality in public schools.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No student should live in fear of attending school, nor should any student be the target of racially motivated hatred,” the Rev. Cozy Bailey, the group’s president, said in a statement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We call on school districts, state leaders, and policymakers to prioritize expanding both mental health services and DEI initiatives in schools. These efforts are not mutually exclusive but critical to building inclusive and supportive environments where all students feel safe and valued,” Bailey said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Virginia has been spared a fatal school shooting since November 2022, when three people were killed and two others were injured in </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/12/26/uva-shooting-timeline-what-happened/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a mass shooting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the University of Virginia, online threats continue to disrupt school operations and scare parents and students. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just last week, the Harrisonburg Police Department </span><a href="https://www.dnronline.com/places/local/rockingham_county/harrisonburg/harrisonburg-teen-arrested-after-posting-shooting-threat-on-social-media/article_1bf1d0aa-3d4c-58a6-9b99-29b6af85bba6.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">arrested</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a 16-year-old male suspected of making violent threats against other students. The arrest was the result of an investigation into the threats posted to social media on Sept. 15, which resulted in both Harrisonburg High School and Rocktown High School closing the next day as a matter of precaution. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/us/school-shootings-fast-facts-dg/index.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recent report by CNN</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, there have been 50 school shootings this year in the United States. While this is lower than last year’s 82 school shootings, if patterns move as they have historically, a dramatic uptick is to be expected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">While addressing school security is critical, the Virginia NAACP stresses that a comprehensive strategy is needed to tackle not only gun control but also the mental health crisis facing youth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This strategy must also confront the harmful effects of racism that persist in educational settings and has motivated racial issues that the Virginia NAACP regularly receives reports about, the organization said in a statement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The rise in violent threats demonstrates the pressing need for DEI programs and inclusive curriculums that can address these systemic issues and create inclusive school environments. Calls to dismantle DEI efforts ignore the reality of the continued presence of racism in schools, where marginalized students are often most vulnerable,” the statement said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bailey, the group’s president, added that the mental health and safety of Virginia’s school children must remain a top priority.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia NAACP further called for collaboration between local governments, law enforcement, community organizations, and educational institutions to ensure that schools are not only secure but equipped to confront both mental health challenges and the ongoing issue of racial discrimination.</span></p>

(Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With early voting now underway in Virginia, former President Donald Trump appears to have warmed up to the practice of sending out mail-in ballots to voters for the November general election — a position contrary to his many deprecatory comments regarding mail-in voting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In this election we must use every appropriate tool to beat the radical left Democrats, that’s why I am urging every Virginia patriot to vote early, and don’t wait,” Trump said during a telephone rally hosted by Gov. Glenn Youngkin Sunday evening. “You’ve heard a lot about voting by mail, but that’s what we have right now.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the 15-minute call, Trump asked Republican voters to cast their ballots “either by mail, early in person or on election day.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have long term voting, we used to have one day, paper ballots, all the things that you know we want to do, but you’re in the first group and I am asking you to get your friends, get your family, get everyone you know and make a plan to vote for Trump,” the GOP’s presidential nominee said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia is one of just three states — the other two being Minnesota and South Dakota — where early voting started on Friday, 45 days before the Nov. 5 election. At least 59,686 Virginians have since cast their ballots as of Sunday evening, according </span><a href="https://www.vpap.org/elections/early-voting/#2024" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the Virginia Public Access Project. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With just 895 returned ballots, mail-in voting marked just a fraction of the total number of votes cast by that time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump has consistently spoken against mail-in voting on the campaign trail while spouting conspiracy theories and falsely claiming that the 2020 presidential election that he lost to Democrat Joe Biden by more than 7 million votes had been stolen from him. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Mail-in voting is totally corrupt. Get that through your head. It has to be,&#8221; </span><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnist/2024/06/29/trump-attack-vote-by-mail-election-ad/74218068007/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at a rally in Michigan in February. And during an </span><a href="https://www.gbnews.com/politics/us/donald-trump-interview-nigel-farage-in-full-watch" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">interview with the British GB News</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in March, he asserted that “anytime the mail is involved, you’re going to have cheating.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump’s cautious embrace of early and mail-in voting aligns with the GOP’s slow acceptance of a practice that has expanded the tent of voters nationwide in recent years and proven to be beneficial for increasing turnout on both sides of the aisle. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Both campaigns are really talking about the election in apocalyptic terms, and this is really motivating voters,” said Stephen Farnsworth, a political science professor at the University of Mary Washington. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Early voting absolutely works for campaigns; you don&#8217;t have to worry about getting voters to the polls on election day. If the ballot is locked in at election time, it gets a lot easier, and election officials can focus on voters who haven’t made it to the polls,” Farnsworth said</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During Sunday’s telephone rally, Trump rattled off a list of different ways for Virginians to cast their ballots early.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Every county in Virginia has at least one early voting location, so that’s important to know. Most counties have early voting Monday through Friday. Any registered Virginia voter can get out and vote as early as possible, you can vote tomorrow,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump said that he could be the first Republican presidential candidate to carry Virginia since President George W. Bush won his reelection bid in 2004. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Because if we are really going at it, we have a really good chance to win Virginia, there hasn’t been one in decades by a presidential candidate,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump still faces an uphill battle in the commonwealth, where he trails Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, by 10 percentage points, according to a </span><a href="https://pro.morningconsult.com/trackers/2024-election-state-polls" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Morning Consult poll</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> conducted between Aug. 30 and Sept. 8.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But a </span><a href="https://www.umw.edu/news/2024/09/20/new-survey-from-umw-center-for-leadership-and-media-studies-takes-closer-look-at-presidential-election-in-virginia/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more recent survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the University of Mary Washington released last week found that the race has since tightened, with Harris leading Trump with just 48 to 46% in a two-way contest, within the poll’s margin of error.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Democrats, however, pushed back against the narrative that the presidential race in the commonwealth was competitive. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While Trump is literally phoning it in here in Virginia, Team Harris-Walz and Virginia Democrats are turning unmatched enthusiasm into action, highlighting the stark contrast between Vice President Harris’ new way forward and Trump’s extreme Project 2025 agenda that would give him unchecked control over our daily lives,” said Virginia Democratic Party chair Susan Swecker. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harris has yet to campaign in the commonwealth as the Democratic presidential nominee. Her husband, Douglas Emhoff, is set to visit Charlottesville on Wednesday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also on Sunday’s call, Youngkin reiterated that elections in Virginia are safe and that voters can trust the process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have paper ballots, we have counting machines, not voting machines, lock boxes are under 24-7 security, and we have a great process to make sure that the ballots are not only kept but custody is clear. And finally, non-citizens will be prosecuted if they vote,” he said.</span></p>

(Parker Michels-Boyce / For the Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Starting Friday, voters across Virginia can begin casting their ballots in this year’s critical elections for the White House, a U.S. Senate seat, and  the state’s 11 congressional districts that will not only impact the future of the commonwealth but also help shape next year’s gubernatorial race. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An </span><a href="https://www.elections.virginia.gov/election-law/proposed-amendments-for-2024/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">amendment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the Constitution of Virginia and a variety of local offices are also on the ballot. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the Sep. 20 kick-off of the 45-day early voting period, Virginians have the option to vote in person until Nov. 2 at their local election offices or send absentee ballots by mail. This marks a turning point in campaign season, as both parties ramp up rallies and events to energize their bases.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just south of Richmond, Gov. Glenn Youngkin will attend a rally at Chesterfield County Airport Saturday. He will be joined by U.S. Rep. Rob Wittman, R-Westmoreland, Bill Moher, the Republican nominee in Virginia’s 4th Congressional District, and Hung Cao, who is seeking to oust U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin in a statement Thursday encouraged “every Virginia citizen to make a plan and vote early” to ensure that each vote is counted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You can trust that Virginia’s elections are secure with clean voter rolls, secure paper ballots, certified counting machines and well-trained election officials,” he said. </span></p>

Glenn Youngkin at an early voting rally in Henrico County in 2023. (Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Later on Saturday, Youngkin will join Derrick Anderson, the Republican nominee in the 7th District, at an Early Voting Rally at the Professional Building Maintenance in Fredericksburg. The event is set to begin at 1:30 p.m.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former President Donald Trump has yet to return to the </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/28/trump-rallies-in-chesapeake-backed-by-virginia-governor-gop-leaders/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">campaign trail in Virginia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a state where he trails Vice President Kamala Harris, his Democratic opponent, by several percentage points </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/new-polling-finds-harris-ahead-of-trump-by-a-comfortable-margin-in-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to recent polling</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Rally Virginia is hosting a Women’s Rally for the Republican presidential nominee at the Trump Winery in Charlottesville on Saturday. The event  starts at 2 p.m., featuring guest speaker U.S. Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-NY.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Team Trump Virginia has been working diligently to ensure an impressive  — and winning — performance in Virginia’s early vote. Across the commonwealth, we have been priming our voters to turn out in record numbers. Trump Force 47 will be mobilizing our supporters to vote,” said Jeff Ryer, a campaign spokesman. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While much of Southwest Virginia leans Republican, Democrats are firing up their bases there with some events, like an early voting kickoff event in Roanoke Friday to support Democratic candidates for city council and mayor, a canvassing kickoff on Saturday in Bristol with local elected officials, ad a Sunday gathering in Montgomery County with 9th District Democratic nominee Karen Baker.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Urging citizens of the Southwest region of the state to take advantage of early voting, Bristol city councilor Neil Osborne said, “Don’t risk having something unexpected come up on Election Day.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine will jaunt around the state for various early voting events over the weekend to support Democratic congressional candidates in competitive races — such as Eugene Vindman in the 7th District, Suhas Subramanyam in the 10th and Missy Cotter Smasal in the 2nd — and to boost his own re-election campaign. </span></p>

(Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Friday gatherings will also be hosted with Democratic challengers Leslie Mehta in Chesterfield County, who wants to unseat Wittman and 5th District candidate Gloria Witt. The 5th District election </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/16/amid-internal-gop-feud-in-the-5th-district-democrat-gloria-witt-sees-her-chance/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">could test the effect</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of GOP infighting over nominee John McGuire, a state senator from Goochland, and Rep. Bob Good, R-Farmville, whose supporters have mounted a write-in campaign after the incumbent lost his primary this summer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think we’ve already held over 1,000 events across the Commonwealth, but (there’s) more to come,” said </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic Party of Virginia chairwoman Susan Swecker. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is a big week with the kickoff for early voting.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On boosting awareness of the different campaigns and to encourage early voting, Swecker said that Democrats have opened 25 campaign offices around the state and hired 150 people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As election seasons become increasingly competitive, early voting has emerged as a vital part of the electoral process, and Virginia is no exception.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Early voting allows voters to participate on their own schedules, whether by visiting local election offices or mailing in absentee ballots. In recent elections, both parties have recognized its significance — a shift that is reshaping the strategies of political campaigns.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Voters like the convenience of early voting options,” said Mark Rozell, a political scientist at George Mason University. “Importantly, Republicans have adjusted to the reality that early voting is here to stay.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, Youngkin’s political action committee </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/glenn-youngkin-virginia-politics-election-day/article_f250116c-6936-11ee-9bad-2b7f054e466e.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">invested millions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> into the promotion of early voting initiatives, following years of GOP opposition to the expanded options. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Past GOP leadership claims that early voting leads to fraud likely had some negative impact on Republican turnout,” Rozell said. “The smart strategy now is to embrace the reality and use flexible voting options as a means to mobilize core supporters.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But opponents of early voting are not devoid of credible arguments, Rozell added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A lot can happen in October that might affect the viewpoints of those who voted in Virginia in late September. You can’t take it back once you’ve voted, so you better be sure when you vote that your opinion will not change under any circumstance.”</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Ways to vote early</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To vote early in-person, registered voters may go to the general registrar’s office for the jurisdiction in which they are registered, present their ID and cast a ballot. The location of the general registrar’s offices for all jurisdictions can be found on the Virginia Department of Elections’ </span><a href="https://vote.elections.virginia.gov/VoterInformation/PublicContactLookup" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, in addition to </span><a href="https://www.elections.virginia.gov/registration/voterid/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a list</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of acceptable forms of identification. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Requested absentee ballots will also be mailed beginning Friday, including ballots to registered military and overseas voters. Any registered voter can request an absentee ballot either in person, by mail, </span><a href="https://vote.elections.virginia.gov/VoterInformation" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">online</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or by contacting their general registrar’s office. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Registered voters do not need a reason to request an absentee ballot, which can be dropped off at the general registrar’s office or polling location on Election Day. Absentee ballots returned by mail must be postmarked no later than Nov. 5 and received by noon on Nov. 8.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The deadline to request a mailed absentee ballot is Oct. 25, but amid national U.S. Postal Service delays, state officials suggest those voting by mail </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/05/virginias-top-elections-official-warns-of-possible-delays-in-mail-in-voting-this-year/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">do so as soon as possible</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The deadline to register to vote and cast a regular ballot is Oct. 15. After that date, voters can still register and vote on Election Day using same-day registration, but they will cast a provisional ballot. Same-day registration must be done in person, either at an early voting location within the voter’s jurisdiction or at their polling place.</span></p>

(Courtesy of Ben Crump Law)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A newly released report by the disAbility Law Center of Virginia (dLCV) reveals that the death of Irvo Otieno, who </span><a href="https://www.vpm.org/news/2023-03-29/irvo-otieno-henrico-county-funeral" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">was killed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at Central State Hospital in Dinwiddie County during a mental health crisis while in police custody last year, could have been prevented had sheriff’s deputies and hospital staff not used prone restraint, a controversial method of subduing individuals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a presentation of the findings before the House Appropriations Committee at the state Capitol in Richmond Tuesday, Colleen Miller, the dLCV’s executive director, urged lawmakers to end the criminalization of mental illness, remove law enforcement from the state’s response to people with mental health episodes and address the conditions in Virginia’s jails, where thousands of inmates with mental illness are being kept.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There is serious reform needed in Virginia, because the events that happened to Mr. Otieno resulted in his death, and it got a lot of media attention. But people with mental illness are encountering these issues every single day in Virginia, and we need to do something about it,” Miller told the panel. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Otieno, a 28-year-old man with a history of mental health challenges, died on March 6, 2023, after being transported from the Henrico County Jail to Central State Hospital. The dLCV confirmed that sheriff’s deputies and hospital staff’s use of prone restraint — a technique where an individual is held face down — was a key factor in Otieno’s death. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The thing that led to his death, the prone restraint, is prohibited in our state facilities, and yet at Central State Hospital he was placed face down, people piled on top of him, and it killed him. So we really need to think about how to eliminate the prone restraint,” Miller said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ten Henrico County deputies and hospital workers were </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/irvo-otieno-killed-deputies-charged-virginia-hospital-ed9d227abea1bfa6946aa7cade5ced8b" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">initially charged</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with second-degree murder in Otieno’s death, which was captured on video. But prosecutors later asked a Dinwiddie Circuit Court judge </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/irvo-otieno-hospital-death-criminal-charges-dropped-b1b6cf44a3c6a33a37a69e657cc821c8" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to dismiss</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the charges against seven of the accused. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The investigation by the dLCV, a non-profit designated by the federal government as the protection and advocacy organization for people with disabilities in Virginia, also found that while jailed in Henrico’s Regional Jail West for three days after suffering a mental health episode, Otieno was subjected to hours — possibly days — in an emergency restraint chair, and the jail failed to provide him with any psychiatric treatment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A restraint chair all by itself can be very dangerous, you are kind of caved in on yourself while you are in that chair, making it difficult to breathe. The correctional restraints require that someone be restrained only as long as necessary, while they are acting out,” Miller said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From Otieno’s initial encounter with police and the hospital emergency room to his incarceration and transfer to Central State Hospital, the </span><a href="https://www.dlcv.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/IO-Public-Report-8.19.24-Near-Final.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">27-page report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> details “a complete breakdown of Virginia’s mental health crisis system, compounded by a culture of criminalizing individuals with mental illness, particularly communities of color.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The system that was supposed to help Otieno “utterly and completely failed him,” the investigation concluded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Mark Sickles, D-Fairfax, the committee’s vice chair, called the report “disturbing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve been trying to work on this area, and law enforcement is getting training in many places,” Sickles said. “Maybe it’s not uniform, I don’t know what happened in Henrico, but they are training law enforcement every day in dealing with people who have serious mental illness, and they need the appropriate training.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sickles emphasized the ongoing struggle to fill positions for mental health workers in Virginia, despite the legislature’s approval of additional funding. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We don’t have professional staffers, we are trying to fund psychiatric residencies, there is a shortage of all these mental health workers. We would hire them, we have openings,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sickles also pointed to housing shortages as a significant barrier, noting that many patients remain in hospitals longer than necessary due to a lack of community housing options. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They shouldn’t be in these situations, and we are working on this,” he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Rodney Willett, D-Henrico, called Otieno’s death a “tragedy on every level.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Willett is the sponsor of </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=HB1242" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 1242</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, also dubbed Irvo’s Law, that the General Assembly passed earlier this year. The measure allows family members and caregivers to access loved ones who are in crisis during their emergency room evaluations, unless the presence of a family member would create a medical or safety risk or if the patient objects to their presence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Irvo’s mom never got the chance to provide that information,” Willett said. “It’s such an unfortunate situation, and it’s also unfortunate that we need to have these terrible situations to inspire action. But we already took action before Irvo’s terrible death, and we are certainly going to take more.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislature this year also backed Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/news-releases/2023/december/name-1018721-en.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Right help, right now”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> initiative, which marked a major investment in building emergency room alternatives to care for patients experiencing a behavioral health crisis, among other measures to address mental health challenges in the state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Del. Delores McQuinn, D-Richmond, said that Virginia’s jails, police and sheriff’s departments still are not equipped to deal with situations involving mental health episodes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I talk often to my sheriffs in Richmond and Henrico County about these issues, and they are overloaded with individuals who have mental health challenges, and they really don’t have a clue of what to do with them,” McQuinn said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is something that all of us must get to the table and bring some greater resolution to this, and I don’t think it’s going to happen swiftly, it’s going to be some years to get where we are trying to go.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The timeline of the dLCV’s investigation shows the importance of removing law enforcement from mental health treatment, said Miller, the group’s executive director. “Everything that law enforcement is trained to do is contrary to what is necessary for a mental health response. They are trained to be intimidating, to be tough, to never retreat.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers and stakeholders “should do some hard thinking” about how to protect people and help them get the treatment that they need,” Miller concluded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have seen different places throughout the timeline where Mr. Otieno was determined to need medical and mental health care and was prevented from getting that, time and time again.” </span></p>

(Image courtesy of Pace-O-Matic) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A new version of slots-like machines that one of the biggest skill game companies in Virginia has begun introducing in the commonwealth does not violate the state’s ban on the electronic betting machines, according to a joint legal opinion by two former state attorneys general and two regulatory attorneys with substantial gaming experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dubbed Queen of Virginia machines (“QVS2 games”), the new cashless devices manufactured by Pace-O-Matic, a software company from Duluth, Ga., were first spotted in the Richmond region at a sports bar in Henrico, The Richmonder </span><a href="https://www.richmonder.org/exclusive-top-skill-game-company-putting-new-machines-in-richmond-area-despite-attempted-ban/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">first reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last week. Shaun Kenney, a spokesman for Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares, said in an email Monday that his office is looking at “whether this company is in compliance with the law.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because the machines do not require — or even allow for — the insertion of a coin, token or any other form of currency for the user to play the games, they fall outside the definition of a prohibited skill game under Virginia law, according to the joint statement that was signed by former Attorneys General Jerry Kilgore and Tony Troy, as well as attorneys Jason Hicks and Stephen Piepgrass. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The current Queen of Virginia games are clearly games of skill, and games of skill have historically been legal in Virginia. Recently enacted laws make certain skill games illegal, but only if they are operated by the ‘insertion of a coin, currency, ticket, token or similar object’ to play. The new QVS2 Games are not activated or played by inserting any object and thus are presumptively legal in Virginia,” the statement said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kilgore and Troy are no strangers to the controversy over skill games. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kilgore, who served as attorney general from 2002 to 2005, was a registered lobbyist for Pace-O-Matic from May 2023 until April of this year. Troy, Virginia’s top prosecutor from 1977 to 1978, lobbied for the company from May 2017 to April 2018. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Troy was also one of the attorneys representing former NASCAR driver and Emporia-based entrepreneur Hermie Sadler in his </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/05/13/virginia-senator-involved-in-skill-game-suit-invokes-special-session-to-delay-hearing/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lawsuit </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">seeking to restore the operations of skill games in the commonwealth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pace-O-Matic has not yet disclosed how many of the new machines are already operating in Virginia, but the company is currently beta-testing the new games and will “evaluate any potential market expansion as the testing period progresses,” according to a company representative.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="YY8tv1Ymns"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/07/11/skill-games-remain-illegal-in-virginia-but-some-businesses-are-evading-the-ban/">Skill games remain illegal in Virginia, but some businesses are evading the ban</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Skill games remain illegal in Virginia, but some businesses are evading the ban&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/07/11/skill-games-remain-illegal-in-virginia-but-some-businesses-are-evading-the-ban/embed/#?secret=x0VT6PH0SY#?secret=YY8tv1Ymns" data-secret="YY8tv1Ymns" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each of the QVS2 gaming terminals is cashless and players will first have to check in with an attendant before they play. Pace-O-Matic has also instituted a self-imposed age restriction of 21 — previously it was 18 — to reflect the state legislature’s most recent proposed regulation. The games’ outcomes are still based predominantly on the skill of the player, as were the original games. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Skill games had existed in Virginia unregulated for decades until in 2020, when the General Assembly passed legislation banning the machines after some lawmakers expressed concern that they could pose a threat to the profitability of the casino industry seeking to set a foothold in the commonwealth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But after the coronavirus pandemic shuttered thousands of small businesses – including those offering skill games — lawmakers agreed to a one-year reprieve for operations of the roughly 6,000 legal electronic betting machines statewide. After the Alcoholic Beverage Control Authority’s regulatory oversight ended two years ago, businesses across Virginia continued operating skill games in murky legal territory.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That changed last fall when the Supreme Court of Virginia reinstated the state’s ban on slots-like skill machines, overruling a decision by a lower court that had issued a temporary injunction blocking enforcement of the ban.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pace-O-Matic spokeswoman Rachel Albritton said in a statement that the company “has never and will never” operate outside the law. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Pace-O-Matic has launched new, legally compliant skill game technology that supports Virginia small businesses by allowing them to earn supplemental revenue today,” Albritton said. “Virginia legal experts have thoroughly reviewed our new product and have confirmed that the games fully comply with current statute.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While working to introduce the new machines, Pace-O-Matic has continued to lobby for legislation overturning the state’s ban on skill games. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But a bipartisan effort to create a regulatory framework and tax structure for the electronic devices during the 2024 General Assembly session failed when the state Senate in April soundly rejected a far-reaching slate of amendments to the legislation proposed by Gov. Glenn Youngkin. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proponents of </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=sb212" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the measure</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which was sponsored by Sen. Aaron Rouse, D-Virginia Beach, and Sen. Timmy French, R-Shenandoah, among others, believe that it would benefit small businesses and generate an estimated $200 million in tax revenue for the commonwealth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Opponents like the nonprofit group Virginians Against Neighborhood Slot Machines, however, have pushed back against lifting the ban, accusing Pac-O-Matic of using “a back-door approach and blatantly disregarding the authority of the Virginia General Assembly and Governor Glenn Youngkin,” according to Nick Larson, the group’s spokesman.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Even legislative supporters of the industry must ask themselves, is it okay for an out-of-state company wanting to do business with the commonwealth to repeatedly make a mockery of its legislative and regulatory authority? Can such a company be trusted as a good actor?”</span></p>
<p><b> </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pace-O-Matic, Larson said, has has spent the last year developing the new machines specifically “to try to thwart Virginia law” and operate while avoiding regulation and tax. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The company has said repeatedly that they want to do things the right way and be regulated, unless the regulations are real. Virginia lawmakers should call out Pace’s action for what it is — a slap in the face.”</span></p>

John McGuire, R-Goochland, and U.S. Bob Good, R-Farmville, the incumbent, Democrat Gloria Witt sees an opening in the traditionally conservative district. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Political analysts suggest the GOP infighting could provide Witt, a political newcomer with lifelong roots in the mostly rural district, an advantage in the Nov. 5 election, after some Republican hardliners have vowed to write in Good, the chairman of the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And in a district where turnout and enthusiasm are crucial, a divided Republican electorate could allow the Democrat to make unexpected gains in the general election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A write-in campaign benefiting a defeated GOP primary candidate is certainly part of a best-case scenario for a Democratic candidate in District 5,” said Stephen Farnsworth, a political scientist at the University of Mary Washington. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So too is a strong performance by Vice President Kamala Harris in the debate against former President Donald Trump last week. But even those tailwinds for Democrats do not erase the fact that the boundaries of the district are very, very friendly to Republicans.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But while Witt is quite aware that the rift between Good and McGuire supporters could potentially reshape the contest’s dynamics heading into November, she remains unfazed and vows to stay focused on shaping her own message. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m hearing the same things about the tensions between the McGuire and Good campaigns, but I’m really not paying too much attention to them, they do what they do,” Witt said in a recent phone interview. “My focus is on appealing to the interests of the voters of District 5, and I believe that we do have enough votes to win based on the interests that impact them.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Witt, a businesswoman and community activist from Amherst County, won her party’s nomination in the June 18 primary after defeating her two primary opponents, Gary Terry, a Kentucky native and a graduate of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, and Paul Riley, an intelligence analyst and U.S. Army veteran. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to data from the Virginia Department of Elections, Witt prevailed with 57.17% of the vote, compared to Terry’s 22.43% and Riley’s 20.40%. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Witt said in the interview that since announcing her candidacy in the spring, she has been crisscrossing the district that spans 11,000-square-miles t, which encompasses the majority of Southside, including Danville, and the cities of Charlottesville and Lynchburg. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m averaging about 3,000 to 4,000 miles a month. We are canvassing, we are phone banking, we are engaging in postcarding and doing the work,” Witt said. “We cannot afford to have anybody on the bench. We all have to be engaged, it is a crucial election cycle, every vote counts. We intend to win this based on what people care about.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the ongoing intra-party feud among supporters of McGuire and Good, Witt’s campaign remains an uphill battle in a district that has been mostly Republican since 2002, when former Democrat-turned-independent Rep. Virgil Goode joined the GOP. Trump won the 5th with 53% in both 2016 and 2020, and in the 2021 gubernatorial election, Republican Glenn Youngkin defeated Democrat Terry McAuliffe with 60% to 39.4% of the vote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And Witt isn’t the only one hitting the road. Sean Brown, a spokesman for McGuire’s campaign, said in a text message that McGuire is “campaigning tirelessly to get the message out that we must grow our economy, secure our borders, and strengthen our national defense.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Voters in the 5th District understand what is at stake in this election and that the only way to achieve these goals is to elect Donald Trump and deliver a Republican majority in the House and Senate,” Brown said.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_17892" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:175px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2020/04/28/embattled-va-dems-stockpile-cash-ahead-of-november/mcguire/" rel="attachment wp-att-17892"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-17892 size-full" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/mcguire.png" alt="" width="175" height="220" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Sen. John McGuire, R-Goochland. (Virginia House of Delegates)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Witt said that the GOP has changed in the eight years since Trump’s first presidential bid. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are no longer operating with the standard GOP platform, which is not your momma and daddy’s platform. It has been hijacked and replaced by something that is new and different,” she said, citing </span><a href="https://www.project2025.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Project 2025</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an initiative launched by the Heritage Foundation in 2022 aimed at advancing conservative and right-wing policies to restructure the federal government and strengthen executive power in the event of a Trump victory in November.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I believe that the voters of District 5 are aware of the impact of Project 2025, and if we allow it to be implemented across the nation, it is going to impact all of us.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Witt said that codifying Roe v. Wade and women’s reproductive health remains the premier concern that she hears from voters as she travels the district. “There is a lot of energy from women to be recognized for having domain over their bodies,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other priorities include furthering economic growth across, access to public education with a focus on K-12, “and this whole idea of protecting social security, strengthening families and healthcare.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harris’  nomination as her party’s presidential candidate has also helped motivate Democrats in the district, Witt said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think that there is a lot of energy around this concept of being future-focused driven by opportunity for all of us versus the other choice, which would mean the control of our rights, a loss of democracy and a questionable economic future. The choices are pretty clear, and I think the rise of Kamala Harris just paints this picture that is so much more positive.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Witt said that after six months of heavy campaigning, she has yet to meet her opponent, who has </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/09/fifth-district-gop-chair-where-is-john-mcguire/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">faced criticism</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from GOP officials in the district for what they said was a lack of campaigning. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“From what I know he is pro-God, pro-Trump, pro-guns, and he was present on Jan. 6 at the Capitol,” she said, referring to the attack on the U.S. Capitol building by a mob of supporters of then–resident Trump in early 2021. While McGuire, a former Navy SEAL, </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/11/03/least-seven-jan-6-rallygoers-won-public-office-election-day/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">attended the rally</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that day, there is no evidence that he participated in any violent activities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And seven weeks before the election, both candidates have yet to face off in a debate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, the Amherst County Democratic Committee invited McGuire to a forum at the Nelson Heritage Center in Nelson County to be held in late September or early October. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We believe all citizens have a right to know the views of those who seek to represent them. We are hopeful Senator McGuire will agree to participate in the forum,” Craig Pleasants, vice president of the Amherst County Democrats, said in a statement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brown, McGuire’s spokesman, said that his campaign was considering an invitation to a debate hosted by the Wilson Center for Leadership in the Public Interest at Hampden-Sydney College in Farmville. “We’re just waiting on dates and times,” Brown said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Witt said that she was ready to face McGuire.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am willing to engage in a debate or forum, I am ready, willing and able, depending on whoever invites us to the table you will get a yes from me,” she said. </span></p>

(Jonathan Ernst/Scott Olson/Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Vice President Kamala Harris gears up to debate former President Donald Trump at what may be their only presidential debate in Philadelphia on Tuesday, new polling shows the Democrat with a significant lead over the Republican nominee in Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A poll by </span><a href="https://pro.morningconsult.com/trackers/2024-election-state-polls" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Morning Consult</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> conducted between Aug. 30 and Sept. 8 among 498 likely voters and published Monday has Harris up by 10 percentage points (52-42%) over Trump in the commonwealth — roughly the same margin by which Democrat Joe Biden defeated the then-incumbent in 2020 (54-44%). Among self-identified independent voters, Harris leads Trump by eight points, or 48-40%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The survey signals better news for the Harris campaign than a  </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/08/20/harris-holds-slim-lead-over-trump-in-virginia-roanoke-college-poll-says/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roanoke College poll</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> released last month, which had the vice president ahead by just three points (47-44%) and within the margin of error. It also marks a substantial improvement compared to </span><a href="https://cardinalnews.org/2024/05/29/biden-and-trump-now-tied-in-virginia-roanoke-college-poll-says/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an earlier poll</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from May that had Biden and Trump tied by 42-42% in a head-to-head matchup, putting Virginia in play for Republicans for the first time in years.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For a brief moment, when Biden was at his lowest, it was possible to believe that Virginia would be competitive,” said Larry Sabato, director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While we always want to see more polling, I’d say a lead of +10 for Harris strongly suggests Virginia is headed for a fifth Democratic presidential victory,” Sabato said, adding that other ‘in-reach’ states for Trump, such as Minnesota, New Hampshire, and New Mexico, “have disappeared from the discussion” since Harris entered the race. </span></p>
<p>Jeff Ryer, a spokesman for the Trump campaign in Virginia, said in an email that the new <span style="font-weight: 400;">polls are “in no way reflective of what we’re hearing at the doors and on the phones from the tens of thousands Virginia voters our thousands of volunteers have personally contacted.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And since the Democrats have confirmed they have </span><a href="https://subscribe.newsleader.com/restricted?return=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newsleader.com%2Fstory%2Fnews%2Fpolitics%2Felections%2F2024%2F09%2F06%2Fvirginia-2024-battleground-state-elections-trump-harris-biden%2F75085960007%2F&amp;gps-source=CPROADBLOCKDH&amp;gca-cat=p&amp;gca-uir=true&amp;gca-epti=z114332p000350c000350u114132e002008v114332&amp;sltsgmt=1001_B_20&amp;gnt-eid=control" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">25 offices and 132 staffers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the ground in Virginia, “it’s obviously not what they are hearing either,” Ryer said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A spokesman from the Harris campaign declined to comment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nationally, the Morning Consult poll finds Harris leading Trump by just three percentage points (49% to 46%), which is roughly in line with the survey’s results among registered voters in the previous weeks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The survey also found that Harris’ popularity has declined a bit among likely voters over the past week, with voters just one point more likely to hold favorable opinions about her than unfavorable ones (50% to 49%).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But nationwide Harris remains more popular than Trump, whose net favorability rating is 10 points underwater, as she continues to receive more positive news coverage than the former president has ever received in Morning Consult’s tracking dating back to November 2022.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A new </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/tablet/2024/09/09/sept-4-8-2024-washington-post-schar-school-poll-virginia-voters/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Washington Post-Schar School poll</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> released Tuesday morning has Harris ahead of Trump by eight percentage points (50-42%), largely owed to an 18-point advantage among women voters and by a sense of unity among Democrats. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The survey also found that 53% of Virginia voters have an unfavorable opinion of the former president, while 39% view him more favorably. In contrast, Harris enjoys a 49% favorability rating, with 42% of voters finding her unfavorable. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., is also ahead of his Republican challenger, former Navy Capt. Hung Cao, by 12 points, or 53-41%, the poll says. </span></p>

John McGuire, shown here campaigning with Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene in Louisa County in May, won his first election in Virginia's 5th Congressional District earlier this month. (Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rift between Sen. John McGuire, R-Goochland, and party officials in Virginia’s 5th Congressional District widened further over the weekend after the Republican nominee failed to attend the district’s GOP committee meeting in Farmville on Saturday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McGuire’s no-show at the gathering, which has traditionally served as a critical opportunity for candidates to solidify party support for their congressional bids, prompted the committee to withhold funding for his campaign and urge him to provide the panel with important contact information, and details on event planning and related activities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a letter to the campaign dated Sept. 6, Rick Buchanan, the district’s GOP chair, reminded McGuire that under the Republican Party of Virginia’s Party Plan, the committee “shall have general supervision over all district campaigns and shall cooperate with the State Central Committee in conducting statewide campaigns.”</span></p>
<a href="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Senator-John-McGuire-letter.pdf" class="pdfemb-viewer" style="" data-width="max" data-height="max" data-toolbar="bottom" data-toolbar-fixed="off">VA-5 GOP Committee letter</a>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buchanan also notified McGuire that he had appointed a sub-committee of three party unit chairs “to work with your campaign to obtain, assimilate and distribute this information to all units within the 5th District so that efforts can be made to ensure success in November.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sean Brown, a campaign spokesman, said in a text message that McGuire was unable to attend Saturday’s committee meeting because he had already committed to door knocking events with the campaign of former President Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, and to appear at an event with volunteer firefighters. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brown said that he and Bri Simon, McGuire’s campaign manager, attended the committee meeting on the candidate’s behalf. He declined to comment further. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During a closed portion of the meeting, the committee voted to allot $8,000 to pay for Trump campaign signs in the district, but it denied McGuire’s campaign any additional funding. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One of the reasons I believe for why the committee was hesitant was that John McGuire is nowhere to be found, he has not shown up at any unit meetings,” Buchanan said in a phone interview Monday. “Since the primary election he has only been to two unit meetings in Campbell County and Albemarle County out of 24 units.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In contrast, U.S. Rep Bob Good, R-Farmville, the incumbent who was defeated by McGuire in the June 18 primary election, met with all 24 unit chairs within weeks of first winning his party’s nomination in 2020. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the disconnect between McGuire and the district’s party leadership predates the primary election. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just days after Trump formally endorsed McGuire in late May, 25 Republican officials advised the former president in an </span><a href="https://cardinalnews.org/2024/06/06/top-gop-leaders-in-the-5th-district-urge-trump-to-reconsider-mcguire-endorsement/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">open letter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to rethink his endorsement and to instead consider backing Good.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Congressman Bob Good has championed America First policies by introducing legislation to codify policies defunding chain migration and requiring that immigrants are self-sufficient.

John McGuire, R-Goochland, prevailed in a recount of votes. (Good campaign)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While it remains doubtful that this effort will split the Republican vote in a way that would hand the Republican-leaning district to Gloria Witt, the Democratic nominee, it’s a sign of the unease that many Republicans still feel about McGuire, who they say has made little effort  to unify the party and campaign district-wide.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“McGuire seems to be running a fairly strange campaign, in my opinion, he does not seem very interested in doing the traditional things campaigns do,” said David Richards, a political science professor at the University of Lynchburg. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Perhaps the thinking is that in a district that rates a +7 to the Republican advantage he does not need to reach out very much. This may work out for him, but there is always a risk, and he needs to be sure he gets all of the Republican voters behind him lest Witt sneak in with a solid Democratic base that could win against a split GOP base.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While McGuire on Monday made several campaign stops in the district with Gov. Glenn Youngkin and Hung Cao, the Republican U.S. Senate nominee, Buchanan, the district’s GOP chair, said in the phone interview that his committee is being kept in the dark about the campaign’s efforts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s not a single thing on the district calendar of any events that he is doing, he’s not returning phone calls from the committee chairs who are trying to get him to come, and he’s not calling me or anybody that I know of. We’re very concerned, because I just don’t know what he’s doing. On Saturday, he couldn’t plan to spend 15 minutes addressing us in Farmville, which is in the very center of the district?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buchanan brushed off concerns that the committee’s support for McGuire is only lukewarm because most of the unit chairs remain supporters of Good, the incumbent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There is only one mission that all of our units have, and that is to get Republicans elected,” Buchanan said. “John McGuire is the Republican candidate. We have trained and organized to do just that, and build our networks around getting out the vote and manning the polls. But where is John? I don’t know where John is today, I have no idea.” </span></p>

Read their responses below, and stay tuned for in-depth profiles of these candidates in the coming weeks.

<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Abortion</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the only state in the South that hasn’t restricted abortion access since the Supreme Court overturned Roe. v Wade in 2022, which made abortion a federal right, Virginia is a key player in the country’s reproductive health landscape. By dismantling Roe v Wade, the nation’s highest court laid the groundwork for each state to restrict or enhance access to abortion; a spate of state bans on abortion have since emerged, with 14 states making the procedure illegal. Abortion remains legal in Virginia and state Democrats will push to enshrine it as a right in the commonwealth’s constitution next year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many Republican candidates in Virginia’s congressional races assert that abortion access should be determined at the state level. In District 2, Republican incumbent U.S. Rep. Jenn Kiggans, a Navy veteran, nurse and former member of the state senate, has “consistently advocated for women to choose life, but respects exceptions for rape, incest, and life of the mother,” according to her campaign </span><a href="https://jenforcongress.com/issues/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Democratic challenger Missy Cotter Smasal, who is also a Navy veteran as well as the director of a nonprofit focused on women veterans, </span><a href="https://fb.watch/uhpo6DTiSN/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">declared herself</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “the only pro-choice Navy veteran in this race.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In District 7, anchored in Prince William County but also spanning rural parts of the state, Spotsylvania attorney and former Green Beret Derrick Anderson, a Republican, is challenging career military officer and Democrat Eugene Vindman for the seat currently occupied by Abigail Spanberger, who is running for governor next year. Anderson has expressed support for the overturn of Roe and </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/DerrickAndersonforVA/videos/my-life-story-is-pro-life-and-thats-how-i-will-serve-in-congress-my-mother-got-p/414067620643367/?locale=ms_MY" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">called himself “pro-life” while sharing on social media</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that his mother had him as a single parent at 17 years old. Vindman plans to support </span><a href="https://vindmanforcongress.com/issues/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">access to abortions and contraception along with in vitro fertilization</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In District 10, anchored in Loudoun County, Democratic state Sen. Suhas Subramanyam is running against Republican Mike Clancy to fill Rep. Jennifer Wexton’s seat. Wexton will not seek reelection due to a health issue, and endorsed Subramanyam during his democratic primary. He has supported an effort to </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+SJ255" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">enshrine abortion protections into Virginia’s constitution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and plans to support federal protections. Clancy said that he “does not support federal action on abortion.” His campaign website lists “respect life” as a campaign issue and notes his support for resources for pregnant people and families. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In District 9, incumbent Rep. Morgan Griffith faces Democratic challenger Karen Baker, a lawyer-turned-nurse. Griffith has voted against congressional efforts to protect abortion access and </span><a href="https://morgangriffith.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=402684" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">stated</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that Roe v. Wade had “produced decades of tragedy.” Baker wrote on her campaign website that “women’s choices must be respected.”</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Ksn63EC7JL"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/17/they-dont-like-abortion-but-kaines-gop-challengers-say-they-wont-seek-a-federal-ban/">They don’t like abortion, but Kaine’s GOP challengers say they won’t seek a federal ban</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, who is seeking reelection, has co-sponsored the </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/kaine-others-reintroduce-reproductive-freedom-for-all-act/article_f6cbd514-a8a7-11ed-8ac8-e388ae499856.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reproductive Freedom For All Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which would protect access federally, now that Roe has been overturned. His Republican challenger, retired Navy veteran Hung Cao, told Virginia Mercury this summer that he </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/17/they-dont-like-abortion-but-kaines-gop-challengers-say-they-wont-seek-a-federal-ban/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">won’t support a federal abortion ban</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He has also </span><a href="https://www.hungforva.com/right-to-life/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">called himself “pro-life.” </span></a></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Housing </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Housing is an issue people experience practically and constantly, amid paying rent or mortgages. Local governments handle approvals or rejections of developments and craft zoning laws that guide development potential. But state and federal lawmakers have roles to play as well — largely through funding mechanisms or taking action where housing intersects with other policy platforms. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While many congressional candidates this year don’t have housing policy outlined on their websites, some have been talking about how they plan to help states and local governments from the federal level. The Mercury reached out to others for more details on what they would do to help with housing supply and affordability. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In District 2, Incumbent Rep. Jen Kiggans did not respond to inquiry for more details on housing policy by the time of this publication, though during her time in the state legislature as a senator, she voted in favor of the </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?212+vot+SV0271HB1889+HB1889" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Residential Landlord and Tenant Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her challenger, Democrat Missy Cotter Smasal, acknowledged the Mercury’s request for comment but did not follow through with a response in time for this publication. Her website touches on housing policy while addressing the economy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We need to stop the price gouging on groceries, and stop massive corporations from buying up houses and raising rent,” she wrote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In District 7, Democratic candidate Eugene Vindman expressed support for building more homes that middle-class families can purchase and “support programs that help first-time homebuyers buy a house.” He added that he’s concerned about out-of-state corporations buying homes that they then sell or rent at higher prices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In Congress, I will work to take on these speculators who are putting regular people&#8217;s American dream out of reach,” he said in an email. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican candidate Derrick Anderson said he’s going to focus initially on how Congress can help reduce inflation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The first thing I’d do is pass a federal balanced budget amendment – ridiculous inflationary spending drove up housing prices (and grocery costs, gas costs, etc),” he said in an email. “Let’s stop the spending and get inflation down for the sake of Virginians who are struggling to get by.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In District 10, Republican Mike Clancy could not be reached for comment by the time of this publication. His campaign website doesn’t include housing policy, but it does stress his goal of helping to reduce inflation and stimulate the economy by “unleashing American innovation” and energy as well as reducing regulations on small businesses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrat Suhas Subramanyam’s campaign replied to The Mercury’s inquiry but did not follow through with his housing policy plans should he become a congressman before publication. He has supported affordability measures as a state senator: This year he </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB597" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">co-sponsored a bill </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">to allow more Virginian localities to utilize Low Income Housing Tax Credits when approving developments, but it was vetoed by Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In District 9, Democratic challenger Karen Baker supports expansion of tax credits that can help spur construction of affordable housing available to various levels of area median income. She also wants to</span><a href="https://www.bakerforva9th.com/affordable-housing" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “work on tailored solutions that address the specific needs of rural communities,”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> like the Southwest Virginia ones she seeks to represent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his tenure as representative, Morgan Griffith has </span><a href="https://morgangriffith.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=402287" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">supported funding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> appropriations to his district meant to help with affordable housing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine has cited his early-career experience as a fair housing lawyer before he went into politics. As a member of congress, he pointed to a bill he co-sponsored, the </span><a href="https://www.kaine.senate.gov/press-releases/klobuchar-kaine-introduce-legislation-to-address-nationwide-housing-shortage" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Housing Supply and Affordability Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which would create a grant program for state and local governments to tap into. He’s also been involved with the </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/2797" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Low-Income First-Time Homebuyers Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which would establish fixed-rate 20 year mortgages for first-time buyers whose income doesn’t exceed a certain amount. Both bills have been introduced multiple times but have yet to become law. Kaine also supports expansions to Low Income Housing Tax Credits, which helps increase affordable housing supply. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine’s opponent, Hung Cao, </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/how-kamala-harris-new-policy-plan-could-impact-housing-in-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">echoes a stance of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump that ties housing issues to the U.S.-Mexico border</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“First and foremost, we need to secure the border,” Cao said in an email to The Mercury. “Everything that’s going wrong in our country right now is a direct result of our wide-open southern border. Housing costs are at an all-time high because there&#8217;s millions who were not here a few years ago for which we need to provide housing.” </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Guns</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Congress remains at a standstill as lawmakers fiercely debate the future of gun rights in America, with proponents of stricter gun control measures clashing with staunch defenders of the Second Amendment. Amid a surge in mass shootings and growing public outcry, both sides are digging in, setting the stage for what will likely be another defining battle over gun laws as the nation is headed toward the 2024 presidential election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the Senate, U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., who was governor of Virginia when the deadly mass shooting at Virginia Tech took place in 2007, co-sponsored the Virginia Plan to Reduce Gun Violence, which he said would enact the same gun safety provisions passed by the Democratic-controlled Virginia General Assembly in 2020 at the federal level. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hung Cao, Kaine’s Republican opponent, strictly opposes further legislation that he believes would infringe Second Amendment rights. Instead, Cao proposes that gun-related violence to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. Prosecutors who refuse to enforce the law must be held accountable, the retired U.S. Navy captain said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia’s 2nd Congressional District, U.S. Rep. Jen Kiggans, R-Virginia Beach, in 2023 received a 100% rating by Gun Owners of America (GOA), a national gun rights organization, and a 92% rating by the National Rifle Association (NRA) in the previous year. While in the Virginia legislature, Kiggans has voted against universal background checks, expanding red flag laws that take guns out of the hands of domestic abusers and those who pose a threat to Virginians, and against prohibiting guns in schools and childcare centers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Missy Cotter Smasal, Kiggans’ Democratic opponent, states on her campaign website that she is committed to legislation seeking to prevent gun violence, create safer communities, and prevent veteran suicide. Smasal said that there are “commonsense measures supported by large majorities of Virginians” that can make Virginia’s neighborhoods safer while also protecting individual rights.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In District 7, Derrick Anderson, the Republican nominee, has stated that Second Amendment rights are sacred and shall not be infringed upon. As a former special forces Green Beret, Anderson vows to be “a strong advocate for gun owners in the halls of Congress.” Earlier this year, the Republican turned to the social media platform X, where </span><a href="https://x.com/DerrickforVA/status/1774127722647687559" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">he said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that Americans have to “stand up for and protect our 2nd Amendment rights.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eugene Vindman, a former career military officer and the Democratic nominee, supports gun safety measures such as background checks and red flag laws to keep guns out of the hands of criminals, the mentally ill, and others who might cause harm. While he believes in the right of law-abiding gun owners to own firearms, Vindman also pushes for more legislation ensuring public safety. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Rep. Morgan Griffith, R-Salem, the incumbent in District 9, is a strong advocate for Second Amendment rights. Griffith said in a statement to The Mercury that he does not support government-mandated registrations of guns but that he backs harsher penalties for offenders who “abuse the right to have guns” by committing felonious crimes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrat Karen Baker, Griffith’s opponent and a gun owner, said she backs rigorous gun safety training for children in school. She is also pushing for enhanced gun safety laws, including tax credits for trigger locks, and she has called for enhanced mental health services for troubled individuals, and a legal mechanism to manage early reports of suspicious behaviors involving non-imminent ideation of shootings. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Across the state in District 10, constitutional lawyer Mike Clancy, the Republican nominee, has vowed to defend Americans’ constitutional rights without exception, including the Second Amendment right to bear arms. Instead of regulating gun ownership. Clancy is pushing for legislation to fully fund law enforcement to ensure law enforcement has the training and equipment to protect Virginia’s communities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During his time in Virginia’s state legislature, Sen. Suhas Subramanyam, D-Loudoun, Clancy’s opponent, has actively supported several gun safety laws, including </span><a href="https://www.suhasforvirginia.com/press-and-media/key-gun-violence-prevention-bills-from-senator-subramanyam-vetoed-by-gun-lobby-backed-governor" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">several measures which passed the General Assembly just this year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, two of which were signed by Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican. Suhas told The Mercury he believes America can achieve serious progress on this issue while respecting the Second Amendment, and without undermining the rights of responsible gun owners.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Education/Project 2025</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With divergent calls from some to eliminate the U.S. Department of Education and from others to improve teacher pay, public education is a top matter for voters in Virginia and across the nation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a Pew Research Center </span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2024/04/23/what-are-americans-top-foreign-policy-priorities/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> published in April, half of the Americans surveyed said that public K-12 education is going in the wrong direction. Some believe that schools should spend more time on core academic subjects. At the same time, communities, including those in Virginia, are sparring over what is taught in schools, particularly history, and gauging if students are falling behind in their studies and how to address that challenge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schools are also facing confrontation from parents over social issues, such as the types of books that are allowed in schools and the treatment of transgender students. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of these education issues and recommendations to address them are outlined in </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/04/what-could-project-2025-mean-for-education-in-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Project 2025</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — a conservative plan for how the country should operate if a Republican wins the White House. Some support the plan and others fear it could derail previous efforts to improve public education in Virginia.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the state’s District 2 congressional race, Republican nominee and incumbent Jen Kiggans has publicly supported</span><a href="https://jenforcongress.com/issues/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> prioritizing students&#8217; safety and security</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and equipping teachers with tools and resources to improve student outcomes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She voted for the </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/5" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Parents Bills of Rights</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a measure to “ensure the rights of parents are honored in public schools” and stands against critical race theory, a graduate-level framework that focuses on racial inequity and has not been found in Virginia curricula.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like the authors of Project 2025 and Kiggans, the Republican nominee for the District 10 seat Mike Clancy said he supports school choice. </span></p>
<p>Democratic nominee Eugene Vindman, in District 7, said he opposes book bans and the project, which he <a class="c-link" href="https://dailyprogress.com/opinion/column/eugene-vindman-project-2025-is-a-threat-to-democracy/article_709f3f3a-6a2a-11ef-927e-b310eb440bd5.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://dailyprogress.com/opinion/column/eugene-vindman-project-2025-is-a-threat-to-democracy/article_709f3f3a-6a2a-11ef-927e-b310eb440bd5.html" data-sk="tooltip_parent">sa</a>id his opponent and Republican nominee Derrick Anderson has failed to denounce.</p>
<p>Anderson said Vindman is “lying” and denied supporting the project&#8217;s proposal to eliminate the U.S. Department of <span class="c-mrkdwn__highlight">Education</span>.</p>
<p>He said he supports helping students in his home district “succeed” and will advocate for ensuring that “test scores go up and conflicts go down.”</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In District 9, Karen Baker, the democratic nominee, said she supports strengthening public schools, much like Vindman.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Baker’s </span><a href="https://www.bakerforva9th.com/issues" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">campaign website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, she supports making universal preschool “a reality for all families” in Southwest Virginia. She also supports investing in vocational education and making it accessible to the area. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Suhas Subramanyam, the Democratic nominee in District 10, said if elected, he will work to expand Pre-K, access to “critical“ job training into apprentice programs, and support providing resources to local schools to close the pandemic, learning loss gap.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He told the Mercury that if the recommendations for Project 2025 were implemented, it would “devastate” Virginia’s public education system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We must do the opposite: invest in our schools, support our parents and teachers, and make college and postgraduate education affordable,” Subramanyam’s campaign said in a statement.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Environment/Climate</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic candidates in Virginia’s congressional races largely have expressed the desire to address climate change by transitioning to zero-carbon generation sources. Some candidates differentiate themselves, like District 3 incumbent U.S. Rep. Bobby </span><a href="https://www.bobbyscottforcongress.com/the-scott-record" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scott</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who’s advocated for funding Norfolk’s flood wall to reduce sea level rise damage. District 6 contender Ken </span><a href="https://www.kenmitchellforvirginia.com/issues" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mitchell</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> highlighted a need to “transition public investments away from propping up fossil fuel companies” on his campaign site, while District 11 incumbent U.S. Rep. Gerry </span><a href="https://gerryconnolly.com/issues/environment/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Connolly</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has said he’s an advocate for environmental justice, an environmental lens that amplifies the voices and needs of overlooked and overburdened communities during development that could impact their area. District 9 candidate Karen </span><a href="https://www.bakerforva9th.com/coal-miners" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Baker </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">doesn’t address climate change on her website, but highlights a need to protect coal miners’ health.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Across the aisle, Republican congressional candidates also mostly fall in line with each other’s environmental policy views by advocating for  </span><a href="https://www.mikeclancyforcongress.com/services-5" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reducing regulations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.hungforva.com/enviornment/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">energy independence</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or promoting energy sources stemming from </span><a href="https://cline.house.gov/issues/energy/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fossil fuels</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><a href="https://sitkaforcongress.com/on-the-issues" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">nuclear</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Some candidates don’t take clear positions about their environmental policy plans. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taking unique approaches on the GOP side are District 2 incumbent U.S. Rep Jen Kiggans, who signed onto a letter with other House Republicans earlier this year asking for House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana to </span><a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/some-house-republicans-warn-against-climate-law-repeal/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">not repeal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> tax credits of the IRA, which have helped incentivize a burgeoning offshore wind </span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2024/07/09/south-korean-company-plans-to-build-681-million-offshore-wind-submarine-cable-plant-in-chesapeake/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">development</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> industry in the Hampton Roads region.

Some environmental groups say the bill includes some concessions for continued natural gas use. Whichever party gains majority control of Congress could determine the fate of that bill.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Election integrity</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Concerns over election integrity and the potential for voter fraud have sparked a renewed focus in Congress, as lawmakers from both parties debate how best to safeguard the democratic process. With allegations of fraudulent voting making headlines in recent election cycles, the issue has become a political flashpoint. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While some legislators call for stricter voting regulations to prevent potential abuse, others argue that such measures could suppress voter participation. As the 2024 election approaches, members of Congress are crafting new policies aimed at ensuring fair elections while addressing public concerns over security and accessibility.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the U.S. Senate, Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., has carried legislation such as the Freedom to Vote Act, which would implement provisions like automatic voter registration, same-day and Election Day voter registration, online voter registration, and no-excuse mail voting. Kaine has also co-sponsored the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, which seeks to restore and update crucial protections against voting discrimination that were weakened by recent Supreme Court decisions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine’s Republican opponent Hung Cao, a retired U.S. Navy captain who is backed by former President Donald Trump, has proposed few legislative means to secure the electoral process beyond a universal requirement for providing a voter ID in order to cast a ballot. But he said in a statement to The Mercury that “the only way to have election integrity is to have people watch the polls.” Cao has also suggested that the U.S. hold elections like the ones he witnessed in Iraq and Afghanistan, where people vote with their finger and blue ink. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In July, U.S. Rep. Jen Kiggans, R-Virginia Beach, who represents House District 2, voted in support of the </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/118/bills/hr8281/BILLS-118hr8281rh.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which passed in the House of Representatives by a 221-198 vote. Advocates of the SAVE Act say it would ensure that only citizens can vote in federal elections, partly by making it mandatory for states to obtain proof of citizenship to register voters and also requiring states to purge noncitizens from voter rolls. But President Joe Biden has vowed to veto the measure, stating that it would make it more difficult for eligible voters to register and increase “the risk that eligible voters are purged from voter rolls.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kiggans’ Democratic challenger Missy Cotter Smasal, who previously mounted an unsuccessful campaign in Virginia’s 8th Senate District, has talked little about election integrity legislation. But the U.S. Navy veteran has attacked her Republican opponent for being  a “big supporter of President Trump” for backing “Big Lie” conspiracy theorists in Virginia’s state legislature by being one of </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/02/24/virginia-youngkin-tax-cuts-house-senate/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">only four Senators to vote for an audit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the 2020 election that would have cost Virginia taxpayers $70 million.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Derrick Anderson, a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">former special forces Green Beret and the Republican nominee in District 7, has talked little publically about election integrity and he offers no clues about his views on his campaign website, but in </span><a href="https://dailyprogress.com/news/local/government-politics/elections/derrick-anderson-talks-biden-the-border-and-inflation-ahead-of-tuesdays-gop-primary/article_a009bd2a-2837-11ef-9cbd-0f478e969dbd.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an interview</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with The Daily Progress he acknowledged that Joe Biden is the legitimate president.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If elected, Anderson’s Democratic opponent Eugene Vindman, the twin brother of anti-Trump whistleblower Alexander Vindman, has vowed to work to pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and strengthen protections for election workers, “so that anyone who threatens a poll volunteer or election official in an attempt to undermine our vote is held accountable.” Vindman, whose family emigrated to the United States from the former Soviet Union, has also warned against downplaying the Jan. 6, 2021 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, which he blamed on a pro-Trump movement that did not recognize the nation’s norms of peaceful transfer of power and that he said undermines elections across the country to this day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Rep. Morgan Griffith, R-Salem, the incumbent in District 9, in 2023 sponsored the </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/4460" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">No Vote for Non-Citizens Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, seeking to ensure only eligible American citizens may participate in federal elections. The bill, which is still moving through the House, withholds some federal dollars that go to localities that allow non-citizens to vote in their elections. Griffith also voted for the SAVE Act. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrat Karen Baker, Griffith’s opponent, told The Mercury that Republicans have failed to provide any evidence of voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election and therefore there is no reason to believe that this year’s election will be different. Baker also stated that fears of undocumented immigrants voting are generated to induce distrust of election integrity but are absolutely without basis, and she has criticized Griffith for refusing to state that he will accept the outcome of the 2024 presidential election. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Mike Clancy, an attorney from Loudoun County and the Republican nominee in District 10, does not list election integrity as one of his legislative priorities on his campaign website, he has been outspoken on social media about strengthening election laws. “Congress must pass the SAVE Act,” Clancy </span><a href="https://x.com/MikeClancyVA/status/1811031488923586986" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said on X</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in July. “Only U.S. citizens should be voting in our elections.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State Sen. Suhas Subramanyam, D-Loudoun, Clancy’s opponent and a strict opponent of the SAVE Act, believes that “democracy is under attack” in America. The son of Indian immigrants, Subramanyam has vowed to continue to fight against “restrictive voter ID laws that are designed to suppress the vote, protect early voting to ensure greater access to the polls, and combat political gerrymandering.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Immigration</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Americans find that more migrants are turning to the United States for employment opportunities or to escape violent conflict in their home countries, among other reasons, they are increasingly interested in candidates&#8217; views on immigration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">America has become one of the most prominent destinations for migrants. However, over several years, many migrants have entered the country illegally, prompting backlash. At the same time, migrants have also been a staple of America’s workforce, including in the commonwealth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the </span><a href="https://map.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/locations/virginia/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">American Immigration Council</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, immigrants comprised about 12.6% of Virginia’s total population in 2022, and 16.2% of Virginia&#8217;s labor force.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the District 9 race, Republican nominee and incumbent Morgan Griffith said immigrants are welcome to come to the United States “legally” and share in the “American dream,&#8221; but supports “cracking down” on illegal immigration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While criticizing the House for ducking its responsibility, Democratic nominee Karen Baker in District 9 said Congress needs to pass comprehensive immigration reform. She said she supports the Senate&#8217;s template for more border control agents and asylum officers and advocates for a DACA bill to protect children who have lived in the U.S. their entire lives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the District 2 race, Jen Kiggans’ campaign said the Republican nominee and incumbent voted for legislation to increase security at the U.S. border by ensuring that federal immigration officials have the training and resources to stop the influx of illegal immigration, drugs and crime into the U.S. The measure has remained in the Senate since last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kiggans supports strict enforcement of existing federal immigration laws and holding President Joe Biden’s administration accountable. She also backed legislation to prevent the administration from using National Parks to house illegal immigrants.</span></p>
<p>Derrick Anderson, the Republican nominee for the District 7 seat, said he <a class="c-link" href="https://dailyprogress.com/news/local/government-politics/elections/derrick-anderson-talks-biden-the-border-and-inflation-ahead-of-tuesdays-gop-primary/article_a009bd2a-2837-11ef-9cbd-0f478e969dbd.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://dailyprogress.com/news/local/government-politics/elections/derrick-anderson-talks-biden-the-border-and-inflation-ahead-of-tuesdays-gop-primary/article_a009bd2a-2837-11ef-9cbd-0f478e969dbd.html" data-sk="tooltip_parent">supports</a> shutting down the border.</p>
<p>“It’s clear that the crisis at the border is hurting people right here in Virginia’s 7th District,” Anderson said in a statement. “Drugs, fentanyl, human trafficking – we need a serious change. We need to secure the border.”</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Suhas Subramanyam, the Democratic nominee in District 10, said with the U.S. immigration system being “broken,” he supports the country taking a comprehensive approach to the problem by starting with securing the border and ensuring that people who are doing “the right things the right way and contributing to our economy“ have a path to citizenship.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said the country must also fix its “broken” asylum system.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Foreign policy (Israel-Hamas conflict, China, Ukraine)</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Virginia voters are following their congressional candidates&#8217; views on common issues in the U.S., they are also considering their responses to global conflicts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a Pew Research Center </span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2024/04/23/what-are-americans-top-foreign-policy-priorities/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that was completed in April, two of the most important issues to Americans are limiting the powers of China and finding a solution to the Israel-Hamas conflict.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Americans are also interested in limiting Russia’s powers following its invasion of Ukraine in Feb. 2022.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., said he takes pride in the fact that he is among a wide slate of lawmakers President Vladimir Putin of Russia permanently banned from visiting Russia in response to his record of standing against Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine two years ago. Kaine has voted for aid to Ukraine, and earlier this year he helped pass a supplemental package that included support for the country to defend its sovereignty. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine also said he views the U.S.-China relationship as the most consequential bilateral relationship of the century. Kaine voted to pass the </span><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/08/09/fact-sheet-chips-and-science-act-will-lower-costs-create-jobs-strengthen-supply-chains-and-counter-china/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CHIPS and Science Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> designed to outcompete China by shoring up domestic supply chains and bringing manufacturing back to America. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After Hamas terrorists attacked Israeli territories on Oct. 7, 2023, Kaine has worked with Democrats, Republicans, and the Biden administration to ensure that Israel has defensive support. But Kaine has also called for a reduction of civilian casualties, supported the safe and swift delivery of humanitarian assistance to civilians in Gaza and the West Bank, and for long-term solutions to allow Palestinians and Israelis to live alongside each other in peace.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine’s Republican opponent and former U.S. Navy captain Hung Cao in a statement criticized the Biden administration and Congress for giving “blanket amounts of money” towards Ukraine’s defense effort, alleging the financial support instead helps fund Ukraine’s retired workers pension plans. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cao considers China an “existential threat” to the United States, and he has further called for the continued support of Israel, which he considers one of the United States’ closest allies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Jen Kiggans’ campaign, the District 2 Republican nominee and incumbent supports legislation to impose sanctions against China for its responsibility in the fentanyl crisis and </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/22/cosponsors" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">prevent selling any petroleum to Chinese Communist Party-controlled entities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Derrick Anderson, the Republican nominee in District 7 and a former special forces Green Beret with six tours of duty overseas, including Afghanistan, Iraq, and various countries throughout the Middle East, told the </span><a href="https://jewishinsider.com/2024/04/virginia-congressional-candidate-derrick-anderson-military/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Jewish Insider”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in an interview in April that Congress needs to move quickly to provide additional aid to the Jewish state in its war against Hamas. He added that he was skeptical of sending more U.S. funds to the Palestinians, noting that other countries are providing aid. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like Anderson, his Democratic opponent Eugene Vindman, also a veteran, called for continued support for Israel, while asking that the U.S. continue to ensure that all the hostages — including Americans — are returned safe and sound to their families. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vindman has also pushed for the continued support of Ukraine in both military and economic terms, and for taking on China&#8217;s state-directed economic system, which he said unfairly competes in the market and compromises America’s national security. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While U.S. Rep. Morgan Griffith, R-Salem, voted for the Ukraine Democracy Defense Lend-Lease Act of 2022, which allowed the lending and lease of American defense material to the country in its defense of the Russian invasion, he also also voted to block similar legislation last year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Griffith </span><a href="https://morgangriffith.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=403045" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">has called</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> China a “dangerous, power-hungry actor” over the country’s territorial claims in the South China Sea, as well as its escalating efforts to control Taiwan, while </span><a href="https://morgangriffith.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=403086" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">criticizing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> President Joe Biden’s decision to hold an arms shipment to Israel last spring. Griffith also said that America’s dealings with other countries must be driven by a careful analysis of what best serves the United States and its citizens.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In relation to the conflict between Israel and Hamas, Karen Baker, Griffith’s Democratic opponent, has pointed out that while she acknowledged Israel’s right to exist, there are “bad acts on both sides.” Baker has also endorsed the continued financial and military support of Ukraine by the United States, </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Suhas Subramanyam, the Democratic nominee in District 10, said he supports the U.S. in opposing Russia leader Vladimir Putin&#8217;s territorial ambitions in Europe and standing up to China, which is “violating international law and illegally dumping goods to prop up their economy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also supports the CHIPS Act, which helped to boost domestic research and manufacturing of semiconductor chips.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for the Israel-Hamas war, Subramanyam said he supports the U.S. returning hostages, especially  American citizens, and helping to rebuild communities affected by the war.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also supports a two-state solution, adding that Hamas cannot be one of the states.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The human lives lost in this conflict have been devastating for all sides,” Subramanyam said in a statement. “I have visited the region, including the areas of Israel that were attacked, and made good friends there. I want to see an end to the war and a long-term path to peace.”</span></p>

Gov. Winsome Sears presides over the Senate. (Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears on Thursday evening officially announced her candidacy for governor of Virginia in the upcoming 2025 election, aiming to become the nation’s first Black female governor. Sears made history in 2022 by becoming the first Black woman in the commonwealth to hold statewide office, and the first woman to attain such a role since Mary Sue Terry’s tenure as attorney general in the 1990s. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The future, a new chapter, is about to begin,” Earle-Sears said at a rally in Virginia Beach. “Together, we have the power to ensure that our brightest days are ahead of us still. But to make that future a reality, we must come together, it is really that simple. We must stand strong, we must support each other, we must share each other’s values and visions.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earle-Sears’s candidacy marks a significant milestone in Virginia’s political landscape. Should she become the Republican nominee, she would likely face U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger, D-Prince William, who was the first candidate </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/spanberger-virginia-governor-candidacy-c19ade683ab0dfaef67051b36791d30a" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to announce</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> her bid in November. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">​​Spanberger is the only Democrat currently seeking her party’s nomination, after Richmond Mayor Levar Stoney dropped his bid to instead run for lieutenant governor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Earle-Sears announcing her run for governor of Virginia was expected, because the lieutenant  governor role is often seen as a stepping stone to the state’s highest office,” said David Richards, a political scientist at the University of Lynchburg. “Glenn Youngkin is a popular governor and so Earle-Sears should try to take advantage of that to go to the next level.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A trailblazer in Virginia politics, Earle-Sears first made history in 2021 when she was elected as the state’s first Black woman to hold statewide office. Her rise in the GOP has been marked by her strong conservative values, her advocacy for education reform, and her emphasis on public safety — themes that are expected to play a central role in her gubernatorial campaign.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A native of Kingston, Jamaica, Earle-Sears, 60, immigrated to the United States at the age of 6. She grew up in the Bronx, New York City, and served as an electrician in the U.S. Marine Corps from 1983 until 1986. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She also directed a Salvation Army homeless shelter before launching her career in public service in 2001, when she was elected to the Virginia House of Delegates, representing the 90th District, becoming the first Jamaican-American, female Republican,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">first female veteran, and first naturalized citizen to serve in the General Assembly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On her path to seize the Republican nomination for governor Earle-Sears will likely face Attorney General Jason Miyares, who is also speculated to announce his candidacy in the coming weeks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another obstacle for Earle-Sears may be her decision in November 2022 to </span><a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/politics/virginia-lt-gov-earle-sears-time-to-move-on-from-trump/3205900/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">publicly withdraw</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> her support for former President Donald Trump, who at the time was teasing an announcement for a third White House run — a move that might haunt her as the Republican nominee for president has shown little tolerance for disloyalty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A true leader understands when they have become a liability. A true leader understands that it’s time to step off the stage. And the voters have given us that very clear message,” Earle-Sears said in a TV interview with Fox News at the time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But on Thursday, Earle-Sears left no doubt about her return into the Make America Great Again fold. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is such a great country, God bless America. And folks, first and foremost, in 2024, that means standing with President Trump, it means standing with [Republican nominee] Hung Cao for our Senate, and it means that we must stand very steadfast with our incumbents so they can continue to defend Virginia’s best interests in Congress,” she told her audience. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some Trump loyalists already pushed back against an Earle-Sears candidacy over her previous remarks about the former president. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“She’s an insufferable, never-Trumper that’s totally myopic and self serving,” conservative talk show host John Fredericks wrote on the social media platform X on Thursday, suggesting that the lieutenant governor’s bid “might as well be paid for and authorized” by Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Once again, it’s all about Winsome Sears, and it’s all about screwing Trump — because that’s all she does,” Fredericks said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Richards, the political scientist, said that it is possible for Earle-Sears to overcome her rocky relationship with Trump and secure her party’s nomination. “She is popular with state Republicans, polling ahead of Miyares in a survey earlier this year. Whether she can replicate Youngkin’s 2021 surprise win statewide remains to be seen.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Either way, an Earle-Sears v. Spanberger matchup would be historic, Richards said. “Two women running for governor of Virginia, and Earle-Sears would be the first Black woman and, if elected, the first person since the 1700s to be governor not born in the U.S.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At her rally in Virginia Beach on Thursday, Earle-Sears vowed that she would mount a good fight. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Winning Virginia is not just possible, it is necessary because the Democrats have had a headstart and they are fighting tooth and nail to win in November. And they want to win in November 2025 as well, but we are not going to let them. So, let’s roll up our sleeves and let’s get to work,” she said. </span></p>

(Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Commissioner of Elections Susan Beals on Wednesday expressed concerns with the operational performance of the U.S. Postal Service ahead of the 2024 presidential election in Virginia, warning that mail-in ballots may not be processed in time to be counted. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Election officials depend on the U.S. mail service to deliver ballots to voters and to return ballots to election officials,” Beals told members of the Virginia House of Delegates Privileges and Elections Committee at a meeting in Richmond. “What I am hoping to change is the expectation of voters, that if I put my ballot in the mail five days before election day that it is going to get there. You need to plan further out than that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beals, who was </span><a href="https://www.wric.com/news/virginia-news/youngkin-appoints-susan-beals-as-virginias-new-elections-commissioner/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">appointed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as Virginia’s commissioner of election by Gov. Glenn Youngkin in March 2022, responded to a question by Del. Phillip Scott, R-Fredericksburg, who had asked what she considered “the biggest threat” to the upcoming election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beals said since before the 2023 election cycle, the Department of Elections has seen issues with mail-in ballots cast by voters who had been living in the same house for decades.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For example, the registrar tries to mail you a ballot and it gets mailed back to the registrar with one of those yellow stickers,” Beals said. “We had some cases where voters were trying to mail their ballot to an elections office and it’s being returned to the voter. We’ve had long delivery times and we’ve had examples of ballots that were sitting in the processing centers for days.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Postal Service has faced significant challenges in delivering mail-in ballots on time since the 2020 presidential election. The surge in mail-in voting due to the COVID-19 pandemic strained the postal system, leading to delays and concerns about the timely counting of votes. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week during a </span><a href="https://www.newsweek.com/postal-service-outlines-plans-mail-ballots-1946552" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">news conference</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the Postal Service outlined its preparations for the “secure and successful delivery of election mail” in the Nov. 5 general election and briefed U.S. House and Senate committee staff of its preparedness to deliver the nation’s ballots.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our letter carriers and facilities teams across the country, the 640,000 women and men of the Postal Service, are fully focused on the critical mission of delivering the nation’s election mail — just as we have done so excellently through this current primary season and as we have done in the past,” Postmaster General Louis DeJoy said in a statement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But despite these efforts to improve operations, issues such as staffing shortages, operational changes, and the sheer volume of ballots have continued to cause problems during more recent elections in many states — including in Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beals told the committee on Wednesday that her department first started raising concerns with the Postal Service prior to the 2023 election. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Virginia was a little bit of a canary (in a) coal mine on the issue of USPS and their performance because we had that statewide election in 2023, and a lot of other states did not, that’s their off-year,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, the department started hearing from registrars about issues with mail ballots not being delivered to voters, not receiving them back in time, and ballots coming back as being undeliverable to voters who had not changed their address in years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We immediately reached out to USPS, we had an in-person meeting prior to the November election, and another in-person meeting after the election,” Beals said. But when the concerns remained, Beals requested to meet with members of Virginia’s congressional delegation and with representatives of both U.S. Sens. Mark Warner and Tim Kaine, D-Va., on Capitol Hill.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They sent me immediately to their committees to detail the types of issues that we were seeing in Virginia,” Beals said, adding that she additionally flagged the mail delivery problems with the National Association of State Election Directors </span><a href="https://www.nased.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">(NASED)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the U.S. Postal Regulatory Commission, an independent agency overseeing the operations of the Postal Service.</span></p>

(Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s been frustrating for us because every time we’ve raised these issues we were assured that they were going to be addressed, and then the subsequent elections weren’t necessarily seeing them get addressed, we’re still seeing some of the same issues,” Beals told the committee. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A spokesman for the Postal Service in Virginia did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment Wednesday. But according to </span><a href="https://about.usps.com/newsroom/national-releases/2024/0829-election-mail-webinar.htm" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">data released</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the agency last week, nationally, the Postal Service in 2022 delivered 99.89% of ballots from voters to election officials within seven days. The 2022 midterm elections saw a similar level of on-time performance, with 99.93% of ballots delivered within the same timeframe. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And Del. Paul Krizek, D-Fairfax, a member of the committee, cautioned against drawing conclusions before more data on mail-in voting in Virginia is available.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think it’s important that we don’t scare the voters into thinking that this is not a safe and valid way to vote, because absentee balloting has been a hallmark of our democracy,” Krizek said in a brief interview Wednesday. “I think it’s a very important form of voting and I’d hate to see it go away or people be afraid to do it.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beals’ message to Virginians planning to vote by mail this year is to not wait until the last minute to request and mail back their ballot — and to stay on top of the process. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Make sure that once you request your ballot and it’s been a week or two, go ahead and call your registrar’s office and ask where it is. And as soon as you receive it, turn it around and put it back in the mail, don’t let it sit,” Beals said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I know folks sometimes get their ballot and sometimes let it marinate and think about it, but you can’t do that this year. You need to make sure that you mail it back or you can drop it at a dropbox at your registrar’s office or at a polling location on Election Day.” </span></p>

Bob Good, R-Campbell, speaks at a campaign rally in Powhatan County. (Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even after an additional review of the recount results in the GOP primary in Virginia’s 5th Congressional District last week </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/08/28/outcome-of-5th-district-gop-primary-unchanged-after-further-review-of-ballots/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">confirmed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> state Sen. John McGuire, R-Goochland, as the winner, some Republican hardliners in the district refuse to accept the former Navy SEAL who was endorsed by former President Donald Trump as their party’s nominee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead, they have vowed to write in U.S. Rep. Bob Good, R-Farmville, the incumbent, who lost what has been deemed one of the most expensive and viciously fought nomination battles nationwide this year by a mere 366 votes out of more than 62,000 cast.</span></p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Outcome of 5th District GOP primary unchanged after further review of ballots&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/08/28/outcome-of-5th-district-gop-primary-unchanged-after-further-review-of-ballots/embed/#?secret=pft4Xcx0mI#?secret=m3uVfZfHcX" data-secret="m3uVfZfHcX" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Anyone with the right moral conviction would write in Bob Good, one of the 10 true conservatives left in Congress,” said Rob Reese, owner of the Virginia Archery Center in Goochland County and a member of a group of self-described “real conservatives” who are encouraging fellow Republicans in the district to write in Good on Nov. 5.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a phone interview Tuesday, Reese painted McGuire as a RINO, a​​ derogatory moniker meaning “Republican In Name Only,” who was handpicked by the GOP establishment in Washington, D.C., as part of an effort to replace true conservatives in Congress. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The swamp has been trying to get rid of every conservative that they can get their hands on,” Reese said. The Republican Party — in Virginia and on the national level — “pulled the same garbage in District 5 that the Democrats pulled” when they replaced President Joe Biden with Vice President Kamala Harris as their presidential nominee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They just hid it better. You don’t primary the most conservative Congress member and replace him with a uni-party yes-boy,” Reese said, adding that the number of Republicans who insist on making Good their nominee has continued to grow despite the incumbent’s failed recount challenge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s thousands of us, enough to cause McGuire to lose the election unless he ponies up and talks to the people,” Reese said. “This isn’t a we-win game to me, it’s about the republic, and people taking the republic back from D.C., and I think they are more in a panic than they can believe.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of the district’s Republicans air their differences on social media — like the Facebook group </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/Va5thDistrictGOP/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia&#8217;s 5th Congressional District GOP Voters</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and even Good’s own campaign account on the platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Responding to </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/share/p/17EToxdKG3/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a post from Good</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from last week in which he thanked </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the judges for their efforts to “address some mistakes that had been identified after the recount,” several of his supporters chimed in, thanking him for his service and encouraging others to join the write-in effort.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Folks … write in Good for Congress! Express your anger, don’t vote McGuire, write in Bob! Mount the write in campaign, don’t let McGuire win that seat,” one commenter wrote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another told Good to “keep up the good work … and folks, please write Bob Good in come November, he’s the only choice we have for America First conservative constitutional representation.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The comment prompted a response from a McGuire supporter: “Why do you keep telling people to write Bob in, are you trying to get a Democrat control? Cause that will happen if McGuire doesn’t receive all Republican votes. Bob Good lost, don’t have our state lose.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McGuire will face Democrat Gloria Witt, a businesswoman and native of Amherst County, in the Nov. 5 election. Witt is fighting an uphill battle in a heavily Republican district where  Trump won twice with 53% of the vote in 2016 and 2020. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But a significant amount of write-ins splitting the Republican vote could potentially put the district in play for Democrats, said David Richards, a political science professor at the University of Lynchburg.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The 5th is a tricky district, it is clearly Republican-leaning, but the margin of the win has been all over the place. And in 2008 the Democratic Party won it by 800 votes, so I don’t think the McGuire campaign can just ignore a write-in effort on behalf of Bob Good,” Richards said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And McGuire is facing several headwinds in his general election campaign, Richards added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There is the write-in campaign, ill-will left over from the primary, a small but vocal </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/03/va-republican-voters-officials-press-for-harris-over-trump/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans for Kamala Harris</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> effort, a muted campaign so far from McGuire, a very active campaign from Democrat Gloria Witt, and general national excitement among Democrats that may elevate Democratic turnout. It is not clear that all of this will add up to enough to swing the district, but it certainly makes it more likely.”</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="GKuITNBkSL"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/03/va-republican-voters-officials-press-for-harris-over-trump/">Va. Republican voters, officials press for Harris over Trump</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Va.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It remains unclear if the write-in effort by Good supporters would trigger Virginia’s so-called </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/09/27/2023-elections-bring-new-scrutiny-of-virginias-sore-loser-rule/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sore loser law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which was designed to ensure that when a candidate is defeated in a Republican or Democratic primary, they can’t drop their party affiliation and appear on the general election ballot next to the person who beat them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rich Anderson, the chairman of the Republican Party of Virginia, said in a phone interview Tuesday that under state party rules, “any member of a subunit of RPV who supports a candidate against a nominated Republican” is deemed to have resigned from the Republican Party and is prohibited from engaging in any party activity for a period of four years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That is a rule that I must and will enforce stringently in this or any future election cycle,” Anderson said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sean Brown, a spokesman for McGuire’s campaign, said while  McGuire “is working hard to deliver Virginia for Donald Trump and build a conservative majority in the House and Senate,” Good and a “very small handful of his supporters” continue to undermine Trump. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For the sake of the country, Bob should put his personal ambitions and hard feelings towards President Trump aside, and work to elect Trump and Trump-backed candidates,” Brown said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Good himself has not mounted a write-in campaign, and he has remained silent on the ongoing effort by his supporters. His campaign spokeswoman Diana Shores on Tuesday echoed Anderson’s remarks about the party rules and code of conduct. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Individuals who are members of their local units are bound by the party plan to support the nominees. I am urging all Republicans to stay engaged with their Republican committees to do the work that needs to be done,” Shores said in a text message. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Glenn Youngkin has also vowed to step up and rally in support of McGuire in the 5th District, where the two will be joined by Anderson and Hung Cao, the Republican nominee for U.S. Senate in Virginia, at four events in Amherst, Bedford and Pittsylvania counties and the town of Altavista on Monday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Matt Moran, the executive Director of Youngkin’s Spirit of Virginia PAC, said in a statement that the governor is “committed to bringing Republicans together around our nominees so we can win in November,” but he stopped short of singling out the grassroots write-in campaign for Good in the 5th District as a concern for McGuire’s bid. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He’s campaigning with Republicans across Virginia on why we need strong leadership back in the White House and in Congress,” Moran said of Youngkin. “We are confident that Republicans are united as our campaigns gear up for the fall.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the governor’s efforts will likely fall on deaf ears among some of Good’s most loyal supporters who have long made up their minds. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among them is Russ Simpson, owner of the Apple Shed &amp; Chapel in Lovingston, who said that McGuire lost his vote because he did not debate Good during his primary campaign. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When you’re running for office to represent me, you damn well better be a fighter. If you’re not willing to fight and to debate, then I’m not interested in supporting you, whether you’re a Republican or whatever,” Simpson said in a phone interview. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While he doesn’t support the policies of the Democratic Party, he is not willing to vote for a candidate just because he has an R by his name, Simpson added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s going to be a lot of people who will write in Bob Good, you’re looking at a significant amount of people, and that could play heavily into him losing. I don’t like being in this position but (McGuire) has put the whole district in a conundrum, and I wish there was a remedy to this situation,” Simpson said. </span></p>

As gambling options become more accessible, experts warn that the number of young people falling into addiction is on the rise, leading to severe financial, emotional, and social consequences.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Problem gambling is not just a personal problem, it’s a family, community and state problem. One individual that struggles with gambling-related harm negatively impacts eight to 10 other individuals,” Brianne Doura-Schawohl, the former vice president of U.S. Policy and Strategic Development for global harm prevention consultancy EPIC Risk Management and now head of Doura-Schawohl Consulting LLC, said at </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/08/22/virginia-one-step-closer-to-creating-single-gaming-agency/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a recent meeting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the newly created Joint Subcommittee to Study the Feasibility of Establishing the Virginia Gaming Commission in Richmond. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Doura-Schawohl warned the panel that about 5% of people who actively gamble will suffer from problematic gambling at some point. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There are biological, psychological and sociological factors that feed into this. Given that the commonwealth has traditionally done nothing to address this public health issue, I’m very concerned about the current state of problem gambling within our jurisdiction,” she said.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The full scope of the problem</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a 2022 review published by the scientific </span><a href="https://www.addictionjournal.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Journal of Addiction</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, globally one in every 400 adults has sought help for gambling problems, either in the past 12 months or at some point in their lifetime, Doura-Schawohl said. In the United States, an estimated 1-2% of the adult population struggles with problematic gambling, and about 5% percent of all those who actively gamble will suffer from this addiction, according to the National Council on Problem Gambling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the opening of several new casinos in the state and the proliferation of online gambling technologies — such as sports betting apps and virtual casinos — the popular pastime has become easier and more enticing for young adults, and lawmakers are aware of the challenges that require the government to act. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As the Virginia Gaming Commission starts to form, between myself and our colleagues in the General Assembly, the problem gambling is probably one of the foremost issues that we are trying to get a handle on and make sure that the resources are there,” said Sen. Bryce Reeves, R-Spotsylvania, the committee chairman. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because there are currently no federal funds designated for problem gambling treatment or research — unlike the billions of dollars in funding for alcohol, tobacco and drug addiction — the General Assembly last year passed legislation creating a new </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB1465" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Problem Gambling Treatment and Support Advisory Committee </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">within the Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services to address and mitigate gambling addiction in Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislature previously created a </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title37.2/chapter3/section37.2-314.2/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Problem Gambling Treatment and Support Fund</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help pay for “counseling and other support services for compulsive and problem gamblers, developing and implementing compulsive and problem gambling treatment and prevention programs, and providing grants to support organizations that provide assistance to compulsive and problem gamblers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advocates for combating problem gambling, including Doura-Schawohl, have been pushing to create a state fund even before a 2021 survey found that Virginia ranked 27th in the nation with a per capita spending of just 27 cents on measures countering the effects of the addiction. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think more shocking was when I did an estimate for the annual cost we as the taxpayers are incurring because we are not funding this efficiently, including divorce, bankruptcy, crime, healthcare for suicidal ideations, depression and anxiety,” Doura-Schawohl told the committee. “We are talking about individuals who are in the throes of an addiction which often compromises their finances.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Substance abuse is 338 times more funded in Virginia than problem gambling services, but it is only seven times more prevalent within the state’s communities, Doura-Schawohl said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So we are talking about something that is pretty rampant yet it doesn’t have nearly the funds that it needs.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reeves, the committee chair, said that in Virginia these efforts are already underway but still in the early stages. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The team that we have on the ground working on this is doing a phenomenal job. One of the primary goals of this committee is to strictly highlight problem gambling, which is why we have to make sure to put in the effort to counter the human cost and try to fix that,” Reeves said. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Paul Krizek, D-Fairfax, a committee member and the sponsor of the support fund legislation, said because there is no federal money for problem gambling prevention or treatment, it is on the state to step up and create more awareness. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think we need to do a better job at public health messaging, and I look forward to the creation of this new agency that will put all gambling regulation in one agency,” Krizek said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At its next meeting in November, the committee is set to vote on a recommendation to create the new independent state agency — dubbed the Virginia Gaming Commission — to consolidate the regulatory powers over online gambling, charity gaming, bingo, live horse racing, fantasy contests, the state’s five licensed casinos, and 10 licenses for Rosie’s Gaming Emporium. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Krizek said that bringing the problem gambling issue into that agency will be an important step, “because the primary reason for why we need this agency is for public safety purposes, that’s the primary responsibility that we have as legislators.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Problem gambling is a big enough issue that the state should take seriously, Krizek added. “I thought that was a wake up call for all of us, I don’t think anybody realized that. We have to use our money wisely, and having it in one agency will help. The idea is we can’t ignore the dark side of gambling, and one of the things we learned is that more suicides occur with problem gamblers than with any other addiction.” </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The risk to young bettors</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A survey by the National Council on Problem Gambling found that sports betting was the most problematic among all forms of gambling, with twice the rate in problematic play than that of other types. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re not talking about tendencies compared to non-gamblers, but these are new individuals,” Doura-Schawohl said. “Most of these are male bettors. There are of course females that are engaged in sports betting, but really I am worried most about the male 18- to 24-year-old demographic in particular.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. Carolyn Hawley, the president of the Virginia Problem Gambling Council and an associate professor in mental health counseling at Virginia Commonwealth University’s School of Allied Health Professions, said the fact that the increasing number of younger people taking advantage of the VPGC’s gambling helplines in recent years is of particular concern. From January through June alone, the helpline had 526 intakes, a 16% increase from the same period of 2023, and a 64% increase from 2022 over the same time period. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We see a huge demographic shift where people right at the beginning of their careers are now being devastated by developing a gambling disorder. The impact that problem gambling has on people, on their families, on their work, and on their schools is significant,” Hawley said. “When you get people this early in their lives that are experiencing this condition, it’s such a setback.”</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_39884" class="wp-caption alignright" style="max-width:100%;width:253px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/03/how-virginia-is-addressing-the-dark-side-of-gambling/screenshot-2024-08-30-at-3-58-00-pm/" rel="attachment wp-att-39884"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-39884 size-medium" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Screenshot-2024-08-30-at-3.58.00 PM-253x300.png" alt="" width="253" height="300" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Screenshot-2024-08-30-at-3.58.00 PM-253x300.png 253w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Screenshot-2024-08-30-at-3.58.00 PM.png 356w" sizes="(max-width: 253px) 100vw, 253px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Dr. Carolyn Hawley, president of the Virginia Problem Gambling Council (courtesy of Virginia Commonwealth University)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New forms of online gambling are a special concern because of their convenience, Hawley added.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m a college professor, and I see it with kids and young adults in the classroom, I see how they are on their phones and everybody is wagering, and it’s become such an acceptable recreational activity. People start out with their friends and their families, and we also see it with families and their young kids and parents thinking this is a safer behavior than say alcohol or drugs. They don’t recognize that this is a similar conditioning, and there can be consequences for people who have developed problems with this behavior.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Next steps</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Krizek, the delegate from Fairfax, said that lawmakers from both sides of the aisle have already agreed to introduce legislation ahead of the 2025 General Assembly session to ensure that going forward, “everybody who will have skin in the game” will pay into the problem gambling fund. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And they want to,” Krizek said, adding that “the casinos are already doing a lot of work, and the online sports betting businesses put in 2.5%, which is the highest of any group. But we can certainly raise that amount, and we have to figure out the best way to raise that money.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The current problem, Krizek continued, is that these efforts remain inconsistent because they lack the coordination by a single state-run agency — a void that the new Virginia Gaming Commission is designed to fill, especially in light of the many new gambling technologies emerging nationwide. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There is new gambling coming online, there is artificial intelligence, virtual reality, there are tons of ways for the dopamine in your system to be activated. I mean, the idea of gaming is to take your money, and many of us cannot afford to lose too much money,” Krizek said.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, for casual gamblers who wager simply for entertainment purposes especially at casinos, that approach is fine, he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But we don’t want to have casinos on every street corner, and we have to be mindful of those people that aren’t good at saying no, that cannot afford to lose the money, and who aren’t really gambling for entertainment purposes anymore.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead, Virginia needs to stand up an agency with the sole purpose of focusing on gaming and gambling, while being a one-stop shop for the commonwealth, “and that doesn’t do its own gambling, like the Lottery selling tickets,” Krizek said. “It would be an agency that’s not conflicted at all.”</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_39885" class="wp-caption alignright" style="max-width:100%;width:279px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/03/how-virginia-is-addressing-the-dark-side-of-gambling/screenshot-2024-08-30-at-4-01-16-pm/" rel="attachment wp-att-39885"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-39885 size-medium" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Screenshot-2024-08-30-at-4.01.16 PM-279x300.png" alt="" width="279" height="300" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Screenshot-2024-08-30-at-4.01.16 PM-279x300.png 279w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Screenshot-2024-08-30-at-4.01.16 PM-768x825.png 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Screenshot-2024-08-30-at-4.01.16 PM.png 838w" sizes="(max-width: 279px) 100vw, 279px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Del. Paul Krizek, D-Fairfax (courtesy of Krizek campaign)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But until the Virginia Gaming Commission is set up — which is currently planned by 2027 if approved by the legislature during next year’s session — the commonwealth will have to step up and provide some up-front funding to counter problem gambling, said Reeves, the committee chair. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Paul and I will have to make a presentation to the money committees in both the House and the Senate to bring this to fruition, because the entity has not been up yet and we can’t start pulling the money out of the gambling institutions as of yet,” he said. “But eventually, gambling will pay for all of this and more.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DBHDS Commissioner Nelson Smith said in an email that cross-agency collaboration “has been and will continue to be key in our prevention and treatment efforts.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The department, Virginia’s Community Services Boards, and the Virginia Department of Education are partnering to develop a curriculum for schools to help increase problem gambling awareness and help students build financial skills, Smith said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are also working to increase merchant education about problem gambling and provide tools and resources. When it comes to treatment for problem gambling, we’ve seen tremendous progress with the addition of peer support from individuals with lived experience. Working with peers helps individuals dealing with problem gambling issues understand that they aren’t alone and recovery is possible.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hawley, the VCU professor, said that she was grateful for the ongoing efforts by the General Assembly and the DBHDS to raise awareness about the dangers of problem gambling. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They have put forward so much legislation that impacts us and the work that we are doing in trying to minimize harm,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think we have to have a balance between understanding what are the economic benefits of an activity and balance that with, ‘What is a potential harm for that?’ We do have a responsibility to protect the citizens and families of the commonwealth, because ultimately we all pay.”</span></p>

(Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State Sen. John McGuire, R-Goochland, remains the winner in a highly contested GOP primary in Virginia’s 5th Congressional District, following an unexpected additional review of ballots from five of the district’s 24 localities almost one month after a full recount that did not significantly change the outcome of the election. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Working with the registrars from Amherst, Cumberland, Halifax and Mecklenburg Counties and the city of Danville, who had </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/08/26/court-summons-back-five-localities-for-new-hearing-in-5th-district-gop-primary-recount/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">been summoned</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the Goochland County Circuit Court Wednesday afternoon, a three-judge panel corrected some minor reporting errors that resulted in incumbent U.S. Rep. Bob Good, R-Farmville, picking up four more votes, bringing down McGuire’s winning margin down to 366 votes.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The court also reviewed a petition filed by Good’s attorney Brad Marss objecting to some of the recount-related expenses billed to the congressman’s campaign. The court agreed to some of the objections, resulting in a reduction of the total cost from $104,000 to $88,918 — less than the $96,500 that Goochland’s Chief Judge Claude Worrell, who headed the recount panel, had estimated at a preliminary hearing in July. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve reviewed, and reviewed, and reviewed,” Worrell said at the conclusion of Wednesday’s hearing. “We asked the representatives of the different areas to come in to show us what we were looking at, but in the end it got a little bit more complicated than that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During their review the judges identified some reporting methods by the registrars that differed slightly from the court’s initial instructions, resulting in numbers that didn’t line up correctly with the final tally. But the differences were too small to impact the outcome of the recount or the election overall. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jason Corwin, the general registrar in Mecklenburg County, said in a phone interview earlier this week that his staff discovered several minor math errors made during the recount in two of the county’s 22 precincts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When we took the original recount certification sheet, we put down a couple of wrong numbers. One was 36 and should have been 37, and one was for early voting where we put down 283 and 128, and they were both off by one vote,” Corwin said in the interview.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good’s campaign  </span><a href="https://cardinalnews.org/2024/07/10/good-files-recount-petition-in-highly-contested-5th-district-gop-primary-race/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">filed a petition</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for a district-wide recount eight days after the election </span><a href="https://cardinalnews.org/2024/07/02/state-elections-board-certifies-congressional-primaries-cementing-mcguires-victory-over-good/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">was certified</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the State Board of Elections in early July. The chairman of the powerful House Freedom Caucus told supporters in an email at the time that he was seeking a “complete recount,” including a hand-count and paper ballot match to the reported machine results.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bernard Goodwyn, the chief justice of the Supreme Court of Virginia, then appointed the three-panel recount court, consisting of Worrell, Judge J. Christopher Clemens of Salem and Judge Christopher Papile of Newport News. Initially, Worrell ordered the recount for July 31, but later pushed it back by a day due to scheduling conflicts. </span></p>

(Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before the recount, McGuire’s lead over Good was 0.6%, which put the incumbent within the 1% margin allowing him to request a recount at his campaign’s expense, but above the 0.5% threshold that would require localities to pay for it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Candidate-funded recounts are rare in Virginia, because of the high cost and because they rarely change the outcome of elections. And after the court reviewed the recounted election returns that election officials from across the district had delivered to the Goochland County Circuit Court on Aug. 1, Good picked up a mere four votes, bringing down McGuire’s winning margin to 370 and effectively ending Good’s bid for a third term in office. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The court on Wednesday agreed to honor some, but not all, of Good’s objections to the cost assessed by the court in the days after the recount. For example, it sustained a motion by Marss to toss out a $2,800 bill by Lunenburg County for its county attorney, agreeing that this expense was “undocumented” and not “reasonably necessary to the proceedings.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the court ruled other expenses billed by the localities as justified, including mileage and other travel expenses filed by election officials and sheriff’s deputies, who escorted registrars carrying ballots to Goochland on Aug. 1. The court also kept in place its order that Good’s campaign pay for meals and catering expenses incurred by election workers during the process. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking with reporters inside the courtroom on Wednesday, Marss — Good’s attorney — said that the court’s decision to hold another hearing weeks after the conclusion of the recount was highly unusual.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Having a hearing like this one I haven’t heard of before,” Marss said. “I consider it unfortunate that it happened that way. Had it not been for the discrepancies from the localities, this would have not been done in a hearing but by way of written memos.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good said in a text message after the hearing that his campaign will pay the cost determined by the court as required within 21 days. He also thanked the court for correcting the irregularities in the final tally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I appreciate the efforts of the judges to address some mistakes that had been identified after the recount,” Good said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sean Brown, a McGuire spokesman, said that the changes that the court reviewed Wednesday were “all clerical errors” by either the registrars or the court on recount day. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The court sustained Good’s objections to costs for the Lunenburg County Attorney, Albemarle Clerk, and sheriff’s deputies. The court said that since it considered the recount to be a court proceeding, those costs shouldn’t be imposed on the parties. The court overruled all of his other objections,” Brown said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McGuire, who was endorsed by former President Donald Trump three weeks before the primary election, had made his campaign a referendum on which candidate is a more loyal supporter of the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. Trump’s support likely helped push him over the edge — McGuire won the election by a mere 374 votes out of 62,792 cast.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Within days of losing the recount, Good squashed persistent rumors that he would be seeking the GOP nomination for lieutenant governor in Virginia by filing a formal “statement of candidacy” with the Federal Election Commission declaring that he will once again run in the 5th District in the 2026 election.</span></p>

(Wyatt Gordon/For The Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Passenger Rail Authority has reached a new deal with Norfolk Southern to extend its state-supported Amtrak service to the New River Valley by 2028, while avoiding a costly tunnel upgrade and making it easier to eventually bring service to Bristol.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the new agreement, which the VPRA’s board of directors approved by a unanimous vote at its meeting in Richmond Tuesday, the state will also purchase Norfolk Southern’s Manassas Line and gain access to the company’s main line, also dubbed the N-Line — a move that is expected to increase passenger rail options for thousands of Virginians. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Glenn Youngkin commended the board for voting to advance “a better, faster, and cheaper solution to bring passenger rail back to a historic location in the New River Valley” while also providing opportunities to bolster service in Northern Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are excited to deliver these benefits as we continue to accelerate results not only in these two regions, but across the entire commonwealth,” Youngkin said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to VPRA, the agreement with Norfolk Southern would support the expansion of two Amtrak round trips to Christiansburg and provide for a third, operating between Roanoke and Christiansburg, at a lower cost than originally planned. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, the purchase of the Manassas Line allows for an increase of the Virginia Railway Express’ Manassas Line service in the future with additional frequencies including evening and weekend options. The line originates at Union Station in Washington, D.C., and goes to Broad Run in Prince William County.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VPRA first announced in June that it had reached out to Norfolk Southern asking to re-open negotiations after receiving public input which supported service to Christiansburg along the N-Line and seeking a more cost-effective and timelier alternative for that service. Over the past three months, the two entities have worked together to develop plans which will allow passenger rail service to return to Christiansburg via Norfolk Southern’s Cambria Yard, which already served the community from 1904 to 1979. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the spring of 2021, then-Gov. Ralph Northam </span><a href="https://roanoke.com/news/local/passenger-rail-service-on-track-to-return-to-the-new-river-valley/article_9d07d5cc-adc8-11eb-8d26-47aff77a1a17.html#tncms-source=login" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">first announced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> during a visit in Christiansburg that Virginia had reached an agreement with Norfolk Southern to bring passenger rail to the New River Valley and increase the intercity service from Roanoke to the Northeast corridor. The Northam administration and Norfolk Southern reached </span><a href="https://vapassengerrailauthority.org/press_release_jan13_2022/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a definitive agreement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in January of 2022.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This original proposal included the construction of a temporary platform on Cinnabar Road in 2028 with an extension through the Merrimac Tunnel to a permanent station near the New River Valley Mall in 2030. But in early 2024, the VPRA released a report stating that upgrading the pre-World War I-era tunnel to modern passenger rail standards would be so expensive that an extension of the line to Bristol would be impossible. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The updated agreement approved Tuesday cuts the estimated total cost of the original plan by more than half — from $951 million to $444 million, which is already funded after the Commonwealth Transportation Board last month </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/va-transportation-board-approves-railway-sale-to-support-southwest-va-passenger-rail-expansion/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">approved</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the VPRA’s amended capital budget to include an increase from $433 million to $487 million for the plan to expand passenger rail service to Christiansburg. The money stems from existing funds in VPRA’s nearly $6 billion capital budget.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The VPRA said at the time that these capital funds will help cover the purchase of the Manassas Line and infrastructure improvements in Roanoke to accommodate more trains and rights to run passenger service on Norfolk Southern’s N-Line to Christiansburg. The funds will also cover infrastructure costs to build the platform and siding track at the Cambria station site.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We look forward to finalizing this agreement, which will make passenger rail a viable option for even more Virginians,” said DJ Stadtler, the VPRA’s executive director. “We appreciate Norfolk Southern’s partnership and look forward to working with them to expand passenger rail in the Commonwealth.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Terry Austin, R-Botetourt, a longtime advocate for extending passenger rail to Southwest Virginia, hailed the proposal as an important step toward limiting surface transportation on Interstate 81 — and doing it in a more timely manner than originally planned. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I see this as another ability to alleviate some of the congestion growth on Interstate 81,” Austin said in a phone interview Tuesday. “The new location going to the old train station in Christiansburg is a nice use of an old terminal, there is adequate parking there, and the facilities are nice and can be renovated to bring back new life. Trying to go through the Merrimac Tunnel would have been a disaster. I’m just really happy about the whole process, I think we made a wise decision here.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The inclusion of the Manassas Line in the new agreement also gives VPRA the flexibility to work with the Virginia Railway Express to expand service along their Manassas Line. The ability to add evening and weekend service is something the commuter agency has recently sought as commuting trends have changed, and the need for service beyond traditional commuting times has increased.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mike McClellan, Norfolk Southern’s chief strategy officer, hailed the agreement as having the potential “to benefit generations of Virginians with reliable, convenient rail travel, while also balancing the needs of the freight rail network the economy relies on.”</span></p>

Bob Good, R-Va, has been sent a cease and desist letter from former President Donald Trump for including his name on signs, despite his endorsement for Good's opponent John McGuire. (Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nearly four weeks after the recount in the GOP primary in Virginia’s 5th Congressional District </span><a href="https://cardinalnews.org/2024/08/01/recount-in-5th-district-gop-primary-still-underway-thursday-evening/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">confirmed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Sen. John McGuire, R-Goochland, as the winner, the court has called back election officials from five of the district’s 24 localities to another hearing in Goochland County Wednesday to resolve some minor discrepancies in their reporting of votes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The court will also review a petition filed by Brad Marss, an attorney representing U.S. Rep. Bob Good, R-Farmville, and the incumbent, objecting to some of the expenses billed to Good’s campaign for the recount. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goochland’s Chief Judge Claude Worrell, who heads the three-judge panel presiding over the recount, said at a hearing in July that the cost would amount to about $96,500. But Diana Shores, a spokeswoman for Good, said on Monday that the campaign had been billed $103,000 and was disputing some of the charges.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Election officials from Amherst, Cumberland, Halifax and Mecklenburg counties and the city of Danville were summoned to appear at Wednesday’s hearing, but the additional review of ballots is not expected to change the outcome of the election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jason Corwin, the general registrar in Mecklenburg County, said in a phone interview that after the recount, his office reached out to the court after his staff discovered several minor math errors made during the recount in two of the county’s 22 precincts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When we took the original recount certification sheet, we put down a couple of wrong numbers. One was 36 and should have been 37, and one was for early voting where we put down 283 and 128, and they were both off by one vote,” Corwin said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the total number of votes cast in his locality remains accurate and did not change after the recount, Corwin said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We saw that we had made a mistake on our end, which almost forced the judges to make one, but they were willing to have another look, because we wanted the order to accurately reflect what we had done.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Corwin said that the court has since asked his office to bring all the hand counted ballots back to Goochland for the upcoming hearing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We went over to the clerk&#8217;s office and packed everything up, and it’s been locked and secured there until I’ll leave on Wednesday.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Danville’s General Registrar Peggy Petty said that she was summoned back to Goochland after her team found that a ballot initially counted as an undervote — which is a ballot not counted because of unclear marking by the voter — had been marked for Good. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This was reported on our original paperwork, but the court did not pick it up for whatever reason,” Petty said. “It was a very clear vote for Mr. Good, it was taken to the court and for whatever reason they did not account for it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Petty said that she wasn’t too happy about having to make the 130-mile road trip from Danville to Goochland Wednesday to deliver a single ballot. “It’s definitely an inconvenience,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">David Richards, a politics professor at the University of Lynchburg, said it was “very unusual” for the court to hold another hearing almost one month after the recount concluded. “I think it speaks to how careful the court and the registrars are being.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the new hearing is not indicative of any major discrepancies with the vote count itself, Richards said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The count was done by scanning the votes, and from what I know, the scans have been tested and shown to be 100% correct. However, undervotes are examined by hand carefully. If there is a question about a singular ballot and how it was counted, it is probably because the recount court is making sure every vote is counted that can be legitimately counted.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia election officials are trained professionals who take their job very seriously, Richards said. “I feel certain that the court is making absolutely sure that if anyone comes behind them, that each vote is clearly counted in the proper manner.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/good-to-seek-recount-after-officials-certify-results-showing-mcguire-won/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">requested</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the recount in the June 18 primary election after losing to McGuire by a mere 374 votes out of 62,792 cast. Under Virginia law, the localities involved cover the cost of a recount when the margin of victory is 0.5% or less, or if the candidate who petitioned for the recount is declared the winner. But because McGuire led the incumbent by 0.6%, Good had to raise money to pay for the recount. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the recount wrapped up shortly before midnight on Aug. 1, Good had picked up just four more votes, reducing McGuire’s winning margin to 370.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shores, Good’s spokeswoman, said that the campaign was “surprised to learn” that officials from five localities had been called back to Goochland for another hearing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Never before had we heard of a case where counties or cities were recalled to the court after a recount was conducted,” she said. “We trust the three judge panel is doing its due diligence to ensure that every vote has been legally counted and we look forward to finalizing this process on behalf of the voters of the district.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shores added that the campaign has the funds to pay for the recount. “We had almost 600 people donate to the efforts. About $103,000 was billed, but depending on what the judge outlines as acceptable billing on Wednesday, that number could change.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his petition, Marss, Good’s attorney, objected to “mileage or other travel expenses beyond those contemplated” being assessed to the campaign. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia law only allows for payment of the sum of $10 and mileage “only to officers of election, and only for each time (an officer of election) delivers poll books and ballots to the polling place, and each time he delivers returns and ballots to the appropriate official after the polls close,” the petition said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Unfortunately, with only one exception (Campbell County), every other locality has sought to assess Good for the mileage expenses paid to officers of election for merely commuting to and from their place of work. Commuting expenses are not generally compensable in the law.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good also objected to any attempt to assess him for any allocated portions of salaries of sheriff’s deputies or other law enforcement officers who performed duties during the recount proceedings, such as escorting election officials carrying ballots to Goochland. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The expenses of such officers’ salaries did not increase due to their involvement in this particular judicial action, and such expenses are not assessable as costs, whether in this recount matter, or in any other civil action,” the petition said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other contested expenses include catered meals for election officials, technical support for voting machines, and portions of the salaries that some local officials had billed to the campaign. Good’s petition further argued that the five localities summoned back to Goochland for Wednesday’s hearing “should have to absorb all expenses their errors may generate.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McGuire on Monday did not respond to calls and text messages seeking comment, but Sean Brown, a campaign spokesman, said that if Good’s campaign “has the money as they claim, they should pay what they owe to localities, instead of short changing registrars, law enforcement officers, and all those that facilitated Bob’s failed recount effort.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wednesday’s hearing has been set for 1 p.m. at the Goochland County Circuit Court. </span></p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legal gaming has surged to new heights in Virginia, transforming into a multibillion-dollar annual market as the state’s expanding casinos, sports betting, and online gaming sectors fuel economic growth and reshape the entertainment landscape.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the industry is currently overseen by multiple state agencies, and splitting those duties has created oversight and enforcement gaps in the rapidly expanding industry. After a </span><a href="http://jlarc.virginia.gov/pdfs/reports/Rpt565.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2022 report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the Joint Legislative Audit &amp; Review Commission (JLARC) recommended that Virginia give a single state agency the power to regulate most gambling, efforts began to consolidate regulatory powers by a centralized body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Wednesday, the newly created Joint Subcommittee to Study the Feasibility of Establishing the Virginia Gaming Commission for the first time reviewed a proposal that would put the numerous agencies under one roof.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the two-year plan before the committee, an independent state agency — dubbed the Virginia Gaming Commission — would consolidate the regulatory powers over online gambling, charity gaming, bingo, live horse racing, fantasy contests, the state’s five licensed casinos, and 10 licenses for Rosie’s Gaming Emporium. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_11562" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:389px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/bingo-4/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class=" wp-image-11562" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/bingo-4-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="389" height="259" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/bingo-4-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/bingo-4-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/bingo-4-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/bingo-4-696x464.jpg 696w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/bingo-4-1068x712.jpg 1068w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/bingo-4-630x420.jpg 630w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/bingo-4.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 389px) 100vw, 389px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  A Virginia Gaming Commission would have regulatory powers over bingo, online gambling, charity gaming, fantasy contests, live horse racing, and the state&#8217;s casinos (Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sole exception under the proposal is the Virginia Lottery, a state agency created in 1987 after a statewide voter referendum, that would remain a separate entity and continue to oversee and regulate the sale of lottery tickets in the commonwealth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As we have gone through the cost-benefit analysis, our team has studied different options, continued stakeholder outreach and working sessions with the agencies, and our team views this option as the best path forward,” Collin Hood, a director at the Virginia-based consulting firm Guidehouse, advised the committee at its meeting in Richmond Wednesday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The target operating model for the Virginia Gaming Commission, Hood added, is an “efficient, cost-effective and strong regulator.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If realized under the proposed plan, the new state agency would be able to respond to new regulatory and oversight needs from emerging gaming types, maintain the state’s commitment to horse racing and charitable gaming industries, increase transparency through centralized annual reporting to the public and the state government, and increase accountability for gaming regulation and oversight. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It would also facilitate a consistent statewide problem gambling strategy across all gaming types and clarify the points of contact for key stakeholders, including Virginia State Police, local law enforcement, state legislators and the industry itself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Change is difficult, but it is the right thing that we need to do to get a handle on it, otherwise everybody is working in different silos,” Sen. Bryce Reeves, R-Spotsylvania and the committee chair, said in an interview after Wednesday’s meeting. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There is internet gaming or electronic gaming that happens in the cloud, and we have three different agencies trying to manage that, so there’s some areas where we can save the state a lot of money.”</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Heading toward $21 billion in wagers</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The plan recommended by Guidehouse, which is drafting various options, “is probably where we’re headed,” Reeves said. “Consolidation is going to help us with enforcement and compliance. If you talk to prosecutors today, they don’t even know what they are looking at.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before Virginia’s anti-gambling stance softened in 2018, about $3.4 billion was wagered on state lottery games, charitable gaming and traditional horse racing — a number that grew steadily as the state approved more ways to gamble. By 2025, when four casinos are expected to be open, total wagering could grow to $21 billion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The JLARC report recommended that the Virginia Lottery should become the primary gambling regulator, noting the agency has already been beefing up its staff to handle sports betting and the four casinos being built around the state. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the Virginia Racing Commission that is in charge of live horse racing and the horse racing-adjacent Rosie’s slots enterprise, doesn’t have the staff to carry out its regulatory mission, the report found. It further concluded the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services — which regulates forms of charitable gaming like bingo, poker and slots-like machines called electronic pull tabs — also doesn’t have the resources to do its job.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The creation of the Virginia Gaming Commission as a head organization would bring together the existing agencies in an effort to provide the state’s response to a rapidly changing industry, Reeves said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ve never voted for gambling, and now I find myself the chairman of the committee, only from the simple fact that this all started from charitable gaming and then finding fraud in it,” he said, referring to findings by a </span><a href="https://studies.virginiageneralassembly.gov/studies/570" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">General Assembly subcommittee</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2021 that showed corruption in the state’s charitable gaming industry was rampant due to inadequate oversight and conflicts of interest.</span></p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We cleaned that up, and everybody learned some hard lessons,” Reeves said. “What we are trying to do here as legislators is that we don’t have the time or bandwidth to monitor all these different gambling institutions, that shouldn’t be our job. In the end we made a policy decision, it’s not a political decision, we are taking politics out of it.”</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">&#8216;A good way to govern&#8217;</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Paul Krizek, D-Fairfax, committee member and an unapologetic critic of legal gaming, applauded the proposed consolidation plan.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re moving judiciously and prudently, and this is a big issue because right now we have a number of different agencies regulating the industry, and they all do it a little bit differently,” Krizek said. “It really needs to be consolidated under one umbrella, that brings expertise and people that know the whole industry.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the current system, legislators like himself don’t have an easy point of contact to go to  with concerns, Krizek said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It ends up being the loudest voices that catch our ear, and really what we need is an expert agency that can vet all of this and make sure that it especially protects the public. And that’s the kind of input that would come from a Virginia Gaming Commission.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the next step, the Guidehouse consultants are tasked with delivering a final report for the committee to vote on at its next meeting in November while lawmakers begin to develop the legislation framework to change the code for the consolidation. The General Assembly would weigh the measure during the 2025 session. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposed two-year roadmap toward the creation of the new state agency would formally begin on July 1. After a successful launch of the Virginia Gaming Commission, lawmakers would reconsider consolidating Virginia Lottery operations under the same roof. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is the first time in 13 years that I have seen us take a proactive approach to government rather than making a cheese sandwich and saying you’ve got to eat it,” Reeves said. “It’s going to allow more people the opportunity to enter the process and to those setting it up a realistic timeline so it’s not so stressful. This is what I would call a good way to govern.”</span></p>

(Photo by Chris duMond/Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One month after announcing her White House bid to succeed President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris holds a slim three-point lead over former President Donald Trump (47-44%) in a head-to-head matchup in Virginia, according to </span><a href="https://roanoke.edu/news/rcpoll/august2024" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a new poll</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> released Tuesday by the Institute for Policy and Opinion Research at Roanoke College. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The vice president also holds a 45-42% advantage when other candidates are included, the poll found. In the U.S. Senate race, Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., leads his Republican challenger, retired U.S. Navy Capt. Hung Cao, by a comfortable 49-38% margin. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new survey is the first Roanoke College Poll that includes Harris as the Democratic party candidate. The vice president formally clinched the Democratic nomination on Aug. 5 — just two weeks after Biden dropped out of the race. Her campaign gave Democrats a slight edge after a </span><a href="https://www.roanoke.edu/news/rc_poll_politics_may_2024" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">previous IPOR poll</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from last spring for the first time found Trump and Biden, then the presumed Democratic nominee, tied in a head-to-head matchup in the commonwealth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The switch from Biden to Harris made a difference in Virginia, but perhaps not as great as some may have thought,” said Harry Wilson, senior political analyst for IPOR and professor emeritus of political science at Roanoke College. “The news for Harris is certainly better than it was for Biden, but her three-point lead is still within the margin of error.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both major party candidates are polling very well within their party, and there is a miniscule number of undecided voters, Wilson added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although only 2% of likely voters say they are undecided in the multi-candidate question, 8% (two-way) to 13% (six-way) say they will vote for someone other than Harris or Trump (Robert Kennedy Jr. polls at 6%; Cornel West and Chase Oliver at 2%; and Jill Stein at 0% in the six-way race). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The party bases remain important, as always. The number who say they will vote third party is declining, and those voters may well determine who wins in Virginia,” Wilson said. “One big takeaway continues to be the chasm between the views of Democrats and Republicans. None of it is new, but it is remarkable that partisans interpret everything through different lenses.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nearly four in five (79%) of likely voters are very certain of their vote choice, and another 18% are somewhat certain, the poll found. More than half (60%) are very enthusiastic about voting, and 25% are somewhat enthusiastic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The economy continues to dominate among the most important issues, being cited by 48% of respondents. Abortion (16%) and immigration (15%) were chosen more frequently than foreign affairs (6%) and crime (4%). Two-thirds (68%) of likely voters plan to vote on Election Day, while 31% say they will vote earlier.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_38028" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:363px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/republican-presidential-candidate-donald-trump-holds-campaign-rally-in-rock-hill-south-carolina/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class=" wp-image-38028" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Getty_Trump_fist-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="363" height="242" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Getty_Trump_fist-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Getty_Trump_fist-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Getty_Trump_fist-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Getty_Trump_fist-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Getty_Trump_fist-2048x1366.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 363px) 100vw, 363px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Republican presidential candidate and former President Donald Trump at a rally in February in South Carolina. Half of the poll respondents said they thought Trump&#8217;s response to <span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the attempted assassination showed toughness.</span> (Win McNamee/Getty Images)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden’s departure from the race has also impacted the campaign and voters’ perceptions. When asked in the new poll about what their votinge plans had been beforeprior to Biden’s withdrawal, respondents gave Trump a six-point lead (although the candidates were tied in the May poll). Some who had planned to vote for other candidates appear to have changed their minds, and 3% said they had not planned to vote in a Biden-Trump matchup.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With 45%, likely voters generally perceive Harris to be more liberal than Biden, with only 16% thinking she is more conservative. Half of the respondents (50%) believe Trump’s immediate response to the attempted assassination last month showed toughness, and nearly as many (44%) see it as an attempt to gain votes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bare majority (51%) believe Trump is a threat to democracy. Slightly fewer (47%) see the Democratic party process of replacing Biden with Harris as such a threat. Slightly more likely voters (56%) see Trump as strong enough to deal with adversaries of the United States, such as President Vladimir Putin of Russia, while less than half (49%) say the same about Harris.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harris’ approval rating is also underwater at 43% favorable and 53% unfavorable, just slightly better than Trump. Both vice presidential candidates are also viewed negatively, with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz sitting at 34% and 51%, and Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, at 32%  and 55%. The U.S. Supreme Court fares slightly better with 45% favorable and 52% unfavorable. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the U.S. Senate race in Virginia, Kaine breaks the negative trend with 50% favorable — tying his all-time high from six years ago — and 41% unfavorable. Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s ratings rose to 54% favorable, which is his best rating during his term, and 40% unfavorable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For its poll, the Institute for Policy and Opinion Research at Roanoke College interviewed 691 likely voters in Virginia between Aug. 12 and 16. The survey has a weighted margin of error of 4.5%.</span></p>
