Dozens of media outlets republished our stories, too, which helped us reach new readers inside and outside the state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year, our readers were especially hungry to learn more about blue catfish and the invasive species&#8217; culinary potential, the state&#8217;s most stately trees and why preserving them is vital, a local school board that made history as the first in the nation to re-name schools after Confederate figures and another that sued a special needs student&#8217;s parent for $600,000. Here&#8217;s a recap of those stories and our other most-read reports and commentary of 2024.</span></p>

<p><strong>From the story: </strong>Proud and satisfied, or sad and embarrassed. However citizens of the commonwealth view Shenandoah County School Board’s recent decision, Virginia appears to be the first in the nation to restore Confederate school names, after years of vigorous community engagement, a controversial renaming process, and a change in board priorities related to race, diversity and inclusion. <strong><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/20/virginia-school-board-restores-confederate-names/">Read more.</a></strong></p>

<p><strong>From the story:</strong> Of the roughly 2 million Virginians who’d been enrolled in Medicaid before the COVID-19 pandemic, over 480,000 of them have been disenrolled as of this August. Typically eligibility determinations are made annually, but they’d been on pause nationwide amid the pandemic due to federal policy. That’s changed over the past year in what’s colloquially referred to as “Medicaid Unwinding” as provisions of federal law have expired. <em><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/nearly-500000-virginians-in-medicaid-have-been-disenrolled/"><strong>Read more.</strong></a></em></p>

Last Monday, Youngkin awarded a $250,000 grant to Sea Farms, a family-owned and -operated aquaculture and seafood processing business with operations in Gloucester and Mathews counties, that among other uses will pay for a blast freezer that will increase the amount of blue catfish the company can buy and sell. </span><em><strong><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/02/05/blue-catfish-are-invasive-in-virginia-the-state-is-paying-to-get-more-of-them-on-peoples-tables/">Read more.</a></strong></em></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>From the story:</strong> Virginia could soon make history as the home of the world’s first nuclear fusion power plant, state officials and private sector leaders announced Tuesday. Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS), a fusion power company founded in 2018 in Cambridge, Mass., unveiled plans to build the groundbreaking facility on a 100-acre site at James River Industrial Park in Chesterfield County. The plant, expected to generate 400 megawatts of electricity — enough to power 150,000 homes — could be operational by the early 2030s. </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/12/18/virginia-to-host-worlds-first-fusion-power-plant/"><b>Read more.</b></a></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>From the column:</strong> Data centers are making the transition (to zero-carbon energy sources) harder, but so is local resistance to building solar. General Assembly members mostly understand the connection, leading to a lively debate in last year’s legislative session over whether to override some local permit denials for solar projects – and if so, how to ensure the localities still have some say. Though none of the legislative proposals moved forward last year, the topic has become a central one for the recently revamped Commission on Electric Utility Regulation (CEUR). </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/12/03/data-centers-approved-solar-farms-rejected-what-is-going-on-in-rural-virginia/"><b>Read more.</b></a></p>

(Getty Images)</p><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the less noticed features of the Virginia Way is the long-running tendency of the commonwealth’s leaders to conduct their decision-making behind closed doors. While the </span></i><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacodepopularnames/virginia-freedom-of-information-act/" target="_blank"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Freedom of Information Act</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> presumes all government business is by default public and requires officials to justify why exceptions should be made, too many Virginia leaders in practice take the opposite stance, acting as if records are by default private and the public must prove they should be handled otherwise.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this feature, we aim to highlight the frequency with which officials around Virginia are resisting public access to records on issues large and small — and note instances when the release of information under FOIA gave the public insight into how government bodies are operating.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the sudden resignation of University of Virginia basketball coach Tony Bennett in October, Lee Enterprises sports editor Matthew Kiewiet filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request seeking details about the matter. The university failed to fulfill the request until Dec. 18 — 40 business days after it was filed, a clear violation of state FOIA laws. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under Virginia law, public institutions must respond to FOIA requests within five business days, with an option to extend by seven additional business days if necessary. If a request is denied, institutions are required to cite specific state code exemptions and describe the withheld materials.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kiewiet, sports editor for Lee Enterprises, which owns the Richmond Times-Dispatch, had requested correspondence between Bennett and the university concerning a memorandum of understanding that had previously been described as a “signed contract.” Bennett, who led the Cavaliers for 15 seasons, including their 2019 National Championship win, announced his immediate departure in October.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now reviewing the records he finally received, Kiewiet described UVa’s FOIA process as “obnoxiously tedious.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe some folks have had better luck than me, but I haven’t heard glowing reviews from others,” he told The Mercury &#8220;They charge astronomical prices, which I am aware is legal, for their public records, and in this instance they didn’t seem especially eager to hand over what I requested.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The university waived the fees for Kiewiet’s request, a gesture he dismissed as inconsequential. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">”Whoopty doo,” he said.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Former Culpeper Sheriff Scott Jenkins convicted in federal bribery scheme</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scott Jenkins, a former Culpeper, has been convicted on federal bribery and fraud charges after being accused of deputizing wealthy civilians who paid tens of thousands of dollars for badges. Key testimony in the case came from Jenkins’ former aide, Kevin Rychlik, who alerted the FBI to  the scheme and secretly recorded hours of conversations that became a cornerstone of the prosecution’s case. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the trial, Rychlik testified that in 2011 he gave Jenkins a $5,000 donation in exchange for an auxiliary deputy badge, </span><a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/investigations/culpeper-ex-sheriffs-longtime-aide-testifies-against-him/3794176/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NBC 4 reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The badge granted him the same rights as a sworn deputy. Rychlik also told the jury that he later became a campaign fundraiser for Jenkins and witnessed money and badges exchanged with others. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After being investigated for unpaid taxes, Rychlik became an FBI informant and tipped off authorities about Jenkins’ scheme. Prosecutors revealed that Rychlik recorded meetings with Jenkins as part of the investigation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Payments to Jenkins reportedly ranged from $5,000 to $25,000, with funds going to Jenkins’ re-election campaigns or being pocketed personally, according to </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/12/18/scott-jenkins-convicted-culpeper-sheriff/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Washington Post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jenkins is scheduled to be sentenced  in March of next year. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">King George Board of Supervisors wants to ‘eliminate restrictions’ on meetings</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The King George Board of Supervisors is asking the General Assembly to revisit state laws governing public meeting requirements, aiming to ease restrictions on how members can convene. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At a recent meeting, the board </span><a href="https://www.kinggeorgecountyva.gov/DocumentCenter/View/14412/121724--KGCBOS-Legislative-Summary-Resolution" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">outlined</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> legislative priorities for the state government, including a request to “eliminate restrictions on the Board of Supervisors’ meeting capabilities,” </span><a href="https://substack.com/home/post/p-153269168" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FXBG Advance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reported. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under Virginia law, any gathering of three or more members to discuss government matters must be advertised as a public meeting, with details on how the public can attend. This applies to both in-person and electronic meetings, such as those held over Zoom. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, a 2004 </span><a href="https://www.opengovva.org/foi-opinions/beck" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Supreme Court decision</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ruled that email exchanges between members do not constitute a public meeting, provided the communications are not simultaneous. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have you experienced local or state officials denying or delaying your FOIA request? Tell us about it: </span></i><a href="mailto:info@virginiamercury.com"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">info@virginiamercury.com</span></i></a></p>
<p><em>Editor&#8217;s note:</em> This story was corrected on Dec. 23 to reflect that the King George Board of Supervisors, not Prince George, wants to eliminate restrictions on meetings.</p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this feature, we aim to highlight the frequency with which officials around Virginia are resisting public access to records on issues large and small — and note instances when the release of information under FOIA gave the public insight into how government bodies are operating. </span></i></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Video of Illinois police officer’s DUI arrest in Virginia likely to remain private</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Efforts to obtain video footage of an Illinois police official’s DUI arrest in Virginia have been repeatedly denied, despite multiple public records requests, the national news network Patch </span><a href="https://patch.com/illinois/burrridge/burr-ridge-cops-arrest-video-kept-secret-virginia" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported Wednesday</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ryan Husarik, formerly the deputy police chief of Burr Ridge, Illinois, was arrested on April 15 in Northern Virginia while attending the FBI National Academy. He was driving a police car with a reported blood-alcohol level 2.5 times the legal limit, according to Virginia State Police.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But despite multiple public records requests since April, Patch has been unable to obtain the video.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Burr Ridge Police released the Virginia police report obtained through an internal investigation but declined to release the video footage, citing an Illinois law that exempts records related to a public body&#8217;s adjudication of employee discipline. Had the arrest occurred in Illinois, the video would likely have been subject to the state’s Freedom of Information Act.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Patch then requested the video from Virginia State Police, but the agency denied access, stating the footage was part of a closed criminal investigation. Virginia’s public records law, which is more restrictive than Illinois’, allows police to withhold such materials at their discretion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, a Patch reporter in Virginia filed a similar request, as Virginia’s public records law sometimes grants greater access to state residents. However, Virginia State Police again denied the request, citing the closed case exemption. The agency stated that its decision applied to all related documents, including the police report.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Megan Rhyne, executive director of the Virginia Coalition for Open Government, told Patch that the law does not prohibit the release of the video but allows police discretion in withholding it. “The only way to pry it loose after repeated denials that are unfortunately allowed under existing law is to challenge the denial in court,” Rhyne said in an email to Patch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The video could provide insight into whether Husarik invoked his status as a police officer during the arrest. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the incident, Husarik, who was earning $150,000 annually at the time, was suspended for 40 days without pay until July 26. He was later demoted to sergeant. </span></p>

<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">UVA Audit Committee reviews health system oversight amid employee allegations</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The University of Virginia’s Board of Visitors Audit, Compliance, and Risk Committee has reviewed its 2024 fiscal audit, focusing on financial oversight at the UVA Medical Center and ongoing investigations into leadership misconduct allegations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The session was mostly closed to the public, with members consulting Washington, D.C.-based legal firm Williams &amp; Connolly, </span><a href="https://www.cavalierdaily.com/article/2024/12/audit-compliance-and-risk-committee-reviews-school-of-medicine-investigation" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to a report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by The Cavalier Daily, the university’s newspaper. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The committee is investigating claims from 128 employees of the UVA Physicians Group, who accused UVA Health CEO Craig Kent and School of Medicine Dean Melina Kibbe of administrative misconduct.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Financially, the university&#8217;s net position rose by $757 million, driven by a $403 million increase in patient services and $593.5 million in investment income. Vice President for Finance Augie Maurelli highlighted a 50% reduction in unresolved audit “management points” from last year, with three new points bringing the current total to six.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">David Rasnic, director of higher education audit programs, discussed financial control issues at the Medical Center stemming from the 2021 acquisition of UVA Community Health. He cited a “historic [structure] of inadequate design controls,” adding that “a lack of supporting documentation paired with management override of controls create risks for error and fraud.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rasnic further revealed that the Medical Center failed to reconcile bank statements for nine months, resulting in $30 million in overpayments and $60 million in unrecorded wire transfers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The audit recommended improved oversight of service providers, stronger interdepartmental communications, better student loan reporting, and enhanced firewall security. It also highlighted the creation of UVA’s first Director of Privacy Programs, set to be hired in early 2025.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ongoing audits include an NCAA-mandated review of intercollegiate athletics revenue and expense reporting, expected by February 2025, as well as the inclusion of UVA’s financial aid audit in Virginia’s broader Single Audit review of federal fund use.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Audit Committee will reconvene at the next Board of Visitors meeting in March.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Misconduct probe prompts mandatory training for Hanover High baseball team</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hanover County Public Schools (HCPS) has completed its investigation into reports of misconduct within the Hanover High baseball program, which remains suspended. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Wednesday, HCPS announced that mandatory training for players and coaches would take place as part of efforts to address the issues, the Richmond Times-Dispatch </span><a href="https://richmond.com/sports/high-school/baseball/hanover-high-school-baseball-program-misconduct-investigation-hawks/article_a8dd668e-b81c-11ef-85fc-ef3994bd4061.html#tracking-source=home-top-story" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">HCPS spokesperson Chris Whitley confirmed that the investigation was “comprehensive” but said specific details, including any disciplinary action or the job status of coach Tyler Kane, could not be shared due to privacy laws. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a letter to families and staff, HCPS outlined three key areas for improvement: increased supervision, clearer communication of expectations, and additional training. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To support this, the program will collaborate with A Better Way Athletics, a third-party vendor specializing in athletics management. The organization will provide required training for all players and coaches, with any team member or coach who misses the initial session required to complete it before resuming activities. “The training from A Better Way Athletics will support our efforts to help ensure that the program is one where all students feel safe, respected, and supported,” Whitley said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Better Way Athletics, based in North Chesterfield, offers courses on topics like managing conflict and engaging officials, aiming to “minimize risk,” “create alignment,” and “cultivate growth.” Clients include schools from across the U.S.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the training, HCPS expects to resume off-season baseball activities after winter break, which runs from Dec. 23 to Jan. 3, according to The Times-Dispatch. Whitley said that no school-sanctioned practices have occurred during the suspension.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Hanover County Sheriff’s Office confirmed it received a report in October related to the investigation but did not pursue it as the family involved did not want law enforcement involvement. “It is a school matter and has nothing to do with the Sheriff&#8217;s Office,” said Sgt. Steven Wills.”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this feature, we aim to highlight the frequency with which officials around Virginia are resisting public access to records on issues large and small — and note instances when the release of information under FOIA gave the public insight into how government bodies are operating. </span></i></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Records show policy campus demonstration discussions at VCU, attorney general involvement</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year, several demonstrations by university students in response to the Israel-Hamas conflict led Virginia higher education institutions to change their policies on protests and free speech, according to records obtained by </span><a href="https://www.vpm.org/news/2024-12-04/vcu-protests-gaza-israel-hamas-war-policy" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">VPM</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> News.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the Oct. 7, 2023 attacks by Hamas on Israeli towns near the Gaza Strip that left over 1,200 dead, VCU Health Workers and Medical students started holding weekly vigils in November 2023, displaying posters to memorialize health care workers killed by the Israel Defense Force. It’s estimated that over 41,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli military attacks in Gaza since then, </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-one-year-anniversary-cf123f95609051e8e8eaf6aebe661b6a" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to The Associated Press.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In January of this year, a VCU employee wrote the School of Medicine’s senior associate dean for DEI over concerns the posters’ “messaging itself may get worse over time,” and asked, “&#8230; do we have a clear policy of what can and can&#8217;t be posted on VCU property/ School of Medicine buildings?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was no policy at the time, but the school adopted a policy in mid-February because of “pre-scheduled facilities maintenance,” ahead of an accreditation visit, a spokesperson told VPM News. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Organizers of the vigil say staff told them to remove the materials because of a scheduled powerwash, but emails VPM obtained show the school’s operation manager saying Jan. 30 that the wash could wait until Spring and provide time to formulate a policy. The school’s chief of staff said not to cancel the wash, though, as the wall was still under discussion with senior leaders. Records show the wash happened Feb. 15.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then on April 29, hundreds of VCU students rallied  in support of Palestinians and chanted anti-war slogans, prompting a response from law enforcement, including VCU Police, city of Richmond Police and Virginia State Police.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The students were told to disperse 13 minutes after police arrived, and the situation escalated quickly. “Richmond Police sprayed protesters with pepper spray, VCU Police corralled isolated protesters from the crowd and restrained them with </span><a href="https://www.vpm.org/news/2024-05-01/vcu-israel-palestine-protest-student-discipline-arrests" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cable ties</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” VPM News reported.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another email VPM acquired via FOIA request showed that, as tent demonstrations began appearing at universities and colleges across the country this spring, the office of Attorney General Jason Miyares wrote an email to Education Secretary Aimee Guidera on April 26, prior to the VCU rally, saying the office would “vigorously” defend Virginia schools’ authority to ban tents and take them down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/04/29/youngkin-says-no-encampments-on-virginia-campuses-supports-peaceful-protests/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">affirmed that stance </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">on April 28, saying on CNN he had been working with Miyares to “make sure if there are protests, they are peaceful.” Records requests for communications between the OAG and Youngkin were not provided to VPM News because of attorney-client privilege and a “working papers” exemption. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VCU changed its policy on gatherings in the hours after the April 29 rally. Emails VPM News obtained show how edits to the policy happened, but don’t clearly state who directed the changes. The school withheld over 30 emails from the news outlet, citing attorney-client privilege and a school records exemption. </span></p>

<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Convicted former Norfolk detective still gets pension</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A former Norfolk detective who was convicted and served 10 years in federal prison for extortion and conspiracy offenses, and lying about it to the FBI, appears to still be getting his pension, records obtained by Richmond TV news station </span><a href="https://www.wric.com/news/taking-action/corrupt-ex-norfolk-detective-got-city-pension-during-prison-and-still-is-records-suggest/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">WRIC </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">show.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Dec. 4, the station reported that it had requested records for any retirement benefit payments to the former detective, Robert Glenn Ford, from the month before he was sentenced in 2011 until Nov. 1. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A city FOIA analyst responded by saying the locality had 178 records of retirement pay stubs, but they were exempt from release. The number lines up with Norfolk police retirees’ monthly pension checks and the number of months the FOIA request spanned, also 178. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In </span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2011/03/17/convicted-norfolk-detective-ford-pleads-indigence/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2011</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the Virginian-Pilot reported Ford was making more than $3,000 a month from his pension as he appealed the federal case.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ford was sentenced after being involved with several crimes that include one request to a Norfolk man convicted of murder for $10,000 in exchange for making the case go away. When he didn’t get it, according to a UVA law clinic, Ford “coerced witnesses and found unreliable snitches to build a case against an innocent man.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The man Ford requested the bribe from, Kevin “Suge” Knight, was pardoned by former Gov. Ralph Nathoam, who noted that the man “was prosecuted based on the work of Norfolk Detective Glenn Ford, who used his official capacity to extort witnesses in order to yield high solvability percentages and was eventually convicted on federal charges.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to WRIC’s review of Norfolk’s code sections on the Norfolk Employees’ Retirement System, which is closed to new members, no provision exists for benefits to be revoked or forfeited following a conviction. Several Norfolk city employees are covered under the Virginia Retirement system, which does allow for the loss of benefits after a felony conviction related to their position.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The chairman of Norfolk’s police union told WRIC he wasn’t aware of the specific circumstances Ford fell under, but that retirees under NERS get retirement pay “no matter what happens after that.” City officials did not respond to questions from WRIC about its retirement system and records on Ford’s retirement pay.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ford declined to provide a comment to WRIC. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Fired Shenandoah County deputy recertified after FOIA-exempt hearing</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Criminal Justice Services Board last month </span><a href="https://www.nvdaily.com/nvdaily/state-panel-recertifies-shenandoah-county-deputy-fired-after-crash-investigation/article_26f3da07-bd2c-5ec1-8dd7-180eebbd8cfb.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recertified</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a Shenandoah County sheriff’s deputy, who was fired for how he handled a drunk driving incident, in a hearing that a recently-changed FOIA law allowed to be held behind closed doors, according to the Northern Virginia Daily.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shenandoah County Sheriff Timothy Carter fired Jacob Unger earlier this year after Unger responded to an April 5 traffic crash that involved a person who Carter said appeared to be a friend of Unger’s, who drove into a barn while intoxicated, the NV Daily </span><a href="https://www.nvdaily.com/nvdaily/shenandoah-county-deputy-sheriff-fired-over-handling-of-crash/article_c82d6110-dea7-56a0-8839-9b8464115fe8.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Unger had given the driver a preliminary breath test showing his blood alcohol content was above the .08 legal limit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unger’s body-worn camera footage shows him relaying that message to the driver, and then ended. Unger gave the driver a court summons for a reckless driving violation during the response.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unger used the incorrect code section on the summons, and when the driver returned to the sheriff’s office to get it corrected, the summons was “destroyed,” Carter told the NV Daily, “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and no subsequent charge (was) attempted by the deputy in regard to the reckless driving charge.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Nov. 21 and after a closed door hearing, the board unanimously approved of Unger’s appeal of the decertification Carter issued. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The decertification process, </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/08/08/statewide-police-conduct-standards-will-soon-be-enforceable-almost-two-years-after-law-passed/#:~:text=But%20the%202020%20law%2C%20which,their%20credibility%2C%20integrity%20or%20honesty."><span style="font-weight: 400;">expanded</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the Democratic-controlled Virginia legislature in 2020, prevents poorly performing officers from being fired and then hired by different departments. On July 1, a change to the Freedom of Information Act law allowed the board to hold the hearing privately, before coming out into a public session to take official action.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It totally vindicated my client and the wrongful things that the sheriff said about him and accused him of,” said attorney David Silek, who represented Unger and said his client was punished for doing what his superior officers told him to do. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carter, who disciplined Unger’s supervisor, gave no comment to the NV Daily in response to the recertification.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Loudoun County School Board vice chair still OK with no cameras during public comment</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Loudoun County School Board vice chairman is standing by his vote to turn off cameras during public comment periods at board meetings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WJLA reporter Nick Minock </span><a href="https://wjla.com/news/local/loudoun-county-school-board-member-meeting-shut-off-camera-despite-transparency-pledge-vice-chair-arben-istref-sam-nandi-public-comments-parenst-comment-controversey" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">asked</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> vice chair Arben Istrefi on Dec. 2 if he regretted his March vote, to which Ostrefi responded, “I don’t.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think that, you know, we&#8217;re still allowing everyone to come and speak,” Istrefi answered. “I think it&#8217;s really important that we do focus on trust and transparency.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In </span><a href="https://wjla.com/news/local/loudoun-county-public-schools-turn-off-cameras-during-public-comment-community-meetings-lcps-school-board-education-students-parents-virginia-governor-glenn-youngkin" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">March</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the school board voted 6-3 to turn off recording cameras, but keep audio, during the public comment portion of their meeting, after members of the county’s Muslim, Christian and Hindu community previously spoke out against the district&#8217;s policy on bathrooms and lockers. The policy allows students to choose which rooms they use at school based on their gender identity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One member of the school board, Sumera Rashid, voted in favor of the motion to turn off the cameras to “avoid a Jerry Springer show,” and board chair Melinda Mansfield said she was “not interested in political grandstanding,” according to WJLA’s reporting. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But another member, Deana Griffith, who attempted to have the cameras turned back on, disagreed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Directing a camera towards a public speaker helps capture and relay their message effectively enabling remote viewers to access the content,” Griffith said.</span></p>

(Getty Images)</p><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the less noticed features of the Virginia Way is the long-running tendency of the commonwealth’s leaders to conduct their decision-making behind closed doors. While the </span></i><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacodepopularnames/virginia-freedom-of-information-act/" target="_blank"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Freedom of Information Act</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> presumes all government business is by default public and requires officials to justify why exceptions should be made, too many Virginia leaders in practice take the opposite stance, acting as if records are by default private and the public must prove they should be handled otherwise.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this feature, we aim to highlight the frequency with which officials around Virginia are resisting public access to records on issues large and small — and note instances when the release of information under FOIA gave the public insight into how government bodies are operating.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Louisa resident raises awareness about advertising requirement for county meetings</h4>

	</strong></p>
	<div class="newsroomSidebarContainer ">
	<div class="newsroomSidebar"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Mercury’s efforts to track FOIA and other transparency cases in Virginia are indebted to the work of the </span><a href="https://www.opengovva.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Coalition for Open Government</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a nonprofit alliance dedicated to expanding access to government records, meetings and other state and local proceedings. </span></div>
	</div>
	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Louisa County resident and her local government are not seeing eye to eye when it comes to advertising  local meetings. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tammy Purcell, a Louisa resident, posted her frustrations on </span><a href="https://x.com/docpurcell/status/1857174570131767405" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">social media</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with some meetings not being advertised on Nov. 14.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am so tired of the Louisa County Board of Supervisors holding committee meetings and not advertising them as required by VFOIA,” Purcell posted on X. “I have raised this issue privately with members of the board and the county administrator yet it has made no difference. Do public business in public.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Louisa does advertise meetings for the Board of Supervisors and some other related groups, Purcell challenges  whether officials are meeting state law that requires the locality to advertise all of its meetings, including those with only two supervisors instead of the full body, or one with county residents appointed by the board or local government leaders such as the mayor or an administrator.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cindy King, a spokeswoman for Louisa County, said the county follows </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title15.2/chapter14/section15.2-1411/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">state law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when forming advisory boards, committees and commissions. As stated, the “governing body of any locality” is responsible for the appointments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">King also said the county advertises meetings, in accordance with </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title2.2/chapter37/section2.2-3707/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">state law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, on the county website, county office building and/or in the newspaper, and said residents can contact the county to confirm meeting dates and times. She did not directly respond to whether the county believes it should advertise committee meetings with only two supervisors and non-board members.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Megan Rhyne, executive director for Virginia Coalition for Open Government, said any committee created by the full public body, even with only two members, is subject to the Freedom of Information notice requirements. However, some committees could fall outside of the FOIA notice requirements if a committee is formed by an individual such as an executive or administrator. Whatever the scenario, Rhyne said, the goal should be enhancing, not restricting, transparency with the public. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you&#8217;re trying to set up ways to avoid having to have your meetings in public, that, to me, is a recipe for breeding mistrust,” Rhyne said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Purcell said since her X post,  she has seen improvements on Louisa&#8217;s part to advertise public meetings. Duane Adams, chair of the Louisa County Board of supervisors, even </span><a href="https://x.com/DuaneAdamsVA/status/1857205946746867804" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">shared</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a weekly lineup of meetings with Purcell in response.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Transparency and open government are at the top of my priority list,” said Purcell, “And I want that to be a priority for everyone in all forms of government.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Long-withheld report on UVA shooting expected by February</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The University of Virginia will release a highly anticipated report into the 2022 slaying of three student athletes by a former student who this week pleaded guilty to murder in the case as early as February, officials said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Albemarle County Circuit Court Judge Cheryl Higgins accepted accused shooter 25-year-old Christopher Darnell Jones Jr. plea of guilt on Wednesday and scheduled his sentencing for February 4.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the days following the Nov. 13, 2022 shooting, UVA officials </span><a href="https://files.constantcontact.com/d3e83e11901/3661950d-9b8c-49ed-8c61-e2c5cfa9efc5.pdf?rdr=true" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">requested</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the Office of the Commonwealth’s Attorney to conduct an independent review of the university’s response to the incident and its previous efforts to assess the potential threat Jones, a former student and UVA football player, posed to the community. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UVA also requested special counsel to review all relevant university policies and procedures and make recommendations for improvement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After receiving confirmation that the special counsel had completed the report, university officials </span><a href="https://news.virginia.edu/content/citing-potential-impact-criminal-trial-uva-delays-nov-13-report-release" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">delayed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> publishing it in what officials said was an effort to prevent it influencing the trial.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Making the reports public at this time, or even releasing a summary of their findings and recommendations, could have an impact on the criminal trial of the accused, either by disrupting the case being prepared by the Albemarle County Commonwealth’s Attorney, or by interfering with the defendant’s right to a fair trial before an impartial jury,” University of Virginia President Jim Ryan said in a statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Wednesday, Jones pleaded guilty to three charges of first-degree murder, two charges of malicious wounding and five firearms charges at the Albemarle County Circuit Court, the </span><a href="https://dailyprogress.com/news/local/crime-courts/uva-shooter-pleads-guilty-to-murder/article_0621a19e-a773-11ef-9718-472b1605c6c0.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Daily Press</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reported. Prosecutors charged Jones and alleged he was responsible for shooting five students on a charter bus when they returned to the campus from a field trip to Washington, D.C. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Three of the students — Devin Chandler, Lavel Davis Jr. and D’Sean Perry — were football players, all of whom died. Mike Hollins, a teammate, and Marlee Morgan, a second-year student with the team, were wounded and survived.          </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Uncertainty around Richmond elections office investigation report</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The city of Richmond&#8217;s Inspector General James Osuna is facing claims that his office has “stonewalled” an official’s attempts to learn more about the investigation into the city&#8217;s elections office over claims of improper spending and nepotism against General Registrar Keith Balmer, according to a </span><a href="https://www.wric.com/news/local-news/richmond/electoral-board-chair-feels-stonewalled-on-request-for-inspector-general-report-on-richmonds-election-office/?utm_source=t.co&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow&amp;utm_medium=referral" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">WRIC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> report.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Starlet Stevens, chairwoman of the Richmond Electoral Board, said in a statement to WRIC that, to her understanding, the investigation was completed in the late summer and was under review by the city’s legal department. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stevens said she contacted Osuna who told her the office wanted to wait to release the report until after the Nov. 5 election. Weeks after the election, she said she has yet to receive a response  about the status of the investigation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s safe to say I’m being ‘stonewalled,’” Stevens wrote to WRIC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Osuna told WRIC that the report “has not been issued at this time,” but he failed to respond to questions of whether the office had completed the report.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stevens is seeking the removal of Balmer, who declined to comment on WRIC’s story.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richmond suspended the purchasing credit cards of Balmer and Jerry Richardson, deputy registrar, after the city found that they violated the city’s purchase </span><a href="https://www.rva.gov/procurement-services/supplier-portal" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">card program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for qualifying small purchases. According to the city, the program “allows payments to be made promptly, eliminates problems with delayed or lost payments, and reduces the overall processing requirements for transactions under $10,000.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Between April 15, 2021 and May 1, 2024, cards belonging to Balmer and Richardson showed purchases on art, hotel stays, furniture, food, ammunition, shoes and clothes, according to WRIC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, records show that the two also spent more than $11,000 collectively on hotel stays, primarily at The Hotel Roanoke and Conference Center in August of that year.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this feature, we aim to highlight the frequency with which officials around Virginia are resisting public access to records on issues large and small — and note instances when the release of information under FOIA gave the public insight into how government bodies are operating.</span></i></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">PETA threatened litigation when George Mason University delayed sending records</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Foundation (PETA) filed a Freedom of Information Act request stemming from George Mason University </span><a href="https://www.peta.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2023-04-27-gmu-olaw-case-f.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">suggesting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that expired antibiotics had been used for animal experiment surgeries. After initially being quoted for the veterinary records, incident reports and photographs sought and sending a check, PETA didn’t hear from the university for much of this year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GMU’s student newspaper, </span><a href="https://gmufourthestate.com/2024/11/08/peta-threatens-litigation-against-gmu-for-unsent-foia-documents/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Fourth Estate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, reported that PETA threatened a lawsuit if GMU failed to send records by Nov. 15 — eight months after they’d paid for their request and well beyond state law’s guidelines to respond. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As a GMU alum from the Class of 1984, I’m deeply dismayed by GMU’s conduct in this matter,” wrote PETA’s chief legal officer and GMU alum Jeffrey Kerr in a </span><a href="https://www.peta.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/11.1.24-GMU-Demand-Letter.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">letter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the university. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Catie Cryar, a media relations manager at PETA, confirmed to The Mercury that records have since been received, but the organization is still mulling a suit over the FOIA violation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paul Allvin, the university’s vice president and chief brand officer, attributed the delay to an internal communication breakdown, the Fourth Estate reported. The former FOIA officer hadn’t been notified of the receipt of the check.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We screwed this one up,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Allvin added that further delay ensued as the university was redacting private information, and that the FOIA office has changed the way notifications occur when payments come in for requests. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span>All options are on the table to protect our rights to receive public records,<span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span> Cryar said in an email. <span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span>Most importantly, GMU must modernize its research program and stop caging, cutting up, and killing animals in useless experiments.<span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Online newspaper ARLNow to publish public notices</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arlington and Falls Church residents will soon be able to find public notices published in an online-only local newspaper that serves them. ARLNow </span><a href="https://www.arlnow.com/2024/11/12/arlnow-receives-court-authorization-to-publish-legal-notices/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced the news</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on its site this week. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A circuit court judge approved the company’s petition last month, which stems from enactment of a new state law from earlier this year that allows online-only news sites to publish legal notices. Historically, those have been posted in print newspapers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As some legacy print media has no longer served portions of the state, online-only outlets have sprung up in recent years to bolster local news coverage. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Public notices, also called legal notices, are paid advertising placements that are required by state law to be published in local media for certain actions. Examples can include proposed zoning changes or ordinances that will have public comment hearings people need to know about in advance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia became the first state in the nation to allow these newer forms of media to publish public notices after bills cleared the legislature with </span><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB157" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bipartisan support</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and went on to be signed by Gov. Glenn Youngkin. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">	<div class="newsroomSidebarContainer ">
	<div class="newsroomSidebar">The Mercury’s efforts to track FOIA and other transparency cases in Virginia are indebted to the work of the </span><a href="https://www.opengovva.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Coalition for Open Government</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a nonprofit alliance dedicated to expanding access to government records, meetings and other state and local proceedings.</div>
	</div>
	</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Lynchburg police department to begin encrypting radio transmissions</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Lynchburg Police Department </span><a href="https://www.lynchburgvapolice.gov/news-updates/lpd-to-encrypt-radio-communications/#:~:text=LPD%20will%20be%20conducting%20a,transition%20to%20this%20new%20system." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Wednesday that it plans to begin encrypting its radio transmissions. According to a news release,the goals include “protecting sensitive information,” “preventing real-time monitoring by criminals,” “securing tactical operations and officer safety,” and “evolving with technical advancements.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The release also mentioned a “commitment to public transparency” which will entail launching a tool for accessing some dispatch information. This means members of the public will still be able to see a list of current calls and a map with their approximate locations. Though that information will be much less revelatory than being able to listen to a police scanner.</span></p>

    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Pulled fire alarm at Arlington, Va. precinct didn’t disrupt voting, Beals says</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following issues with some ballots in Richmond and Chesterfield earlier in the day, in a 9 p.m. update Tuesday evening Virginia’s top election officials reported just one other hiccup: a pulled fire alarm that prompted the evacuation of an Arlington County polling location, but didn’t prevent anyone from voting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the 6 p.m. hour, the alarm was pulled at  Arlington Precinct 150, the Crystal Plaza polling place,  Virginia Elections Commissioner Susan Beals told reporters in the third and final press briefing of the day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They evacuated the building and they continued voting outside,” Beals said. “Their voters continued voting through 7 o’clock, and then they closed the polls.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some colleges and universities, Beals said, faced longer lines, but “we have checked with all of those registrars, and they have indicated to us that all of those students have been served. There currently are no lines, (or) anyone else waiting to be served in those areas.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia did not receive any bomb threats, Beals said, following a news </span><a href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/press-releases/fbi-statement-on-bomb-threats-to-polling-locations" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">release</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the Federal Bureau of Investigation stating several states had received them. The origins of those threats were traced back to Russian email domains, the release said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As results continued to trickle in Tuesday evening, Beals also laid out the next steps in the counting process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wednesday morning, officials will double check the results from machines and begin reviewing provisional ballots from </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/05/va-college-voting-bloc-utilizes-same-day-registration-shares-top-policy-issues/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">same day registrations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which were counted at 15,000 to 17,000, as of Tuesday morning. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After provisional ballots are cast, identification of the voters must be validated by 10 a.m. on Friday. Local electoral boards will be meeting next week to finalize whether all their provisional ballots will be counted or not, Beals said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Localities have until Friday, Nov. 15 to report their results to the state Board of Election, which will then determine on Monday, Nov. 18 which congressional race will receive an audit, a procedure to make sure votes were counted accurately. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re going to have two post election auditions during the week of Nov. 18,” said Beals. “One, the U.S. Senate race will receive a risk-limiting audit that every locality across the state is going to participate in. And then two, one congressional district is going to be chosen at random to also have a risk-limiting audit.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dec. 17 is when Virginia will convene its electoral college, when electors will meet and vote for the president and vice president, Beals continued. Their certificates will be sent to Congress and  counted on Jan. 6, and the president will be inaugurated on Jan. 20, Beals said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beals also expressed gratitude to poll workers statewide.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I would like to reiterate my thanks to the hundreds of poll workers across Virginia who helped their fellow Virginians vote today,” Beals said. “We could not have done it without you.”</span></p>

<p><strong>6:25 p.m.:</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid the backdrop of a contentious presidential election, voting appeared to go smoothly in Virginia on Tuesday as people cast their ballots in federal and local elections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though early voting </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/early-voting-in-virginia-dips-below-2020-levels-as-parties-push-for-final-turnout-surge/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">dropped</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this year from the last presidential cycle — which also happened at a height of the COVID-19 pandemic where people were avoiding large crowds — some jurisdictions have shared that they’ve experienced </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/05/live-updates-election-day-in-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">long lines and high turnout </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">or substantial use of </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/05/va-college-voting-bloc-utilizes-same-day-registration-shares-top-policy-issues/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">same-day</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> voter registration this year. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A couple of snags were detected in Richmond and Chesterfield early in the day, though both were resolved quickly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Richmond, 11 people at an East End precinct had been given ballots that only included federal elections rather than both federal and local contests.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Unfortunately,” Richmond registrar Keith Balmer said, those voters won’t be able to weigh in on local contests. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Balmer said the city’s electoral board held an emergency meeting to vote to remove the precinct chief. A member of his staff oversaw voting for the rest of the day and no other issues have been reported. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The federal-only ballots were intended for military and overseas voters who can vote in federal elections, but can’t vote in local jurisdictions because they don’t live there and aren’t part of the local tax base, Balmer explained. These ballots are typically used for absentee voting, but Balmer said that a small number are still on hand at local polling places because that voter demographic does sometimes show up to vote in person. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was those ballots that were mistakenly handed to people when Precinct 310 opened at 6 a.m. Balmer said that because those people have already voted, there’s nothing that can be done to change that. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Once we put their ballot in the machine — even though it’s clear as day that they were given the wrong ballot — there’s no do-overs unfortunately,” Balmer said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Chesterfield County briefly experienced jammed ballot scanners at “a handful of precincts,” registrar Missy Vera said in a release. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The scanners are used to accept printed ballots and she attributed the issue to “ink levels </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">of a specific batch of ballots that were printed by a state-affiliated vendor.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To resolve the matter, poll workers were instructed to not use the specific batch of blank ballots that had been identified as the source of the issue. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She added that the jamming issues “are not slowing the voting process” and that the unused ballots that had been the source of the jamming issue wouldn’t  be used going forward.</span></p>
<p><b>5:25 p.m.:</b></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Richmond precinct chief dismissed after handing out the wrong ballots</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A precinct chief in Richmond’s Precinct 310 was dismissed and replaced on Tuesday after an error resulted in 11 voters receiving the wrong ballots, according to Virginia Elections Commissioner Susan Beals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beals informed reporters during a second Election Day briefing Tuesday afternoon that Richmond’s City Electoral Board met and chose to replace the precinct chief responsible. The error meant that the affected voters were unable to cast ballots for local races, as they were given special ballots meant exclusively for federal races.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My understanding is that they cast only federal ballots which included only the office of President of the United States,” Beals explained, adding that these specific ballots are usually reserved for voters who are about to move. “Those ballots, to my understanding, did not include the local races,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The error highlights the challenges election officials face in ensuring each voter receives the correct ballot, especially during high-turnout elections. </span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Number of provisional ballots cast unclear, but same-day registrations are up</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beals also said at the briefing Tuesday that the number of provisional ballots cast throughout Election Day remained unclear by 4 p.m. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Right now we don’t have anything statewide other than what we knew of this morning, which is we had between 15,000 and 17,000 statewide,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beals added that several localities with universities and colleges reported an </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/05/va-college-voting-bloc-utilizes-same-day-registration-shares-top-policy-issues/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">uptick in same-day voter registrations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have heard that there are long lines in some localities that have universities and colleges, as a lot of those students have been encouraged to same-day register today,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Department of Elections officials have remained in touch with these localities and, when needed, deployed more officers of elections and supplies to those universities and the precincts on their campuses, Beals said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What we encourage everyone to do is to please make sure you stay in line, even if the 7 p.m. hour passes. They will process you and they do want you to vote, so please do not get out of line.”</span></p>
<p><strong>5:10 p.m.:</strong></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">At the polls, Northern Virginia voters weigh views on abortion, cost of living</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Tuesday, campaign signs were spread across Northern Virginia at intersections, street corners, and even posted on a bridge over Interstate 66, urging Virginians to support local, state and presidential candidates in this year’s general election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In areas such as Arlington, Falls Church, and Fairfax City, some voters have already cast their ballots early, leaving little foot traffic at precincts on Election Day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to David Bjerke, general registrar for the City of Falls Church, the city recorded a voter turnout of 80.1% by 5 p.m. In Fairfax County, one of the larger jurisdictions in the commonwealth, election officials said total turnout was at 67.9% as of 3:30 p.m.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While 2,305,439 Virginians had already cast their ballots through early voting as of Tuesday morning, the number of early voting ballots cast has dipped by about 525,000 compared to the last 2020 presidential election, according to data collected by the Virginia Public Access Project (VPAP).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While some Election Day voters in close proximity to the federal government offices in Washington D.C., said they preferred to keep their names and who they voted for private due to their jobs, others were not shy to share their views.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think we need a change in this country,” said Elizabeth Green, a city of Fairfax voter who is concerned about the cost of living and voted early for former President Donald Trump. Green said she thinks Trump is the best presidential candidate to tackle the rising costs of food and housing she’s seen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other residents in Northern Virginia said they voted in person for convenience and to experience the voting atmosphere firsthand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mealod Khashei, in the city of Falls Church, said he voted on Election Day because doing so gives him more confidence his vote will be counted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s our civic duty, right,” Khashei said. “We [have] a few responsibilities that we’ve got to do, and that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m doing.”</span></p>
<p><strong>4:07 p.m.:</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;re getting slammed with provisional ballots,” city of Richmond registrar Keith Balmer said in a phone call around 3:30 p.m. It’s mostly same-day voter registration.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chris Davis, an election poll worker at Main Street Station polling place, estimated Tuesday afternoon that about 10% of ballots cast by early afternoon were provisional ballots — in part, he surmised,</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/05/va-college-voting-bloc-utilizes-same-day-registration-shares-top-policy-issues/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">from populations of college students</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that live and study in the area. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Same-day registration and provisional ballots are used in instances where someone forgot to bring their ID card or another form of identification when they vote. They can register at the polling place, vote, and then follow up with their local election officials to provide identification. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s also an</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/think-you-might-have-been-mistakenly-purged-from-virginias-voter-rolls-heres-what-to-do/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">option</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the roughly 1,600 people who were</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/30/u-s-supreme-court-grants-stay-in-challenge-to-youngkins-voter-purge-order-allowing-removal-of-thousands-from-rolls/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">purged from voter rolls</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this year over questions of citizenship status on Department of Motor Vehicles paperwork. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike regular ballots, provisional ballots undergo more scrutiny before they are counted, Balmer said. Officials research voters to determine factors like their identity, citizenship status, or residency in the district they voted in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My staff is going to have to research the eligibility of all of these voters and make a determination if their ballot should count or if it should not,” he explained. “Then the electoral board will ultimately make the final decision.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Basically, all of next week, we&#8217;re going to be adjudicating hundreds, if not thousands, of provisional ballots,” Balmer said. </span></p>
<p><strong>3:48 p.m.:</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outside the Virginia Commonwealth University polling location on the second floor of the Student Commons, several students shared their same-day voter registration experiences and the top policy issues driving their choice between presidential candidates Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. Reproductive rights, housing and economic policy were among the young voters’ chief concerns. <strong><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/05/va-college-voting-bloc-utilizes-same-day-registration-shares-top-policy-issues/">Read more.</a></strong></span></p>
<p><strong>2:15 p.m.: </strong></p>
<p>Chris Davis, a poll worker at Main Street Station, said that about 10% of votes cast had been through same-day registration. He suspects that’s due to the amount of Virginia Commonwealth University and other university and college students that live in the area.</p>
<p><b>1 p.m.:</b></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Virginia early voter turnout data and mail-in voting</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Elections Commissioner Susan Beals said at a media briefing on Election Day morning that as of Nov. 1, a record 6,374,437 Virginians had registered to vote. As of Tuesday morning, 2,305,439 Virginians had already cast their ballots through early voting, of which 1,861,938 were cast in person and 443,501 were returned by mail. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of the mail ballots that are still outstanding, a total of 126,266 mail ballots have yet to be returned. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Those who are voting absentee by mail must have those ballots postmarked on or before today Nov. 5, and they must be received in the mail by noon Friday, Nov. 8, in order to be counted,” Beals said.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While same-day registrations data was not yet available for Tuesday around 10 a.m., Beals said that the state had filed a total of 16,557 same-day registrations leading up to Election day, “but we are obviously expecting more today.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In September, Beals had </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/05/virginias-top-elections-official-warns-of-possible-delays-in-mail-in-voting-this-year/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">expressed concerns</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about potential delays with the U.S. Postal Service affecting timely processing of mail-in ballots ahead of the election. However, on Tuesday she reported that these issues have not materialized so far, and ballots are being processed on schedule.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think a lot of folks have chosen to do a drop off at a dropbox at their registrar’s office, we have seen an increase in that method of return,” Beals told reporters. ” We have not heard specific examples of people having delays in getting their mail back.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beals added most voters are being very diligent about ensuring that their ballot has been received, which they can check online and see that it’s been received by their local registrar’s staff once they mail it back. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have seen an overall decrease in the number of people who have requested absentee by mail-in ballot this year as compared to 2020, but you can&#8217;t necessarily attribute that to just this issue, because 2020 was a very different time and a lot of people requested mail-in ballots because they just didn’t know what to expect on Election Day that year with the pandemic. So it’s hard to even make a case there.”</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Election integrity and and security concerns addressed early</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beals reiterated that elections in Virginia are secure and reliable. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In Virginia, we have some of the most experienced election officials in the country. They have already conducted two statewide elections this year and have provided 138 days of early election day voting for Virginia voters as of today,” she said. Because Virginia has elections each year, Beals said, “our election officials have a great depth of experience in handling issues that come up for voters at the polls.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beals added that election officials in the commonwealth have worked throughout the year to ensure that the elections are safe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In terms of security concerns, we have been meeting for many months with our state and federal law enforcement partners to plan for today,” she said. “We’ve had several meetings where we’ve run through various scenarios to make plans.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beals couldn’t speak to the specifics of those plans but asserted again  “we’re very confident that we’re going to have a safe and secure election in Virginia day.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Department of Justice officials are </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/u-s-justice-department-to-monitor-polling-places-in-27-states-including-six-virginia-localities/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">monitoring six localities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Virginia Tuesday to ensure compliance with federal voting laws, but Beals said that her department would have no information to share on that. </span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Election Day snags</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beals reported that the Department of Elections had been made aware of an incident at Precinct 310 in Richmond Tuesday morning, where election workers handed out federal-only ballots to at least 11 voters. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That issue has still since been resolved. My understanding is that the officers of election gave out the incorrect ballot to the voters that had only a presidential race on the ballot,” she said. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Editor’s note: This is a developing story that will continue to be updated as more information becomes available. </span></i></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this feature, we aim to highlight the frequency with which officials around Virginia are resisting public access to records on issues large and small — and note instances when the release of information under FOIA gave the public insight into how government bodies are operating. </span></i></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Tech companies, localities use secret deals, researchers find</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A search for secret agreements between localities and tech companies pursuing to bring data centers to the state proved fruitful for a Virginia professor and his students, the group of them announced this week. But the jurisdictions involved say those non-disclosure agreements are used frequently in economic deals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eric Bonds, a sociology professor at the University of Mary Washington, and his students Viktor Newby and Victoria Gallaway noticed localities in the state approving data centers, which are the warehouses storing the internet’s processors proliferating with skyrocketing energy and water needs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Details of those needs were scant, said Gallaway in an interview with The Mercury, leading the UMW trio to submit Freedom of Information Act requests with localities in the greater Fredericksburg area for any non-disclosure agreements with tech companies or data center companies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The group’s search proved successful — they found that non-disclosure agreements, which prevent parties who sign on to them from sharing any details of arrangements, were used in the city of Fredericksburg and counties of Caroline, Louisa, Orange, Culpeper and Stafford, according to a news release from Bonds and the students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spotsylvania County was working on a response to their inquiry, the trio said, as King George County was “largely non-responsive,” and the town of Culpeper said it did not use any NDAs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In one NDA with Culpeper County, the organization was listed as “The Company.” In Orange County, officials declined to share 157 pages of correspondence between the county administrator and the director of economic development, out of fear of violation of the NDA.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bonds said in the release that his concern is that “the use of NDAs is part of the reason public discussion has been so limited.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Locally, landowners and homeowners are going to be impacted by the construction of new electrical utility lines and water pipelines,” said Bonds. “Up until recently, these projects were approved with very little public debate about the cumulative environmental impacts.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But NDAs are used all the time, explained the FOIA officer in Culpeper County, as a way to prevent bidding wars over land a large tech company may be interested in. Officials in King George and Louisa counties echoed those reasons, with the latter saying regulation 2.2-3705.6 allows for NDAs to be used.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Once performance measures, investments and incentives terms neared finalization, project information was brought before the board for approval,” said Cindy King, community engagement manager with Louisa County. “Public notices were provided, and a public hearing was held to ensure transparency. Details, including the cooling method and water supply needs, were discussed openly.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">	<div class="newsroomSidebarContainer ">
	<div class="newsroomSidebar">The Mercury’s efforts to track FOIA and other transparency cases in Virginia are indebted to the work of the </span><a href="https://www.opengovva.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Coalition for Open Government</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a nonprofit alliance dedicated to expanding access to government records, meetings and other state and local proceedings.</div>
	</div>
	</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Josh Levi, president of the Data Center Coalition, voiced those competition concerns while adding they may prove beneficial to the public.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“An NDA between a locality and a company does not restrict information shared with the locality, including information related to water or power,” Levi said. ”On the contrary, the protections provided by NDAs may result in an increase in the amount and detail of information shared with localities as projects are considered.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Louisa County reviews “water supply requirements in detail,” King added, noting that power needs involve the Rappahannock Electric Cooperative. Similarly, Chris Hively, town manager for Culpeper, said water needs had been publicly discussed in September meetings, and power needs involve consultation with Dominion Energy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">King George County media relations manager Amy Southall said the locality “holistically reviews information” on project proposals. And Andrew Spence, Stafford County’s chief director of information services, said the county “has conducted a thorough assessment of the community’s and Amazon Web Service’s water needs.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for the lack of response from King George County, Southall said the locality “values transparency… to maintain trust with its residents.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After telling Bonds no NDAs were found once an initial search concluded, Southall said that two were found and notice to him was given on Thursday, two days after Bonds made his information public and The Mercury inquired about it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The county is seeking its legal counsel to advise on the FOIA request,” Southall said. “Once a determination is made, Mr. Bonds will receive updated information on the status of his request.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Officials in the counties of Caroline and Orange did not respond to requests for comment.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Richmond wrongful termination lawsuit not getting its day in court</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The former Freedom of Information Act officer for the city of Richmond is saying the city is delaying its wrongful termination lawsuit so it gets passed “onto the next administration,” according to the </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/government-politics/foia-whistleblower-lawsuit-connie-clay-motion-petul-burks/article_fe6387e0-8cb2-11ef-bc19-2b924581691e.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richmond Times Dispatch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Connie Clay, the city’s former FOIA officer for six months after being fired in January, filed her lawsuit in March, saying the termination was illegal after whistleblowing the city was breaking public records laws. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The city’s attorneys received a 30-day extension to review Clay’s claims, and then filed a demurrer, which seeks to see if a case has merit to proceed, saying the allegations are baseless. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since then, over a six-month span, a court date hasn’t been set, despite a Nov. 19 date being secured on the court’s docket. A city spokesperson declined to provide comment to The Times-Dispatch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mayor Levar Stoney is serving in the final year of his first term and he is seeking the Democratic nomination for Virginia’s lieutenant governor next year. A new mayor will be elected on Nov. 5.</span></p>

(Getty Images)</p><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the less noticed features of the Virginia Way is the long-running tendency of the commonwealth’s leaders to conduct their decision-making behind closed doors. While the </span></i><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacodepopularnames/virginia-freedom-of-information-act/" target="_blank"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Freedom of Information Act</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> presumes all government business is by default public and requires officials to justify why exceptions should be made, too many Virginia leaders in practice take the opposite stance, acting as if records are by default private and the public must prove they should be handled otherwise.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this feature, we aim to highlight the frequency with which officials around Virginia are resisting public access to records on issues large and small — and note instances when the release of information under FOIA gave the public insight into how government bodies are operating.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Nonprofit sues Justice Services</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Department of Criminal Justice Services faces claims it has failed to release the certification and disciplinary records of law enforcement officers, according to </span><a href="https://www.whro.org/virginia-center-for-investigative-journalism/2024-10-11/241111vcij-coplawsuit" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">WHRO’s review</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the suit filed in September in Richmond.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Invisible Institute, a nonprofit newsroom, sued the agency for withholding the names of nearly 100,000 active and inactive law enforcement personnel. WHRO said the agency claimed the latter were exempt from disclosure because “the officers could be tasked with undercover assignments.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To improve misconduct complaints, advocates, including those in Virginia, have urged law enforcement to improve its transparency into an officer’s record. Access to the records helps the public understand who is policing their communities, and the records prevent officers with a history of abuse from being hired by other agencies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Center For Investigative Journalism at WHRO, which has collaborated with Invisible Institute, </span><a href="https://vcij.org/stories/virginia-is-in-the-minority-of-states-keeping-even-the-most-basic-police-data-secret" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that reform efforts to enhance oversight have stalled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2022, the agency released the names of decertified officers after receiving a similar FOIA request. However, when a MuckRock reporter and the Invisible Institute made their requests in 2023 and 2024, respectively, DCJS said the records were exempt from disclosure because they were related to personnel information. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawyers representing the plaintiffs from the University of Virginia School of Law First Amendment Clinic said in a statement that “the release of the requested information would allow the public to monitor if officers are sufficiently regulated — including whether they are prevented from evading repercussions for misconduct by changing jobs.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed"> Former swim coach to try again for school records</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A former high school swim coach told the </span><a href="https://fxbgadvance.substack.com/p/breaking-news-court-dismisses-foia?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;publication_id=1315258&amp;post_id=150263929&amp;utm_campaign=email-post-title&amp;isFreemail=true&amp;r=2482si&amp;triedRedirect=true&amp;utm_medium=email" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fredericksburg Advance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> he plans to request a collection of school records again after a Spotsylvania General District Court judge rejected his petition on Tuesday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Judge Jane M. Reynolds initially dismissed the case because Theodore Marcus’s petition was served improperly, but continued the case to allow the petitioner to address the matter after serving the petition by email instead of by law enforcement or a third-party civil process server.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this month, Marcus began petitioning for the release of the records related to the Riverbend High School varsity swim team after claims that school officials withheld the production of emails and text messages between certain school leaders —  Spotsylvania School Board members Lisa Phelps and April Gillespie, former superintendent Mark Taylor, and former Riverbend principal Xavier Downs — leading up to a Dec. 20, 2023, meeting with parents, school officials and coaches. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In December, Marcus and former head coach Rachel Adriani resigned from the program after some “incidents,” according to the Fredericksburg Advance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He argues that withholding the records violates Virginia’s Freedom of Information Act.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Code allows the petition to be heard within seven days.</span></p>
	<div class="newsroomSidebarContainer ">
	<div class="newsroomSidebar"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Mercury’s efforts to track FOIA and other transparency cases in Virginia are indebted to the work of the </span><a href="https://www.opengovva.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Coalition for Open Government</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a nonprofit alliance dedicated to expanding access to government records, meetings and other state and local proceedings.</span></div>

<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Clarke County supervisors change oversight of social services</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leaders in Clarke County have changed how social services will be overseen by dissolving its board of citizens and turning oversight to its county administrator.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State law allows local departments of social services to be administered by boards and advisory groups. Clarke estimated that Virginia has approximately 63 administrative boards and 51 advisory boards.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a Tuesday report by </span><a href="https://www.winchesterstar.com/winchester_star/supervisors-approve-oversight-change-new-advisory-board-for-clarke-dss/article_f60633bd-b578-5819-bb6f-7831ff6b2faf.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Winchester Star</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the Clarke County Board of Supervisors transferred oversight of the Department of Social Services to County Administrator Chris Boies beginning Jan. 1.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Boies told The Mercury that the members supported the board&#8217;s dissolution. The group has two vacancies on the seven-member board. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to an Oct. 15 </span><a href="https://www.clarkecounty.gov/home/showpublisheddocument/12906/638640850148830000" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">staff report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the learning curve for citizen board members is “immense,” which could create recruitment concerns. The report states that each member is required to participate in training annually, and the board is required to provide several documents and plans for review to the supervisors before being submitted to the state, including the director’s evaluation, compensation plan, monthly expenditure report and consents to adopt as needed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There have been numerous times in the past two years where the board could not meet because a quorum couldn’t be assembled,” the report stated.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this feature, we aim to highlight the frequency with which officials around Virginia are resisting public access to records on issues large and small — and note instances when the release of information under FOIA gave the public insight into how government bodies are operating.</span></i></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Hopewell treasurer indicted on record forgery and fraud charges</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hopewell treasurer Shannon Foskey has been charged with two counts of forging and uttering a public record along with a count of computer fraud and a count of disabling computer software. The felony charges each carry a maximum 10-year prison sentence if Foskey is convicted. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.wtvr.com/news/local-news/shannon-foskey-arrest-oct-9-2024" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">WTVR reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that Foskey’s office was raided last week by state police and that she was arrested after failing to pay her city taxes and allegedly used her position as treasurer to free a Department of Motor Vehicles hold on her car registration. Holds are placed when people fail to pay their taxes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Foskey denied that accusation,the </span><a href="https://www.progress-index.com/story/news/crime/2024/10/09/hopewell-city-treasurer-arrested-at-office-wednesday/75592030007/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Progress Index reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and she claimed that her taxes had been repaid and that she’d been properly reinstated by the only other employee in her office that was authorized to do so. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her next court appearance will be Oct. 16. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Because the treasury is a constitutional office and doesn&#8217;t report to the city manager, the city has no comment,” a Hopewell city spokesperson said when WTVR inquired about the allegations and the arrest. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Former Spotsylvania superintendent’s lawsuit challenges termination, reveals possible FOIA violations</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the Spotsylvania County School Board announced the firing of its former superintendent, Mark Taylor, earlier this year the reasons why weren’t publicly revealed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now a wrongful termination lawsuit Taylor filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia reveals the reasons the board gave for his termination. It also shows that Taylor believes he was fired in retaliation for orchestrating a book fair last December that promoted Christrian literature. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taylor had partnered with former TV star-turned-evangelist Kirk Cameron, who spoke at the event, along with Christian book company Brave Books and SkyTree Book Fairs to host the event. His lawsuit claims that he acted as a private citizen “at all times” and used his own funds to pay for the event, the </span><a href="https://www.fredericksburgfreepress.com/2024/10/08/former-spotsylvania-superintendent-taylor-files-lawsuit-against-school-board/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fredericksburg Free Press reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A letter from the school board’s lawyer to Taylor’s lawyer does not indicate that the book fair was a cause for his termination. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The board’s lawyer does claim Taylor may have violated the Freedom of Information Act and alleges that he “made numerous documented offensive and inappropriate social media posts” </span><a href="https://fxbgadvance.substack.com/p/taylor-blames-retaliation-lawsuit?r=2yvsz2&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;triedRedirect=true" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FXBG Advance reported.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The letter also mentioned that Taylor may have acted in violation of state law when he removed books deemed sexually explicit from school libraries in 2023 While Virginia has a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/06/15/school-districts-struggle-to-implement-new-laws-on-sexually-explicit-books/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">law in place to require parental notification of books </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">with sexually explicit content and provide alternatives for students whose parents disapprove, Taylor garnered attention last year for flagging books that the school board approved removal of in May.

	<div class="newsroomSidebarContainer ">
	<div class="newsroomSidebar"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Mercury’s efforts to track FOIA and other transparency cases in Virginia are indebted to the work of the </span><a href="https://www.opengovva.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Coalition for Open Government</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a nonprofit alliance dedicated to expanding access to government records, meetings and other state and local proceedings.</span></div>

<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed"> Lawsuit seeks records release from Spotsylvania School Board, division</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former Riverbend High School swim coach, Theodore Marcus, is seeking records he has requested through the Freedom of Information Act since January of this year. Marcus filed a petition asking Spotsylvania District Court to compel the school board, individual members Lisa Phelps and April Gillespie, as well as superintendent Clint Mitchell to release records that relate to a December 2023 incident involving the varsity swim team, FXBG Advance </span><a href="https://fxbgadvance.substack.com/p/lawsuit-seeks-release-of-records?r=36fl9e&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;triedRedirect=true" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thursday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The incident Marcus seeks answers about led to the disruption of the swim program and the resignations of himself — assistant coach at the time — and head coach Rachel Adriani. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://fxbgadvance.substack.com/p/lawsuit-seeks-release-of-records?r=36fl9e&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;triedRedirect=true" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FXBG Advance reported </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">that he would specifically like to see emails and text messages between Phelps, Gillespie, former superintendent Mark Taylor and former Riverbend principal Xavier Downs about the events leading up to and following </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“the contentious December 20, 2023, meeting with swim team coaches and parents and school administration.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the meeting, Downs had been placed on administrative leave and was later  fired. Records produced so far in response to Marcus’ requests indicate such emails and texts do exist, his petition states. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though letters had been sent informing the parties they were subject to FOIA  by the school board chair and the division’s human resources director, Marcus’ petition argues more should have been done. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His petition also asks the court to order the school division to release results of a third-party investigation into the swim team that it has previously withheld. When FXBG Advance requested a copy this past summer, the division declined, citing attorney-client privilege exemptions. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Emails obtained by FOIA reveal rail company wants Richmond to accept liability to reopen Pipeline Trail</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CSX railway wants the city of Richmond to make safety upgrades and accept liability in order to consider allowing recreational use of the Pipeline Trail, according to </span><a href="https://www.richmonder.org/csx-city-must-make-safety-fixes-accept-liability-to-keep-pipeline-trail-open/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Richmonder</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company’s director of state relations for Virginia wrote in an email that the railway’s initial agreement with the city for the walkway above the pipeline was “for installation and maintenance of the pipeline and did not authorize recreational or other access or use of our property.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The email, which The Richmond obtained through a FOIA request, shows more details surrounding the uncertainty of the local recreational space. Following a sewage leak in the summer, the trail was temporarily closed for repairs, but the appearance of a chain link fence at the catwalk entrance led to speculation about prolonged or permanent closure of the trail. A </span><a href="https://sign.moveon.org/petitions/give-us-back-our-pipeline-trail?ref=richmonder.org" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">petition</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> calling for its reopening has garnered over 2,000 signatures. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other  emails show conversations between the company and city of Richmond  officials. A spokesperson for CSX told The Richmonder that a more formal discussion between the entities should happen in the second half of October. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Prince William County approves changes to school redistricting process</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prince William County is going to focus on more transparency for future redistricting of its school boundaries, </span><a href="https://www.insidenova.com/headlines/changes-are-officially-coming-to-the-school-boundary-planning-process-in-prince-william-county/article_af3dd6a6-81af-11ef-afa5-93ad9590e39e.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inside NoVa reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The approved changes comply with a recommendation from the school division and an outside consultant group. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The revised policy, approved on Oct. 2, states that the redistricting process can only begin when a school is going to open, close or expand its capacity or when otherwise directed by the local school board. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Redistricting criteria that will be considered include: current and projected school populations; local geography; and stability of school assignments over time. Student demographics will also be considered, in alignment with the Equal Educational Opportunities Act. When neighborhoods and communities are identified that may need to be changed,  a public engagement process will be initiated. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Engagement can include town hall meetings, parent focus groups, work groups, roundtable discussions, and surveys, as well as electronic outreach. The school division will also be required to maintain a website dedicated to redistricting with information and opportunities for the public to provide feedback throughout the process.</span></p>

(Getty Images)</p><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the less noticed features of the Virginia Way is the long-running tendency of the commonwealth’s leaders to conduct their decision-making behind closed doors. While the </span></i><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacodepopularnames/virginia-freedom-of-information-act/" target="_blank"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Freedom of Information Act</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> presumes all government business is by default public and requires officials to justify why exceptions should be made, too many Virginia leaders in practice take the opposite stance, acting as if records are by default private and the public must prove they should be handled otherwise.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this feature, we aim to highlight the frequency with which officials around Virginia are resisting public access to records on issues large and small — and note instances when the release of information under FOIA gave the public insight into how government bodies are operating. </span></i></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">ACLU launches investigation into possible abuses of civil rights across campuses</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the violent police response and mass <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/06/more-than-125-arrested-at-four-virginia-universities-amid-nationwide-protest-over-israel-hamas-war/">arrests of students, staff, and faculty protestors</a> on multiple Virginia campuses this spring amid the flaring Israel-Hamas war, the ACLU of Virginia </span><a href="https://www.acluva.org/en/press-releases/virginians-deserve-answers-without-foia-reform-virginia-universities-wont-have-share" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">has launched</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> an investigation into potential abuses of civil rights and liberties.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The organization submitted Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests to several universities across the commonwealth, seeking information on selective enforcement and viewpoint discrimination, the use of force by campus and state police, and the due process afforded to students and university employees subjected to disciplinary actions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the responses to these FOIA requests have been largely unsatisfactory, the ACLU said in a statement. The universities — which include Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU), Virginia Tech, the University of Virginia (UVA), and the University of Mary Washington (UMW) — </span><a href="https://www.acluva.org/en/news/were-investigating-possible-abuses-students-rights-virginia-campuses" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cited exemptions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that allowed them to withhold information or indicated they would provide details only for exorbitant fees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mary Bauer, executive director of the ACLU of Virginia, expressed disappointment at the lack of transparency.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Universities are charged with creating environments that encourage students to exercise their First Amendment rights,” Bauer said. “After deploying state police and imposing questionable disciplinary charges against student demonstrators this spring, university leaders should be more forthcoming about their decision-making processes and how they will enforce the new policies passed over the summer.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bauer emphasized that Virginians, who fund public universities with their tax dollars, deserve clarity on how their civil rights and liberties are being protected. “Transparency is essential — without exception, exemption, or hefty fees.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Media pushes for courtroom access in Otieno case</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Powhatan Circuit Court Judge Joseph M. Teefey initially barred reporters from the courtroom during jury selection for the trial concerning Irvo Otieno’s death, but relented after requests from reporters with the Richmond Free Press and the Richmond Times-Dispatch, the latter publication </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/crime-courts/irvo-otieno-trial-dinwiddie-wavie-jones-central-state-hospital/article_e87990da-7f7b-11ef-8f36-f7cc78e723a4.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> earlier this week. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The trial, which opened Monday, involves Wavie Jones, a former Central State Hospital employee charged with involuntary manslaughter in Otieno&#8217;s March 2023 death.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Otieno, who died while handcuffed and restrained, was ruled to have died from asphyxiation by a medical examiner. However, Jones’ defense argues Otieno died of a “sudden cardiac event” due to an enlarged heart, and that Jones positioned Otieno on his side to avoid restricting his breathing. Prosecutors counter that Jones used excessive force and disobeyed orders not to get involved.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Otieno’s death, captured on hospital security footage, gained national attention, with the video being scrutinized in court. Witnesses had conflicting memories about Otieno’s position during the restraint, and hospital policies against prone restraints were introduced as evidence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jones is the only remaining hospital employee facing charges after some were dropped against others. The trial has evoked themes of civil rights and police reform, with several potential jurors removed for their views on police use of force. Otieno’s family attended the trial, with his mother, Caroline Ouko, reacting emotionally during discussions of graphic evidence.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Litigation against three Roanoke County school board members allowed to move forward</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lawsuit by Roanoke County Supervisor Martha Hooker against three members of the school board has been allowed to advance, a federal court decided Monday. The case was preceded by a decision Hooker and other supervisors made that was “described as a way to increase transparency and accountability”</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">in the process of funding the renovations of two schools and the replacement of a technical education center, the Roanoke Times reported. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Times’</span><a href="https://roanoke.com/news/local/crime-courts/lawsuit-moves-forward-against-three-roanoke-county-school-board-members/article_5e838ee4-7f7b-11ef-8a6e-0ff6a5cfc44d.html#tracking-source=home-top-story" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Hooker claims that Cheryl Facciani, Tim Greenway, and Brent Hudson sought to have her fired from her part-time position with the county school system in retaliation for her voting on a contentious school funding issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. District Judge Elizabeth Dillon denied a motion to dismiss the lawsuit&#8217;s central claim, which alleges that the school board members acted out of anger over Hooker’s vote, thus infringing on her First Amendment rights. While some claims in Hooker’s wrongful termination case were dismissed, the main thrust remains intact, according to her attorney, Tommy Strelka.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In May 2023, Hooker was dismissed from her role as the school system’s work-based learning coordinator, with Superintendent Ken Nicely stating that certain school board members believed she had a conflict of interest. However, Hooker argues that the real reason for her termination was political retaliation linked to funding decisions made by the board of supervisors for school renovations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ongoing conflict between the supervisors and school board has included disputes over funding methods for various educational projects. Although the school board’s attorney argued that the members were not directly involved in Hooker’s termination, Judge Dillon indicated there was sufficient evidence for potential individual liability. The Roanoke County school system has declined to comment on the pending litigation.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the less noticed features of the Virginia Way is the long-running tendency of the commonwealth’s leaders to conduct their decision-making behind closed doors. While the </span></i><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacodepopularnames/virginia-freedom-of-information-act/" target="_blank"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Freedom of Information Act</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> presumes all government business is by default public and requires officials to justify why exceptions should be made, too many Virginia leaders in practice take the opposite stance, acting as if records are by default private and the public must prove they should be handled otherwise.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this feature, we aim to highlight the frequency with which officials around Virginia are resisting public access to records on issues large and small — and note instances when the release of information under FOIA gave the public insight into how government bodies are operating.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">New videos reveal more about Otieno&#8217;s case</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WRIC has </span><a href="https://www.wric.com/news/taking-action/new-videos-irvo-otieno-before-death/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">obtained</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> never-before-seen video footage of Irvo Otieno, a  28-year-old Black man who was placed under emergency police custody while in mental distress at his mothers home before dying in custody at a state-run psychiatric hospital in March 2023.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The videos showed Otieno cursing and threatening law enforcement, as his mother “repeatedly explains that he’s in distress, asks when mental health help is arriving and tries to tell officers that how they are interacting with Otieno is exacerbating his distress,” the TV news station reported. WRIC said the video footage did not show Otieno physically engaging with law enforcement at the home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the news outlet, the collection of footage captures the events over three days beginning when Henrico Police responded to his mother&#8217;s house, where Otieno was placed under an emergency custody order, to his ultimate death at Central State Hospital.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Officers took Otieno to Parham Doctors’ Hospital and the video footage shows him there, where he was shackled to a bed and threatened hospital staff and officers trying to restrain him. Officers struck Otieno multiple times, and he struck an officer while partially restrained, as staff attempted to treat him, the video shows.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="HnnGNtb5kV"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/18/scathing-report-calls-for-a-ban-of-prone-restraint-tactics/">Scathing report calls for a ban of prone restraint tactics</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Scathing report calls for a ban of prone restraint tactics&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/18/scathing-report-calls-for-a-ban-of-prone-restraint-tactics/embed/#?secret=lO6p4nQIau#?secret=HnnGNtb5kV" data-secret="HnnGNtb5kV" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Otieno didn’t see a psychiatrist during the six hours he was in the Parham Doctors’ Hospital’s emergency department, a state investigation showed, and the facility didn’t comply with treatment guidelines for mentally ill patients. The hospital </span><a href="https://www.wric.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/74/2024/09/VDJ6595cb71ee9fb.pdf.pdf.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">later reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that they weren’t able to fully stabilize Otieno because Henrico Police officers interrupted their care. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Otieno was charged with three counts of assaulting a law enforcement officer, disorderly conduct in a hospital and vandalism and taken to the Henrico County Jail, where he was strapped to a restraining chair for at least 11 hours, according to experts who reviewed the case. Otieno’s condition deteriorated inside a cell at the jail before officers took him to Central State Hospital in Dinwiddie County, where he died.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Previously released video of Otieno’s time at the psychiatric hospital show him being restrained and pressed to the floor by hospital workers and officers before his body goes limp and workers try to resuscitate him, unsuccessfully. Prosecutors initially charged seven sheriff’s deputies and three hospital workers with  second-degree murder in Otieno’s death, but many of those charges were dropped. Now, just three defendants, a hospital orderly and two deputies, face charges of involuntary manslaughter. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last September, Otieno’s family settled on an $8.5 million settlement with Virginia, Henrico, and the county’s sheriff’s office. The case has raised awareness about the challenges of Virginia’s mental health treatment system and prompted calls for reform from state legislators, advocates and high profile leaders such as civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who represented Otieno’s family.</span></p>
<p><b>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Audit shows pattern of failures in Richmond’s finance department</h4>

	 </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The city of Richmond’s finance department “ignored multiple emails, voicemails, service requests” and failed to process taxpayer forms, according to a </span><a href="https://www.wtvr.com/news/local-news/richmond-finance-audit-sept-13-2024" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">WTVR report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> informed by a records request.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The department’s poor performance was the subject of an audit requested by Richmond leaders and conducted by consultant Anne Seward after the city faced questions from restaurant owners about “unfair meals tax late fees and collection practices.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seward found several cases of customer service deficiencies, including employees who were found sleeping at work and displaying unprofessional conduct. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Department leaders also failed to monitor customer concerns, the report stated, as indicated by 7,000 emails the agency received but didn’t respond to, 3,400 personal property tax service requests that had not been addressed for eight months, and six months of ignored voicemails.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WTVR reported that Seward billed the city over $130,000 for her work. Her contract ends in December.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">FBI contacts George Mason over failed tournament plan</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">George Mason University’s Men&#8217;s Basketball Team was slated to soak up some sun during a five-day, four-night trip to Nassau for the Bahamas Bash Basketball Tournament last month.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the team’s plans were dashed days before they were supposed to depart, when the university learned that the team’s airfare and lodging accommodations had not been secured. Mason paid the Georgia-based tournament promoter and event consultancy The VIII Group about $160,000, according to </span><a href="https://www.sportico.com/leagues/college-sports/2024/george-mason-mens-basketball-bahamas-trip-canceled-fbi-1234796780/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sportico</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The records revealed a signed April 3 agreement between The George Mason University Foundation and The VII Group. The contract stated that if The VII Group canceled the event, the promoter would refund payments made aside from the foundation’s “original deposit,” which was considered non-refundable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Records show GMU athletic officials held a Zoom call with The VII Group on July 24 and, by the start of last month, were still preparing as if the trip was a go,” Sportico reported.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But on Aug. 7, less than a day before the trip was supposed to start, Mason’s athletic director Marvin Lewis emailed The VII Group, accusing them of breaching the contract and demanding total compensation. In follow-up emails, The VII Group owner Christopher Williams acknowledged the company’s inability to fulfill the contract. He later said in an email that Mason should have “everything finalized and paid back” by Aug. 23.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Aug. 16, Christian Roccia, the special agent in charge of the FBI’s Northern Virginia Resident Agency, emailed George Mason’s athletics department, asking the department’s deputy athletic director Zack Bolno about “scheduling a meeting with someone from your office regarding the topic we discussed,” the email read. Sportico obtained the email in response to a records request. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bolno forwarded the inquiry to GMU athletic director Marvin Lewis, who then shared it with</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Eli Schlam, a lawyer with the university.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We received a call and email from an FBI agent inquiring about the Bahamas trip. Will you advise on the appropriate next steps? … I can follow up but wanted to check-in prior to responding to the agent,” Lewis’ email read. Schlam directed Lewis to get further guidance from Carl Rowan, Jr., the chief of GMU’s campus police unit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sportico said records did not show any further communications on the topic. It appears that the situation has not been cleared up, as Lewis said in a Sept. 6</span><a href="https://gomason.com/news/2024/9/6/athletics-inside-mason-nation.aspx" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> letter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to “Mason Nation” students and fans “the university continues to work with The VII Group to resolve this matter and secure a full refund for those directly impacted.”</span></p>

While the </span></i><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacodepopularnames/virginia-freedom-of-information-act/" target="_blank"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Freedom of Information Act</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> presumes all government business is by default public and requires officials to justify why exceptions should be made, too many Virginia leaders in practice take the opposite stance, acting as if records are by default private and the public must prove they should be handled otherwise.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this feature, we aim to highlight the frequency with which officials around Virginia are resisting public access to records on issues large and small — and note instances when the release of information under FOIA gave the public insight into how government bodies are operating. </span></i></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Virginia Beach&#8217;s former economic development director under investigation</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Beach’s former economic development director is </span><a href="https://www.13newsnow.com/article/news/local/mycity/virginia-beach/former-vb-economic-development-director-under-investigation-spending-habits/291-9eac77c6-a57e-4f36-ac5b-430713029f9b" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">under investigation for spending roughly $47,000 of city money</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in his first year on the job.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though he resigned this past July, records show that Charles Rigney took trips to Brazil, Italy, Germany, Spain, New York and Las Vegas. It’s unclear what triggered the investigation, 13 News Now reported, but emails it obtained show that Virginia Beach’s finance department and city manager staff called a meeting in July to discuss missing receipts and a set of expense reports from one of Rigney’s trips. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The emails also included discussion of a $329  bill — $200 of which was spent on alcohol — at an amphitheater where Rigney said he was trying to convince a Norfolk-based company to move to Virginia Beach. </span></p>
<p>The city provided documents in response to 13News Now&#8217;s FOIA request but declined to provide additional comments to the station, saying in a statement that &#8220;this matter remains under investigation by the City Auditor and it would be inappropriate to respond further until his investigation is complete.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Richmond’s inspector claims he was advised to stop investigating tax issues</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richmond Inspector General Jim Osuna said that city attorneys advised him to stop investigating tax issues in the city’s finance department — a claim the city attorney&#8217;s office refutes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Osuna had been probing allegations that the finance department had failed to alert business owners they were due refunds or credits on tax overpayments. He told city council mid-July at a meeting that he had “put a pause” on his investigation due to legal advice that he wasn’t “authorized to look at it,” the</span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/government-politics/inspector-general-meals-tax-city-attorneys-council-investigation/article_ee5c9c98-6fab-11ef-8d4b-03fb6be3bdf5.html#tracking-source=home-top-story" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Richmond Times-Dispatch reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Council, which both city attorneys and the inspector general report to, gave the Times-Dispatch different answers about the probe. 4th District Councilor Kristen Nye confirmed that Osuna had been conducting an investigation, but did not clarify if he’d discussed being told to stop. Meanwhile, 8th District Councilor Reva Trammell claimed that Osuna had relayed that information to her. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While back and forth has played out over Osuna’s inquiry, Richmond is allowed to hold onto overpayments for the time being. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title58.1/chapter39/section58.1-3990/#:~:text=If%20the%20taxes%20have%20not,penalties%20and%20interest%20paid%20thereon." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">State law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> outlines that the city is not at fault for withholding extra funds, but that taxpayers have three years to claim a refund. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Winchester City Council considers guidance for public comment</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The city of Winchester might change how it conducts public comment during its city council meetings, the </span><a href="https://www.winchesterstar.com/winchester_star/city-council-considering-rules-for-public-comment-portions-of-meetings/article_302796ec-bd66-5e54-8085-ad56a33f1163.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Winchester Star reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, speakers are allotted three minutes to speak but there is little other guidance or restrictions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The policy review follows a series of protests that played out during public comment at  council meetings this summer. Opponents of Israel’s war with Hamas pressed the council to adopt a resolution that would condemn the conflict and call for a ceasefire. Councilors declined to pass such a resolution; public comment periods then became flooded with protesters talking about the resolution in lieu of other matters before the local council at its meetings. Insults had also been lobbed at members, Winchester Star reported. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the protesters have not returned to recent council meetings to bring the matter up again, the local legislative body may still explore adjustments to how public comment is conducted. It’s unclear what that could look like, as free speech is protected by the U.S. Constitution, though guidance on avoiding verbal attacks or using profanity could be advised. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The council unanimously voted for their city attorney to draft a document she can present to the council at a future meeting. </span></p>

While the </span></i><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacodepopularnames/virginia-freedom-of-information-act/" target="_blank"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Freedom of Information Act</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> presumes all government business is by default public and requires officials to justify why exceptions should be made, too many Virginia leaders in practice take the opposite stance, acting as if records are by default private and the public must prove they should be handled otherwise.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this feature, we aim to highlight the frequency with which officials around Virginia are resisting public access to records on issues large and small — and note instances when the release of information under FOIA gave the public insight into how government bodies are operating. </span></i></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Does the government overuse exemptions to withhold information from the public?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An out-of-state professor of journalism and podcasting encountered difficulties accessing records from Virginia law enforcement under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), according to a </span><a href="https://www.wtvr.com/news/local-news/foia-exceptions-virginia-sept-2-2024" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recent report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by WTVR in Richmond. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">David DesRoches was investigating a 1990s murder case that occurred on his family’s property in Goochland County, which was solved and closed by the Richmond Police Department in 2015.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DesRoches sought the case files for educational purposes but was denied access due to a FOIA exemption that allows law enforcement to withhold information, even for closed cases.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richmond Police cited their policy of using exemptions in serious violent crime and death investigation cases — a practice DesRoches found unusually restrictive compared to his experience in Connecticut. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Marcus Simon, D-Fairfax, who chairs Virginia&#8217;s Freedom of Information Advisory Council, told WTVR that overuse of these exemptions is a common issue in the state, with many agencies applying them too broadly, limiting public access to information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simon explained that while FOIA exemptions are discretionary, they are often used as a shortcut by government bodies to reduce their workload, instead of fully processing public requests. He suggested that requiring agencies to justify their denials in detail could encourage more transparency and limit the overuse of exemptions.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Man sues Portsmouth’s top prosecutor in open records dispute</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Josh Stanfield, a 38-year-old from York County, frequently files open records requests with state and local agencies, a hobby that often leads him to court. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In December, Stanfield sought records on former Portsmouth Police Officer Vincent McClean, who was charged with manslaughter for failing to provide aid in two separate 2018 cases, the Virginian-Pilot </span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2024/08/31/man-suing-portsmouths-top-prosecutor-in-open-records-dispute/?clearUserState=true" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> earlier this week. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stanfield also requested records on Robert Huntington, a former investigator involved in McClean’s case, but encountered delays and conflicting information from the Portsmouth Police and the local Commonwealth’s Attorney’s office.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After getting the runaround from both agencies, Stanfield hired attorney Verbena M. Askew and sued Commonwealth’s Attorney Stephanie Morales, arguing the office violated Virginia’s Freedom of Information Act by not responding within the required five business days. At a court hearing, Morales’ attorneys admitted the response was late but argued the records were exempt due to personnel and administrative protections, making the delay irrelevant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Circuit Court Judge Randall Smith acknowledged the frustration caused by the delay but allowed the prosecutor’s office to cite exemptions. He questioned whether government agencies should have the sole authority to withhold documents without external oversight, suggesting he might review the records personally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stanfield told the newspaper that he viewed this experience as part of his ongoing effort to hold government agencies accountable, though he remains frustrated that his reputation for persistence has not yet led to better compliance with public records laws.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Mercury’s efforts to track FOIA and other transparency cases in Virginia are indebted to the work of the </span><a href="https://www.opengovva.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Coalition for Open Government</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a nonprofit alliance dedicated to expanding access to government records, meetings and other state and local proceedings.</span></p>

<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Few Virginia whistleblowers, even fewer rewards, from state fund</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 12 years, Virginia’s whistleblower reward fund, managed by the state inspector general, has paid just one claim — $2,041 in fiscal year 2023 — despite receiving 32 tips for potential rewards, according to </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/virginia-whistleblower-fund-manoli-loupassi/article_324edbc4-66dc-11ef-af90-97f9ec16ac08.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an analysis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the Richmond Times-Dispatch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This lackluster performance has disappointed former legislator Manoli Loupassi, who championed the fund’s creation based on the success of a similar program in Richmond. Loupassi questioned the incentives for government officials to report fraud or waste, suggesting a lack of awareness about the fund. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Office of the State Inspector General (OSIG) receives hundreds of complaints annually but substantiates only a fraction. In 2023, it resolved 165 cases out of 762 complaints, with only 32 deemed valid. OSIG’s public relations officer, Maggie Sotos, explained that many complaints don’t meet the criteria for fraud or abuse, and rewards are only issued if tips lead to recovering at least $5,000. The whistleblower receives up to 10% of the recovered funds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite a 34% increase in hotline cases investigated over the past three years, the number of unsubstantiated allegations remains high. A 2018 study found that OSIG handled less than 5% of fraud and waste investigations, with most being handled by individual state agencies. These investigations are often conducted by untrained personnel, raising concerns about their thoroughness and effectiveness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A recent report from the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission highlighted the need for the inspector general’s office to better investigate complaints, especially those involving state psychiatric hospitals. The commission warned that failure to fully investigate could lead to critical issues being ignored or concealed.</span></p>

While the </span></i><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacodepopularnames/virginia-freedom-of-information-act/" target="_blank"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Freedom of Information Act</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> presumes all government business is by default public and requires officials to justify why exceptions should be made, too many Virginia leaders in practice take the opposite stance, acting as if records are by default private and the public must prove they should be handled otherwise.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this feature, we aim to highlight the frequency with which officials around Virginia are resisting public access to records on issues large and small — and note instances when the release of information under FOIA gave the public insight into how government bodies are operating. </span></i></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Daily Progress challenging decision to withhold report on UVA shooting</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Daily Progress is continuing to fight for the University of Virginia to release a report on the December 2022 shooting that killed three football players, which the school has withheld since last year .</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The paper filed a challenge with the Virginia Court of Appeals last week over the July 18 decision by Judge Melvin Hughes to not release the report in response to the newspaper’s FOIA request because the document had become part of the criminal investigation into 24-year-old former UVa student Christopher Darnell Jones. On Nov. 13, 2022, Jones shot Lavel Davis Jr., Devin Chandler and D’Sean Perry to death, and two other students who were injured.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In June, Albemarle County Commonwealth’s Attorney Jim Hingeley intervened in the trial over the FOIA request for the report, saying he had given the report to UVa Police Chief Tim Longo, making it part of the criminal investigation into Jones. Active criminal investigation files are exempt from FOIA releases.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, in its </span><a href="https://dailyprogress.com/news/state-regional/crime-courts/daily-progress-appeals-after-court-bars-release-of-uva-shooting-report/article_331080b6-454a-11ef-8bfa-4b3dc6e4c9df.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">article</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> detailing the latest appeal, the Daily Progress notes the school didn’t introduce any evidence on the matter during the trial, and never brought up Hingeley’s argument that the report was part of the criminal proceeding. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are undeterred,” said Daily Progress editor Reynolds Hutchins. “We have every respect for the court, but we believe the judge erred in permitting the Albemarle County commonwealth’s attorney to intervene in our case, ending proceedings before even closing arguments could proceed. Virginia taxpayers paid more than a million dollars for this report last year and three families paid an incalculable price in 2022, they all deserve to know what happened.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jones is scheduled to face a jury trial in January. He has been granted access to the report.</span></p>
	<div class="newsroomSidebarContainer ">
	<div class="newsroomSidebar">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Mercury’s efforts to track FOIA and other transparency cases in Virginia are indebted to the work of the </span><a href="https://www.opengovva.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Coalition for Open Government</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a nonprofit alliance dedicated to expanding access to government records, meetings and other state and local proceedings.</span></p>

	</div>
	
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Richmond’s resistance to releasing records</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of Aug. 26, a month after the Richmond Times-Dispatch requested receipts and meal purchase forms for certain meal charges made to a former employee’s credit card, the newspaper in Virginia’s capital city still had not received them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia FOIA law mandates officials respond to public record requests within five workdays, excluding holidays and weekends. Officials can also obtain a seven-day extension, if it’s “not practically possible” to complete the request in five workdays.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The meal records request update came to light in an </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/government-politics/foia-deadines-fees-extensions-public-records-richmond-freedom-of-information-act/article_b35a1914-6172-11ef-a6dd-7321745bfa6d.html#tncms-source=login" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">article</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by reporter Samuel Parker explaining procedures outlined in FOIA law, including response deadlines and request costs. The city has missed the deadlines in several instances, and interpreted their allowance to recover costs for time spent on recovering documents to be $1,725.18 in one case. In another request, the city said the cost for a single email already provided to a private investigator for a separate request was $75.25.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Times-Dispatch has continuously reported on financial records of city employees following the discovery of department charge cards being used for questionable reasons. On Thursday, the paper published a story about an ex-spokesperson spending nearly</span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/government-politics/oxford-england-training-petula-burks-professional-development-leadership/article_632a9d66-6559-11ef-9a7e-f71bf53a09eb.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> $8,000</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for training in England.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">City officials said they are working to increase staffing and technology to streamline the FOIA process.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Spotsylvania schools staying silent on swim team investigation</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spotsylvania County Public Schools representatives are staying mum on an investigation into issues with the Riverbend High School swim team, according to the </span><a href="https://fxbgadvance.substack.com/p/riverbend-swim-team-investigation" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fredericksburg Advance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the Advance previously reported, the issues involved a late November decision to create smaller instructional groups among the swim team led by captains because of its 45-member size, as well as a parent’s allegations that a former assistant coach communicated inappropriately with their child.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The decision to create the smaller groups outraged the parent, who characterized students being chosen to lead the smaller groups as “like a participation trophy.” That parent then alleged then-assistant coach Theodore Marcus was inappropriately texting with their child, after praising him as a role model for months and giving him the child’s phone number, according to the Fredericksburg Advance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other parents said the organization of the team created a more inclusive environment, and staff said it could foster leadership skills among those chosen to direct the smaller groups.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the controversy, Marcus resigned. Following a “contentious” meeting on December 20, school principal Xavier Downs and coach Rachael Adriani were put on administrative leave. The school began an investigation on the issues surrounding the team in March.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under FOIA, the Fredericksburg Advance had requested from the school district the report from the investigation. But the district said the records were exempt from mandatory disclosure after previously telling the outlet “the Division does not have a statement to share regarding this matter,” when asked about the status of the investigation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Fredericksburg Advance’s review of online financial information for the district found almost $40,000 had been paid to attorney Yeng Collins by June 21 for work on “division investigation.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Payments to law firms besides Sands Anderson, which provides general legal advice to the School Board and represents the division in special education matters, have continued throughout the summer and now approach $500,000 for the calendar year,” the Advance reported.</span></p>
<p><b>Arlington County police expand public access to crime data</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Arlington County Police Department unveiled a new crime data hub available online, according to </span><a href="https://wtop.com/arlington/2024/08/arlington-co-police-make-crime-data-more-visible-with-new-online-hub/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">WTOP news.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The website provides maps, information on offenses and arrest data within Arlington County, with updates issued weekly on Wednesday mornings. Information comes from the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s National Incident-Based Reporting System.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several groups in the community evaluated the website before it went online, WTOP reported. The Virginia State Policy has a similar online database of crime reported annually in Virginia.</span></p>
