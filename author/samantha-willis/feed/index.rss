<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TikTok and its parent company, ByteDance, sued the U.S. government over the law, saying it impeded their First Amendment rights, but a federal appeals court recently upheld the law. The high court will hear oral arguments in the appeal case Jan. 10.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Allowing TikTok to operate in the United States without severing its ties to the Chinese Communist Party exposes Americans to the undeniable risks of having their data accessed and exploited by the Chinese Communist Party,” Miyares, a Republican, said in a statement announcing the amicus brief. “The Supreme Court now has the chance to affirm Congress’s authority to protect Americans from foreign threats while ensuring that the First Amendment doesn’t become a tool to defend foreign adversaries’ exploitative practices.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/7521/text?s=1&amp;r=1&amp;q=%7B%22search%22%3A%22Protecting+Americans+from+Foreign+Adversary+Controlled+Applications+Act%22%7D" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was introduced in March, members of Virginia’s congressional delegation supported it. Democratic U.S. Reps. Abigail Spanberger and Bobby Scott said the measure would protect Americans against foreign digital threats, while U.S. Sens. Mark Warner, D-Virginia, and Marco Rubio, R-Florida, who co-chair the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, supported the House’s action against TikTok. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In December 2023, Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin issued an </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/governor-of-virginia/pdf/eo/EO-24---Banning-the-Use-of-Certain-Applications-and-Websites-on-State-Government-Technology.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">executive order</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> banning the use of TikiTok “on any government-issued devices, including state-issued cell phones, laptops, or other devices capable of connecting to the internet except for public safety purposes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Miyares co-led the amicus brief alongside Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen. Attorneys General in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, and Utah also signed on in support.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With 98% of votes counted, the Associated Press <a href="https://apnews.com/projects/election-results-2024/virginia/?r=0" target="_blank">called</a> the presidential contest in Virginia for Vice President Kamala Harris, giving her the state&#8217;s 13 Electoral College votes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harris’ win continues a blue streak that began with Barack Obama’s win here in 2008. She garnered 51.9% of Virginia’s votes and won handily in the state’s large metro areas, carrying 56.6% in Northern Virginia&#8217;s Loudoun County, 82.1% in Richmond and 70% in Norfolk down in Hampton Roads, according to the AP. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia has chosen Democratic candidates in the last four presidential elections: Obama earned 52.3% of Virginia’s votes in 2008; in 2012, 51.5% of Virginia voters helped re-elect Obama; Hilary Clinton won by 49.7% in the state in 2016; and Joe Biden swept the state with 54.1% of votes in 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harris prioritized reproductive health care access, gun reform, addressing inflation and expanding voting access during her months on the campaign trail. Her campaign launched a national reproductive health care bus tour in the final weeks before the election, which made </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/harris-walz-fighting-for-reproductive-freedom-bus-tour-coming-to-virginia-this-week/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">several stops in Virginia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, in Richmond, Virginia Beach and Northern Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican former President Donald Trump focused on immigration, the economy, foreign policy issues including the Israel-Hamas war and Ukraine-Russia conflict, and election security during his reelection campaign, while facing mounting civil and criminal lawsuits. The </span><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/10/21/central-park-five-lawsuit-trump/75778337007/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">most recent suit </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">was lodged against Trump on Oct. 21 by the Central Park Five, five men who were exonerated in the rape and assault of a New York woman in the 1980s, for Trump’s false claims during the ABC News presidential debate in September that the group pled guilty to the crime and that someone was killed in connection to it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A former prosecutor, California attorney general and U.S. senator, Harris is the daughter of immigrant parents and the first woman to serve as America’s vice president, and the first Black and Asian person to be vice president.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares addressed the stay to Chief Justice John G. Roberts, after federal Judge Patricia Tolliver Giles on Oct. 25 ordered people stripped from Virginia’s voter rolls to be reinstated because eligible voters may have been included in the state’s voter roll purges. Youngkin’s executive order directed the state DMV to send lists of people who identified as noncitizens to the state Board of Elections for daily removal from voter lists. The </span><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?061+sum+SB313" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2006 state law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Youngkin’s order is based on called for this process to occur monthly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The League of Women Voters, the Virginia Coalition for Immigrants Rights and the DOJ have </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/over-1600-people-removed-from-voter-rolls-under-youngkin-order-groups-seek-court-injunction/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">filed separate lawsuits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> against the state for the ramped up removals, citing instances where eligible voters who had made errors on their DMV paperwork had been removed, as well as people who became naturalized citizens after they filed their DMV paperwork. The groups also said the removals are systematic and happened within 90 days of Election Day, a violation of federal law. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/22/youngkin-blasts-doj-lawsuit-that-trust-virginias-voter-roll-removals-into-national-spotlight/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and Miyares, both Republicans, have argued that the executive order merely reinforces the 2006 law implemented under a Democratic governor, and that the removals were individualized. They, and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, have characterized the legal challenges to the removals as politically-motivated actions that hinder the state’s ability to bar noncitizens from voting.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is a federal crime for noncitizens to vote, and there is no evidence that it’s a widespread problem in America. A Brennan Center for Justice survey held after the 2016 presidential election found</span><a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/noncitizen-voting-missing-millions" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> just 30 instances of noncitizens voting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> out of  23.5 million votes cast. </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/10/12/nx-s1-5147789/voting-election-2024-noncitizen-fact-check-trump" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recent voter data audits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in states like Georgia and Arizona have revealed negligible cases of noncitizens voting.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Giles’ order would “irreparably injure Virginia’s sovereignty, confuse her voters, overload her election machinery and administrators, and likely lead noncitizens to think they are permitted to vote, a criminal (offense) that will cancel the franchise of eligible voters,” Miyares wrote in the stay, requesting the high court issue it by Tuesday. Giles mandated that the state comply with her order to reinstate purged voters by Wednesday.</span></p>

It&#8217;s an especially bad moment to be spreading misinformation online. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seems Rooz Dadabhoy has a poor sense of timing. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dadabhoy is the president of Rally Virginia, an organization that describes itself as “the home of the modern Republican woman,” a tech company CEO and a </span><a href="https://bov.vcu.edu/members/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">VCU Board of Visitors member</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> appointed by Gov.

Glenn Youngkin, posted this tweet containing misinformation about FEMA funds on Oct. 5, 2024. The post was later deleted. (Screenshot)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“FEMA has spent hundreds of millions on its ‘Shelter and Services Program’ for ILLEGAL migrants this year—and it’s right there on FEMA’s own website. WHAT ABOUT HELPING OUR OWN CITIZENS???? Shame on HARRIS-BIDEN!!!” Dadabhoy’s now-deleted Oct. 5 tweet read. The post included a photo that appeared to show a teary-eyed, wet-haired little girl sitting on a boat, wearing a life jacket and clutching an equally-soaked puppy as another boat floats down a river in the background. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most people who saw it, including me, immediately connected the picture to the water-logged Southeast now recovering from Hurricane Helene. Over 100 people died in the storm, and entire communities in </span><a href="https://ncnewsline.com/2024/10/08/fact-check-debunking-misinformation-surrounding-helene/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hardest-hit North Carolina</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> were washed away. There’s been significant flooding in Southwest Virginia, as The Mercury has </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/04/youngkin-shares-update-on-helene-damage-in-virginia-urges-to-not-be-distracted-by-climate-change/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, with at least 519 homes damaged or destroyed; two people have perished. That’s reality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The photo in Dadabhoy’s tweet, however, is not. It’s an AI-generated image, which I was able to confirm in less than 15 minutes by running the photo through </span><a href="https://sightengine.com/detect-ai-generated-images" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">three</span></a> <a href="https://aiimagedetector.org/result#google_vignette" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">different</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> free AI detection tools online. She could have easily done the same — and should have —  before sharing this fake photo.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dadabhoy’s words are also not rooted in reality. The tweet implies that FEMA funds are being routed to undocumented migrants instead of American-born natural disaster victims, a false claim parroted by Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and repeatedly debunked by FEMA in recent days.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No money is being diverted from disaster response needs. FEMA’s disaster response efforts and individual assistance is funded through the Disaster Relief Fund, which is a dedicated fund for disaster efforts. Disaster Relief Fund money has not been diverted to other, non-disaster related efforts,” FEMA posted Oct. 3 on a page of its website especially dedicated to setting the record straight (that they felt compelled to do that is sad, in and of itself).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only is the misinformation Trump, Dadabhoy and countless others are pushing irresponsible, it’s downright dangerous. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is reducing the likelihood that survivors will come to FEMA with a trusted way to register for assistance,” Keith Turi, acting associate administrator for response and recovery at FEMA, told </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/10/07/nx-s1-5144159/fema-funding-migrants-disaster-relief-fund" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NPR</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> yesterday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowing all this, I asked Dadabhoy two questions: Were you aware when you made that tweet that FEMA has repeatedly debunked the false claim that disaster relief funds are being used to support undocumented immigrants? What did you hope to accomplish by tweeting that? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dadabhoy replied that “I never implied that money is being diverted away from Hurricane Helene victims and being siphoned to illegal immigrants. I did not imply that. I did not even intend to imply that.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t believe that, and neither do the dozens of people who replied angrily to her tweet, some calling for her removal from VCU’s BOV. One person, unfortunately, replied by asking after the welfare of the AI child in the fake photo, showing the problem with spreading digital misinformation, even unintentionally: somebody will believe it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginians in positions of public influence, and who have our governor&#8217;s support, should be dispelling Trumped-up, unproven claims — especially in the aftermath of a major natural disaster, when so many people still need help — not adding fuel to the rumor wildfires.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_40341" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:979px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/08/no-fema-helene-funds-arent-going-to-undocumented-immigrants-despite-youngkin-appointees-tweet/picture3_0/" rel="attachment wp-att-40341"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-40341 size-full" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Picture3_0.jpg" alt="" width="979" height="651" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Picture3_0.jpg 979w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Picture3_0-300x199.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Picture3_0-768x511.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 979px) 100vw, 979px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  From FEMA: &#8220;Crews working to restore utilities and infrastructure damaged by Helene (in Washington County, Va.). (Nicholas Monteleone/ FEMA)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At a press gaggle Youngkin convened Tuesday morning to give updates on Hurricane Helene recovery efforts in Virginia, a reporter asked him what his administration was doing to counter misinformation concerning the storm and FEMA’s response, and referenced Dadabhoy’s tweet as an example of the problem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are using, I think, the best process, which is to put people on the ground, answer questions directly, and speak to you all frequently, so that you can help us get out the word how to apply for help where it&#8217;s available, and most importantly, that we care and that we&#8217;re there, and there will be a better day tomorrow,” the governor replied, in part. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin is wise to lean into working with the media to spread the facts; it is an essential part of our role. And you, dear reader, can do your part to identify and stop the spread of misinformation, too. Here are a few tools, tailored to our concurrent election and hurricane seasons:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Perhaps ironically in the context of this column, VCU Libraries is offering an excellent information literacy campaign called </span><a href="https://www.library.vcu.edu/about/news/2024-news/as-a-beacon-in-todays-information-fog-vcu-libraries-launches-campaign-to-encourage-people-to-vetyoursources.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">#VetYourSources</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, including a lecture by author and info literacy expert Mike Caulfield, “Rumors of Theft: Navigating election integrity discourse online” on Oct. 15.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> As mentioned above, FEMA’s </span><a href="https://www.fema.gov/disaster/current/hurricane-helene/rumor-response?utm_campaign=Emergency%20response%202024&amp;utm_content=310511761&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;hss_channel=tw-14074515" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hurricane Helene: Rumor Response&#8221;</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> page offers just-the-fact-ma’am breakdowns of what’s real and what&#8217;s not when it comes to the agency’s response to Helene cleanup efforts, and answers questions about its funding for future emergencies. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The Brennan Center for Justice at NYU Law&#8217;s </span><a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/how-detect-and-guard-against-deceptive-ai-generated-election-information" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">primer on fact-checking</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a great resource to help you learn “how to detect and guard against deceptive AI-generated election information.”</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The Poynter Institute’s </span><a href="https://www.politifact.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PolitiFact</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a verifiable fact-checking machine, a nonpartisan platform with a robust process of analyzing claims by politicians and media “to give citizens the information they need to govern themselves in a democracy,” writes Angie Drobnic Holan, Politifact’s former editor-in-chief. They&#8217;ve got a special section focused on debunking misinformation, too.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s always a good day to stop the spread of dubious digital distortions. Tweet, post, read and share responsibly out there, folks. </span></p>

Lewis High School on June 2, 2023 in Springfield, Virginia. (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The question burning at the center of American public opinion since the first presidential debate: If </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/07/11/biden-at-nato-press-conference-rebuts-doubters-im-the-best-qualified-to-govern/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">President Joe Biden</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> steps down, who will replace him as the Democratic nominee for president of the United States? The most obvious answer appears to be the nation’s second-in-command, Vice President Kamala Harris. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But her candidacy would face nearly insurmountable odds of success, if American history and recent voter polls are any indication.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not because she isn’t qualified; as the </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/11/us/politics/kamala-harris-biden-news-conference.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">president asserted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Thursday in a press conference, she is, undoubtedly. And, being decades younger than Biden and accustomed to the demands of public office, she’d likely have the energy and stamina to campaign and serve out four years of the presidency. She’s also a history maker, as the first woman, African American and South Asian American person elected vice president. There’s the rub.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://according/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Poll </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">after </span><a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/2024/national/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">poll </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">show only mere percentage points separating Biden and former President Donald Trump. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reflect on that: A huge chunk of American voters want Trump, a convicted felon whose </span><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/06/trump-racism-comments/588067/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">racist</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trump-offensive-comments-women" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sexist</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/trump-under-fire-again-for-violent-language-and-dehumanizing-anti-immigrant-rhetoric" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">violent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> rhetoric went beyond bombast before, during and after his time in the White House and was frequently reflected in his policies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If that many voters are seriously considering voting for him, then does Harris — representing so much of what Trump stands against — even stand a chance?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think that she does not,” </span><a href="https://politicalscience.vcu.edu/directory/faculty/wrighten.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jatia Wrighten, PhD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an assistant professor of political science at Virginia Commonwealth University, told me this week. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In this political climate, and historically in the country’s political climate, Americans have been hesitant to put support behind Black women at the national level,” Wrighten said. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enter </span><a href="https://nmaahc.si.edu/shirley-chisholm-president" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shirley Chisholm</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the first Black woman elected to Congress and, in 1972, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the first Black candidate to seek a major party&#8217;s nomination for President of the United States. Despite her track record of success representing New York’s 12th congressional district — including sponsoring legislation that expanded food assistance programs for low-income single mothers and drawing from her experience as an early childhood educator and authority to further Head Start and school lunch programs — her candidacy was largely viewed as a joke. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Media members, mostly white men, picked apart her appearance and dismissed her presidential run as “</span><a href="https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=J7AiAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ErMFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2935%2C941954" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">female meddling</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.” Those who seemed most likely to support Chisholm — like feminist leader Gloria Steinem and civil rights leader Rev. Jesse Jackson — instead </span><a href="https://www.biography.com/political-figures/shirley-chisholm-presidential-run" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">supported her opponent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, George McGovern. In the end, she clinched just 152 delegate votes at the Democratic National Convention that year and the party deemed McGovern their nominee. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More recently there was Stacey Abrams of Georgia, who, though seeking her state’s highest office and not the country’s, experienced many of the same obstacles Chisholm did by daring to seek public office while existing as a Black person and woman, at the same time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps as much as supporters and the media covered her work to root out voter suppression in the Peach State, Abrams’ opponents and the media zoomed in on all the wrong things, betraying a double standard, which subjects Black woman political candidates to scrutiny that white candidates, male or female, just aren’t.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They talked about [Abrams] being single, her </span><a href="https://medium.com/@mnhoskin25/the-real-reasons-stacey-abrams-may-have-lost-georgias-gubernatorial-race-b21dbc6e8a2b" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">weight</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, how dark she was, on top of examining the things we look at with any candidate, like how qualified she was, her education, how well spoken she was,” Wrighten said. Heightening all of this is the fact that dark-skinned, kinky-haired Chisholm and Abrams don’t mirror classic American beauty standards, derived from European ideals of fair skin, straight hair, a narrow nose and a thin physique. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Concerning Black women in American politics, Wrighten posited, “Being overweight matters, having darker skin matters, having natural hair matters…and it shouldn’t. Black women candidates are faced with this standard of beauty that others don&#8217;t have to contend with.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The same sentiments that poisoned Chisholm’s candidacy and Abrams’ governor’s race still exist in America and would pose a serious hurdle to Harris’ victory, said Wrighten.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“At the national level, there&#8217;s a lot of media attention that works against Black women. There&#8217;s a lot of bias, there are stereotypes at play that hurt Black women especially. There&#8217;s still a sense that women are unfit for the office.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another obstacle Harris could encounter if she tried to make the leap from VP to commander-in-chief: &#8220;I think established Democrats would have an issue with [Harris] running; there&#8217;s this sense of, you have to put your time in, pay your dues,&#8221; Wrighten said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That dynamic is familiar is Virginia state politics, too, evidenced by the establishment Dems putting their weight behind Terry McAuliffe&#8217;s 2021 run for governor — a role he&#8217;d already held, in addition to chairing the Democratic National Committee 2001-2005 and Hilary Clinton&#8217;s presidential campaign in 2008 and co-chairing former President Bill Clinton&#8217;s 1996 reelection campaign — instead of the Jennifers, McClellan and Carol Foy. Both Black women  — with their bold ideas, statehouse experience and lots of public support — had the potential to be Virginia&#8217;s first Black woman governor. Instead, McClellan and Carol Foy&#8217;s prospects were blunted because their party&#8217;s heavy hitters backed McAuliffe (who then lost to Gov. Glenn Youngkin).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s also the lingering effects from the Obama era that would likely damage Harris’ chance to be commander-in-chief. The election of the country’s first Black president ushered in a double-edged sword: a “post-racial era” (yeah right) marked by more opportunities and tangible progress for historically oppressed, disenfranchised groups, most notably Black Americans. The flipside was a seething resentment of that progress mostly expressed by the historically powerful group that orchestrated the oppression and disenfranchisement, white Americans. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“From the tea party’s racially tinged attacks on the president’s policy agenda to the ‘birther’ movement’s more overtly racist fantasies asserting that Obama was not even an American citizen, the national racial climate grew more, and not less, fraught” after Obama’s presidency, wrote historian Peniel Joseph, director of the Center for the Study of Race and Democracy and the LBJ School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas, in a 2016 Washington Post </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/national/obama-legacy/racism-during-presidency.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">series</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Obama’s legacy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Obama’s presidency, flesh-and-blood proof of the nation’s shifting demographics and values, fueled a public sentiment held by many white Americans “that Black people were getting perks they didn&#8217;t deserve,” Wrighten said. “So we see this pushback against that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of this consideration may be for nought, as Biden again reiterated Thursday that he intends to stay in the race, despite any voter polling indicating Harris would fare better against Trump than he would. But should Harris come to the forefront as the nominee, she’ll have a tough time ahead of her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think she’ll continue to be sexualized,” Wrighten said, referring to the </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/10/07/kamala-harris-sexist-racist-attacks-spread-online/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">unfounded rumors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that emerged almost as soon as Biden announced Harris as his VP in 2020. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">There will continue to be this idea that she didn&#8217;t earn what she has.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are 59 countries of the United Nations’ 193 member states who have elected women heads of government, a number that has </span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/03/28/women-leaders-around-the-world/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“risen steadily”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> since 1990. It doesn’t seem likely that November’s presidential election will put America on that list; since George Washington’s election in 1789, America’s presidents have always been men. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think that the U.S. should take a long hard look at itself when we&#8217;re thinking about who can be a leader and what they look like,” Wrighten said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I also think there’s ample evidence to suggest that some serious self-examination is in order, on a national scale. The reality is, only Americans can transform the nation into one that would actually support and enable Harris, or any other woman or woman of color, becoming president. But it doesn’t appear we’re in a particularly reflective mood. </span></p>

Glenn Youngkin last week.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Kempsville High School varsity baseball team&#8217;s season was brought to a screeching halt after administrators found evidence that players had been making racist, harassing comments for years — one local mom said her son&#8217;s teammates called him the n-word — Virginia Beach Public Schools&#8217; superintendent </span><a href="https://www.13newsnow.com/article/news/local/mycity/virginia-beach/not-something-we-tolerate-vb-schools-superintendent-addresses-racism-hate-speech-found-in-kempsville-hs-baseball-program/291-78dd27ff-54fa-4f5a-8128-f51263ca4006" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said Monday</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Commonwealth University and George Mason University aren&#8217;t moving forward with previous plans to make mandatory courses that expand students&#8217; racial literacy and understanding of racism’s real-world consequences for Black Virginians and others of color. This, after the Youngkin administration </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/03/28/youngkin-administration-reviews-race-dei-syllabi-for-vcu-george-mason-courses/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">asked to review the courses&#8217; curricula</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and framed such classes as “a thinly veiled attempt to incorporate the progressive left’s groupthink on Virginia’s students.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even President Joe Biden snubbed one of the state&#8217;s oldest historically Black colleges, Virginia State University, by </span><a href="https://www.wric.com/news/politics/capitol-connection/virginia-lawmakers-college-leaders-react-after-president-biden-announces-he-wont-participate-in-debate-at-vsu/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pulling out of a highly-anticipated debate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the school with former President Donald Trump; it would have been the first time a presidential debate was hosted at an HBCU in the nation, at a time when most are </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/10/03/enrollment-is-growing-at-virginia-hbcus-but-they-face-historic-underfunding/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">still underfunded</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> compared to legacy white institutions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I could go on but I don&#8217;t need to; the pattern of these events reflects a steady dissolution of years of progress Virginia had been making to recognize and address the historic lack of diversity and equitable, inclusive practices in public schools, higher education, health care, and local and state government. It&#8217;s in line with the </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/21/us/dei-education-state-laws.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislative pushback against DEI</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> across the country, which will undoubtedly further rupture our ideological and political divides. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a moment for reflection. We should be asking ourselves hard questions, starting with, how did we get here?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why are we OK with our decisions and public policies hearkening back to a time when certain Virginians&#8217; human and civil rights were trampled as standard practice?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are we creating a legacy of social progress that will make the state the best it can be for all Virginians, or are we replicating the prejudices and problems that defined much of our past and passing a baton of moral failings to the next generations?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It will be to all of our benefit if our thinking spurs some serious course correction.</span></p>

(Library of Virginia)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We&#8217;re moving soon and our new house sits on land that&#8217;s been in my family for generations. Wanting a clearer picture of the ancestors who passed the property down to us, my husband and I asked my aunts, our family historians, to do some genealogical sleuthing. They identified our long-dead relatives who settled the land after the Civil War but, just as interestingly, they uncovered a deed for a nearby family parcel that contained a </span><a href="https://mappingcville.com/2019/01/20/racial-covenants/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">racial covenant</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The white parties in the 1940 deed agreed &#8220;not to sell the above described real estate to any one not of the caucasian race for the period of twenty-five (25) years from this date, with the exception of five acres thereof situated in the Northwest corner of the above described real estate which may be sold to Sally Bowles (colored).&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sally Bowles was my great-great-aunt and a Black woman entrepreneur in western Hanover County. White people in the area paid her to do their laundry and that&#8217;s probably why they deigned to sell her five measly acres of the 272 acres they were selling. Besides being proof of the historic, systemic exclusion of Black families from wealth building in Virginia and other southern states, my lingering questions about who my people were presents an opportunity to visit the Library of Virginia.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Library, founded in 1823, is the state&#8217;s deepest trove of Virginia&#8217;s cultural history and includes over 130 million books, maps, periodicals and other materials that tell the story of who we were and are. Since 2014, the Library has offered a genealogy workshop series to teach people how to use its records and other resources to research their heritage and family lineage. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We really began the series by focusing on beginning genealogy and then began expanding it to more specific types of records over the years,&#8221; Ginny Dunn, the Library&#8217;s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Archives &amp; Library Reference Services Manager, emailed me. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our military records, African American genealogy, and immigration records workshops have been among the most popular workshops.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I understand exactly why the African American genealogy workshop draws a lot of interest; although Black history doesn’t begin with slavery, that brutal institution robbed many Black families of being able to trace their roots beyond its reaches. That longing for our family, for knowing who we truly are and where they came from, has never left some of us. But finding out more about one&#8217;s familial past is a curiosity nearly everyone will experience at some point in their life. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About &#8220;one-in-seven U.S. adults (15%) say they have ever used a mail-in DNA testing service from a company such as AncestryDNA or 23andMe,&#8221; a Pew Research Center </span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2019/08/06/mail-in-dna-test-results-bring-surprises-about-family-history-for-many-users/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">survey </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">found in 2019. Eighty-seven percent of people who have used one of the kits said they did it to &#8220;learn more about where their family came from,&#8221; while 36% did it to &#8220;get information about their health or family medical history&#8221; and another 36% wanted to &#8220;connect with relatives they might have but didn&#8217;t know about.&#8221; People are getting to know themselves like never before and in our state, the Library of Virginia can aid those inquiries.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_38457" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:235px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/records-ledger-for-the-Bradshaw-family-of-Virginia_Library-of-Virginia.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-38457" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/records-ledger-for-the-Bradshaw-family-of-Virginia_Library-of-Virginia-235x300.jpg" alt="" width="235" height="300" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/records-ledger-for-the-Bradshaw-family-of-Virginia_Library-of-Virginia-235x300.jpg 235w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/records-ledger-for-the-Bradshaw-family-of-Virginia_Library-of-Virginia.jpg 728w" sizes="(max-width: 235px) 100vw, 235px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  A records ledger for the Bradshaw family of Virginia is an example of the types of items Library of Virginia staff help patrons use to research their family histories.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Many times when people come to the Library, they’ll say to us, ‘I want to search for my family,’ but they don&#8217;t know how to do it or what to do,” Dunn said. “We lead them through the steps, help them figure it out, and tell them you always start with yourself and work your way back through the records.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year’s series kicked off March 1 with a workshop that introduced 22 beginners to genealogical research, led by Dunn and education and program specialist </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anne McCrery. Dunn said the attendees enjoyed the experience and “asked a lot of questions.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In mid-April, the Library hosted the second workshop, “How to Trace Your Virginia Roots,” and the series will continue May 3 with a workshop on how to use little-known records — including “Virginia penitentiary records, Prohibition Commission records, state mental hospital records, court order books” — to trace Virginia genealogy. The series runs through October. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The things we find out about our kin when we dig into our family history may surprise us. I learned, for instance, that my great aunt Lillian — niece of Sally, mentioned above —  was a nightclub singer and pianist who performed frequently in Richmond’s historic haven of Black culture, Jackson Ward, in its heyday. How glamorous she sounds! I’d been researching (often at the Library, sometimes assisted by legendary historian/then</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">-director of educational and outreach services Gregg Kimball)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://richmondmagazine.com/news/features/a-leader-from-leigh-st/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">writing</span></a> <a href="https://richmondmagazine.com/news/richmond-history/reflections-of-the-past/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">about</span></a> <a href="https://richmondmagazine.com/news/features/coming-home/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jackson</span></a> <a href="https://richmondmagazine.com/news/features/still-standing/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ward</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for years without realizing I had a personal connection to the area.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Others may find themselves similarly shocked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We had a patron find that her grandmother&#8217;s real name was different than she thought and also that she was married a different year than she had been told,” Dunn told me. “Another interesting thing that people have found is that a physical description of an ancestor (often found on a military pension record) is very similar to a living descendant.” She’s also seen “people who found something about their ancestry that is very emotional, and they&#8217;ll start crying. You just don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s crying in a good way or something upsetting.”</span></p>

Glenn Youngkin recently took action on a flurry of Virginia legislators’ measures related to reproductive health, mostly blocking bills designed to preserve the public’s access to abortions and birth control as these same issues roil national debates and as other states pass laws that restrict womens’ bodily autonomy and roll back decades of abortion protections. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, a surprising signoff: Youngkin, a Republican, </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB78" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">signed a bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Del. Vivian Watts, D-Fairfax, that prevents electronic menstrual data — often collected in period-tracking digital apps — from being subject to search warrants, subpoenas or court orders. Watts said in a phone interview Wednesday that her bill is a “preventative measure” that, considering the social climate of the nation, is warranted.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="bAa0vHLXBJ"><p><a href="https://azmirror.com/2024/04/10/the-1864-abortion-ban-is-a-feature-not-a-bug-of-the-gops-assault-on-reproductive-rights/" target="_blank">The 1864 abortion ban is a feature, not a bug, of the GOP&#8217;s assault on reproductive rights</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;The 1864 abortion ban is a feature, not a bug, of the GOP&#8217;s assault on reproductive rights&#8221; &#8212; Arizona Mirror" src="https://azmirror.com/2024/04/10/the-1864-abortion-ban-is-a-feature-not-a-bug-of-the-gops-assault-on-reproductive-rights/embed/#?secret=xix0dTUif4#?secret=bAa0vHLXBJ" data-secret="bAa0vHLXBJ" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Arizona Supreme Court just allowed a law that goes back to the 1800s to override a law passed within the last decade,” Watts said, referencing the state’s recent decision to uphold a 160-year-old statute that bans virtually all abortions and reject a 2022 law that allowed abortions up to the 15th week of pregnancy. When the newly-reenacted antebellum era law was first created, Arizona wasn’t a state, women couldn’t vote, and slavery was an ongoing American tradition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arizona’s near-total abortion ban is the latest example of how access to abortions has been increasingly limited since the Supreme Court of the United States overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, removing Constitutional protections for the procedure that is often </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1N2TC0VD/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">necessary</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to save womens’ lives or health. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My surprise at Youngkin greenlighting Watts’ bill isn’t based on the common sense merit of the measure. Protecting individuals’ private health information should be the standard of any state that respects its citizens. And it’s just downright creepy to imagine a Virginia judge or law enforcement officer scrutinizing the date and duration of peoples’ periods.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That Youngkin advanced that bill while vetoing several other reproductive health measures is what seemed like an unexpected mixed message to me, Virginia abortion </span><a href="https://x.com/ProtectChoice/status/1776404452678783176" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">advocates</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and Watts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am amazed that there&#8217;s the recognition of the importance of privacy as a basic human right,” Watts said of Youngkin signing her bill, “that&#8217;s not being recognized in the other abortion-related legislation, where the right of a private decision is not being respected.”</span></p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;As Texans fight for life-saving abortions, don&#8217;t take our reproductive rights for granted, Virginia&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/12/08/as-texans-fight-for-life-saving-abortions-dont-take-our-reproductive-rights-for-granted-virginia/embed/#?secret=C9535ogAoY#?secret=Em7s3V6jEr" data-secret="Em7s3V6jEr" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which pieces of related legislation did the governor reject or alter?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He shot down a </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB15" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> carried by Sen. Barbara Favola, D-Arlington, to prevent the extradition of people who come to Virginia for an abortion from other states where the procedure is illegal, should that person face related criminal charges in their home state. The bill’s extradition protection would have extended to doctors and medical workers who performed or assisted with out-of-state patients’ Virginia abortions, too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“By vetoing this bill, the governor has refused to provide a layer of protection that Virginia healthcare professionals believe is necessary to ensure that they can provide abortion care without the fear of prosecution,” Favola</span><a href="https://x.com/BarbaraFavola/status/1776595597404917998" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> posted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on social media platform X. Doctors and women seeking abortions in the state “deserve the peace of mind this bill would’ve provided,” she added.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB716" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bills</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Del. Candi Mundon King, D-Dumfries, and Sen. Jennifer Carroll Foy, D-Prince William, </span><b> </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">that would have protected medical professionals who provide abortion care from disciplinary actions by the Board of Medicine also met Youngkin’s ax.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said no to a </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB1098" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Del. Sam Rasoul, D-Roanoke, mandating companies with 50 or more employees provide workers up to 10 days of unpaid bereavement leave after a family members’ death, but also, importantly, after a miscarriage, an unsuccessful “reproductive technology” procedure like in vitro fertilization, a stillbirth or following a medical diagnosis that “negatively impacts pregnancy or fertility.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB609" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Del. Marcia Price, D-Newport News to establish a right to access and use birth control regardless of the American Constitution’s requirements was, like Watts’ bill, an effort to protect reproductive health care from future federal restrictions that may be on the horizon. Youngkin </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+ful+HB609H1" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">amended</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and weakened, the bill by predicating Virginians’ right to contraceptives on landmark Constitutional contraceptive protections, ones that could be overturned just like Roe. v. Wade. By doing so, he took the teeth right out of it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin didn’t fully reject a </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB819" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">measure</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Sen. Ghazala F. Hashmi, D-Richmond, and King to mandate insurance companies cover birth control; he amended it by adding a loophole allowing insurers to be exempt based on their religious or ethical beliefs. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2016/06/21/where-major-religious-groups-stand-on-abortion/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Religious beliefs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about the God-given sanctity of life are the bedrock of America’s anti-abortion movement. Some use their religious beliefs to </span><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/06/20/lgbtq-people-americans-largely-oppose-religious-based-discrimination/70335484007/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">discriminate against LGBTQ+ people</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Slaveowners used their religious beliefs to condone owning human beings, even </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/the-bible-was-used-to-justify-slavery-then-africans-made-it-their-path-to-freedom/2019/04/29/34699e8e-6512-11e9-82ba-fcfeff232e8f_story.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reading Bible passages</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about servants obeying their masters to enslaved Black people. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The problem with the governor tacking on a religious beliefs exemption to Hashmi’s bill is that, historically and presently, religious beliefs have been a convenient way for some people to excuse their bad behavior, spread prejudices and enforce their agendas at the expense of others’ lives, liberty and wellbeing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia is the last Southern state to preserve access to abortion with no new restrictions after Roe’s overturning. Our commonwealth is now a sanctuary of last resort for people who can’t get abortion care that they desperately need where they live. As the reproductive health culture wars rage on, it’s imperative that Virginia’s laws reflect what citizens need and want: laws that support their health and ensure the best quality of life possible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Immediately after torching most abortion bills and diluting one to cement birth control as a human right, Youngkin started touting his </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/news-releases/2024/april/name-1025084-en.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">revised budget</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as a way for state lawmakers and their constituents to reach “common ground.” But by rejecting the legislature’s reproductive health measures, our governor also rejects the rights and will of many Virginians and contributes to the deepening political and cultural divides fracturing our country.</span></p>

Here, the SDO spacecraft captures an image of a partial eclipse on Aug. 21, 2017. (www.science.NASA.gov photo)</p><p>Let’s avert our eyes from Virginia&#8217;s state <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/03/26/this-is-what-spoiled-brats-do-democrats-blast-youngkin-on-budget/">budget battle</a> for a moment and look toward the skies.</p>
<p>Actually, before you do that, make sure you have a pair of special solar viewers. That’s right, ladies and gentlemen and children of all ages, we have a solar eclipse on the way. Enjoy these 15 questions and answers — informed by actual experts — about the big event.</p>
<p><b>Wait! There’s going to be a solar eclipse?</b></p>
<p>Yes! On Monday, April 8, 2024, to be precise. The partial eclipse will be visible from roughly 2:20 p.m. to 3:30 p.m., with the total eclipse lasting from 3:28 p.m. to 3:35 p.m., <a href="https://eclipse-explorer.smce.nasa.gov/" target="_blank">depending on your location</a> in the state.</p>
<p><b>What’s a solar eclipse again?</b></p>
<p>According to our <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/eclipses/future-eclipses/eclipse-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">friends at NASA</a>: “A total solar eclipse happens when the Moon passes between the Sun and Earth, completely blocking the face of the Sun. The sky will darken as if it were dawn or dusk.”</p>
<p>Just imagine that you’re watching an important TV program and your beloved spouse passes in front of the set. They instantly become much less beloved.</p>
<p>Now, let’s equate your TV set with the sun and your spouse with the moon. It’s just like that.</p>
<p><b>Who will get to see it?</b></p>
<p>Everyone in Virginia should witness at least some degree of the solar eclipse, although the state is not in the path of totality. Richmond and most areas of central Virginia are expected to see about 83% to 85% of the moon covering the sun during the celestial spectacle, according to NASA.</p>
<p>In Southwest Virginia, about 87% to 90% of the sun will be blocked during the eclipse&#8217;s peak, 3:00 to 3:20 p.m.</p>
<p>The Hampton Roads region will see the least of the eclipse, with Virginia Beach and localities close to the coast expected to witness just 80 to 83% of sun blotted out by the moon.</p>
<p>The best views of the eclipse will happen in Northern Virginia, where several counties will experience about 90% visibility or above.</p>
<p><b>How much will I see if I, you know, decide against traveling?</b></p>
<p>I advise <a href="https://eclipsesoundscapes.org/eclipse-lookup-tool/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this handy website</a>, sponsored by a NASA grant. It lets you to enter any ZIP code and reveals the eclipse extent for your neighborhood.</p>
<p><b>Any advice on watching it?</b></p>
<p>Don’t look at the eclipse with your naked eyes. Let me repeat that, in italics: <em>Don’t look at the eclipse with your naked eyes</em>.</p>
<p>The sun is usually so bright that we can’t physically stand to look at it. An eclipse cuts down on the brightness, but doesn’t stop solar radiation that can cause <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/eclipse-safety-how-to-view-the-eclipse-safely" target="_blank" rel="noopener">major vision damage</a>. This happens to people. It literally scars their retinas. They see a phantom image of the sun for the rest of their lives.</p>
<p><b>But I can still sneak a peek, right?</b></p>
<p>Please don’t do that. If you don’t believe me, listen to Shannon Schmoll, the director of the Abrams Planetarium at Michigan State University.</p>
<p>“We don’t ever, ever want to look directly at the sun. It will harm our eyes and can cause permanent damage,” she told journalists during a <a href="https://www.sciline.org/environment-energy/total-eclipse-2024-solar-eclipse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">briefing organized by SciLine last week</a>. “So to look at this, you need to use either eclipse glasses or some sort of eclipse viewers.”</p>

<p><b>So where do I find those solar viewers?</b></p>
<p>The American Astronomical Society <a href="https://eclipse.aas.org/eye-safety/viewers-filters" target="_blank" rel="noopener">maintains a list</a> of reputable manufacturers and retailers. For the record, they do not recommend going to your prominent online retailer of choice and searching for “cheap eclipse glasses.” You can do better. For goodness’ sake, think of those eyes.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dcr.virginia.gov/state-parks/solar-eclipse" target="_blank">Virginia State Parks</a> are selling eclipse glasses for $1 per pair; check the visitors&#8217; center at any of the 42 locations statewide.</p>
<p><b>Could I just use a camera instead?</b></p>
<p>Nope. An unfiltered look at the eclipse will leave your fancy digital camera <a href="https://www.space.com/how-to-photograph-a-solar-eclipse" target="_blank" rel="noopener">literally smoking</a>. You need a specialized <a href="https://www.cnn.com/cnn-underscored/outdoors/how-to-take-photos-total-solar-eclipse" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lens filter</a> to take photos of the event with a standalone or phone camera.</p>
<p><b>Okay, okay. Let’s get glasses and filters aplenty. But does this mean the world is about to end?</b></p>
<p>No. Millennia of eclipses have come and gone, and <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/eclipse-apocalypse-end-of-the-world" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the world remains</a>, for better or worse.</p>
<p><b>People are handling this totally normally and rationally online, right?</b></p>
<p>Haha. Of course they aren’t!</p>
<p>A bonkers story from online technology website <a href="https://gizmodo.com/tiktokers-convinced-solar-eclipse-will-break-simulation-1851371946" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gizmodo rounds up</a> some of the wilder claims circulating online. Among them: The eclipse will bring down electrical grids and cellphone service, it will disrupt the “<a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/do-we-live-in-a-simulation-chances-are-about-50-50/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">simulation</a>” in which we all live, and assorted Biblical nonsense.</p>
<p><b>Will animals act all weird?</b></p>
<p>Take a read through the <a href="https://www.sciline.org/environment-energy/total-eclipse-2024-solar-eclipse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">briefing mentioned above</a>. In short, we know that birds and insects quiet down during an eclipse, but they don’t freak out or anything.</p>
<p>“The eclipse is strong enough to suppress that daytime diurnal activity — of day-flying insects and birds going to roost — but it’s not strong enough to initiate the kind of typical nocturnal behaviors we see at sunset,” said Andrew Farnsworth of the Center for Avian Population Studies at the Cornell University Lab of Ornithology.</p>
<p><b>Any other safety tips?</b></p>
<p>The Virginia Department of Transportation sent out <a href="https://www.vdot.virginia.gov/news-events/news/statewide/make-plans-to-rotate-travel-around-solar-eclipse.html" target="_blank">several tips</a> for staying safe on the roads if you plan to travel during the eclipse. Beyond reminding drivers that the darkened skies will reduce visibility and encouraging them to turn on their headlights, VDOT also advised:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not pull over and park on the shoulders or ramps of highways to view or photograph the eclipse</li>
<li>Choose a safe location to stop and see the celestial event</li>
<li>After choosing a safe viewing location, be sure to exit your vehicle cautiously</li>
</ul>
<p>Also among the tips: Don’t drive with your eclipse glasses on.</p>
<p><b>Any events in Virginia I should know about?</b></p>
<p>Again, <a href="https://www.dcr.virginia.gov/state-parks/solar-eclipse" target="_blank">all 42</a> Virginia State Parks are hosting eclipse viewing events, so there&#8217;s sure to be one near you.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://smv.org/explore/things-to-do/eclipse-viewing-party/" target="_blank">Science Museum of Virginia</a> invites the public to The Green (in front of the building) for a free, family-friendly eclipse party in Richmond. You can snag some glasses and buy some ice cream, while you&#8217;re there.</p>
<p>There are loads of opportunities to take in the eclipse in Northern Virginia, according to <a href="https://www.insidenova.com/headlines/celebrate-the-solar-eclipse-with-viewing-events-around-northern-virginia/article_735d668a-f0e4-11ee-9c83-87f482caf868.html" target="_blank">InsideNoVA</a>; one example is a viewing party at the National Air and Space Museum&#8217;s Udvar-Hazy Center in Sterling. If you&#8217;re inclined to venture into D.C., there will be a Solar Eclipse Festival on the National Mall from 12:00-4:00 p.m.</p>
<p>Southwest Virginia peeps, head to Virginia Tech&#8217;s Drillfield, 2:30-4:30 p.m., for an <a href="https://www.science.vt.edu/get-involved/events/eclipse.html" target="_blank">eclipse viewing party</a> complete with free glasses and Moon Pies.</p>
<p><b>When will we get to do this again?</b></p>
<p>That’s a great question! The next eclipse to reach Virginia won’t be until 2078. This article from <a href="https://www.astronomy.com/observing/how-often-do-solar-eclipses-occur/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Astronomy</a> discusses why and how often eclipses occur.</p>
<p><b>Is this good for the country in some way?</b></p>
<p>I can’t imagine it being good or bad for the United States or Virginia. However, the Washington Post opinion section <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2024/03/31/total-solar-eclipse-america/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bravely charged forward</a> with a hot take.</p>
<p>“A four-minute spectacle will not repair the fabric of our country rent by years of mutual distrust, yet if enough of us stand in the path of the moon’s shadow on April 8, the eclipse may remind us of the unity we long to restore,” wrote science correspondent <a href="https://www.american-eclipse.com/author/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">David Baron</a>.</p>
<p><em>This piece was adapted for Virginia. The <a href="https://kansasreflector.com/2024/04/02/solar-spectacle-15-questions-and-answers-about-the-great-kansas-eclipse-of-april-8-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">original</a> was published at the Kansas Reflector, which like the Virginia Mercury, is part of States Newsroom, a nonprofit news network supported by grants and a coalition of donors as a 501c(3) public charity.</em></p>

<p><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+ful+HB1157H1" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 1157</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> cements actions laid out in a 2021 </span><a href="https://rosetta.virginiamemory.com/delivery/DeliveryManagerServlet?dps_pid=IE3440504" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">executive order</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by former Gov. Ralph Northam, including: creating an ombudsman to facilitate dialogue between the tribes, the governor and state agencies; establishing a process to notify tribes of projects requiring permits from the state; and requiring state leaders to seek and consider the tribes’ input on those projects.The Department of Environmental Quality and the Department of Conservation and Recreation, among others, would need to consult with tribes before permitting projects, under the legislation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This bill could save everyone — developers, businesses, state agencies and the tribes —  a lot of time and money, Chief Frank Adams of the Upper Mattaponi tribe told me. Adams is one of the tribal leaders who have been pushing this effort forward for the past two years. A </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/03/07/house-republicans-torpedo-bills-giving-virginia-tribes-state-consultation-rights/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill to give Virginia tribes consultation rights</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was shot down by House Republicans in 2022, although it won unanimous support in the Senate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re not asking for power to stop the permitting process. We are asking to be notified when departments in Virginia, like [the Department of Environmental Quality], are considering permitting a development or project. We need to be brought into the process early on, so we can speak up about any potential conflicts we see,” Adams said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Imagine finding out secondhand, through TV or newspaper reports, that a state agency gave the OK for a mineral mine to be built bordering your backyard. (Side note: Some of us don’t have to imagine, since our communities of color, </span><a href="https://www.epa.gov/environmentaljustice/learn-about-environmental-justice" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">historically</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, have been the usual spots where projects <a href="https://www.usccr.gov/files/pubs/envjust/ch2.htm" target="_blank">fraught with environmental risks</a> that white people don’t want in their neighborhoods develop.) Before many of us could even consider whether the mine would be profitable, or what it would mean for our environment and quality of life, we’d want to know why no one consulted us about it when the plan was first hatched. Shouldn’t the people who stand to be impacted most deeply by projects get a say in their development?</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ATyPhZq1sB"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/03/11/people-or-profits-arena-drama-reflects-a-familiar-struggle/">People or profits: arena drama reflects a familiar struggle</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;People or profits: arena drama reflects a familiar struggle&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/03/11/people-or-profits-arena-drama-reflects-a-familiar-struggle/embed/#?secret=9a2ff01JpP#?secret=ATyPhZq1sB" data-secret="ATyPhZq1sB" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s tribes know their lands and sacred sites far more intimately than developers and regulators do. Of course they should be afforded the opportunity to weigh in on what happens there, before the first permit is issued or the first shovelful of dirt is dug. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adams emphasized that the Mattaponi and other federally recognized tribes are “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">not anti-development, not anti-business.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">” Their goal is not to block projects that could boost local and state revenues or create jobs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s actually the opposite. We don’t mind development but we want the opportunity to say, ‘This project is on or near our burial ground, but if you try to move it a mile down the road it won&#8217;t be a problem.’” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When that conversation doesn’t happen, and projects end up encroaching on sites of special meaning and memory, Adams said “yes, we will eventually protest, and it would cost developers and others lots of money and time. We don’t have to do it that way.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps the most striking example of the backwardness of Virginia’s current process of notifying tribes after a project is well underway is Rassawek.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the James River Water Authority, led by Louisa and Fluvanna Counties, announced its plans to build a pump station, water pipeline, and water treatment plant at Point of Fork in 2014, it sent shock waves through the Monacan Indian Nation. Carbon dating showed that the Monacan’s ancestors had occupied the capital town of Rassawek as early as 3,000 B.C. and Captain John Smith marked it in his 1612 map of Virginia. By the 1930s, researchers determined that the ancient Rassawek was likely located at present-day Point of Fork, and all doubts were removed when the Department of Historic Resources in 1980 officially pinpointed Rassawek’s location, after a gas pipeline’s construction at Point of Fork disturbed Native American burials there.</span></p>

(Cultural Heritage Partners)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Monacans weren’t given the human remains revealed by the pipeline’s construction, according to a </span><a href="https://culturalheritagepartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/SaveRassawekTimeline_9-23-2020.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">by Cultural Heritage Partners, PLLC. At this moment in Virginia, “If you&#8217;re a developer that needs to move a burial ground, you can go to the Department of Historic Resources to get a permit, or go to a circuit court judge to get an order to move the cemetery,” Cultural Heritage Partners attorney Marion Werkheiser said. The more some things change, the more others stay the same.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DEQ issued a permit for the James River Water Authority’s project in 2015. The Water Authority didn’t notify the Monacan Nation of its plans for Rassawek until 2017. What followed was a protracted battle between the tribe and local and state authorities that finally concluded in 2022, when the Water Authority </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/water-authority-abandons-plans-to-site-pump-station-at-rassawek/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">gave up their project plans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at Rassawek and instead chose to develop a water intake and pump station on an alternative site.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just how long have Virginia Native American communities been asking for the type of consideration and respect that HB 1157 is designed to give them?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don&#8217;t want to be cute about it, but this goes back to the treaty the tribes made with the governor of Virginia in 1677,” answered </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Werkheiser. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adams said, “We’ve always wanted the state to consider our beliefs and our traditions more. That goes back to the beginning, for many of us.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It shouldn’t take that amount of time and the eyes of the world watching for Virginia agencies to take culturally competent, decently human actions to preserve sites that are extraordinary in their rareness and importance to Native American nations and Virginia history.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I hope, mightily, that Gov. Glenn Youngkin — who now wields the power to reject this long-sought measure or sign it into law — agrees. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My relationship with the Mercury gave me the chance to make connections with communities that still inform my work and understanding of the state’s dynamics.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was anxious thinking the pipeline&#8217;s compressor station would excise her &#8220;bear friend&#8221; and other animals from the woods surrounding her home. She and other residents asked hard questions — namely, why was it OK to put the compressor in a historic Black neighborhood but not in an affluent white one? — that I couldn&#8217;t answer. But I did ask decision makers to answer those inquiries; that kind of accountability seeking is an essential point of local journalism and remains one of my top goals as a journalist. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am and have always been interested in the problems and possibilities in Virginia.

(Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A proposal to build an arena in Alexandria for two pro sports teams may not be dead, but it’s facing increasingly uncertain odds after Virginia legislators declined to add it to the two-year state budget they released right before the legislative session ended. The situation reflects Virginia’s perennial challenge of balancing developments to boost the state’s economic health against the will and needs of the people who live where the developments unfold.</span></p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Youngkin: legislature flouting ‘broad bipartisan support’ in excluding arena from state budget&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/03/07/youngkin-legislature-flouting-broad-bipartisan-support-in-excluding-arena-from-state-budget/embed/#?secret=E0XvOH6pG3#?secret=DJF9HYSqSV" data-secret="DJF9HYSqSV" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The arena’s exclusion from the budget “befuddled” Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who has been the biggest advocate for the plan that he designed with the billionaire whose company owns the Washington Wizards and Capitals. In response to the legislature’s rejection of the arena project, which was to be partially funded by $2 billion in state bonds stemming from your tax dollars and mine, Youngkin said in a Thursday press conference he couldn’t understand why this “truly transformative” opportunity for Virginia to reap $12 billion in economic benefits wasn’t in the spending plan. He blamed the plan’s most vocal opponent, Sen. Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, without calling her name, for being the “single roadblock” to the plan’s progress. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s true Lucas has been loudly, proudly dead set against the arena project almost since its unveiling late last year. She hasn’t been shy to share her concerns that the “GlennDome,” as she and others on Twitter called it, would have negative implications for the state’s finances and credit rating. She pointed to other priorities that billions of taxpayer dollars could be spent on, like Hampton Roads toll relief and increasing public education funding. She’s not the only one of her political peers who were skeptical of the arena plan, but perhaps more importantly, many Alexandria residents also made it clear that they don’t want the arena in their backyard. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So let me see if I can add some clarity to relieve our governor’s confusion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a community says, “We don&#8217;t want this development here,” too often, local and state governments will dismiss or ignore their opposition in the almighty name of economic opportunity. If boards of supervisors, councils, mayors or governors believe a profit will be made by inviting a corporation to settle down someplace, the promise of profit frequently trumps the opinions of the people who live there.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="pC6vfUIn0c"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/03/28/it-didnt-have-to-be-this-way-wegmans/">It didn’t have to be this way, Wegmans</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;It didn’t have to be this way, Wegmans&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/03/28/it-didnt-have-to-be-this-way-wegmans/embed/#?secret=4zj8PJQLYB#?secret=pC6vfUIn0c" data-secret="pC6vfUIn0c" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Look at Wegmans in Hanover County’s Brown Grove. That community said repeatedly, and clearly, that they didn’t want a huge regional distribution center built in their tiny neighborhood. Yet they —  Wegmans, incentivized by former Gov. Ralph Northam’s</span><a href="https://www.vedp.org/press-release/2019-12/wegmans" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 2019 promise of $2.35 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in state dollars to build the facility and Hanover’s majority-Republican Board of Supervisors, who welcomed Wegmans with open arms and rezoned the area to make the project possible — forced it on them anyway. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wegmans promised its $175 million distribution center would create 700 full-time jobs, and that seemed to satisfy Northam and local leaders, so much so that they tuned out the steadily louder chorus of residents’ protests and environmental justice concerns. The gargantuan center now hulks on nearly 2 million square feet in the middle of a historically Black community that has been the unwilling host of one industrial project site after the other. This kind of thing happens a lot in economically disadvantaged and Black communities inside and outside Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a woman who grew up in Brown Grove told me last year, “We’re tired of hearing how much good this [facility] is going to do for everybody, how it’s going to bring new jobs and all of that. Nobody who’s saying that will have to live with this thing in their neighborhood, they won’t have to hear it or see it or deal with the extra traffic. They say it’s good for everybody but it’s bad for us. Nobody cares, though.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Should possible benefits to many outweigh actual harm to a few?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many other examples of profits-over-people developments in communities statewide, often supported and enabled by local or state government, and the arena project would probably be one more on the list.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A</span><a href="https://www.change.org/p/stop-the-arena-at-potomac-yard" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> petition</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by an opposition group of Alexandrians has over 3,000 signatures from folks who buck the prospect of the arena becoming their neighbor. They worry the arena will worsen traffic, raise taxes, put off noise pollution, decrease property values and disrupt their quality of life, among other concerns. Those worries are valid, and if I lived there, I probably would share some of them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve been following discussions about the arena project on social media. Some in the digital courts of public opinion don’t like that Virginia lawmakers weren’t consulted about the plan earlier in its development process. Others question why they and other Virginia residents should pay for a billionaire’s big idea, and whether the actual cost of the thing would end up being more than the projected total. Again, all of those are fair inquiries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m not naive enough to believe that legislators’ decision to drop the arena deal like a hot potato is due only to their care for constituent concerns. Many are almost certainly using the issue as a political chess piece or for posturing purposes. Still, their blocking the arena also amplifies the voices, needs and desires of the commonwealth’s citizens, which is always a good thing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When, and if, the arena proposal goes away for good, it will give Gov. Youngkin a chance to focus on </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/03/04/va-democrats-fast-track-marriage-equality-gun-bills-headed-to-youngkin/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">priority issues</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that have emerged this session that, unlike the arena, impact people&#8217;s everyday lives — like raising the minimum wage, enhancing gun safety measures, making childcare more affordable and expanding access to </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/contraception-coverage-bills-head-to-youngkins-desk/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reproductive health care</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. A </span><a href="https://cnu.edu/wasoncenter/surveys/archive/2024-01-24.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">majority of Virginians</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> want a retail marijuana market, and it’s included in the state budget, yet the governor is as against it as Lucas is against the arena. It’s 2024, not the Prohibition era; maybe it would be wise to rethink his stance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s still a chance Youngkin could send down a bill that brings the arena back to life and compels lawmakers to discuss it in a special session or he could add it as a budget amendment. But arena or no, Youngkin should review what matters most to his constituents and take action accordingly. </span></p>

Here, across 10 acres that rooted Richmond as the nation’s second-largest flesh market of the American slave trade, a new story seems about to begin, built on the old.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a splashy ceremony inside the cavernous upper level of Main Street Station last week, Richmond leaders unveiled before an audience of hundreds the Shockoe Project, a sprawling memorial pavilion dedicated to the hundreds of thousands of African Americans bought, sold and held there in the 19th century and their experiences as currency in Richmond’s prosperous slave economy. To call it ambitious is an understatement: The $265 million project is slated to take nearly 15 years to complete and will feature seven components that reveal the history of the site, and give it new meaning fit for a 21st century Virginia defined as much by its future as it has always been by its past.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are choosing to move forward by telling Shockoe’s complete story and by honoring and memorializing the lives of enslaved Africans,” outgoing Richmond Mayor Levar Stoney said Tuesday evening, placards of each of the project’s sites curving in a half circle along the front of the airy, glassed-in space, trains leaving and arriving at the outdoor platform a stone’s throw away. The plan proposes a 62,000 square foot National Slavery Museum, the Shockoe Institute, billed as the park’s introductory gateway housed inside Main Street Station, communal and green spaces, and then a restaurant and retail pavilion. All this, combined with existing elements including the African Burial Ground, the Trail of the Enslaved, Lumpkin’s Jail and Winfree Cottage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stoney said the Shockoe Project already has about $38 million in funding: $25 million stemming from the </span><a href="https://www.vpm.org/news/2023-05-09/richmond-budget-fiscal-2024-3billion-tax-housing-revenues" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Capital Improvement Plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ensconced in the city’s 2024 fiscal year budget; $13 million in state dollars from the Virginia General Assembly, and an </span><a href="https://www.mellon.org/grant-details/shockoe-heritage-campus-center:-transforming-richmond's-core-commemorative-landscape-20451741" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$11 million grant</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the Mellon Foundation. “We’re choosing to embrace its complete history and use its unique position to tell a national and even global story of how slavery was intricately connected to this nation’s history, economy, culture and complexity,” Stoney said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That sounds like a very worthy endeavor; yet, much of this plan we’ve heard before, expressed through various, disjointed efforts by historians, politicians, racial justice advocates, preservation organizations and local and state entities. Stoney admitted that it has been at least a decade since the first plans to illuminate Shockoe’s dark history on a grander scale were proposed. People have been debating what to do with Shockoe Bottom for much longer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former Gov. L.

Not only was it never built, but the organization filed for bankruptcy in 2012 and the former governor, the grandson of enslaved people and America’s first Black governor, </span><a href="https://www.wtvr.com/2014/05/08/wilder-slavery-museum" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">then suggested</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> moving the location of his elusive entity to Shockoe Bottom, where it was also never built. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.rva.gov/slave-trail-commission/richmond-city-council-slave-trail-commission" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richmond Slave Trail Commission</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, founded in 1998, oversaw the installment of a </span><a href="https://www.rva.gov/sites/default/files/2022-06/Slave%20Trail%20Brochure.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">walking path</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that winds up from Manchester Docks through the bowels of Richmond’s slave market, allowing modern Virginians and visitors to follow in the footsteps of the bound, passing such horrors as Lumpkin’s Jail – the human holding pen appropriately nicknamed “the Devil’s Half Acre” – and the African Burial Ground (which was until, very recently, coated over with asphalt, a 20th century developmental disrespect to the sacred space which also bore witness to the </span><a href="https://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=15116" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">execution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of enslaved blacksmith and literal freedom fighter </span><a href="https://encyclopediavirginia.org/entries/gabriels-conspiracy-1800/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gabriel</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). The commission’s longtime chair, Del. Dolores McQuinn, D-Richmond, said at Tuesday’s unveiling that the group’s yearslong effort to more fully pay homage to Shockoe’s history – including plans to build a museum at the Lumpkin’s Jail site, excavated in 2008 –  has at times seemed “insurmountable.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2013, former Richmond Mayor Dwight Jones put forward a monstrous plan to build a </span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/richmond-mayor-plans-ballpark-near-site-slave-cemetery-prompts-outcry-flna2d11594917" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hybrid ballpark-slavery memorial</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Shockoe Bottom; thankfully, this very bad idea prompted public outcry and never made it off the bench. You should be sensing a theme by now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The memorial park, a foundational aspect of the Shockoe Project, comes courtesy of the </span><a href="https://www.sacredgroundproject.net/p/contribute.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sacred Ground Historical Reclamation Project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which proffered a community-led proposal for a nine-acre memorial park in 2015. Ana Edwards, a public historian, assistant professor in Virginia Commonwealth University’s African American studies department and Sacred Ground’s chair, is part of the Shockoe Project’s curatorial team. Among this esteemed group of historians whose job it is to “get the story right,” Edwards said she’s an accountability partner who has every reason to believe that this time, Shockoe’s story will be fully, finally told.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What’s different is, all of these elements have come together into a comprehensive plan,” Edwards said in a phone interview. “That&#8217;s never happened before. There’s never been so much collective cooperation on this effort before, and much of it comes directly from [the] community.” The intention that the space will emotionally, spiritually, economically and socially benefit Black people, who have so often endured social injustice in this state and country, is another key piece that is starkly different from past endeavors, said Edwards.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This Black cultural resource is for humanity, but it cannot come into being and generate revenue for the city without it benefitting the Black community. That is baked into this.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By incorporating the Trail of the Enslaved, McQuinn depicted the Shockoe Project as a new way to “leave … a legacy of truth, narrated by the living and by those who we cannot see, but who see us. Narrated from the grave.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many may doubt that the Shockoe Project can be manifested from renderings and grand pans into reality; given the history, it’s understandable if they do. But I want to believe that this project will come to fruition. I would love to take my family there, not to wallow in the suffering of our ancestors, but to show my sons part of our historic narrative as the descendants of free and enslaved Black Virginians. I want to reflect on our peoples’ strength in a space specifically designed to imbue those ancestors with the dignity they were denied in life.</span></p>

The first phase of the project, the Shockoe Institute, is scheduled to open next summer; may the climb continue.</span></p>

She&#8217;d left her home country and traveled to Virginia at the behest of a man who said he loved her and wanted to create a life with her. Instead, she found herself physically and emotionally trapped in his home, forced to cook, clean and have sex with him on demand — or face the consequences.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He told her he&#8217;d go to the authorities about her being here illegally,” said Teresa Christin, executive director of the Avalon Center, an organization that serves 11 localities in greater Williamsburg and the Middle Peninsula, offering emergency shelter and resources to domestic violence and sexual assault survivors. “She couldn&#8217;t speak English, only Spanish, and was totally unfamiliar with the legal system here. She was completely at the mercy of someone who was exploiting her every day.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The woman sheltered at Avalon, where staff are also trained to identify and assist sex and labor trafficking victims, for about six months before returning to her country. Her experience unfortunately wasn’t rare: Although Christin doesn’t think Williamsburg and the surrounding region is a hotbed for sex trafficking, labor trafficking has been a big problem there. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, authorities uncovered the largest labor trafficking case in Virginia history, criminally charging the leaders of a cleaning business that forced 100 Salvadoran immigrants — all of them just 14 to 25 years old — to live and work in a Williamsburg warehouse. One teen </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“often worked 11-hour overnight shifts before going to school in the morning,” reported </span><a href="https://www.wavy.com/news/local-news/3-sentenced-in-williamsburg-human-trafficking-case/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">WAVY</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Human trafficking, a modern form of slavery in which perpetrators force victims to perform labor or sex acts, is a growing problem across the country, including in Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s hard to pinpoint how many children and adults have been trafficked in Virginia, because data to inform the answer is spread across several local, state and federal agencies. </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+sum+SB1669" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bipartisan</span></a> <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+sum+HB2576" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the 2019 General Assembly created a statewide sex trafficking response coordinator position to study, track and report annually on human trafficking prevalence in Virginia. The role was also tasked with making recommendations to eradicate trafficking and working with relevant state agencies, health care providers and social service organizations to develop anti-trafficking standards and training. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the coordinator’s most recent </span><a href="https://www.dcjs.virginia.gov/sites/dcjs.virginia.gov/files/publications/victims/trafficking-response-coordinator-annual-report-2022.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, 6,420 adults and minors were arrested between 2012 and June 2022 </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“for assisting or promoting prostitution, for prostitution, and for human trafficking—commercial sex acts.” Other data sources tally the human cost: From 2007 to 2021, the National Human Trafficking Hotline </span><a href="https://humantraffickinghotline.org/en/statistics/virginia" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">identified</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 3,573 victims (children and adults) involved in 1,689 cases of human trafficking in Virginia. The most common venues for sex trafficking in the commonwealth, the Hotline found, are businesses that front as massage parlors or spas, while labor trafficking often occurs in domestic settings. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sadly, these figures and details don’t show the full scale of the problem, because not every trafficking incident is reported or prosecuted. Nor does the arrest and prosecution of perpetrators end the suffering: Trafficking survivors may be plagued by fear and insecurity, and be left with lasting mental and emotional damage.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s alarming to know that while there is no set profile or characteristics of trafficking victims, the people most often exploited are from already marginalized communities or in vulnerable positions. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.transitionsfvs.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transitions Family Violence Services</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, based in Hampton, was the lead victim service agency that helped the survivors in the Williamsburg labor trafficking case by working in tandem with the </span><a href="https://www.oag.state.va.us/programs-outreach/human-trafficking/hampton-roads-human-trafficking-task-force" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hampton Roads Human Trafficking Task Force</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://samaritanhouseva.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Samaritan House</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Transitions’ Executive Director Sanu Dieng noted by email that in addition to the Williamsburg case, the organization </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">has served 23 survivors of trafficking since 2020. They were a mix of men and women whose ethnicities varied from Asian to Caucasian to Black to Latino.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.justice.gov/humantrafficking/what-is-human-trafficking" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traffickers target </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">youth who are homeless or habitual runaways, or who have been involved in the juvenile justice or child welfare system, the U.S. Department of Justice notes. People lacking legal immigration status, Black people and others of color, LGBTQ+ individuals, migrant workers and people with disabilities or substance use disorders are also frequently ensnared. People who fall into two or more of these categories are at even greater risk. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But even if you aren’t in any of those categories, you could still become a victim, or someone you love could. Nor does it matter if trafficking victims are here illegally, because whatever their citizenship status, all people have a right to safety, shelter and freedom from attacks on their wellbeing. Trafficking is not an issue any of us should shut our eyes against; the suffering of some should be an incentive to action for all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To our lawmakers’ credit, Virginia’s legislative response to human trafficking has been robust in recent years. The state funded the development of the Virginia Analytics System for Trafficking (VAST), a platform that collects data from multiple agencies to determine where, when and how often trafficking is happening here. This information allows a more streamlined response to the problem, but VAST requires additional funding and technical development before it can be used more widely. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">S</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">everal measures in this year’s legislative session attempt to further efforts to uncover, prevent and correct the serious harms of human trafficking.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB581" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 581 </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">would require commonwealth’s attorneys to create multidisciplinary response teams to determine how communities deal with sex and labor trafficking and review best practices for trauma-informed care that centers victims during the evidence gathering process</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB203" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another measure</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> likely heading to the governor’s desk would require private security company employees to undergo training to recognize and report signs of human trafficking. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB633" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 633</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> enacts stiff criminal penalties for labor traffickers, adds labor trafficking to anti-racketeering rules in state code and defines labor trafficking as a barrier crime that precludes offenders from working as caregivers to children, senior citizens or disabled people. </span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="HukobsDMDO"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/02/16/three-interesting-bills-labor-trafficking-city-council-salary-caps-and-employee-retaliation/">Three interesting bills: labor trafficking, city council salary caps and employee retaliation</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These bills and authorities’ efforts to curb human trafficking are laudable, but it also takes the vigilance of everyday citizens to make a lasting impact. If you see something, say something: Send human trafficking tips to Virginia State Police by texting </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">847411 (type VSP and then your tip). You can also contact your local social services office, or</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> call the National Human Trafficking Hotline at </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">1-888-373-7888 or text HELP to 233733. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While legislators do their part, a simple text or phone call from the rest of us could prevent many men, women and children from being abused and exploited in Virginia. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of those priorities are expected to win final passage in the weeks ahead, but they’re heading to an uncertain fate at the hands of Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who has not yet played a major role in the policymaking process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the governor pushing hard for a Northern Virginia sports arena deal, the story of the 2024 session could come down to whether Youngkin and Democratic leaders can strike a bargain that gives both sides some of what they want.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of that negotiating could be worked out through the state budget, which will take up more of legislators’ time in the session’s second half.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tuesday was the deadline for the state Senate and House of Delegates to finish work on their bills before they cross over to be heard by the other body. Here’s a rundown of what’s happened on big issues so far: </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Sports arena</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legislation that would create a sports authority to issue $2 billion in bonds to build a new arena for the Washington Wizards and Capitals in Alexandria has been one of the most closely watched proposals of the session. Backed by Youngkin, the project envisions the construction of not only the arena, but a new entertainment district in the Potomac Yard neighborhood that the governor says could produce $12 billion in revenues over the coming decades. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The authority bill has cleared the House with a reenactment clause that would require the General Assembly to approve the proposal again in 2025 for the project to move forward. But it died in the Senate after Finance and Appropriations Chair Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, said </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/02/12/nova-arena-proposal-runs-into-trouble-as-top-senate-democrat-presses-pause/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">she wouldn’t bring it to a vote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, citing concerns with the project’s financing and what she and Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, described as Youngkin’s unwillingness to negotiate with Democrats. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, some members of the Senate have signified they aren’t abandoning the arena idea. “To quote Eric Idle — it’s not dead yet,” Surovell </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/02/12/monumental-arena-youngkin-bowser-bill-general-assembly/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">told The Washington Post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Monday. “We are always open to talking about ways to try to alleviate our concerns, but the conversations need to happen ASAP.”</span></p>

<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Taxes</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin came into the 2024 legislative session </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/12/20/youngkin-budget-calls-for-income-tax-cuts-sales-tax-increases/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">seeking major tax reforms</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: an across-the-board 12% cut in income taxes, a bump in the state sales and use tax from 4.3% to 5.2%, and an expansion of the sales and use tax to digital goods like digital downloads and streaming services. He also proposed eradication of the widely disliked car tax, a goal that has eluded</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/05/20/two-words-for-local-governments-considering-keeping-windfall-car-tax-collections-jim-gilmore/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> former Republican governors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and would require more than one piece of legislation to accomplish.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/youngkin-tax-cuts-virginia-budget-general-assembly/article_8554e5fa-c4f4-11ee-a464-0b251d3ab4b3.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats rejected bills to carry out much of that agenda</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which they have complained would disproportionately harm lower-income people. While the ideas remain alive in the governor’s budget proposal, their prospects appear dim as the House and Senate prepare to unveil their own two-year spending plans on Sunday. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Banning legacy admissions</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legislation to ban the practice of providing special treatment in college admissions decisions to applicants related to alumni and donors is on course to reach the governor after both chambers </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/blog-va/bills-banning-legacy-admissions-clear-both-virginia-chambers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">unanimously backed the proposal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the legislation passes for a second time and the governor signs it into law, all of Virginia’s public colleges and universities would be prohibited from engaging in the admissions practice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Education Reform Now, a think tank, says more than 100 colleges and universities have ended legacy admissions since 2015, but 787 still used the practice as of 2020.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Gambling</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a major policy reversal for the General Assembly, skill games — the slots-like machines tucked into corners of gas stations and bars all over the state — appear to be on track to be fully legalized, taxed and regulated. Lawmakers have signaled </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/02/13/virginia-lawmakers-vote-to-lift-ban-on-skill-games-but-details-are-uncertain/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">broad, bipartisan support for repealing a skill game ban</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that first took effect in 2021, but they haven’t finalized the details of how tough or lenient the new regulatory structure should be.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers punted on a proposal to allow a voter referendum on </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/02/06/virginia-senate-postpones-northern-virginia-casino-plan-until-2025/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a potential casino in Fairfax County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, blocked an effort to allow </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/01/30/virginia-house-panel-scuttles-plan-for-cruise-ship-casinos-in-state-waters/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cruise ship casinos</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to operate in Virginia waters and again said no to the idea of allowing sports betting on college games involving Virginia schools.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After Richmond voters said no to a casino twice, legislators have advanced a bill to give Petersburg voters a chance to weigh in on whether their city should host a casino in the capital region. Another piece of legislation moving forward would take Richmond off the state’s list of cities allowed to pursue casinos.</span></p>

<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Guns</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leaving </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2020/02/17/va-senate-committee-blocks-assault-weapon-bill-4-democrats-vote-to-push-it-to-2021/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">past caution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> behind, Democrats have passed dozens of new gun control bills, many of which are almost certain to be vetoed by the governor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those proposals include a ban on assault-style weapons manufactured after July 1, a ban on untraceable “ghost guns” assembled at home, a five-day waiting period for gun purchases and several bills meant to encourage safe gun storage, particularly when children are present.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few gun bills have picked up Republican votes, most notably a proposal to ban auto sears, small attachable devices that can produce automatic fire from semi-automatic handguns. Unregistered auto sears are already banned under federal law, but the Virginia bill aims to create a state-level ban that would give police more power to remove them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans have criticized Democrats for blocking their proposals to toughen criminal penalties for people convicted of multiple gun crimes.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Minimum wage</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A top Democratic priority for the session, legislation to raise the state’s minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2026 has cleared both the House and Senate on strict party-line votes. The bills continue a process started by Democrats in 2020, when they began raising the minimum wage from the federal floor of $7.25 per hour to the current level of $12 per hour.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislation is virtually doomed, however: While Youngkin hasn’t promised to veto the bill, he’s tiptoed right up to the line. At a small business-focused event in Richmond this January, </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/01/23/the-market-is-working-youngkin-signals-opposition-to-minimum-wage-hike/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">he told reporters</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> there was no need for the General Assembly to send him a bill “because the market is handling it. And they should allow small businesses to handle this.” </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Behavioral health reforms</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a state report found severe overcrowding and understaffing at Virginia’s nine state-run mental health hospitals, both Democrats and Republicans have backed </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/02/14/bills-to-ease-strain-on-state-mental-hospitals-advance-without-bed-of-last-resort-changes/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">proposals that aim to ease the strain on the facilities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Bills that try to reduce “inappropriate” admissions of patients with conditions like autism or dementia, align nursing schedules with industry standards and step up investigations of abuse and neglect allegations have gotten unanimous support. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers have stopped short of recommendations to reform Virginia’s “bed of last resort” law, which requires state hospitals to accept any patient under an involuntary commitment order if a bed can’t be found for them in a private facility. A December report found the law was contributing to dangerous numbers of patients in state wards. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Constitutional amendments</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats came into the session with several big ideas for constitutional amendments on abortion, same-sex marriage and voting rights, but decided to push them off until next year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those amendments would scrap Virginia’s longstanding policy of stripping voting rights for life after a felony conviction unless a governor restores them, create a state-level right to abortion and ensure same-sex marriage remains legal in Virginia no matter what future rulings come out of the U.S. Supreme Court.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because those amendments need to be approved by the General Assembly in both 2025 and 2026 before going to voters for a final decision, passing the amendments this year wouldn’t have made the process any faster. Waiting a year could also bring strategic advantages for Democrats, giving them more time to reassess the political environment after the 2024 presidential race and build momentum heading into Virginia’s 2025 elections.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Weed</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both chambers have approved legislation to allow retail marijuana sales for recreational use, which remains a major unfinished piece of Democratic efforts to decriminalize and regulate weed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats are still working out the details of how a state-sanctioned retail market would work, but they don’t appear to be having much luck yet convincing Youngkin to allow legal weed stores on his watch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless, a recreational marijuana bill could still land on Youngkin’s desk, forcing him to veto it or give in as part of a broader legislative deal with Democratic leaders.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Abortion</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With abortion access in Virginia protected due to last year’s election results, Democrats have passed several bills meant to protect abortion providers and women seeking abortions in Virginia from being targeted by authorities in other states with abortion bans.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="3rNQQMmxu7"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/02/12/a-slap-in-the-face-va-house-gop-forced-to-reject-own-members-anti-abortion-bill/">‘A slap in the face’: Va.

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;‘A slap in the face’: Va. House GOP forced to reject own member’s anti-abortion bill&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/02/12/a-slap-in-the-face-va-house-gop-forced-to-reject-own-members-anti-abortion-bill/embed/#?secret=xLPf5S7FfK#?secret=3rNQQMmxu7" data-secret="3rNQQMmxu7" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=SB377&amp;submit=GO" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would prohibit anyone from being extradited to another state for abortion offenses that are not a crime in Virginia. </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB78" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would prohibit law enforcement from getting search warrants for menstrual data stored in period-tracking apps, a preemptive safeguard abortion rights advocates say would prevent private health information from being seized for abortion-related prosecutions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proposals creating a state-level right to contraception — another measure advocates have pitched as a way to prevent further erosion of reproductive rights — have also passed both chambers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats have defeated several GOP-sponsored bills to ban or restrict abortion. One of those bills created </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/02/12/a-slap-in-the-face-va-house-gop-forced-to-reject-own-members-anti-abortion-bill/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">high drama</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the House when Democrats forced Republicans to take an up or down vote on whether all public funding for abortion should be banned with no exceptions for rape, incest, severe fetal abnormalities and when the life of the mother is at risk. After trying to avoid the vote altogether, nearly all Republicans ended up voting against the bill that came from their side.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re going to continue to push this issue out there until they all capitulate and start backing women’s reproductive health care,” House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, said of his move to bring the anti-abortion bill to the floor for a recorded vote. “Because they’ll continue to lose elections on this issue.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Same-sex marriage</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s Constitution still has an antiquated ban on same-sex marriage voters approved in 2006, but Democrats have been trying for years to overcome GOP opposition and give voters a chance to formally approve marriage equality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats are waiting until next year to begin the process of formally scrapping the ban, but they’ll also probably need to retain control of the House in the 2025 elections and pass the amendment again in 2026 before it can go to voters in November of 2026.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For now, Democrats are pushing forward a mostly symbolic </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB174" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> stating that marriage licenses must be issued regardless of the gender, sex or race of the two people involved. That legislation has picked up a few Republican votes in the process, but it’s unclear how Youngkin will handle it.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Local taxes for modernizing schools</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both chambers backed a bill that would let local governments increase their sales tax by 1% to pay for school construction projects as long as voters OK the increase in a referendum. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the last two years of split control of the General Assembly, the </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB14" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> died twice in the House after Republicans balked at the idea of raising taxes. But this year, the proposals have gotten strong bipartisan support, passing the Senate on a 27-13 vote and the House on a 69-28 vote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, local governments have control over adjustments to their property tax rates but aren’t allowed to change the sales tax rate without explicit permission from the General Assembly. Under current law, </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/02/24/virginia-explained-why-can-just-nine-localities-impose-a-sales-tax-for-school-capital-projects/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">only nine localities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can impose a 1% sales tax to fund school construction and renovation projects. </span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="JJrEW1LW9J"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/01/15/as-data-centers-continue-spreading-across-virginia-state-lawmakers-propose-new-development-rules/">As data centers continue spreading across Virginia, state lawmakers propose new development rules</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;As data centers continue spreading across Virginia, state lawmakers propose new development rules&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/01/15/as-data-centers-continue-spreading-across-virginia-state-lawmakers-propose-new-development-rules/embed/#?secret=Y3atwKTcJ5#?secret=JJrEW1LW9J" data-secret="JJrEW1LW9J" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Data centers</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers introduced roughly a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/01/15/as-data-centers-continue-spreading-across-virginia-state-lawmakers-propose-new-development-rules/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">dozen bills</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to address the ongoing proliferation of data centers in Virginia. But only one has made it through crossover, with the others headed to the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission, which </span><a href="https://jlarc.virginia.gov/pdfs/resolutions/2024_Data%20centers_JLARC.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">voted in December</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to conduct a study of data centers in Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Let’s have JLARC have a look at it and move forward on data center and environment issues created by them in a uniform fashion and come up with really good public policy,” said Sen. Dave Marsden, D-Fairfax, during discussion of one proposal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lone bill to make it out of its chamber, from Del. Josh Thomas, D-Prince William, initially would have required local governments to conduct site assessments ahead of approving a project but was amended to say they can do the assessments if they want. It could face trouble in the Senate, which sent a similar version to JLARC for study.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Paid family and medical leave</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A proposal to set up a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/01/29/virginia-democrats-again-push-for-paid-family-and-medical-leave/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">state-run, universal paid family and medical leave program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> modeled on the state’s unemployment insurance program passed the Senate but never made it out of the House Appropriations Committee. Uniform Republican opposition to the idea also indicates that even if the legislation makes it through the Democratic-controlled legislature, it’s unlikely to gain Youngkin’s favor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the proposal, both employers and employees would contribute small amounts to a state insurance fund that would then pay out 80% of a worker’s wages for up to 12 weeks annually if the worker had to take time off for the birth of a child, care for a family member or a serious health condition. Twelve states and Washington, D.C. have instituted similar programs to date. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Rent stabilization</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The third time was not the charm for Suffolk Democratic Del. Nadarius Clark&#8217;s proposed measure to stabilize rent increases, which </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/11/11/4-takeaways-on-housing-in-light-of-thursdays-inflation-report/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">surged statewide</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> during the pandemic and are still a big concern for some Virginia residents and advocates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clark&#8217;s </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB721" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 721</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would have given localities the option to create anti-rent gouging ordinances and the power to enforce them, required that landlords give tenants at least two months&#8217; notice before hiking rent, and capped annual rent increases between 7% and 15%. Lawmakers in the House Courts of Justice Committee voted to continue the measure until 2025. Clark had put forward similar legislation in the </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+sum+HB596" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2022</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB1532" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2023 </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislative sessions, both of which failed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A companion </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB366" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Sen. Jennifer Boysko, D-Fairfax, was also defeated. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">SCC judges</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It took almost two years for the General Assembly to fill two vacancies on the State Corporation Commission, the arm of state government that regulates utilities, insurance, banking and business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A political standoff in the formerly divided legislature ended this session after Democrats took control of both chambers and appointed Kelsey Bagot, an attorney with NextEra Energy and former adviser to a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission member, and Sam Towell, an attorney for Smithfield Foods and former lawyer with the Office of the Attorney General. The appointments mean retired judges will no longer need to be recalled to maintain a quorum.</span></p>

A National Historic Landmark, visitors may now visit the building that became a museum in 1896. (Matthew Brady/National Archives)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a move prompted by a persistent Virginia Beach teenager, the Virginia Senate this week advanced a bill to remove the United Daughters of the Confederacy (UDC) from the list of nonprofit and charitable organizations exempt from real estate, deed recordation and personal property taxes in Virginia state code. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fantastic. As </span><a href="https://encyclopediavirginia.org/entries/united-daughters-of-the-confederacy/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lost Cause devotees and American traitor venerators</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the UDC should never have been on that list to begin with. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/02/07/virginia-assembly-confederate-tax-exemption/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Washington Post&#8217;s Greg Schneider reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that Virginia Beach high schooler Simone Nied, 17, started advocating for the UDC&#8217;s tax exemptions to be stripped two years ago. Her requests culminated in </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB568" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House of Delegates </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB517" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bills to do just that. The loss of the tax exemptions, as Schneider noted, could mean a yearly tax payment to the state of at least $50,000, if the measures are approved by Gov. Glenn Youngkin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the 1890s when the UDC was founded, America was in the final throes of Reconstruction, the process of putting our fractured nation back together again after the Civil War. For a short time, it seemed the country would make good on its promises of life and liberty to millions of Black Americans who had been freed from slavery and were eager to enjoy the full benefits of citizenship. They bought land and started farms, educated themselves and even pursued </span><a href="https://encyclopediavirginia.org/entries/african-american-legislators-in-virginia-1867-1899/#:~:text=%E2%80%931878%2C%20Republican.-,John%20Robinson%20(1825%20or%201826%E2%80%931908)%2C%20from%20Cumberland,%2C%201869%E2%80%931871%2C%20Republican." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">political power</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then </span><a href="https://www.history.com/topics/early-20th-century-us/jim-crow-laws" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jim Crow</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> came, which rolled back most of that progress and all but stamped out the fledgling embers of advancement Black people had strived so hard to achieve. As Black Virginians entered the nadir of 20th century racial terror and socioeconomic disenfranchisement, the UDC was founded under the banner of honoring the Confederate soldiers who had fought for the right to continue enslaving those same Black Virginians’ parents, grandparents and ancestors. The daughters and descendents of Confederates in Virginia and elsewhere in the South were determined to restore the social dichotomies and disparities of the “good old days,” when African Americans had no civil or human rights and when white people wielded power in all aspects of society. It is no coincidence that most of Virginia’s Confederate monuments and memorial societies were </span><a href="https://www.splcenter.org/20190201/whose-heritage-public-symbols-confederacy" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">created</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as the nation reenacted a legal system of segregation and discrimination designed to put Black folks back in their place and keep white folks on top. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The UDC has continued to cling to this mission, often disguised with flowery phrases about honoring Southern sacrifice and bravery while never acknowledging the white supremacist ideals that intertwine that mindset. The hate such a stance represents cannot be separated from its heritage — I don’t care how many tepid anti-racism statements UDC adds to their largely-inaccessible-to-the-public </span><a href="https://hqudc.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or how much bunk they get unnamed advocates to spew in newspapers alleging their group </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“only does good in its community.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s with all of this in mind that I commend Ms. Nied and Virginia’s senators and delegates for trying to stop public dollars from subsidizing an organization inextricably rooted on the wrong side of history. It’s a nice companion to other </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB132" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bills</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and resolutions focused on righting wrongs, </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB32" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">improving lives</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SJ16" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">acknowledging</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — if not repairing — harms endured by Virginians of color for centuries. The Senate and House legislation on ending UDC’s tax breaks needs to be reconciled, and then the ball will be in Gov. Youngkin’s court.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An aside: I don’t know if our governor will accept the Assembly’s proposal, but it would be hard to imagine any modern-day presidential hopeful successfully ascending to the White House trailing the scent of moldy Confederate memorials. If the top job of leading an increasingly multicultural 21st century America is his ambition, he’d do well to sop up his </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/12/16/confederate-memorial-arlington-cemetery/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">disappointment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with the removal of mementos commemorating the most divisive period of the nation’s history from public spaces, and he probably shouldn’t buck the proposed end of the UDC’s tax-free days either.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While we’re considering organizations that don’t deserve to skip out on paying taxes, I’d suggest some Virginia churches be next up for review. Specifically, the ones that </span><a href="https://www.christianpost.com/news/judge-rejects-churches-challenge-to-virginia-lgbt-antidiscrimination-law.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">discriminate against LGBTQ+ people</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, allow </span><a href="https://www.timesnews.net/news/education/church-rally-focuses-on-political-participation/article_a7526f66-f0d9-11eb-94f9-377865f0f2d4.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">politics to infiltrate the pulpit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and destroy </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/style/wp/2018/06/25/feature/former-members-say-calvary-temple-splits-families-what-happens-to-those-who-leave/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">family relationships</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The point is not to persecute religious organizations, most of which I believe provide foundational support to many citizens’ spiritual and emotional wellbeing and strengthen communities in ways more valuable than mere money ever could. But just as legislators’ proposal to end the UDC’s tax-free days exemplifies, reexamining the activities of wayward churches would be another opportunity to seriously consider if we’re using our state’s fiscal resources the best and fairest way we can. Can I get an amen? </span></p>

As AI continues infiltrating nearly every aspect of our society, it’s crucial that Virginia lawmakers and experts continue to study its benefits and risks. That task is particularly urgent as the technology has been shown to perpetuate inequity that already exists in many of our systems.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The blessing and curse of AI</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are several pieces of legislation related to AI up for debate now in Virginia’s General Assembly. </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+fuh+HB249+700025" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 249</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> calls for the development of a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “comprehensive framework” for how law enforcement agencies use AI and a model policy to guide criminal justice systems’ use of machine learning technology by 2025. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such measures sure would have been helpful five years ago, before Norfolk police briefly used </span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2020/09/09/norfolk-police-tried-a-controversial-facial-recognition-app-that-has-billions-of-photos-maybe-yours/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a facial recognition app</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> developed by Clearview AI to identify suspects in criminal investigations without public knowledge and without oversight from city or state leaders. Not only was that a huge privacy concern, but it could also have misidentified people — especially people of color — and connected them to a crime they had nothing to do with. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) tested 189 face recognition algorithms, and found that most facial recognition AI systems have a significantly higher rate of false positive identifications for photos of Black, Asian, and indigenous people’s faces than for photos of white people’s faces,” Dr. Jennifer Rhee, director of the </span><a href="https://humanitiescenter.vcu.edu/labs/ai-futures-lab/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AI Futures Lab</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at Virginia Commonwealth University, told me by email. “Some facial recognition systems were found to have false positive rates 10 [times] to 100 [times] higher for Black, Native American, and Asian people than for white people.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite those very high error rates, versions of this technology are currently being used by some police departments in America, and for surveillance of public spaces and national borders. That may spell “serious consequences for the people who are erroneously identified by these systems,” Rhee added. </span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facial recognition technology is riddled with bias, because most of the images used to train algorithms to recognize faces are white, male faces. Most of the engineers developing this technology over the past decade are also </span><a href="https://aiindex.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2021-AI-Index-Report-_Chapter-6.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">white and male</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">; they create tech tools in their own image, and any bias they have is reflected in those creations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Recent studies demonstrate that machine learning algorithms can discriminate based on classes like race and gender,” reads a </span><a href="https://proceedings.mlr.press/v81/buolamwini18a/buolamwini18a.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2018 MIT study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> led by Joy Buolamwini and Timnit Gebru that evaluated three commercial AI-powered facial recognition tools that consistently misidentified darker-skinned people’s gender, while almost always getting the gender of lighter-skinned people right. Other tools don’t recognize Black faces as human, as demonstrated in 2015 when Google Photos automatically sorted 80 photos of a Black man into a folder it labeled </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/15/technology/artificial-intelligence-google-bias.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“gorillas.”</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Because AI systems are trained on data produced by society, these systems reflect society’s biases and power dynamics,” Rhee told me by email. </span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Legislative efforts </h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Artificial intelligence has been under study by state lawmakers since 2020, when the Artificial Intelligence Subcommittee of the Joint Commission on Technology and Science was </span><a href="https://studiesvirginiageneralassembly.s3.amazonaws.com/meeting_docs/documents/000/000/673/original/Final_HayesJCOTSLetter_Aug.pdf?1596734736" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">founded</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The function of the group, subcommittee chair Del. Cliff Hayes, D-Chesapeake, told me last summer, is to help legislators get a better understanding of how the technology works and its implications in Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We need to be equipped to deal with this in Virginia because AI and other technologies are evolving so rapidly, we can&#8217;t necessarily sit around and wait for federal guidelines,” said Hayes, who has had a nearly 30-year career in programming and technology management and is currently the city of Portsmouth&#8217;s chief information officer. It&#8217;s important to view AI and other technological developments holistically, and to not focus exclusively on either the positive or negative aspects, he added.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Kqcct3lc13"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/07/18/as-employers-expand-artificial-intelligence-in-hiring-few-states-have-rules/">As employers expand artificial intelligence in hiring, few states have rules</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;As employers expand artificial intelligence in hiring, few states have rules&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/07/18/as-employers-expand-artificial-intelligence-in-hiring-few-states-have-rules/embed/#?secret=IdmXMPqGdE#?secret=Kqcct3lc13" data-secret="Kqcct3lc13" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2021, Virginia’s legislature banned police departments across the commonwealth from using facial recognition technology without first gaining permission from the state. But policymakers quickly concluded that approach meant Virginia would miss out on the legitimate ways AI could aid law enforcement and criminal justice efforts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;An all-out ban of AI isn&#8217;t the answer, we learned,&#8221; Hayes said. &#8220;The answer was to dissect and deal with the technology as it advances, so that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re doing.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2022, legislators </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+sum+SB741" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rolled back the ban</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, allowing police departments to use facial recognition only in certain instances. That legislation also required the Virginia State Police to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;develop a model policy regarding the investigative uses of facial recognition technology&#8221; and mandated that any facial recognition technology used in Virginia &#8220;be evaluated by the National Institute of Standards and Technology and have an accuracy score of at least 98 percent true positives across all demographic groups.&#8221; The second measure was intended to address public concerns that the technology is less accurate in recognizing the faces of people with darker skin tones. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In June, Attorney General Jason Miyares co-authored a letter written by attorneys general of 23 states entreating the</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">National Telecommunications and Information Administration to review AI governance policies. The </span><a href="https://files.constantcontact.com/d3e83e11901/bf211eb0-2a5c-4ccc-bb61-475714b902db.pdf?rdr=true" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">letter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> cited data privacy, the need to develop AI safely without hampering innovation and the technology’s possible impact on individuals&#8217; legal and personal information as causes for concern and caution.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last September, Gov. Glenn Youngkin issued a similarly themed </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/news-releases/2023/september/name-1014625-en.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">executive order</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on artificial intelligence that focused on four areas: legal requirements, especially those related to privacy or intellectual property; policy standards for state agencies; appropriate IT safeguards such as cybersecurity and firewalls; and training for students. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That sounded good and all, except there wasn’t a focus area dedicated specifically to one of the foremost challenges of AI: its well-known, deeply researched biases that fuel systemic discrimination against some groups of people, usually those who are already marginalized. This directive made me wonder if the governor truly had an interest in safeguarding Virginians of color and </span><a href="https://hls.harvard.edu/today/algorithms-and-their-unintended-consequences-for-the-poor/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">impoverished people</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from this pervasive problem. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s latest AI-related executive order, released in January, steps up to meet that challenge. Standards for how the technology should be used and taught in the state’s public schools and guidelines for AI’s use in state agency databases issued through the order do strive to prevent harmful AI practices “</span><a href="https://www.education.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/secretary-of-education/pdf/AI-Education-Guidelines.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">based on inherent biases that lead to discriminatory outcomes”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and “</span><a href="https://www.vita.virginia.gov/media/vitavirginiagov/it-governance/ea/pdf/EA-Solutions-Artificial-Intelligence-Standard.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">mitigate any risk of bias and discrimination by AI Systems</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.” That’s a sign the governor is listening to and learning from experts and everyday citizens concerned about how AI could unfairly impact some of us; it’s a good start.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Suhas Subramanyam, D-Loudoun, a few weeks ago introduced </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SJ14" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Joint Resolution 14</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which orders the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission to continue studying the impact of AI in the state with a specific focus on understanding </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“deep fakes, data privacy implications, and misinformation,” making sure the technology doesn’t “indirectly or directly lead to discrimination,” finding ways to “promote equity in AI algorithms,” and looking at how AI can “improve government operations and services.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subramanyam, who was a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">technology policy adviser in the administration of former President Barack Obama,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> said his professional as well as personal experiences prompted him to put forward this measure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We shouldn&#8217;t necessarily stifle and overregulate [artificial intelligence], but we should look at how we can prevent bad practices and behaviors” that stem from it, he told me during a 9 p.m. interview earlier this week. (It was the only time he could talk after a full day at Capitol Square; I whispered my questions to him from my bedroom closet, hoping not to wake my kids. That he would make time to speak on AI after hours spoke volumes about his interest in and passion for the subject.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I come from an immigrant family, and one of the things I&#8217;ve found, as someone with a ‘funny’ name like mine and a background like mine, you tend to find a lot of overgeneralizations or caricatures of your culture already, and those things also show up in the datasets that we use with AI and emergent tech,” Subramanyam said. “If you&#8217;ve got a dataset that&#8217;s not representative of all communities and cultures, then you will have an outcome that represents that characterization and misrepresentation.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, among the roughly two dozen measures dealing with AI that are on the table this session is </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+ful+SB621" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 621</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which would establish a commission dedicated solely to advising the governor on AI policy in Virginia; I think Youngkin could surely use the help, and future leaders could too. Through this bill and others, Virginia now has the opportunity to implement artificial intelligence, machine learning and other emerging technologies in a responsible, ethical way that takes into account the specific harms possible for many of its citizens. </span></p>

Some women also report memory problems and trouble bonding with their babies. In Virginia, over 11% of mothers surveyed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2021 reported PPD symptoms. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first oral medication to treat postpartum depression, approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration last year and made available in speciality pharmacies in December, is a new tool to combat the common yet underreported problem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“PPD is the most common complication of childbirth occurring in about 10 to 15% of all pregnancies, with higher rates in women with a preexisting mood disorder like major depression or bipolar disorder,” explained Dr. Jennifer Payne, a reproductive psychiatrist, professor and vice chair of research in the University of Virginia’s Department of Psychiatry and Neurobehavioral Sciences. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PPD isn&#8217;t just just feeling sad; it can contribute to serious behavioral health challenges for women that are sometimes deadly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Mental health conditions including suicide and substance abuse remain the leading cause of maternal mortality during and after pregnancy, and PPD is a key player in that statistic,” said Payne.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="kqyiHYBpE6"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/07/10/study-shows-sharp-increases-in-maternal-deaths-over-two-decades/">Study shows sharp increases in maternal deaths over two decades</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Study shows sharp increases in maternal deaths over two decades&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/07/10/study-shows-sharp-increases-in-maternal-deaths-over-two-decades/embed/#?secret=QG7zzvjFLk#?secret=kqyiHYBpE6" data-secret="kqyiHYBpE6" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than mothers are affected. Babies of mothers experiencing PPD may also have lower IQ, delayed language development and psychological problems.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the clinical description of PPD sounds scary, the reality of living through the experience is terrifying. I was diagnosed with PPD six weeks after the birth of my first baby. To this day, my memory of those early days is clouded, and I regret what I simply can’t recall due to the illness; what I can almost makes me shudder.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What I remember most clearly are not the newborn snuggles and blissful bonding with the tiny human I’d grown inside my body and brought into the world in a torrent of the most severe pain and complete joy I’d ever experienced. Instead, I recall the utter exhaustion, our disorientingly blended days and nights, and the sinking feeling that I was already failing my child, whom I was sure deserved a better, more capable mama. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A voracious reader since my elementary school days, I lost all interest in books and didn’t read any of the novels I’d stockpiled throughout my pregnancy. I withdrew from my family, even my husband, somehow convinced that I should be able to care for my baby with as little assistance as possible. I anxiously counted down the days until my maternity leave was up and cried more than I ever had; my son’s little face was often wet with my tears and his.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My OB-GYN pinpointed the problem as PPD and prescribed an antidepressant pill, though not one designed specifically for postpartum depression and anxiety. The medication took a while to fully integrate into my system and start working: Although I gave birth in January, it wasn’t until mid-May that I started to feel like myself again. Had the newly approved PPD pill, zuranolone, been available then, it could have saved me months of struggle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Unlike standard antidepressant treatments, zuranolone has a very quick response — most women taking it for PPD have responses as early as three days after starting the medication,” Payne told me. “This is far faster than standard antidepressant treatments, which take weeks to even months to initiate response.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not all mothers with PPD may be able to access the new treatment, as the cost — </span><a href="https://investor.sagerx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/sage-therapeutics-announces-third-quarter-2023-financial-results?_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8AuY_inv_mzKpZLA5Xi-OLW6R5OfIIRw5Va-MjVCKMagqJ3D-9zXW77XhBt66dxJjYI3T8iXguQ5Qv7479aZzaYwlqGDjYCeJlozMyQuf44tZV7yc&amp;_hsmi=281525450&amp;utm_campaign=the_readout&amp;utm_content=281525450&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hs_email" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$15,900 per 14-day course</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> without insurance — could be prohibitive, especially for low-income families or those without insurance or access to health care. (For Virginia families who need it, the state offers the </span><a href="https://www.dmas.virginia.gov/for-members/for-pregnant-women/famis-moms/#:~:text=The%20FAMIS%20MOMS%20program%20provides,for%20a%20healthy%20birth%20outcome." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FAMIS MOMS</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> program, which provides prenatal care to uninsured pregnant mothers who aren’t eligible for Medicaid up to a year after birth.) Sage Therapeutics and Biogen, the drug’s creators, offer </span><a href="https://www.zurzuvae.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">financial assistance programs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help offset the hefty cost, but terms and conditions apply and not all mothers may be eligible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s unclear exactly how many providers in Virginia have prescribed zuranolone (known commercially as Zurzuevae) or which medical facilities offer it, since it so recently became available. Payne said the drug will “absolutely be available through the </span><a href="https://newsroom.uvahealth.com/2023/05/19/uva-health-opens-mental-health-clinic-new-mothers-moms-to-be/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">UVA Perinatal Mental Health Clinic</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” and hopefully, other institutions in the state will follow suit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond medication, there are also legislative efforts underway now in Virginia’s General Assembly session to boost awareness of PPD and other maternal health issues women in Virginia experience. One such measure is freshman Democratic Del. Destiny LeVere Bolling’s </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB935" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 935</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which would require insurance companies to cover state-certified doula care for pregnant people. The same measure </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/01/30/virginia-lawmakers-ask-for-study-on-requiring-insurers-to-cover-doula-care/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">failed in last year’s session</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, when lawmakers rejected the bills and instead ordered a state study of mandated health insurance benefits.  Virginia Medicaid currently covers doula care.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Doulas — trained workers who provide non clinical support and guidance to moms before, during and after pregnancy — have been found in studies to </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10292163/#:~:text=A%20recent%20retrospective%20cohort%20study,their%20counterparts%20without%20third%2Dparty" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reduce rates of postpartum depression and anxiety</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in mothers by as much as 57.5%.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bolling is also carrying </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+ful+HJ44" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Joint Resolution 44</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, seeking to designate April 11 through April 17 of each year as Black Maternal Health Week in Virginia. Not only are Black women in Virginia</span><a href="https://vcij.org/stories/for-expectant-and-new-mothers-in-virginia-troubling-covid-19-trend" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> twice as likely to die </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">during or after childbirth than white women, but nationally, Black women are</span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3733216/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> less likely</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to receive proper treatment for PPD. Bolling’s bills are as timely for the public good as they are personal for her. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A large portion of my district is African American (48.2%) and</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">of those</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the majority are women</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, making this a key concern for the people of my district</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” Bolling, whose District 80 spans Henrico County, wrote to me in an email. Additionally, she experienced PPD after losing her first son, Noah, who was delivered stillborn at 19 weeks and two days. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, “I have since miscarried during the holidays before the General Assembly session began,” she wrote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I can’t imagine wrestling with PPD and grieving my infant simultaneously; few would want to. But I can understand exactly why maternal-related policy is a priority for her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bolling believes that the new PPD pill “can be an important tool in helping support the maternal health efforts in Virginia” but — correctly, in my view — thinks other measures are needed to alleviate maternal health issues statewide. Take it from me, a mother of three and a PPD survivor: Medication is nice, but guaranteed paid maternity leave and more compassion for mothers in the workplace would be even better. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prescriptions can blunt PPD, but so could expanded,</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/10/16/state-report-finds-child-care-is-unaffordable-for-most-virginia-families-with-young-kids/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> affordable child care options</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for Virginia families. Zurzuevae might be an excellent aid to childbearers; so too are doulas, and every mother should have access to their services (my third pregnancy and birth experiences were amazing, thanks in large part to my equally amazing doula).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is no magic pill that can cure PPD or other maternal health challenges. Instead, we must use what we have — namely, the creation and implementation of sound public policy, coupled with continued societal support  — to birth a better future for moms and children, which means a better future for all of us. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From John Smith and the colonists who carved out the first permanent English settlement in North America, to the burgesses who enacted the first representative government in the country, to our first president George Washington to other founding fathers like Patrick Henry and Thomas Jefferson, we were taught to revere all these caucasian males as courageous pioneers of a new world order named America. </span></p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;We celebrate one 1619 moment in history; another, we try to bury&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/11/22/we-celebrate-one-1619-moment-in-history-another-we-try-to-bury/embed/#?secret=DzlD2SAIaO#?secret=LB83IexVCK" data-secret="LB83IexVCK" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Untold and uncelebrated, until very recently, were the stories of our nation’s birth and evolution that featured people who looked like me and my family, Black people whose sacrifices, smarts and strengths built a solid foundation for the country and then carried it forward on their backs. Instead, these people were cast as minor supporting characters in the Virginia story, often nameless beyond the inherently degrading title of “slaves.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ones whose names we will never know — including most of the first Africans who landed on Virginia’s shores and were cast into a life of forced servitude and the millions of Black Virginians whose enslavement stretched across almost 250 years — far outweigh the few whose names we do: </span><a href="https://virginiahistory.org/learn/affidavit-1693" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anthony and Mary Johnson</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who were brought here in 1620, eventually worked their way out of slavery, became landowners and raised free children; </span><a href="https://www.lva.virginia.gov/public/dvb/bio.asp?b=Key_Elizabeth_fl_1655-1660" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elizabeth Key</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who in 1656 set a precedent as the first Black female Virginian to sue for her freedom and win it; </span><a href="https://encyclopediavirginia.org/entries/turners-revolt-nat-1831/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nat Turner</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a 19th century enslaved preacher and Southampton County freedom fighter; and select others whose names and deeds are usually relegated to Black History Month.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was all the more momentous to me, then — a seventh generation Black Virginian descended from enslaved people and freedmen in Hanover County — to see <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2024/01/10/historic-display-of-racial-gender-diversity-marks-the-start-of-2024-general-assembly-session/" target="_blank">history made this week</a> by Del. Don Scott, who became the first-ever Black speaker of Virginia’s House of Delegates when the legislature opened Wednesday. His words upon his ascension both hearken back and press forward.</span></p>

Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, recognizes supporters before being elected speaker of the House at the Virginia State Capitol on Jan. 10. (Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scott is a husband, father, son, attorney and a former federal prison inmate. Some would say he’s an unlikely hero in Virginia’s story — which, after 400 years, is still being written — only now with more than just white men as the central stars. Scott is one member of arguably the most racially diverse Virginia General Assembly since Reconstruction, evidenced by a record number of Legislative Black Caucus members, composed of 32 elected leaders in the House and Senate. There are also more women serving in the statehouse, too, with 15 women in the Senate, the most ever. Additionally, this session saw the first Bangladeshi-American and first trans Virginia senators sworn in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of this shows that we’re living in transformative times; Black Virginians and others of color now see themselves reflected in state politicians who champion policy and issues that impact their daily lives. All this, even as diversity has become a bad word, depending on who you ask. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we truly believe in the founding ideals of liberty, justice and freedom that undergird our nation, we can’t focus only on Virginia’s historic firsts without a mind to protect the progress they represent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s a very real and sustained effort to censor and diminish Black history education in America right now, and Virginia school districts are at this moment </span><a href="https://www.dnronline.com/news/rockingham-county-school-board-votes-to-temporarily-remove-list-of-55-books/article_2c60d75f-7022-5ec9-8ecd-201afec3939b.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">removing</span></a> <a href="https://www.axios.com/local/richmond/2023/11/20/virginia-hanover-county-book-ban-wicked-handmaids-tale" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">books</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Black authors from library shelves, and ones that broach sexuality.</span></p>

(Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Homeownership is a key factor in building wealth and achieving the American dream but it has never been accessible to all Americans. Recent reports of racial disparities in mortgage loan lending at Navy Federal Credit Union – the largest credit union in America, based in Virginia – demonstrate the persistent challenges people of color face in the quest to buy homes and create financial legacies for their families. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This present-day disparity, </span><a href="https://www.urban.org/urban-wire/how-local-differences-race-and-place-affect-mortgage-lending#:~:text=Black%20applicants%20were%20between%201.8,white%20applicants%20across%20neighborhood%20types." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pervasive</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> within lending institutions and neighborhoods nationwide, reflects America’s historically inequitable economic systems and social practices, which intentionally excluded Black people and others of color from some of the most basic but most critical aspects of American liberty and progress.</span></p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;&#8216;The bedrock of wealth inequality&#8217;: Data shows big racial disparities in mortgage loans and homeownership&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2020/07/21/the-bedrock-of-wealth-inequality-data-shows-big-racial-disparities-in-mortgage-loans-and-homeownership/embed/#?secret=Ls0gM9iUOT#?secret=0kTrMP3cnW" data-secret="0kTrMP3cnW" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Racial disparities in home lending</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/14/business/navy-federal-credit-union-black-applicants-invs/index.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CNN analysis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found that Navy Federal approved over 75% of conventional mortgage loan applications by white borrowers, but approved less than 50% of Black borrowers seeking the same loan. It was “the widest disparity in mortgage approval rates between White and Black borrowers of any major lender,” CNN reported. The deep disparity persists</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “even when more than a dozen different variables – including income, debt-to-income ratio, property value, down payment percentage, and neighborhood characteristics – were the same.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Navy Federal denied that its lending practices are discriminatory against Black borrowers, with the credit union’s spokesperson telling CNN its analysis excluded factors like “credit score, available cash deposits and relationship history with lender.” Yet they wouldn’t provide data about those factors to CNN, and, as the media outlet noted, “most of the Navy Federal applications that were denied are listed as being rejected for reasons other than ‘credit history.’” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This news touched off strong responses from fair lending advocacy groups and civil rights organizations and prompted a </span><a href="https://bencrump.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/231217-Oliver-et-al-v-NFCU-Complaint.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">class action lawsuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> filed in Virginia’s Eastern District Court Dec. 17, on behalf of Black applicants who had been denied home loans, despite their high incomes and stellar credit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Edward Barnes of Portsmouth told 13 News Now that Navy Federal inexplicably denied his mortgage refinance loan last October, a shock to the credit union’s customer of 34 years. Using the same information on his application, Barnes was approved for a loan with another lender two months later.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re in 2023. They should be past this. Stuff like this shouldn’t be happening,&#8221; Barnes said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He is right; it seems reasonable to expect this type of discrimination to become less potent as the years go by and the country progresses. Unfortunately, in many aspects of homeownership access and wealth building, America has, shamefully, regressed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2022, the Black homeownership rate was 45%, according to the National Association of Real Estate Brokers’s 2023 “State of Housing in Black America” </span><a href="https://www.nareb.com/site-files/uploads/2023/11/SHIBA-Report-2023.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “Even though the percentage of Black homeowners has slowly increased since the passage of the 1968 Fair Housing Act, the gap in homeownership rates between Blacks and Whites is larger than it was more than half a century ago,” the report stated. Covertly biased mortgage lending practices help widen the <a href="https://homeofva.org/research-policy/exhibits/credit-inequality/exhibit/" target="_blank">gap</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://dmz1.dhcd.virginia.gov/HB854/index.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB854 Statewide Housing Study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a January 2022 report </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">commissioned by the Virginia General Assembly, found that 48% of Black households in the commonwealth owned homes, compared to 73% of white households. “The history of </span><a href="https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/#loc=5/39.1/-94.58&amp;text=intro" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">redlining</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and race-based federal mortgage programs, </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/15/us/racist-deeds-covenants/index.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">deed restrictions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> based on race, </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-foreclosures-race/racial-predatory-loans-fueled-u-s-housing-crisis-study-idUSTRE6930K520101004" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">predatory lending programs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><a href="https://www.marketplace.org/2021/08/09/when-it-comes-to-the-racial-wealth-gap-home-appraisals-are-part-of-the-problem/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">discriminatory property appraisals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> contribute to many inequities that the Commonwealth must continue to address,” wrote the study’s authors, Virginia Housing and the Department of Housing and Community Development.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several federal agencies oversee financial institutions’ compliance with fair lending laws. The </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Credit Union Administration monitors Navy Federal’s and other institutions’ “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">financial performance, risk management practices, payment systems, and compliance with laws and regulations,” NCUA’s Ben Hardaway told me in an email. They don’t handle lending or other consumer financial protection-related matters and instead pass on any complaints they receive about these issues from the public to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Since 2019, Hardaway said, the NCUA has referred 2,405 complaints involving Navy Federal to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the same timeframe, the Bureau’s Consumer Complaint Database shows 691 complaints about Navy Federal, concerning either applying for a mortgage loan or a refinance loan (like Barnes’) or problems with an existing mortgage. Of those, 50 came from Virginia; several of them mention Navy Federal’s suspected </span><a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/consumer-complaints/search/detail/5653655" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">violation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the Fair Housing Act as the basis of the complaint. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau last year referred five fair lending matters to the Department of Justice, it said in its annual </span><a href="https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_fair-lending-report_2023-06.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to Congress, “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">involving discrimination on the basis of race and national origin in mortgage lending (redlining).”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I believe this represents a snapshot of a wider problem; how many would-be Virginia borrowers, denied loans by Navy Federal or other banks, didn’t file a report with the Bureau?</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Equitable solutions</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the 10 years since founding <a href="https://www.tealhousecompany.com/tealvilleusa" target="_blank">Teal House Company</a>, a real estate firm servicing central Virginia and Rhode Island, Damon Harris said he has “often” encountered Black people whose mortgage loan applications have been rejected, seemingly without good reason.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s tricky because no one is ‘denied’ for a mortgage; technically [lenders] can&#8217;t say ‘no.’ They can say ‘not right now because of these factors.’ So it&#8217;s hard to nail down those factors, but these classic problems – redlining, the wealth gap, wage inequality – still play a part today.&#8221;</span></p>

(Teal House Company)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His company also offers real estate strategy and homebuyer education classes, as well as pathways to responsible home-selling and community development. In addition to the challenges of finding fair lending, Harris said people of color face barriers like wage inequality and disproportionate student loan debt in their quest for homeownership. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And, we have a dire affordable housing shortage in the country and this state, which makes it harder for everyone to find safe, decent homes. Housing is a right and many people are being blocked from that right now.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Education, self-advocacy and dogged persistence are keys to navigating these issues, Harris, a native of Petersburg, Va., said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone needs a buying strategy. You can&#8217;t just wake up Monday and say, let me go buy a house Wednesday. Start the process 12 months in advance, or as soon as you can. Determine what you need and what you want in a home, and how much you can afford.” Would-be buyers can also partner with companies like Harris’, state agencies and housing nonprofits to boost their home buying knowledge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Especially if you&#8217;re a first-time buyer, a partner can explain things you don’t know so you&#8217;re prepared when you talk with a lender. They can also help you find a lender”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you apply for a home loan and are denied, lending institutions “have to send paperwork that explains why,” Harris said. “They are supposed to tell you the specific reason for the rejection; hold them accountable for that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most importantly, “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Believe and don&#8217;t be discouraged. It’s a process that can take time but if you keep at it, you will get there.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Homeownership may be, to riff off Harlem Renaissance poet Langston Hughes, a dream deferred. A deferred dream, though, is better than no dream at all and gives us an aspiration to focus on as we work to make homeownership not only a bright vision for some, but a waking reality for all. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mercury columnists asked hard questions like, “Why is our governor </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/10/24/felons-suffrage-in-virginia-shouldnt-rely-on-one-person-even-if-he-is-the-governor/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the sole arbiter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of who gets their right to vote back after a criminal offense?” “</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/09/22/in-harrisonburg-reconnecting-northeast-will-help-heal-urban-renewals-old-wounds/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Who has a voice in discussions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about how land is used — and </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/09/18/eminent-domains-long-ago-racism-still-hinders-african-americans-today/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">whose voices are missing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">?” “Are we really </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/08/16/why-are-ratepayers-footing-the-bill-for-virginias-data-center-buildout/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">prepared</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/02/15/building-more-virginia-data-centers-requires-increased-pollution-controls/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">proliferation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/11/21/a-5-point-plan-for-data-centers/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">data centers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> happening here?” and “How can the American dream of </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/08/10/lift-act-could-boost-wealth-building-for-first-time-homebuyers-supply-could-be-a-problem/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">homeownership become more accessible</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to all the commonwealth’s citizens?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We examined how the ever-unfolding </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/05/04/despite-ceaseless-slayings-these-virginians-keep-combating-gun-violence/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">gun violence</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> epidemic continues infecting Virginia, and we probed </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/01/26/these-bills-could-bring-more-clean-energy-to-your-community/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">energy legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/09/05/if-dominions-plan-is-so-bad-is-there-a-better-one-spoiler-alert-yes-there-is/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">developments </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">that enhance or detract from our natural landscape and resources. We connected the dots between </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/04/26/pocahontas-islands-next-lifetime/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">past and present</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and helped shed light on why things are the way they are here </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/11/13/a-divided-government-is-virginias-natural-condition-has-been-for-50-years/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">politically</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We outlined why the </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/11/22/we-celebrate-one-1619-moment-in-history-another-we-try-to-bury/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">past is always pretext</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — and very often </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/12/14/make-it-last-forever-how-richmonders-recollections-build-public-knowledge/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">present</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — in modern Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The point was, and is, never to tell readers what or how to think. Rather, we’ve tried our best to offer perspectives informed by facts and then invite the public to think through all of it with us. </span>Our goal is to inform, to seek accountability from our elected leaders and to provoke productive dialogue statewide.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We also listened to and learned from a diverse range of Virginians by intentionally increasing the number of guest commentary pieces we considered and published each week. It remains critical to me and to our mission that we</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> publish the voices of those who may not be heard or read otherwise, or whose life experiences are often underreported or misrepresented in legacy media. </span></p>

They represent the tapestry of us, Virginians of varying thoughts and ideals that each day we weave into the cultural cloth of the commonwealth. How different and alike we are! How much we have to learn from each other! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2024, we’ll keep curating a thoughtful space that Virginia readers seek out for timely local perspectives. We’ll keep</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> exploring our shared history — the good, the bad, the ugly and the undertold. We’ll keep asking hard questions and offering informed opinions. And we’ll keep listening and learning from Virginians, who make our work worthwhile. I invite your column ideas, pitches, praise or protest: swillis@virginiamercury.com</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since 2019, the lab has been contributing to the library&#8217;s repository of central Virginia history. But a cash infusion of $900,000, by way of a newly awarded Mellon Grant, will go a long way toward furthering its efforts to bolster Virginia&#8217;s public memory archives.</span></p>

(Samantha Willis/The Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the near future, the Memory Lab will offer even more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our goal is to lead classes, workshops and programs on how to digitize physical materials and to encourage folks who have materials relating to Richmond&#8217;s history to consider donating to our collection,&#8221; said Chloe McCormick, Main Library&#8217;s senior special collections librarian. &#8220;For example, someone may have childhood photos of the neighborhood they grew up in, which has changed a lot over the years. We want to see those photos, and other people want to see those photos.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McCormick, who is also a trained folklorist, just completed a one-year role as a Memory Lab fellow. Much of her work during the past year involved staffing the Memory Lab and assisting people who used it, reorganizing the local history collections, overseeing oral history projects and helping prepare the library for its </span><a href="https://rvalibrary.org/rpl-100/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">centennial anniversary</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which it celebrated from November 2022 through November 2023. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The library, said McCormick, helps to fill a niche in a city that values its history and is largely defined by it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I think in Richmond, we&#8217;re so lucky to have so many large-scale historical institutions at our disposal. And that&#8217;s amazing, but I think what we excel at in the library is helping people who walk in off the street looking for that grassroots social history of Richmond or other underrepresented history that&#8217;s not always easily accessible at other institutions,&#8221; she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an example, McCormick cites a sustained interest in Richmond&#8217;s Black history, evidenced by African American residents dropping in frequently to seek information about their genealogical and family records. Finding such information is a unique challenge Black Americans face, often due to the country&#8217;s legacy of slavery.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In 1860, nearly 4 million enslaved individuals lived in the United States but they didn’t appear on federal census records,&#8221; </span><a href="https://blogs.loc.gov/loc/2021/04/african-american-genealogy-searching-for-yesterday/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wrote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Ahmed Johnson, a reference librarian in the Library of Congress Researcher and Reference Services Department. &#8220;Therefore, you have to search for other records to help you locate family names and push your family history back further.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McCormick and the Richmond Main Library staff can help uncover such records.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;On an almost daily basis, I&#8217;m helping Black patrons find something about their community or family history,&#8221; McCormick said. &#8220;We do run into those walls all the time, where there isn&#8217;t easily accessible information about the topic they&#8217;re looking for, or the trail of their family members goes cold.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Memory Lab can bring these histories, which have perhaps only prevailed previously as family lore, into public view. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This stuff exists in living memory, so our goal is to access that and make it more widely available,&#8221; McCormick said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Main Library — which already engages with several Black heritage groups including the </span><a href="https://www.aahgs.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Afro-American Historical and Genealogical Society</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — is hoping to work with more historic Black churches in Richmond and throughout the state to tap into their member records and archives. Perhaps in this way, descendants may find their ancestors, and the public record of local Black history be made richer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The grant, the largest in the library’s history, will also enable the library to create personal archiving kits, offering the tools and opportunity to capture precious memories to those who can&#8217;t come to the library. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The kits could contain cameras, audio recording equipment, lights, scanners and other devices,&#8221; McCormick said. &#8220;So if you have family members who can&#8217;t make it to the library and you want to record them sharing an oral history, or if you have materials that you can&#8217;t bring here, you can use these tools in your own homes and communities.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richmond&#8217;s revamped Memory Lab is expected to be complete by the end of 2024. That gives you plenty of time to think of what knowledge you&#8217;d like to preserve representing your life, family, heritage or community, and to decide if other Virginians can share in that knowledge too. </span></p>

Thousands of protesters came out in response to a new bill outlawing abortions after a fetal heartbeat is detected signed on Wednesday by Texas Governor Greg Abbot. (Photo by Sergio Flores/Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In perhaps the most visceral recent example of how far-reaching and punitive abortion restrictions have become across the country since the fall of Roe v. Wade, 31-year-old Kate Cox is only able to terminate her nonviable, 20-week pregnancy because a Texas judge on Thursday handed down a temporary protective order allowing her to pursue the procedure. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was the first time in 50 years that a judge has intervened to allow a grown woman to exercise agency over her own body and health by ending her pregnancy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Immediately after the judge&#8217;s decision, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton went into combat mode, sending a menacing letter to several Texas hospitals that threatened legal action if they violated the state’s abortion laws, which only allow abortion to save the life of a pregnant person. Paxton might also seek to appeal the judge&#8217;s decision to the Texas Supreme Court, although some legal experts told the </span><a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2023/12/07/texas-emergency-abortion-lawsuit/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Texas Tribune</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that it could make sense for him to hold his fire as the court wades through a different lawsuit by 20 women and two doctors challenging Texas’ abortion laws with regard to “complicated” pregnancies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several of the </span><a href="https://reproductiverights.org/zurawski-v-texas-plaintiffs-stories-remarks/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">women in that case</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Zurawski v. Texas, sought abortions because their fetuses had severe developmental abnormalities; one woman’s fetus failed to grow a skull, while another’s had </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">trisomy 18, a condition that causes major problems like a malformed heart and lungs, and has very low chances of survival. These conditions also posed high risks to each mother’s health the longer she stayed pregnant. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If anybody needed an abortion, these women did. Yet Texas’ laws prevented them from obtaining the health care that could save their lives. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If these women had been Virginia residents, most of them could have gotten an abortion, since the commonwealth allows abortions through the second trimester (and into the third under specific circumstances). Currently, Virginia is the only state in the South that hasn’t furthered abortion restrictions since Roe v. Wade was overturned, making it </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a safe haven for abortion access.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginians are aware of the importance of the issue. Abortion was arguably the highest-stakes issue in last month’s General Assembly elections. While Gov. Glenn Youngkin and front-running Republicans put forward a 15-week abortion ban as a “compromise” alternative to Democrats’ vow to keep abortion legal and accessible under the state’s current laws, the 15-week ban didn’t include an exemption for birth defects and conditions threatening the life of the baby like the ones involved in the Texas cases. It’s still not clear why.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Siobhan Dunnavant, R-Henrico, </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/01/20/republican-senator-breaks-with-gop-to-oppose-15-week-abortion-bill-in-virginia/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">broke with her party</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> during the last legislative session to oppose the 15-week bill because it didn’t have such an exception. The practicing OB-GYN characterized the proposal as “extreme” and </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+SB1483" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">submitted a Senate bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that stated “abortion laws do not apply to the treatment of a nonviable pregnancy.” She also proposed </span><a href="https://committees.lis.virginia.gov/forconsiderationsubs.aspx?ses=231&amp;bil=SB1385&amp;hou=S" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an amendment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to her colleagues’ 15-week bill that would have allowed abortion through the second trimester in the case of &#8220;severe fetal anomaly.&#8221; Her bill and amendment failed, and months later, Virginia voters rejected the 15-week ban by handing control of the statehouse to Democrats. Dunnavant herself lost to Democrat Del. Schuyler VanValkenburg.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After their victory, Democrats proposed a </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SJ1" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">constitutional amendment </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">to enshrine abortion access as a fundamental right in Virginia. It will take </span><a href="https://www.vpm.org/news/2023-12-07/virginia-abortion-access-amendment-no-vote-until-2026-at-least" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">at least two years</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for that measure to potentially be brought to voters in a referendum; Virginians would do well to use that time to reflect on the necessity and nuance of abortion access, with the somber recognition that if our mothers, sisters, daughters, relatives and friends need an abortion to save their life or health, they can still get one — unlike many of our fellow Americans, in Texas and elsewhere, who don’t have that right, and whose lives often depend on it.</span></p>

(Samantha Willis/ The Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I saw </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/loreal-hair-relaxers-litigation/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reports</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about a National Institutes of Health </span><a href="https://academic.oup.com/jnci/article/114/12/1636/6759686?login=true" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that found women who used chemical hair straighteners known as relaxers were more than twice as likely to develop uterine cancer than those who didn’t, a sulfur-scented flashback zapped me back to my first experience getting my hair relaxed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was 10 or 11, and my mama was preparing me and my little sister for Easter church service the next day. She had laid out our frilly white dresses with ankle socks to match and black patent leather Mary Janes; all that was left to do on that Saturday evening was our hair, so Mom pulled out a box of children’s no-lye relaxer and transformed into a kitchen table chemist. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She mixed a small bottle of activator liquid into a jar of relaxer base, and the goopy, pale pink mixture smelled like rotten eggs or something you might clean your bathroom with. That worried me a little, but not enough to dissuade me from the relaxer process that promised to turn my naturally kinky African American hair into silky smooth strands that could be bedecked with barrettes, like the little girl’s on the box. There wasn’t anything on the packaging that said the relaxer was unsafe either, unless you got it in your eyes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So I squeezed my eyes shut while Mom applied a thin layer of petroleum jelly around my hairline, “so it won’t burn your skin,” she said. She carefully plastered the relaxer onto my hair with the same skillful motions she used to ice cakes, and when I told her it was starting to tingle, she said that meant the treatment was working. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As time passed, the tingling turned to itching and then to burning. It felt like a hot curling iron was pressed directly against my crown, sending waves of intense heat all over my head and making my still-closed eyes water. But finally I could bend over the bathroom sink for Mom to rinse the relaxer from my strands, which, I saw when I finally opened my eyes, now hung limp instead of clumping in their usual tight coils — a look that my elders sometimes called “nappy.” Mom then styled my hair to resemble the relaxer box girl’s straight strands, and I was so happy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mom applied her own relaxer that night too, after mine and my sister’s. We didn’t know then what we do now: Relaxers are a byproduct of discrimination Afro-haired people have faced for centuries in America, stemming from a beauty standard that has </span><a href="https://www.shape.com/lifestyle/mind-and-body/mental-health/eurocentric-beauty-standards-black-women" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">favored Eurocentric features</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> like straight hair, slim noses, thin lips and fair skin. Relaxers have long been a way many Black women have conformed to this standard, which has often been necessary to advance in their careers and to also be seen by the larger white society as “presentable,” “neat” and “stylish.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The message that such standards broadcast — that natural, kinky-curly Black hair is not presentable, neat or stylish — has only recently been challenged in our society, evidenced by passage of legislation like the so-called “Crown Act,” which in 2020 </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+sum+HB1514" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">updated</span></a> <a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacodepopularnames/virginia-human-rights-act/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s human rights anti-discrimination law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to include “traits historically associated with race, including hair texture, hair type, and protective hairstyles such as braids, locks, and twists.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Codifying the acceptance of Black hair in public accommodations and employment is excellent progress, but it may have come too late for many Black women.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NIH isn’t alone in discovering a connection between relaxers and cancer. Last month, Boston University released a </span><a href="https://www.bumc.bu.edu/camed/2023/10/11/first-large-study-of-hair-relaxers-among-black-women-finds-increased-risk-of-uterine-cancer/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">new study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that reported “long-term use of chemical hair relaxers by postmenopausal Black women was associated with increased risk of uterine cancer.” This study followed 45,000 women for 22 years, noting their hair relaxer use and cancer rates. The disparities it found between Black women and other women are alarming.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We did our best to adjust for possible other explanations for why the women got cancer in our statistical analysis,” said Boston University Associate Professor of Medicine Kimberly Bertrand, an epidemiologist and one of the study’s authors. “We tried to account for other risk factors of uterine cancer that we&#8217;re aware of, like obesity or reproductive issues, and ruled those out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You can&#8217;t prove causality with this type of study design but you can prove correlation,” she continued. “There’s strong biological plausibility that some of the chemicals included in these products do have effects on the hormone system, and could plausibly be associated with cancers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like many cosmetic and beauty products, hair relaxers are loosely regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. That lack of close oversight potentially puts people who use them at risk, said Lee Floyd, a Richmond-based attorney who has been appointed to the plaintiffs’ steering committee of a massive </span><a href="https://www.aboutlawsuits.com/wp-content/uploads/2023-03-02-Order.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">class-action lawsuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> against several global beauty brands that produce and market hair relaxers. The case now includes over 8,200 women who have used relaxers and developed cancer, including “hundreds” from Virginia, Floyd said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These are products that are sold to women of color, not just in the U.S., but internationally. They are also marketed to children. In many instances, these products are marketed as created from ‘natural’ substances, like olive oil or Moroccan oil,” she said. “What we&#8217;re now learning is that these hair relaxer products contain dangerous carcinogenic substances, which, again, women and children are applying to their hair without any warning of the carcinogens. It’s heartbreaking.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lawsuits seek to not only compensate victims for the harm they may have suffered due to the relaxers but also force beauty brands to disclose on packaging and marketing materials that the products contain dangerous substances that could cause cancer. Had those types of warnings been included on relaxer boxes from the start, many women — including my mama, my sister and me — wouldn’t have used them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Master stylists and sisters Aleta Smith and Areta Johnson might have thought twice about applying the treatments to their customers’ hair too. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ve done countless relaxers,” said Smith, who has served mostly Black women over her 40 years as a stylist in Hanover County. She hasn’t had any clients who developed uterine cancer, she said, and is curious whether the box relaxers at the center of the lawsuit contain different chemicals than the professional-grade, pre-mixed relaxers she and her sister use. <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Areta-Johnson-Aleta-Smith-master-stylists.png" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-37025 size-full" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Areta-Johnson-Aleta-Smith-master-stylists.png" alt="" width="668" height="1174" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Areta-Johnson-Aleta-Smith-master-stylists.png 668w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Areta-Johnson-Aleta-Smith-master-stylists-171x300.png 171w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Areta-Johnson-Aleta-Smith-master-stylists-583x1024.png 583w" sizes="(max-width: 668px) 100vw, 668px" /></a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The back-to-natural hair movement sweeping the nation in recent years has decreased the number of relaxers Smith applies now, but she said that “back in the day, almost all of my customers were getting relaxers, and they have to be touched up every six weeks. Some of them wanted it sooner than six weeks but I wouldn’t give it to them.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After retiring from Twin Images, the salon she shared with Smith, Johnson is now a cosmetology instructor at Rowanty Technical Center, teaching hair care and stylist skills to students from Dinwiddie, Prince George and Sussex County Public Schools and preparing them to take the state cosmetology licensing exam. Johnson also said she’s not aware of any relaxer clients developing uterine cancer, but she stopped relaxing her own hair about 10 years ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I was a cancer survivor, and my hair texture had started changing,” she said. “And I realized I could get the same look without a relaxer and my hair would be healthier and not prone to thinning.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If she was still behind the stylist’s chair, Johnson said she would advise clients to “really think carefully about getting a relaxer now. How you wear your hair is a personal choice, but with these studies coming out, I would be leery of hair relaxers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s been over 10 years since I last used creamy crack, as relaxers are colloquially called in Black culture. My decision to stop was less about the health risks — which I didn’t know existed — and more about empowering myself as an African American woman to proudly wear my hair in its natural texture, Eurocentric beauty standards be damned, because Black is beautiful. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While I know many women who now reject the sociocultural programming of their mothers’ and grandmothers’ generations that made relaxers a requirement for the well-coiffed, I know others who still relax their hair. That is their choice and right. But everyone should also have the right to be fully informed about the cancer risks relaxers probably pose so that they can make the choice that best suits them, their hair and their personal definition of beauty, safely. </span></p>

(3M/Ketchum)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than 7,300 miles separate Virginia from Ethiopia, the birthplace of Hemen Bekele, a Fairfax teen newly named “America’s Top Young Scientist” for his potentially groundbreaking invention of skin cancer-fighting soap.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the distance, Bekele keeps his homeland close to his heart and credits it as his inspiration for creating a soap designed to treat skin cancer.</span></p>

(Donnie Biggs/Fairfax County Public Schools)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I was born and raised in Addis Ababa and I didn’t move to America until I was 4 years old,” Bekele told me by phone. “But my true inspiration for this project was seeing people working long hours under the glaring hot sun. While I was 4 years old, I didn’t really understand the problem, but I did retain those memories and slowly, as I started to grow up, I started to realize how prevalent an issue that is.”</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.skincancer.org/skin-cancer-information/basal-cell-carcinoma/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Basal cell carcinoma</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the most common type of skin cancer globally and the </span><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/der2.132" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">most documented skin cancer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Northern African countries, including land-locked Ethiopia whose economic backbone is agriculture. The condition is characterized by “open sores, red patches, pink growths, shiny bumps, scars or growths with slightly elevated, rolled edges and/or a central indentation,” according to the Skin Cancer Foundation. When ultraviolet radiation from sun exposure damages the skin’s DNA, it can transform the basal cells in the skin’s epidermis, the outermost layer. Skin cancer is a problem in Virginia too: the state has a nearly </span><a href="https://statecancerprofiles.cancer.gov/quick-profiles/index.php?statename=virginia#t=2" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">21% incidence rate of melanoma</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, compared to the 22.5% national incidence rate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Bekele realized that screening and treatment for skin cancer is often expensive and inaccessible for people living in economically-challenged localities, he made it his mission to find an equitable solution. The self-described “naturally curious” W.T. Woodson High School freshman entered the </span><a href="https://youngscientistlab.com/annual-challenge/about-the-challenge?utm_source=de_marketing&amp;utm_medium=press_release&amp;utm_campaign=2023_q2_ysc_finalist" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">3M Young Scientist Challenge</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last year, a competition that “encourages students to solve everyday problems using science and innovation,” pitching his special suds as a global skin cancer solution.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once accepted into the contest, Bekele spent the next several months experimenting with chemical compounds like salicylic acid and tretinoin, often in his family’s Fairfax kitchen or basement, to find an effective mix that would combat cancer by repairing damaged skin cells. The contest-winning combination includes organic shea butter, coconut oil and moisturizing cream 3M Cavilon; Bekele believes his soap works by reactivating dendritic cells, which help the body ward off pathogens and boost immunity. In October, Bekele was announced as the competition’s victor, earning international recognition and $25,000.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His win also symbolizes the breakthrough advances we can expect to continue only if STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) fields of academic study and careers become more inclusive and diverse.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Black and Hispanic workers remain underrepresented in the science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) workforce compared with their share of all workers,” </span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2021/04/01/stem-jobs-see-uneven-progress-in-increasing-gender-racial-and-ethnic-diversity/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">found</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a 2021 Pew Research Center study. The root of that underrepresentation is often planted long before college: “About four-in-ten Black adults with at least a high school degree (39%) say they have had at least one of the following negative experiences: being treated as if they couldn’t understand the subject matter, made to feel like they don’t belong, or receiving repeated negative comments about their race,” another Pew study found. Those negative experiences can deter students of color from studying STEM in college or pursuing a STEM career; that leads to fewer scientists, engineers and thinkers who can help solve societal problems.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some Virginia colleges and universities are aware of this challenge. </span><a href="https://egr.vcu.edu/news-events/news/06302022-vcu-receives-1-million-grant-to-increase-minority-phd-stem-students.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Commonwealth University</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the </span><a href="https://engineering.virginia.edu/about/diversity-and-engagement/center-diversity-engineering" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">University of Virginia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><a href="https://www.vsu.edu/research/undergraduate-research/hbcu-up/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia State University</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are among the state-funded public institutions of higher learning that offer specialized programming to boost students of color representation in STEM fields and make the STEM career pipeline more accessible. In 2020, former Gov. Ralph Northam </span><a href="https://www.virginiabusiness.com/article/northam-proposes-1m-investment-for-future-stem-educators-at-hbcus/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pledged $1 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to Norfolk State University and Virginia State University to participate in the UTeach program, making Virginia the first state in the nation to allocate public funds to UTeach’s goal of increasing STEM educators of color.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One day in the near future, Bekele could take advantage of one of these programs. The 14-year-old is “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">thinking about [studying] biomedical research or biochem in college, but I have plenty of time to change my mind. If you’d asked me what I wanted to study a year ago, I would have said engineering, so I’m constantly learning and my goals evolve with that.” He hopes to eventually mass produce his soaps and, by 2028, create a nonprofit organization to distribute it to communities who need it.</span></p>

(3M/Ketchum)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although he’s been passionate about science from a young age, an interest Bekele said his mom and dad stoked throughout his life, it’s not his only focus. He plays flute in his school’s band and piano at home, where he lives with his parents and two sisters, one younger and one older than him. Bekele loves injera, a savory Ethiopian flatbread (“I </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">highly</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> recommend it, so delicious!”), and stays connected to his heritage through food and language, often conversing with family back home in Ethiopia in </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amharic. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">He enjoys competitive chess, Model UN (which he credits with sharpening his public speaking and presentation skills, both of which helped him clinch the 3M competition) and, like many other Virginia teens, online video games. His advice to his peers statewide who, like him, are preparing to make their mark in the world?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think more than anything, be committed and be resilient. If you have a goal and stick to it, and work as hard as you can towards that goal, you can accomplish it. Every win starts with a dream.”</span></p>

Hanover is one of a handful of Virginia localities whose school boards are appointed by local governments rather than elected by voters. (Samantha Willis/The Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In November, Hanover County voters will answer a question that sounds simple but could be the precursor of a historic shift in the way the county oversees the education of its 17,000 public school students: “Shall the method of selecting the school board be changed from appointment by the governing body to direct election by the voters?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Preceding this referendum is a chorus of voices — from parents, educators, students and community members — calling for significant change in how members are added to the school board. What began years ago as low-toned complaints about the board’s lack of transparency and accountability to residents are now a cacophony of legitimate concerns that cannot be easily quieted. As a graduate of Hanover schools, I say emphatically: Bring the noise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hanover County is one of just 12 localities statewide where </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/02/21/senate-kills-house-backed-measure-on-elected-school-boards/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">school board members are appointed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by a local governing body instead of elected by citizens. Before 1992, all school boards in the state were appointed, according to Gina Patterson, executive director of the Virginia School Boards Association, which serves 131 school boards across the state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We were the last state that allowed elected school boards in the country,” Patterson told me by phone. “The beauty of Virginia is that we allow both elected and appointed school boards; we allow whatever is the best fit for the community.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Hanover’s case, there has been continued consternation about what the best fit for the community really is, centering on whether the appointed school board is truly representative of Hanover students, what they need academically and what they and their parents want from their educational experience. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even a cursory glance at the school board’s actions over the past few years lends legitimacy to students’ and parents’ concerns that the majority-white, majority-male school board — appointed by the all-white, majority-male Hanover County Board of Supervisors — doesn’t reflect or respect beliefs, lifestyles or teachings outside a conservative, white worldview.</span></p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Hanover swiftly rushed to the defense of guns; not so quickly for residents shaken by a racist rally&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2019/12/23/hanover-swiftly-rushed-to-the-defense-of-guns-residents-shaken-by-a-racist-rally-not-so-much/embed/#?secret=XM8v8Zk6Jy#?secret=XgnFX9ezPN" data-secret="XgnFX9ezPN" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was the school names controversy, wherein the school board refused to change the names of Hanover schools bearing Confederate veterans’ monikers. The board staunchly refused to remove the racist school names for years, despite protests from hundreds of citizens who rightly viewed them as hurtful reminders of the Civil War and the white men who fought in it for the right to continue owning Black people as property. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the issue first surfaced for a vote in 2018, the Board of Supervisors booted off Marla Coleman, who was one of just two school board members to vote to change the names. (The other member, Ola J. Hawkins, was a Black woman; removing her would have been too obviously racist, they probably concluded.) Coleman has since </span><a href="https://fb.watch/nOtInjQyp2/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">publicly shed light</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on what she calls the “political” appointment process, which until now has been shrouded in secrecy by the Board of Supervisors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amanda Kronenberg, a parent of a 9-year-old Hanover Public Schools student and a 15-year-old who attends Maggie Walker Governor’s School, said she first learned Hanover had an appointed school board at the time of the name change controversy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I started to look into who was on the school board, what they do, who is my rep, and how they voted on this issue,” she said. “The person who was my rep at the time voted against changing the names; I was pro-changing the names. I didn&#8217;t like that they didn&#8217;t support the students that way, so I wondered when they were up for election and ‘never’ was the answer.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After years of negative press about the school names, the board finally, if reluctantly, </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/07/17/treat-the-cause-not-the-symptoms/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">voted to change the names</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2020. By then, they’d lost the trust of many members of Hanover’s Black community and their allies, and that well-earned distrust persists today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2021, the school board flagrantly rejected standards mandated by the state Board of Education to protect transgender and nonbinary students, leading to student protests and a </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2021/12/09/aclu-hanover-schools-transgender-students/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lawsuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> levied by five trans students and their families. The school board then hired notorious conservative Christian advocacy group Alliance Defending Freedom to craft its own </span><a href="https://go.boarddocs.com/vsba/hcpsva/Board.nsf/files/CHMR566C441D/$file/Restroom%20and%20Locker%20Room%20Policy%20-%20August%2030.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">policy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for trans children, which requires these students to submit written requests to use bathrooms that match their gender identity and gives the school board the sole authority to accept or reject the requests. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kronenberg was also troubled by this kerfuffle, saying it “signaled that the school board or system didn’t care about trans students, which appalled me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The board’s policy also suggests the requests include students’ personal information, including disciplinary and criminal records, and a doctor’s or therapist’s note “verifying that the student has been diagnosed with gender dysphoria and/or that the student consistently and authentically expresses a binary gender identity.” This needlessly burdensome process seems unfair and discriminatory toward students whose gender identity should have no bearing on the quality of education they get in Hanover and whether they can just use the bathroom where they feel most comfortable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, the school board’s </span><a href="https://go.boarddocs.com/vsba/hcpsva/Board.nsf/files/CE5J244B014C/$file/Equity%20Report%20Data%20-%20May%202022.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">self-directed equity audit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> revealed that “Black students in Hanover schools are overrepresented in school discipline and underrepresented in advanced courses, such as AP and IB programs, in the county for the second straight year,” according to </span><a href="https://www.wric.com/news/local-news/hanover-county/after-years-community-equity-board-member-says-no-movement-on-top-proposals-to-hanover-school-board/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">WRIC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite that, a member of the school system’s Community Equity Advisory Board, formed partly in response to the racial equity concerns that bubbled up during the school names controversy, said there had been “no movement” from the school board on the advisory group’s top recommendations — that the school system submit to a third-party equity audit and that it hire a director of equity and inclusion initiatives — for at least three or four years. All of this sent the message that the school board doesn’t take its commitment to equity seriously. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, this year, the board has ruffled feathers by jumping on the book banning bandwagon. This June, it created and voted in a policy that outlines how public requests for books to be banned from school libraries will be processed and then</span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/education/hanover-books-ban-llibrary/article_35e54f04-0a65-11ee-92bc-bff2eab514de.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> banned 19 books</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, including “The Bluest Eye” by Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist Toni Morrison.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Zw2PWzJ3lP"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/06/15/school-districts-struggle-to-implement-new-laws-on-sexually-explicit-books/">School districts struggle to implement new laws on sexually explicit books</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;School districts struggle to implement new laws on sexually explicit books&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/06/15/school-districts-struggle-to-implement-new-laws-on-sexually-explicit-books/embed/#?secret=OvbfbVIEvY#?secret=Zw2PWzJ3lP" data-secret="Zw2PWzJ3lP" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I first read that book as a Hanover County high school student, devouring sentences between classes; it solidified my lifelong love of literature and gave me an example of fiction writing on a genius scale authored by a Black woman whom I adored and emulated as a budding creative writer. Sadly, other young Black aspiring writers in Hanover schools won’t get the same mind-opening opportunity — an essential point of public education — that I did. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Throughout these firestorms, the common denominator is Hanover’s School Board, whose hardline stances against progressive actions to make the school system more welcoming, equitable and inclusive of all students clashes with large swaths of the constituents it serves. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To me, appointed school boards like Hanover’s hearken back to the Jim Crow era, when all-white appointed school boards had sole authority over education in their localities, often to the detriment of Black students. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A classic example of this dynamic was found in Prince Edward County, where in 1951, students of the county’s only high school for Black students, Robert Russa Moton High, and the NAACP sued the school board for refusing to equally fund Moton or give it basic resources for student success — like books in good condition or classrooms where students would be warm and dry. A Black teenager, Barbara Johns, </span><a href="https://www.pbs.org/video/virginias-black-churches-develop-young-leaders-wlo5jv/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">led a protest of 450 students</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> before the lawsuit; it set the stage for the landmark case that would end school segregation, Brown v. Board of Education. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This model of appointed school board leadership belongs in the history books, not in Virginia’s modern school systems. But in Hanover, the growing number of folks who didn’t agree with the school board’s many missteps has had no recourse.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Until now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beginning last year, a nonpartisan, citizen-led group, </span><a href="https://www.electhanover.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hanover Citizens for an Elected School Board</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, collected more than 10,000 signatures in support of placing the question of whether the county’s school board should be appointed or elected on the November ballot. In July, their work earned the court-ordered </span><a href="https://www.vpm.org/news/2023-07-21/hanover-county-elected-school-board-referendum" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">right to a referendum</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The group makes some very sane points. They highlight the fact that while school boards in Virginia have no taxation authority, they do determine how federal, state and local funds, some of which come from taxpayers, should be spent. Even if Hanover residents don’t have a child in school or any connection to the school board, their taxes still fund it. Should taxpayers continue to have no say in the school board’s decisions? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A counter-effort to keep the school board appointed has geared up, fueled by a $15,000 contribution from the </span><a href="https://www.vpap.org/committees/474664/raw-reports-in/?schedule=A" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hanover County Republican Committee</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They’re fighting under the banner of voting no to “political school boards.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Hanover’s school board has </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">always </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">been political, by virtue of its members’ appointment by the Board of Supervisors, whose politics could be seen as clear as day even by Stevie Wonder.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another anti-elected school board group, Together Hanover, shared this </span><a href="https://rumble.com/v2jwcca-i-know-spotlighting-is-illegal-officer-but.....html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">frankly frightening presentation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in an April Board of Supervisors meeting. If you don’t care to watch the full sermon, they allege that those seeking an elected school board </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">have an “unstated goal through teaching CRT to create a race war and gender war” and are </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">vying “t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">o not only keep parents out of the classroom but to keep parents from knowing what&#8217;s going on in the classroom in the first place.” The rhetoric is closely aligned with Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s dubious </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/08/21/virginia-youngkin-parents-matter-elections/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Parents Matter” movement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which stokes unfounded fears about Virginia schoolchildren being force-fed critical race theory and equity education.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If parents matter so much, why shouldn’t they have a say in deciding who will represent them and their children on the school board? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Election Day in Hanover, there will be much to lose but also much to gain. Whether the referendum on electing the school board passes or fails, the fact that it’s on the ballot means Hanover citizens finally have a vote in the county school system’s progression or regression — and a chance to participate in the democratic processes that uphold this nation. </span></p>

You rise, get dressed, scarf down some cereal and, if you’re very lucky, fire up your computer to work remotely. If you’re less lucky — or if you just prefer commuting and working face-to-face with other humans — you rush out of the door, hop in your vehicle and drive to work, or get there via public transportation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But if you’re one of the thousands of residents of the commonwealth who have lost their driving privileges and can’t access a bus or train, you’re just out of luck.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are currently about 6.3 million licensed drivers in Virginia, according to the </span><a href="https://www.dmv.virginia.gov/about/agency-overview" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Department of Motor Vehicles</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. From July 1, 2021 to June 30, 2022, there were </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">11,212 people who lost their driving privileges for the first time because they drove on a suspended or revoked license; another 4,408 people faced the same consequence for driving with a suspended or revoked license for the second time. That’s nearly 16,000 citizens of the commonwealth who can’t drive to work, doctor’s appointments or even the grocery store, and these figures, the latest data available from charitable organization </span><a href="https://www.drivetowork.org/index.cfm" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drive-To-Work</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, don’t show the full scope of the problem.</span></p>

Good riddance.&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2019/12/16/va-law-that-seizes-licenses-for-unpaid-court-debt-appears-doomed-good-riddance/embed/#?secret=zUwkHWlTGH#?secret=xLCrPCp4dZ" data-secret="xLCrPCp4dZ" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There are lots of ways you can lose your license in Virginia,” said Sara Wilson, an attorney and Drive-To-Work’s president and CEO. Besides incarceration, the commonwealth can snatch away one’s mobility ability due to driving under the influence of alcohol, failing to make child support payments, not paying court costs stemming from vehicle accidents, not maintaining insurance and more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Money is a big hurdle” for people trying to get their license back, Wilson said. “They have to pay for the driver improvement clinic, they have to get an intervention interview, they have to get insurance, or they&#8217;ve been in jail and have to pay child support. … All of that requires money to complete.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This means economically disadvantaged Virginians are disproportionately affected by these standards; so too are Black would-be drivers, who Wilson says represent most of Drive-To-Work’s clientele. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our typical client is a Black male who is 30 to 45,” Wilson said. One of those clients, Kenneth Judkins, Sr., spoke about his arduous experience regaining his license at Drive-To-Work’s annual Second Chance Community Luncheon in early October. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I first lost my driver’s license privileges in October 2003, because of driving while intoxicated in my car. I was immediately affected because I used to have a Class A [commercial driver’s license] and I used to drive tractor trailers,” Judkins said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the next six years, Judkins racked up several more DUIs and served stints in jail as a result. He moved to New Jersey in 2011, seeking an “environmental change” to aid in his recovery; while there he got a job as a building maintenance man but was still struggling with drinking. By the time he moved back to Virginia to renovate his grandmother’s mobile home in 2017, he’d had a change of heart and lifestyle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I finally realized I needed to make a wise decision: either I wanted to drive or I wanted to drink alcohol. I needed to stop drinking and driving before it killed me or someone else,” Judkins said at the luncheon. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He stopped drinking but kept driving without a license, because he needed to get back and forth to work. In 2021, he contacted Wilson to start the process of regaining his driving privileges; it took two and a half years, but in June of this year, Judkins was granted a license and the ability to drive legally for the first time in nearly 20 years.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I now have my own handyman service. … Thank you for a second chance,” he told Wilson and her Drive-To-Work colleagues at the luncheon. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Judkins’ situation shows how hard it can be for some Virginia residents to earn back their driving rights, the loss of which can seriously impact their ability to get and keep a job, support themselves and their families, complete basic self-care tasks and maintain social bonds with their friends and community members. While it’s true that many of these people lost their license due to their own poor decisions, after they’ve served their time, paid their debt to society and are attempting to become productive members of their communities, it’s critical that they have the support and resources they need, including and especially a valid driver’s license.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drive-To-Work has advocated for major changes in Virginia’s laws regarding restoration of driving privileges since it was founded in 2007 by Randy Rollins, a former McGuireWoods lawyer and Virginia Secretary of Public Safety under Gov. Douglas Wilder. The General Assembly in 2019 passed legislation that stopped driver’s licenses from being suspended solely because of unpaid court fees, a change for which Drive-To-Work had lobbied for years. Before the law changed, the Legal Aid Justice Center said in a 2016 lawsuit against the state that more than </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/transportation/2019/06/03/va-drivers-licenses-suspended-unpaid-court-debt-be-reinstated-july/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">940,000 Virginians</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> had their licenses suspended for unpaid court fees and fines.</span></p>

Automatically</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;How will 627,000 drivers with suspended licenses get their privileges back under new law? Automatically&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2019/04/17/how-will-627000-drivers-with-suspended-licenses-get-their-privileges-back-under-new-law-automatically/embed/#?secret=oTuSZnD9uo#?secret=1GdtuYBwf9" data-secret="1GdtuYBwf9" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The court fee law is just one piece of legislation that Drive-To-Work has challenged as inequitable; Wilson says the group has several legislative priorities in its sights for the 2024 General Assembly session. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want to terminate restriction periods on drivers licenses for cases that are so old they&#8217;ve been purged by the court system,” Wilson said, noting if someone’s purged case dates back 10 years, they’ve already spent a decade without their license. “It’s inefficient and an unnecessary hurdle,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want to also see a restricted license developed for people who have had a conviction for a motor vehicle-related judgment, so that these folks can drive, get back to work and pay off the judgment. And we also want to see better communication between the DMV and the courts all over Virginia,” Wilson said, citing a client who, despite having a court approve his license reinstatement, had to repeatedly visit DMV to claim his card, all because of a simple paperwork problem that could have been cleared up had the courts and DMV collaborated more clearly on his case. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earning the right to drive again isn’t just a way for folks to cruise the streets; for many Virginians, it is a second lease on life and a much-needed opportunity to do better, get it right and move forward — goals that most of us strive towards daily. </span></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richmond city leaders really, really want a casino. So much so that they resurrected an effort to build a sprawling, $562 million entertainment emporium that Richmond voters killed in 2021. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voters will have another chance to yea or nay the casino in November’s general election after Richmond City Council </span><a href="https://www.vpm.org/news/2023-06-13/richmond-casino-referendum-2023-approved-council" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">voted June 12</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to put the casino referendum on the ballot once again. Public perceptions of the casino are mixed, with voters pointing to an array of factors from race to economic equity that they see as front of mind in the decision.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Richmond Grand Resort and Casino developers are making lots of promises about how much their venue would benefit the 8th and 9th districts of Richmond’s Southside, a largely Black and Latino part of the city that has long struggled with poverty, unemployment, limited economic development and other challenges. It’s understandable, then, that the developers’ claims that the casino will create 1,300 jobs is attractive to many Southside residents. The jobs, plus an initial $25 million payment to the city and an estimated $30 million in revenue generation each year, definitely sounds like a sweet deal.</span></p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Fifth Virginia casino could be in the cards, but Richmond voters still divided&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/09/29/fifth-virginia-casino-could-be-in-the-cards-but-richmond-voters-still-divided/embed/#?secret=rUBnsU2asn#?secret=1Y77Z3YDNA" data-secret="1Y77Z3YDNA" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there is limited evidence that casinos are a boon for the communities or states where they’re built. “We find that, despite tax revenues being a major motivator for state legalization of casinos, there is little evidence that they boost state taxes,” </span><a href="https://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/economic_brief/2022/eb_22-28" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wrote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond last year. And there’s absolutely no guarantee that the casino, if built, would actually make as much money as its developers project. If it doesn’t become a cash cow, how will it give tens of millions to the city?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s important to note that the </span><a href="https://www.vpap.org/electionresults/20211102/election-1707/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">doomed 2021 referendum</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was most strongly supported in the majority-Black 8th and 9th districts, but soundly rejected in the whiter, more affluent 1st, 2nd, 4th and 5th districts. Some, including Richmond City Council President Michael Jones, feel that the perspectives of Black Southside residents shouldn’t be overshadowed by those of white Richmonders. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As an African-American male, I have a problem hearing white people say ‘this is not good for Black people, this is not good for poor people.’ That’s a very paternalistic view and perspective,” Jones </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/09/29/fifth-virginia-casino-could-be-in-the-cards-but-richmond-voters-still-divided/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">told</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> VCU’s Capital News Service.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I agree with Jones. We should acknowledge the agency and perspective of Black voters on the casino issue; some want it, </span><a href="http://www.richmondforall.com/rfa-canvassing-engages-community-on-proposed-casino/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">others don’t,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and it’s their right to assert their views. Black people are not monolithic, and this casino issue is a prime example of the diversity of thoughts, beliefs and values of Black Richmonders and Virginians. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, however, we should take a critical look at the casino and question its potential value or detriment to Richmond and to the state. No project this expensive and expansive should escape scrutiny of every detail. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of those details give me pause. One is the fact that the casino developers have brought on a major new partner, Churchill Downs, a company that’s been repeatedly accused of </span><a href="https://www.lpm.org/news/2021-05-01/a-second-year-of-racial-justice-protests-outside-the-kentucky-derby" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">underpaying and exploiting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Black and Latino Kentucky Derby workers and “gentrifying” the surrounding South End community in Louisville. Another is the recent revelation that the casino’s parent company, Urban One, has a record of </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/government-politics/richmond-grand-resort-and-casino-urban-one/article_86cc139a-6225-11ee-99f1-4b296f134b38.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">shoddy financial recordkeeping and reporting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and could soon be delisted from the NASDAQ stock market.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="xuTFpaXSYn"><p><a href="https://kentuckylantern.com/2023/05/05/the-state-of-the-derby/" target="_blank">The state of the Derby</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m not a Richmond resident, though, and it will be up to those who are to determine whether the casino is the right fit for their hometown. In the meantime, the city leadership’s best bet would be to continue listening to the voices of all its citizens, not only those who want the casino as badly as they do.</span></p>

(City of Harrisonburg) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before 1960, Harrisonburg&#8217;s Northeast neighborhood was a vibrant, predominantly Black community filled with homes, businesses and families striving toward a brighter future during the height of America&#8217;s Civil Rights Movement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But starting in the 1960s, the dreams and progress of many of those Northeast families were crushed by </span><a href="https://www.wmra.org/wmra-news/2020-02-11/the-legacy-of-harrisonburgs-urban-renewal" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the city&#8217;s urban renewal projects</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which destroyed dozens of Black-owned homes and businesses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What the all-white city leadership saw as removing blight and improving aesthetic appeal, residents saw as the wholesale demolition of their community. For some, it permanently severed their trust in their hometown government.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, some 50 years later, there&#8217;s an opportunity to repair some of the physical and emotional damage, to reconnect Northeast to the city&#8217;s downtown and to strengthen the fragile bonds that hold the community together. </span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Northeast disconnected</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;A lot of times we focus on the homes that were demolished, whereas when I think about urban renewal, it&#8217;s about the community and sense of community that was lost,&#8221; said Monica Robinson, a Harrisonburg City Council member, Northeast resident and executive director of the </span><a href="https://valleyblackheritage.org/index.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shenandoah Valley Black Heritage Project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Maybe your home wasn&#8217;t burned or razed, but by the community changing and other buildings and markers moved, that collective memory and sense of self was lost,” she continued. “Ms. So and So&#8217;s house who watched you as a child, the homes of people you knew, that was all lost. &#8230; When you lose everything that&#8217;s familiar to you, when you lose that sense of safety that allows you to be able to live freely in that area, you don&#8217;t have to lose your house to lose everything.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Robinson is one of the community leaders who will help determine how grant funds from </span><a href="https://smartgrowthamerica.org/program/community-connectors-grants/#custom-collapse-0-7" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smart Growth America</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that are intended to &#8220;repair the damage of divisive infrastructure in small and mid-sized cities&#8221; will be used. Harrisonburg is one of 15 cities nationwide to be selected for the organization&#8217;s Community Connectors program, which will provide money, technical knowledge and other forms of assistance to communities whose transportation and socioeconomic growth has been hindered by past urban renewal projects. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, the specter of government-ordained urban renewal has haunted many communities of color for decades. Richmond&#8217;s &#8220;Black Wall Street,&#8221; </span><a href="https://reconnectjacksonward.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jackson Ward</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, was split in half by the construction of Interstates 95 and 64 in the 1950s. Charlottesville&#8217;s oldest center of Black business and homeownership, </span><a href="https://www.pbs.org/video/raisedrazed-bg0gek/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vinegar Hill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, was razed to make way for parking lots during the same time period. Roanoke&#8217;s </span><a href="https://www.wsls.com/features/2020/08/06/urban-renewal-redlining-still-have-lasting-effects-on-roanokes-black-communities/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gainsboro</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> neighborhood once brimmed with cultural spaces and homes, until redlining in the 1930s reduced economic investment. It&#8217;s a familiar, sad pattern seen not only in Virginia, but across the country. It&#8217;s also why the Community Connectors program is so needed and welcome in Harrisonburg.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I live in Northeast, the same community I grew up in,&#8221; said Harrisonburg Mayor Deanna Reed, the first Black woman to inhabit the role. &#8220;This was a community that went through the hardships of urban renewal in the 60s.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That included the construction of North Mason Street, which is now an infrastructure barrier that separates Northeast from the heart of the city. Harrisonburg&#8217;s R-4 Project in the 1960s delineated Northeast — a part of the city bounded by Broad, Johnson, North Main and Rock streets — as blighted and subsequently, under the auspices of eminent domain, tore or burned down homes and businesses there. </span></p>

(City of Harrisonburg)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I have aunts who remember that time. I remember them talking about the smell of houses burning; it was very traumatic. It is a piece of our history that we&#8217;ve never healed from,&#8221; Reed said. She envisions the Community Connectors grant as a tool for healing those deep wounds. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The exact scope of the Community Connectors project in Harrisonburg remains to be determined: Its details will be worked out in a process to be led by community groups like the Shenandoah Valley Black Heritage Project, the </span><a href="https://www.nenava.org/history.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Northeast Neighborhood Association</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and Harrisonburg Downtown Renaissance. </span></p>
<p>Steve Davis, assistant vice president of transportation strategy at Smart Growth America, said Harrisonburg was selected for the Community Connectors grant from a pool of 80 cities nationwide largely because of its goal to repair harm the city had done to parts of its community by its urban renewal projects.</p>
<p>A major challenge of Community Connector-style projects, which “retrofit, repair, or remove a road or highway, is that they are most often controlled or owned by state departments of transportation, requiring a major amount of cooperation, buy-in, and complexity,” Davis said in an email. “The fact that the city controls the major road in question” made Harrisonburg a great fit for the grant, he continued. “They’ve got a good group of stakeholders involved so they can rebuild trust, engage the community on a forward-looking plan, and then carry it out without needing to bring higher levels of government to the table.”</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harrisonburg Director of Communications Michael Parks said the city&#8217;s Department of Public Works applied for the grant and wants to base everything on what the community wants, the opposite mindset of city leadership in the past. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We want to go into the community and have these difficult conversations, and help our residents feel comfortable talking with us,” he said. “Maybe the grant funds will allow us to contract with a third-party facilitator to lead those dialogues. Our goal is to try to repair the ruptures between some families and city government as it pertains to history, and whatever the city can do to address those, that&#8217;s what we want to do. Those conversations will be the driving force behind what action we take.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Parks said that in present-day Harrisonburg, the city sees four-lane North Mason Street as &#8220;an overbuilt roadway that is a significant barrier between Northeast and downtown. We want people to be able to walk to shops or even City Hall from Northeast, and they can&#8217;t do that presently.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Possible solutions include creating walking and biking paths to reconnect Northeast to the city&#8217;s center. While Parks said the city doesn&#8217;t yet know the exact amount of the grant funds, it will be up to $130,000.</span></p>
<p>Davis added that the grant money is meant to permanently establish the city’s capacity for this project and others of its kind in the future. It can be used for “staff salaries, consultant fees, data collection and analysis, meetings, supplies, funding support for community-based organization participation, initiative-related travel, other direct expenses,” and other costs the city will determine with Smart Growth America. For Harrisonburg and the other 14 cities in the Community Connectors cohort, Smart Growth America will “connect them with resources available in state and federal transportation programs, providing support tailored to each project&#8217;s need.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Harrisonburg is setting an example that other localities in Virginia should follow</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is heartening to see the city take such steps to repair past harms, however overdue. Other cities and towns should take note, if they hope to contribute to the creation of a more equitable commonwealth where everyone’s heritage and identity is honored and respected. It would also be a wise course for cities and counties if they don’t want to repeat the history of officially sanctioned, destructive land use and eminent domain decisions that have harmed Virginians of color for generations — and over which they have prevailed, against all odds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next steps for the Community Connectors rollout in Harrisonburg will be a meeting between funders Smart Growth America, Mayor Reed and the community groups, to be held in Atlanta in November. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The city will seize the chance to move forward, said Reed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is just a piece of our past that we need to acknowledge, understand and heal from,” she said. “Harrisonburg is a place for everyone; it used to not be that way, but we are now.&#8221; </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Headlines blared the torrid news about Gibson, a Democratic candidate running to represent the 57th District in Virginia&#8217;s House of Delegates: She performed sex acts with her husband for an online audience and asked viewers to chip in tips, a violation of porn site Chaturbate&#8217;s rules. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This information about Gibson was first shared with </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/09/11/susanna-gibson-sex-website-virginia-candidate/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Washington Post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by an unnamed Republican operative and has since traveled worldwide, blared in headlines from here to India and plenty of places in between.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Post and other media juxtaposed Gibson&#8217;s racy online activities with the fact that she is a mother of two children, a nurse practitioner and a married native Virginian who enjoys meals and board games with her family. All of this information was publicly available before The Post&#8217;s story broke, but the media glare now starkly contrasts it with her X-rated online romps with her husband.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The question is, why should it matter that this married mom engaged in consensual sex with her husband and invited others to watch online? There&#8217;s nothing illegal about adults live streaming sexual acts and there&#8217;s no evidence Gibson or her husband were coerced into doing so. The pearl-clutching and head shaking that the revelation of Gibson&#8217;s videos were meant to prompt stem from a bedrock of American culture: patriarchal standards that dictate what morality means and how it is exemplified in our ideals and practices – with a special laser focus on women&#8217;s behavior.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I smell more than a whiff of misogyny in the social media comments circulating like wildfire about Gibson, and sadly, women appear to be some of the chief water bearers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I hope she is removed from her employment&#8230;don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d ever want her to [be] anywhere near my health-care,&#8221; wrote one user of X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. Another X user said of Gibson, &#8220;Oh gross! Filthy! What is she doing with a white coat on?!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That people are disqualifying Gibson&#8217;s educational credentials and years of professional health care experience because she chose to make porn online with her life partner is absurd. Calling Gibson filthy is tantamount to so-called &#8220;slut shaming,&#8221; defined as &#8220;the action or fact of stigmatizing a woman for engaging in behavior judged to be promiscuous or sexually provocative.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe you or I wouldn&#8217;t do as Gibson did; that&#8217;s our preference, and that&#8217;s fine. We all have the right to think and believe differently, as long as we&#8217;re not harming others or infringing on their rights. Likewise, no one was harmed and no rights were violated by Gibson&#8217;s preference to film and broadcast her sexually explicit videos.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For her part, Gibson isn&#8217;t slinking into the shadows or hanging her head in shame. In response to the scandal, she told the Post: “It won’t intimidate me and it won’t silence me. My political opponents and their Republican allies have proven they’re willing to commit a sex crime to attack me and my family because there’s no line they won’t cross to silence women when they speak up.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While I don&#8217;t agree with her that the revelation of her videos was a crime (after all, she chose to post them on a publicly accessible porn site), I commend her courage in speaking up for herself in what would be a truly humiliating and terrifying situation for many of us. And I think she&#8217;s right that there is a very real, sustained effort to silence and diminish the voices and experiences of women, from within and without the Republican Party. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We need look no further than the raging inferno of abortion access and reproductive rights debates to see that. Despite </span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/religious-landscape-study/state/virginia/views-about-abortion/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">55% of Virginians, over half of them women, believing abortion should be legal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in all or most cases, most Republican messaging, candidates and leaders (including our</span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/11/us/politics/virginia-youngkin-elections.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> governor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) support a 15-week ban on abortion; some continue to tune out women’s voices to maintain their pro-life proclivities.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="FKlaxE10kv"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/08/02/expanding-abortion-access-would-benefit-all-virginians/">Expanding abortion access would benefit all Virginians</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Expanding abortion access would benefit all Virginians&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/08/02/expanding-abortion-access-would-benefit-all-virginians/embed/#?secret=AuyoFcgdk8#?secret=FKlaxE10kv" data-secret="FKlaxE10kv" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia chapter of the National Organization for Women reiterated their support for Gibson Thursday and in a statement said her stance on abortion likely fueled the firestorm she’s now embroiled in.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “It’s clear to us she is being attacked because she is an abortion rights advocate who is gaining momentum in an election that is increasingly about maintaining Virginia as the last Southern state with access to legal abortion and which offers safe harbor for girls, women, and pregnant people facing crisis pregnancies,” said Virginia NOW president Lisa Sales.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The gender pay gap hasn&#8217;t closed over the past two decades, the Pew Research Center reported in March; on average, American </span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/03/01/gender-pay-gap-facts/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">women earned just 82% of what men earned</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last year, with disparities even worse for women of color. The most recent data available from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that in 2021 in Virginia, </span><a href="https://www.bls.gov/regions/mid-atlantic/news-release/womensearnings_virginia.htm#:~:text=In%202021%2C%20Virginia%20women%20who,of%20Labor%20Statistics%20reported%20today." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">women earned just 80%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of what men earned. It’s an issue that many women’s rights groups, including Virginia NOW, keep ringing the bell about. Still, Republicans in the U.S. Senate in recent years </span><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/06/08/gender-pay-gap-senate-republicans-492316" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">blocked a bill </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">to </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/7/actions" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">redress the pay gap</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. (Virginia&#8217;s Democratic Sens. Mark Warner and Tim Kaine supported the bill.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Susanna Gibson&#8217;s online sexual forays should have no bearing on her ability to make positive civic contributions and to serve Virginians. Could making porn</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> possibly right before or in the early days of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> launching a political campaign show poor judgment on Gibson’s part? Maybe. It will be up to voters to decide that come November. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The agricultural practices Chavis and a dedicated team of volunteers use at Sankofa reflect the advent of an agricultural movement centered on uplifting the work and challenges of Black farmers and earth workers nationwide. The media has highlighted important issues like food deserts in majority-Black neighborhoods and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/02/19/1156851675/in-2022-black-farmers-were-persistently-left-behind-from-the-usdas-loan-system#:~:text=Black%20farmers%20still%20receive%20the,withdrawn%20per%20each%20racial%20group." target="_blank">discriminatory lending practices</a> that block Black farmers from success. Underneath it all is a push for access to and ownership of land.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the span of the 20th century, Black families lost </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/12/04/growing-forward-facing-historic-and-modern-challenges-virginias-black-farmers-look-to-bolster-ranks-and-grow-their-communities/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">90% of the land they owned</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, approximately 16 million acres. Though the economic impacts of those losses are staggering, they aren’t incalculable: </span><a href="https://www.americanbar.org/groups/crsj/publications/human_rights_magazine_home/wealth-disparities-in-civil-rights/the-contemporary-relevance-of-historic-black-land-loss/#:~:text=By%201997%2C%20Black%20farmers%20lost,land%20from%201920%20to%201997." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> released earlier this year by the American Bar Association found their cumulative value was $326 billion.</span></p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Growing forward: Facing historic and modern challenges, Virginia’s black farmers look to bolster ranks and grow their communities&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2018/12/04/growing-forward-facing-historic-and-modern-challenges-virginias-black-farmers-look-to-bolster-ranks-and-grow-their-communities/embed/#?secret=2Gwr8EubnD#?secret=1B6HLAfkaq" data-secret="1B6HLAfkaq" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even that, the organization reported, was a conservative estimate based on county-level census data from 17 states that contained the bulk of Black acreage, including Virginia. That land loss, and the inability to pass the land on to future generations of Black people, undergird America&#8217;s present-day wealth gap. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, white Americans &#8220;make 73 percent more in annual income, are nearly two times more likely to own their homes, hold ten times more wealth, and are 28 times more likely to become millionaires than Black Americans,&#8221; RAND Corporation researchers </span><a href="https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA1259-2.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">found</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in May. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chavis and other area Black farmers joined with the Massachusetts-based Agrarian Land Trust last year in a series of efforts to return land to the hands of African Americans in central Virginia. Among the group was Renard Turner, owner and operator of Louisa County&#8217;s </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/vanguardranchmeatgoats" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vanguard Ranch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and a celebrated agricultural leader, and fifth-generation </span><a href="https://thecarterfarms.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Orange County farmer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and agricultural educator Michael Carter, Jr. Along with Chavis and others, both men are founding board members of the Central Virginia Agrarian Commons, which is overseen by the Agrarian Land Trust. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Agrarian Land Trust helped broker an 80-acre land donation to the Commons as part of what Chavis called “an act of reparative justice.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Basically, a white woman who grew up in Amelia and didn&#8217;t have any kids wanted to make sure her land went back to Black people, because it had been a plantation where people were enslaved,&#8221; he explained. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That white woman, </span><a href="https://www.agrariantrust.org/initiatives/agrarian-commons/about-the-central-virginia-agrarian-commons-board/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Callie Walker</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, gave the 80 acres of land she inherited from her family because, she stated on the group&#8217;s website, her ownership of it was &#8220;a responsibility and a calling to find others who will nurture the land itself, the food it can grow and the people it can feed.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The trust has overseen other acquisitions as well, including the purchase of 5 acres of land in Petersburg, which the Central Virginia Agrarian Commons is now leasing at low or no cost to Black agriculturists like Natasha Crawford of </span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@thebeerandthegarden" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Healing Hope Urban Gardens</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and Tyrone Cherry of </span><a href="https://www.oasisyouthfarm.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Petersburg Oasis CommUNITY Farm</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, whose efforts to grow food, expand green space and educate youth offer major benefits to the region, Chavis said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of this is &#8220;land-based reparations, and a model for other organizations to follow,” Chavis said. “One of the biggest impasses for Black and brown people farming is lack of land and lack of capital to buy it. So we are removing those barriers from the equation.” There are more parcels available for anyone who wants to get their hands dirty. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Central Virginia Agrarian Commons’ work will be highlighted at this year’s milestone </span><a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/cc/the-20th-annual-happily-natural-day-2393869" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Happily Natural Day</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a festival Chavis founded 20 years ago to celebrate African diasporic culture, holistic health and Black beauty in a world dominated by Eurocentric beauty standards. This year’s festival, which will run Aug. 25 to 27, will include a guided tour of four Black-owned urban farms in central Virginia, panel discussions on racial, social and land justice work in the region and beyond, at least 40 local vendors and a performance by Hip Hop pioneers Dead Prez. The festival will conclude Sunday with </span><a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/another-black-beautiful-brunch-registration-672783422327" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another Black and Beautiful Brunch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at Sankofa Orchard, featuring a vegan feast prepared with community-grown foods and activities including yoga, art, and live music.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a basket of glistening purple eggplants that he probably picked in view on a nearby table, Chavis says Happily Natural Day is a “best of” celebration of his and other Black agriculturalists’ ongoing work, like the 12-week <a href="https://www.wtvr.com/news/local-news/central-virginia-urban-farm-fellowship-brook-road-youth-farm-january-29-2023" target="_blank">Central Virginia Urban Farm Fellowship</a>, which is designed to foster more Black and Hispanic growers. Brook Road Youth Farm is another endeavor, helmed by a youth training program that offers mindfulness exercises, culinary arts experiences, workforce development and more. Up next: a Happily Natural food truck, which will turn the produce that they grow into ready-to-eat meals and food products and provide opportunities for Black chefs and entrepreneurs to partner while building their skills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Policy-wise, Chavis sees a need for state funds to flow to efforts to fight the effects of climate change in</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/there-may-be-a-link-between-urban-heat-islands-and-past-redlining-practices-study-finds/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> formerly redlined neighborhoods</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the often majority-minority communities that are disproportionately impacted by a steadily-warming planet. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We see more adverse health effects in these communities, we see </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/08/01/out-with-the-green-in-with-the-heat/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">urban heat islands</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we see questionable impacts on water sources and flooding,” said Chavis. “All of these issues need further study and funding for solutions statewide, especially in the frontline communities where we work. These spaces and residents are taking the brunt of it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The work of Chavis and other Black agriculturalists is crucial because it is rooted in equity and returning that which was lost. Black people, newly freed from slavery, were promised <a href="https://www.pbs.org/wnet/african-americans-many-rivers-to-cross/history/the-truth-behind-40-acres-and-a-mule/" target="_blank">40 acres and a mule</a> by the American government, a promise that never materialized and perhaps was never sincere in the first place. Modern-day efforts to repair that and other historic wrongs are more than admirable; they are necessary and represent the very best of who we can be, collectively.  </span></p>

(Roger Chesley/ Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The descendants of Virginia-born miracle woman Henrietta Lacks finally won a major </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/henrietta-lacks-hela-cells-thermo-fisher-scientific-bfba4a6c10396efa34c9b79a544f0729" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">settlement with a biotechnology company</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that profited billions from Lacks&#8217; ever-reproducing cells; I congratulate them. The hard-won settlement is a glimmer of justice flashing within a dark facet of America&#8217;s medical and scientific progress, fields fueled by racist, unethical practices in the past and present that have taken so much from Black people and given very little in return.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://edu.lva.virginia.gov/changemakers/items/show/30" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lacks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, born in the rolling hills of Roanoke and raised in Halifax County tobacco country, changed the course of medical and scientific history without ever knowing it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Researchers at Johns Hopkins University Hospital harvested cells from Lacks&#8217; body without asking her or telling her they were doing so while she was being treated for cervical cancer there in 1951. They did so because they discovered Lacks’ cells lived on and on, never dying and instead, astonishingly, reproducing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cells, which scientists dubbed HeLa after Lacks, became a foundational force in research into diseases like polio, cancer and COVID-19. Lacks&#8217; cells were the first human cells sent into space, and the first human cells to be successfully cloned. Scientists used them to study the effect of radiation on humans. It is no understatement to say that many of the </span><a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/who-was-henrietta-lacks-heres-how-hela-cells-became-essential-to-medical-research" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">medical breakthroughs of the 20th century</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, progress that increased the quality of life for untold millions of Americans and others worldwide, would not have been possible without Lacks&#8217; cells. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They also became an engine for others’ profit. Companies worldwide have for decades been reproducing and marketing HeLa cells, raking in billions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet Lacks herself never saw any benefit from the use of her cells in her lifetime, nor did her family, which struggled with chronic illnesses and financial insecurity after her October 1951 death. Where is the fairness in that? The settlement the family reached with the biotech company Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., whatever the amount of money, is not enough to compensate for the incalculable benefit to humanity that Lacks’ cells provided, but I’m glad they got something. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What about the other Black Virginians and Americans who have also contributed to medical and scientific progress? What is their reward and legacy?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sepia-skinned victims of </span><a href="https://dailyprogress.com/news/local/uva/grave-robbing-detailed-in-final-uva-slavery-report/article_ccdf6a26-9822-11e8-9818-6b7678744ccc.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richmond grave robbers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – the unidentified Black people whose bodies were stolen and dissected so that physicians at Virginia medical schools could better study anatomy – what payment did they or their relatives get for giving their bodies into the hands of white medical professionals? None.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What about the thousands of </span><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-31654546" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">African Americans who were forcibly sterilized</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, sometimes without their knowledge, under the state’s 1924 Eugenical Sterilisation Act — legislation that wasn’t outlawed until 1979? For the destruction of their</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">reproductive abilities, sterilized Virginians may now, after </span><a href="https://dbhds.virginia.gov/developmental-services/victimsofeugenics/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">applying for a program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and enduring screening by an advisory panel, be eligible for $25,000 compensation, itself “contingent on the availability of funding,” through a </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/admincodeexpand/title12/agency35/chapter240/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">state compensation fund</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> created in 2017. That little bit of money doesn’t come close to balancing the unknowable loss of these peoples’ potential progeny, but it’s apparently the best Virginia can do.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Will the nameless enslaved women subjected to the between-the-legs butchery of </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/04/17/603163394/-father-of-gynecology-who-experimented-on-slaves-no-longer-on-pedestal-in-nyc" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">J. Marion Sim</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">s, the so-called “father of gynecology,” ever get their due, or will their families be rewarded for their foremothers’ sacrifices? Probably not. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed, today’s Black Virginians are largely descended from enslaved laborers, builders, cooks, craftsmen, businesspeople and thinkers whose unpaid efforts laid the foundation for this state and this nation. </span><a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/why-we-need-reparations-for-black-americans/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reparations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, though, the idea of paying Black people for centuries of their ancestors’ free labor, work upon which most American industries were built, is still a bad word in many circles. Even among people more open to the possibility, the “how” outweighs the “why,” and year after year, we do nothing to make right so much that was and is wrong.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We can and should celebrate the victory of Lacks’ family’s settlement, but we must understand that she is but one Black person whose contributions counted for a lot while they themselves benefited maybe just a little – or not at all. With Lacks in mind, we must endeavor to correct the harms of the past – yes, sometimes with cash –  in order to forge a more equitable future for all of us.</span></p>

(Samantha Willis/The Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I visited the Hickory Hill Community Center last week in Richmond’s Southside, the first thing I noticed was the pervasive presence of the Richmond Fire Department. RFD vehicles filled the parking lot and a polite, fresh-faced young fireman ushered me into the red brick building that, in its previous life, was the first high school for African American students in Chesterfield County (annexed by the city in 1970). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Navigating the narrow hallways of the building, which until now has been used as a recreational and educational space for residents of the area, I encountered several more firefighters, some attending a training session in one of the classrooms. Outside, a hulking fire engine leaked fluid onto the pavement near the center’s playground, community garden and a small park space dotted with benches. There are no children in sight, only a few Parks and Recreation employees; when they notice my camera, they tell me I can’t take photos and ask me to leave – despite the center being a public facility – as more fire crew members stroll by.  If I didn’t know any better, their attitudes would lead me to think I was trespassing at an official fire department facility. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it isn’t an official fire department facility – yet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hickory Hill has been embroiled in a firestorm of controversy sparked by the fire department’s December 2022 proposal to install a fire training facility on its grounds. The facility would consist of a two-story burn building made of shipping containers that would simulate live infernos firefighters could practice extinguishing. It would also swallow up two acres of Hickory Hill’s grassy grounds in the process. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therein lies a glaring contradiction of the city’s stated plans to add, not subtract, green spaces in a mostly Black and Latino part of town that sorely lacks them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adopted by Richmond City Council in 2020 under the leadership of Mayor Levar Stoney, the Richmond 300 Master Plan lays out an impressive array of goals and envisions a “welcoming, inclusive, diverse, innovative, sustainable, and equitable city of thriving neighborhoods.” </span><a href="https://www.rva.gov/planning-development-review/master-plan" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of those goals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the development of more parks and green spaces so that by 2037, “100% of Richmonders live within a 10-minute walk of a park.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am not the best with math, but I do understand that subtraction cannot equal addition. How can the city aspire to add more green spaces in one breath and in another suggest deleting a green space from an area of the city that needs it most?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hickory Hill </span><a href="https://cor.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=e4d732f225fe457d83df11fe9bf71daf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sits smack dab in the middle</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of an urban heat island, defined as an area of a city that is hotter than less densely populated and greener outlying areas.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_35862" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:2672px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Hickory-Hill-Urban-Heat-Island_RVAgreen250-climate-map.png" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-35862 size-full" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Hickory-Hill-Urban-Heat-Island_RVAgreen250-climate-map.png" alt="" width="2672" height="1302" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Hickory-Hill-Urban-Heat-Island_RVAgreen250-climate-map.png 2672w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Hickory-Hill-Urban-Heat-Island_RVAgreen250-climate-map-300x146.png 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Hickory-Hill-Urban-Heat-Island_RVAgreen250-climate-map-1024x499.png 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Hickory-Hill-Urban-Heat-Island_RVAgreen250-climate-map-768x374.png 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Hickory-Hill-Urban-Heat-Island_RVAgreen250-climate-map-1536x748.png 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Hickory-Hill-Urban-Heat-Island_RVAgreen250-climate-map-2048x998.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2672px) 100vw, 2672px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Richmond&#8217;s RVAgreen 250 plan identifies Hickory Hill Community.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heat islands are also an </span><a href="https://www.epa.gov/heatislands/heat-islands-and-equity" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">equity issue</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as explained by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, whose data have found that “people of color and community members with low incomes are more likely than other groups to live in historically redlined neighborhoods that are present-day intra-urban heat islands.” People living in urban heat islands also experience more heat-related health challenges, such as asthma driven by breathing ground-level ozone and smog.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.southsidereleaf.org" target="_blank">Southside ReLeaf</a>, a volunteer environmental justice group, has since 2019 planted and given away over 1,000 trees in Manchester, Blackwell and other areas of Richmond’s Southside to combat the effects of local urban heat islands and improve the quality of life of people living in them. Amy Wentz, the organization’s co-founder, said the group worked with Hickory Hill leaders to mitigate the impact of extreme heat in the neighborhood by planting over 100 trees there in 2021, in partnership with the Chesapeake Bay Foundation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I spoke with Wentz, she pointed out that the fire department’s proposed burn building runs against not only the Richmond 300 plan, but also the city’s </span><a href="https://www.rvagreen2050.com/what-is-rvagreen-2050" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">RVAgreen 250 plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, billed by the Office of Sustainability as “Richmond’s equity-centered climate action and resilience planning initiative.” The latter promises to slash and eventually eliminate the city’s greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 and, in the meantime, “help the community adapt to Richmond’s climate impacts of extreme heat, precipitation, and flooding.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How the hell are you gonna make these pledges and plans and then, when it comes to adding this burn building at Hickory Hill, you present almost like a direct retraction from all the things you said you were going to do?” Wentz asked Stoney and his administration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Groups like Southside ReLeaf aren’t the only ones concerned. Richmond’s Urban Design Commission recommended the project be denied back in March. The city’s Planning Commission in April </span><a href="https://richmondva.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6009986&amp;GUID=BED7E613-9328-4956-972B-28440548F12C&amp;Options=ID%7CText%7C&amp;Search=fire" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">denied</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the fire department’s request for the project, citing the “removal of greenspace,” the “adverse impact on the neighborhood” and “environmental concerns” among its reasons for the rejection.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_35864" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/PXL_20230721_182903660-scaled.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-35864 size-full" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/PXL_20230721_182903660-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1920" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/PXL_20230721_182903660-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/PXL_20230721_182903660-300x225.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/PXL_20230721_182903660-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/PXL_20230721_182903660-768x576.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/PXL_20230721_182903660-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/PXL_20230721_182903660-2048x1536.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Part of the green space at Hickory Hill Community Center that would be destroyed by a proposed fire training facility. (Samantha Willis/The Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite that, Stoney and the councilmember for the district where the site lies, Reva Trammell, trumped the recommendation of both bodies by introducing a </span><a href="https://richmondva.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6184783&amp;GUID=555B5AC2-457D-42B7-9FDC-BB72702EB6F7&amp;Options=ID%7CText%7C&amp;Search=hickory+hill" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">joint resolution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in May to “overrule the decision of the City Planning Commission denying approval of the City&#8217;s application to relocate the Department of Fire and Emergency Services training facility to the Hickory Hill Community Center.” City Council then passed the resolution, allowing the project to move forward.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It makes absolutely no sense to take away from this neighborhood’s already-limited green space to build a fire facility, period, and we expect better from our administration,” Wentz said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monica Esparza, a local resident who played on Hickory Hill’s grounds as a child and now serves as a trustee of the Hickory Hill Preservation Committee, agrees with that stance. Though the city owns Hickory Hill’s building and grounds and both are managed by the Parks and Recreation Department, she says she and other members of the preservation committee worked in tandem with officials for years to ramp up community programming and resources at the center – until the fire training facility proposal surfaced. Now, Esparza said there is less overall cooperation from the city, and its support of the fire department&#8217;s push for Hickory Hill’s green space feels like a hostile takeover.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_35861" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/PXL_20230721_183538953-scaled.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-35861 size-full" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/PXL_20230721_183538953-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1920" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/PXL_20230721_183538953-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/PXL_20230721_183538953-300x225.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/PXL_20230721_183538953-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/PXL_20230721_183538953-768x576.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/PXL_20230721_183538953-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/PXL_20230721_183538953-2048x1536.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Monica Esparaza, a Hickory Hill Community Center advocate, explains why she&#8217;s opposed to a fire training facility being built there. (Samantha Willis/The Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Many community members don’t feel welcome anymore when they come here,” she said while leading me on a tour of the grounds in the sweltering summer heat. The Parks and Rec employees working the center’s front desk wouldn’t allow us to meet anywhere inside the building; if community members get the same treatment, I don’t doubt at all that they feel as unwelcome as I did at Hickory Hill. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the fire training facility materializes, it would bring “problems with water runoff, chemicals from the burning building polluting the area, and other environmental problems,” Esparza said. “This is just not the right place to put a burn building, and I think deep down, they know that but they just don’t care.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On its face, the fire facility proposal may not seem harmful. After all, don’t we want our local fire fighters to receive the proper training so they can provide the best services possible? Everybody loves firefighters, those public servants who risk their lives to save others’ lives and property, those men and women who personify heroes in the minds of children and adults alike. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the opposition to this particular fire facility isn’t rooted in dislike of or disrespect for fire departments; rather, it’s about holding our leaders accountable for their promises of environmental equity. It’s about defending a part of the city that, historically, has been marginalized, under-resourced and ignored time and time again. Yes, the city’s fire department needs a training facility, but why does it have to be at Hickory Hill? I don’t know the answer to that question because the fire department didn’t respond to my interview requests.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next steps for the burn building remain to be seen; as of publication, a building permit had not been issued for it. Maybe the city’s real goal is to transform all of Hickory Hill into a fire department facility, and community members will just have to find another space to play soccer, learn crafts and build the bonds of fellowship that strengthen and sustain neighborhoods and neighbors. If that happens, local civic associations will lose access to their meeting space, the center will likely no longer be a voting precinct, and Southside – which has already lost so much through the years – will lose, once again.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Editor&#8217;s note: <em>This article has been updated to reflect that Southside ReLeaf has planted over 1,000 trees, not 500, in Southside Richmond, and that the group planted 100 trees at Hickory Hill Center in 2021, not this year. </em></p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Supreme Court of the United States last month </span><a href="https://alaskabeacon.com/2023/06/15/u-s-supreme-court-upholds-indian-child-welfare-act-in-7-2-decision/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">upheld the Indian Child Welfare Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (ICWA), a federal law designed to protect Native American children and keep them connected to their heritage. Four Virginia Indian tribes that signed on to a brief supporting the ICWA in the face of a challenge to its constitutionality say it is still a vital tool for the preservation of their communities and culture and is a cornerstone of tribal sovereignty in the state. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Four of Virginia&#8217;s </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/trump-signs-bill-recognizing-virginia-indian-tribes/2018/01/30/8a46b038-05d4-11e8-94e8-e8b8600ade23_story.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">seven federally recognized</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Indian tribes — the Monacan Indian Nation, the Pamunkey Indian Tribe, the Rappahannock Tribe and the Upper Mattaponi Indian Tribe — signed the amicus brief supporting the ICWA in the 2022 Haaland v. Brackeen lawsuit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The case emanated from a white couple in Texas who argued that the law — which says that if Native American children need to be adopted or placed in foster care, every effort must be made for them to remain in the care of their extended family or tribal community — was racially discriminatory and overrode state laws governing child welfare. On June 15, 2023, in a 7-2 decision, </span><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/21-376_7l48.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the justices overturned</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a Texas federal court&#8217;s decision that the ICWA was unconstitutional and cemented the law as a bedrock protection for some of the nation&#8217;s most vulnerable children. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ruling was a critical recognition of the tribes&#8217; right to decide what is in the best interest of their children, said Chief Robert Gray of the Pamunkey Tribe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We signed onto the brief because we believe the issue is important to tribal identity and respect for our culture and our sovereignty,” said Gray. The Supreme Court&#8217;s decision “affirmed our belief. We would say we see our sovereignty and tribal status as the chief issue. It&#8217;s not a racial issue, it&#8217;s a tribal issue.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Pamunkey was the first of Virginia&#8217;s Indian tribes to gain federal recognition, in 2015. This status grants tribes full control over legal affairs and governance within their communities and mandates that federal agencies consult them about regulatory policies that might impact them. But while that consultation is mandatory at the federal level, Virginia has lagged in granting Native Americans full sovereignty: Current state law </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/03/07/house-republicans-torpedo-bills-giving-virginia-tribes-state-consultation-rights/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">does not require</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Virginia agencies to consult with any of the tribes on projects and development plans that might affect them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legislation to institute that consultation right has been introduced twice, in 2022 and </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB2004" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2023</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But it has died both times in the House of Delegates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It takes an unimaginable amount of gall to invade people&#8217;s homeland, take control and nearly eradicate them in body and spirit and then, several centuries later, say — as Del. Lee Ware, R- Powhatan, did during the 2022 session — you&#8217;re not </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/03/07/house-republicans-torpedo-bills-giving-virginia-tribes-state-consultation-rights/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;comfortable yet&#8221;</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with passing laws to give them a say in protecting what few lands and rights they have managed to claw back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The tenuous nature of Virginia Indians&#8217; tribal sovereignty is part of what makes the ICWA&#8217;s protections for Indian children so consequential, said Gray.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;These children are citizens of the tribe; it&#8217;s a sovereignty issue,” he said. “I would liken it to, if there&#8217;s a French citizen in the U.S. that was being put up for adoption, the country of France would have a say in that adoption. You can kind of see how it works with adoptions from Russia, Romania and other countries; those governments have a say in those adoptions. Indian nations are looking for that same respect.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Pamunkey, Virginia tribes and other Indian nations have earned that respect a thousand times over. It takes just a quick survey of Virginia&#8217;s and America&#8217;s early history to see why the ICWA was desperately needed and remains important. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The European settlers who came to Virginia&#8217;s shores often </span><a href="https://www.dhr.virginia.gov/blog-posts/indians-a-d-1600-1800/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">harmed the health and culture</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the Indian communities they encountered, bringing disease and dis-ease wherever they ventured. Colonists reneged on treaties with the tribes, leading to the loss of most of their ancestral homelands and even their languages and instigating centuries of bitter, violent relations in the fledgling state. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then came other government-born horrors far and near: Thousands of tribal members were  forcibly relocated west through the Trail of Tears. Educational institutions designed programs to strip Native American children of their heritage and assimilate them into Western society and ideologies; they include one founded in </span><a href="https://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=73794" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1878 at Hampton University</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to “christianize and civilize” </span><a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/mnhs-org-support/mn_history_articles/51/v51i03p082-098.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">American Indians</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which is particularly disappointing coming from a college created by and for marginalized Black Americans. Eugenicist Walter Plecker, as head of Virginia’s Bureau of Vital Statistics, physically erased the heritage of countless tribal members on official birth and death certificates, which made it difficult for tribes in the commonwealth to prove their identities and gain federal recognition. Our vital records office is </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/02/14/in-righting-wrongs-former-state-registrar-helped-create-a-more-equitable-inclusive-virginia/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">still untangling</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> some of the mess Plecker made of Virginia Indians&#8217; ethnic and cultural heritage. </span></p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;In righting wrongs, former state registrar helped create a more equitable, inclusive Virginia&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/02/14/in-righting-wrongs-former-state-registrar-helped-create-a-more-equitable-inclusive-virginia/embed/#?secret=i4CaoECcKt#?secret=KqdWgVzoK4" data-secret="KqdWgVzoK4" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Department of Social Services is responsible for making sure the Indian Child Welfare Act is enforced in the state. The agency performs a bimonthly search of its child welfare information system, known as OASIS, for children identified as American Indian and/or Alaskan Native. If any children are identified, the agency works with the local social services department where the child lives to find nearby federally recognized Indian tribes and ensures they are aware of the child&#8217;s foster or adoption needs and can give input and guidance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8220;VDSS also serves as liaison for Virginia’s seven federally recognized tribes for any issues or concerns regarding a child welfare case involving their tribal citizens,&#8221; agency spokesman Will Hockaday said via email. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It appears that the ICWA is functioning as intended in Virginia, thankfully. Just one Native American child was placed for adoption or foster care outside their tribal community in 2022, according to Hockaday, and the process was approved by a tribe in the area. Gray also says the Pamunkey have only been involved with one ICWA case recently, and it was resolved satisfactorily. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The larger struggle for the full benefits of tribal sovereignty, however, continues.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;re constantly under attack; there are constant little things that are always threatening bits and pieces of our sovereignty,&#8221; said Gray. &#8220;We are always on the lookout, and we will always remain vigilant.&#8221; </span></p>

(Parker Michels-Boyce for the Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin Thursday praised the U.S. Supreme Court’s landmark decision striking down affirmative action at higher education institutions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Today, after the Supreme Court’s ruling, we are closer than ever before to ensuring that an individual’s future opportunities are unlocked based on the trajectory of their potential, their aspirations and the quality of their capabilities as opposed to simply on their race,” Youngkin said on Twitter shortly after the country’s highest court struck down race-conscious admissions in a case involving Harvard University and the University of North Carolina.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, who in 2021 became the first Black woman to hold statewide office in Virginia, also applauded the outcome, saying it will “ensure college admissions are based on a student&#8217;s merits, not the color of their skin.” Earle-Sears noted she had joined a legal brief supporting the plaintiffs who challenged affirmative action policies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attorney General Jason Miyares, who did not comment on the ruling, also signed onto </span><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/20/20-1199/222849/20220509155246082_OkSFA%20Merits%20Amicus%20MAIN%20May%209%202022%20E%20File.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a brief supporting the plaintiffs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Democrats had sharply different reactions to the </span><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/20-1199_hgdj.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">6-3 decision</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ruling that consideration of race violates the equal protection clause of the U.S. Constitution. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement, U.S. Rep. Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond, said the decision “undermines an important effort to address racial inequality caused by our nation’s history with racism,” adding, “The impact of 246 years of slavery and 100 years of Jim Crow on our communities and institutions did not go away with a magic wand.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., who began his career as a lawyer fighting housing discrimination in Richmond, said the “strength of Virginia’s—and America’s—higher education system lies in its diversity.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Today’s sad ruling means we have even more work to do to address our nation’s ugly history of racism and root out the system inequities that unfairly burden diverse communities, like Black and Latino Americans,” Kaine said. “Not only are those system inequities plain wrong; they hurt all of us and hold our economy back.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What the court ruled</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The majority opinion penned by Chief Justice John Roberts found Harvard and UNC “fail to operate their race-based admissions programs in a manner that is ‘sufficiently measurable to permit judicial [review],’” haven’t sufficiently proved a connection between those programs and goals like increasing diversity and training future leaders and haven’t identified an endpoint by which the programs would no longer be considered necessary.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, the court ruled that the universities’ programs “fail to comply with Equal Protection Clause’s twin commands that race may never be used as a ‘negative’ and that it may not operate as a stereotype,” pointing to a lower court finding that Harvard’s process resulted in fewer admissions of Asian American students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The “assertion that race is never a negative factor in their admissions programs cannot withstand scrutiny,” the majority wrote. “College admissions are zero-sum, and a benefit provided to some applicants but not to others necessarily advantages the former at the expense of the latter.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor argued that the ruling will result in “further entrenching racial inequality in education” and will end progress toward more inclusive schools begun in Brown v. Board of Education. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For 45 years, the Court extended Brown’s transformative legacy to the context of higher education, allowing colleges and universities to consider race in a limited way and for the limited purpose of promoting the important benefits of racial diversity,” she wrote. “This limited use of race has helped equalize educational opportunities for all students of every race and background and has improved racial diversity on college campuses.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thursday’s ruling, she concluded, “cements a superficial rule of colorblindness as a constitutional principle in an endemically segregated society where race has always mattered and continues to matter.” </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Impact on Virginia schools</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia universities reacted cautiously Thursday to the ruling. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Erin Jay, a spokesperson for William &amp; Mary, said “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the university will take time thoughtfully to review (the ruling) and understand if there are implications to William &amp; Mary’s comprehensive review process for admissions.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The university reported that 32% of its students “identify as people of color” and </span><a href="https://www.wm.edu/offices/compliance/discrimination_overview/affirmative_action/index.php" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">on its website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has said it is “committed to affirmative action, equal opportunity/equity, and diversity.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement, Virginia Commonwealth University President Michael Rao said the school “has been preparing for some time by evaluating admissions procedures and considering the impact of this ruling.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While he acknowledged that “we won’t know all of those answers right away,” he said that “many of VCU’s admissions procedures are unlikely to be affected.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rao noted that a third of VCU’s incoming freshman class are first-generation students, while a third of undergraduate students are eligible for Pell grants.</span></p>
<p>George Mason University said flatly the decision will have no impact on the school, because it doesn&#8217;t consider race in its admissions process and admits more than 90% of undergraduate applicants. In August, GMU said, the school will &#8220;once again welcome the largest and most diverse student body in the history of the Commonwealth of Virginia.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This diversity of origin, identity, circumstance, and thought is what drives our quality and defines our character,&#8221; <a href="https://www.gmu.edu/news/2023-06/george-mason-university-statement-supreme-court-rulings-regarding-college-admissions" target="_blank">GMU said</a>. &#8220;When walking across one of our campuses, the rich diversity everyone sees is not artificially curated by an admissions process primarily defined by keeping students out.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Tech said its administration is reviewing the ruling but will continue to live up to its motto “Ut Prosim (That I May Serve)” and its goal of providing a “practical education to all members of the commonwealth, nation, and beyond.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“To accomplish this mission, we will continue to work hard to expand access to underserved and underrepresented populations,” Virginia Tech said in a statement from its communications office.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. Eric Claville, a political and legal analyst and professor of politics and law at Norfolk State University, characterized the Supreme Court&#8217;s Thursday ruling as both expected and regressive. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Higher education leaders have known for a long time that this challenge [to affirmative action] would come,” he said. “We need these policies to advance diversity and equity on campuses, and the law is the incentive to make and enforce those changes. Without that, we will not have the same protections for promoting diverse, inclusive, equitable student bodies in Virginia and elsewhere.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Claville said the high court&#8217;s decision “will have far-reaching implications beyond limiting race-based admissions in colleges.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I believe that here in Virginia, we will see ripple effects – perhaps in the way we hire for jobs, in the ways we support our communities, in the work across many sectors – that could basically roll back advancement opportunities for non-white people,&#8221; he said.</span></p>

(Samantha Willis/The Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This morning, a Richmond mother woke up to the yawning absence of her teenage son and husband, men whose lives were snuffed out by bullets in a</span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/richmond-high-school-graduation-shooting-6acc439941097597a2c9cc5220f9262c?clickedOnVideo" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> mass shooting right after Huguenot High School’s graduation ceremony</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in downtown Richmond Tuesday afternoon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That son and brand-new graduate, Shawn Jackson, was just 18 years old when his life was snatched away from him. Shawn’s father, 36-year-old Renzo Smith, was also killed in the shootout.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Five other people were shot and several others were injured in the mayhem. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A 19-year-old suspected gunman</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was arraigned this morning on two counts of second-degree murder.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/AP/status/1666520875993014288?s=20" target="_blank">https://twitter.com/AP/status/1666520875993014288?s=20</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I watched the police briefings on this tragedy last night and again this morning, a bitter anger burned in the pit of my belly. Here we are, not halfway through the year, and in the U.S. we have experienced our</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 279th mass shooting </span><a href="https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">so far </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">in 2023. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why is this acceptable to us? How many more youth have to die before we wake up and make some serious changes in our cities, states and nation? Why do we, the American people, keep accepting politicians who dispense thoughts and prayers like Pez candy after each bout of mass death born of bullets, but then go right back to their offices and their legislative agendas and do nothing to curb the violence? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was especially incensed to see Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears opening her uninformed mouth to speak at one of the briefings yesterday evening. She talked</span><a href="https://twitter.com/WinsomeSears/status/1666272388470788097" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> passionately</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of needing “true leadership” and “accountability” to prevent these shootings, not-so-subtly pointing fingers at Richmond’s elected leaders in the wake of the tragedy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Who is in charge? Is that the mayor? Is that the chief? Who is that? I mean, let’s start naming names, because otherwise, if no one is accountable and if all we do is come in front of a camera or several cameras and keep talking about, &#8216;Well this shouldn&#8217;t happen and that shouldn&#8217;t happen,&#8217; well, you&#8217;re the one in charge. You&#8217;re the one responsible,&#8221; Earle-Sears said. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then she had the temerity to say that yesterday’s shooting was “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">not about law-abiding gun owners. This is about gangs. This is about even if you took all the guns off the street from the law-abiding citizens, the others who mean harm, who mean to kill and maim, they&#8217;re going to have the guns.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the same woman who consistently supports the National Rifle Association, whose </span><a href="https://www.ojp.gov/ncjrs/virtual-library/abstracts/effect-nra-national-rifle-association-citizens-special-interest" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">powerful lobbying effort</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">s have practically paralyzed meaningful gun control efforts in American politics for generations. Shortly after the Uvalde carnage, Sears spoke at a women’s luncheon at NRA’s national conference in Houston and blamed our gun violence epidemic on everything from “emasculated” men to the absence of prayer in schools — everything, that is, except guns, and the ease of access with which Americans can get their hands on them for hunting or homicide, whichever strikes their fancy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here in Virginia, the NRA has</span><a href="https://www.vpap.org/donors/137269-national-rifle-association/?start_year=all&amp;end_year=all" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> donated</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> $1,276,970</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over the past 25 years to mostly Republican candidates and groups. But more so than the money, former Mercury reporter Mechelle Hankerson <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/07/12/its-not-the-nras-money-that-sways-virginia-politics-its-the-members/" target="_blank">wrote</a> in 2019, &#8220;analysts and people who work in Virginia politics say the power of the NRA comes from the sheer number of voters who align themselves with the organization and show up at the polls and in front of lawmakers, especially in solid red districts where politicians’ biggest fear is a primary challenge from the right.&#8221; Nationally, as Mercury columnist Roger Chesley so aptly <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/amid-texas-tragedy-an-unsurprising-red-herring-laden-speech-from-va-official/" target="_blank">pointed out</a>, NRA “members and other pro-gun advocates hold vast influence with the GOP in Congress, thus ensuring gun-control bills rarely become law.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is especially sickening to me to see another Black woman trot out right-wing tropes like </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/8News/videos/818151346391550" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“gangs” </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">as one of the root causes of yesterday’s senseless shootings. At the time Sears made her statement, she could not have known with any certainty whether gang violence was involved or not, as it was an actively evolving investigation. Richmond police said Wednesday morning that there is no evidence that the shooting death of Shawn Jackson was precipitated by gang violence; rather, police said, an ongoing social media beef likely played a part. Saying “gangs” caused this deadly shooting of a young Black man by another young Black man, without proof, is one small step from blaming “thugs” for “Black on Black crime,” all </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2015/04/30/403362626/the-racially-charged-meaning-behind-the-word-thug" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">stereotypes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that racists, right wingers and Sears’ </span><a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/politics/virginia-lt-gov-earle-sears-time-to-move-on-from-trump/3205900/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">former pal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> former President Donald Trump espouse regularly. How can any Black person with even a shred of self-respect play into these blatantly racist falsehoods? Even if it turns out Jackson&#8217;s death was connected to gang violence, that is something a proper investigation will reveal and not something that an elected official should be spouting without proof so soon after the young man&#8217;s untimely death.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When he walked across the stage to receive his diploma, Shawn Jackson reached a milestone that I hope to see my three young sons accomplish one day. My boys are still here, but Shawn is gone, his whole life ahead of him; it’s not fair and it’s not right. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richmond Public Schools Superintendent Jason Kamras said he was shaken to see Jackson receive CPR while still in his graduation gown; without even seeing it myself, that image anguishes me. But in the midst of the heartache that we feel in the face of this and other tragedies, we cannot lose sight of the real root issue that paves the way for mass shootings to continue: the lack of meaningful gun control measures and the refusal of the highest lawmakers in the land to acknowledge and remedy that problem. Until that happens, we might as well keep our well-meaning but utterly useless thoughts and prayers handy for the next, inevitable gun violence tragedy. </span></p>

(Samantha Willis/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most days, James Douglas would be on the water by 5:30 in the morning, on the hunt for oysters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He’d push off in his small boat from his family’s wharf on the Yeocomico River in Westmoreland County, the birthplace of the nation’s first president, George Washington, and, since 1824, of Douglas’ family, the Wilsons.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Douglas’ family has owned their waterfront property in Virginia’s Northern Neck since 1877. This is an astounding feat, considering few Black people were able to purchase land back then, and those that did were sometimes bullied by whites to give up their property or sell it for a pittance.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Mitchell Wilson number one, he got a white fellow to buy it for him, and he split it up between all of his children and descendants,” said Douglas, sweeping his hand toward a ring of homes perched near the riverbank. “Those descendants, my family, are still here now.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Douglas is one of Virginia’s last living Black watermen, a culture and profession that was the backbone of the Chesapeake Bay’s seafood industry as early as colonial times. These African American men, some enslaved, some free, fished for menhaden, dug for clams, harvested oysters and caught crabs that they sold to white-owned processing facilities, which sold and shipped the brackish water delicacies to restaurants and homes in Maryland, Washington, D.C., Philadelphia, New York and beyond. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But this tradition has over the past few decades been disappearing. The Black watermen culture is fading, Douglas said, largely due to the seafood industry itself shrinking and watermen leaving their small-town birthplaces seeking better economic opportunities in cities like Washington, D.C., Philadelphia and Richmond. In early May, Preservation Virginia named “African American Watermen Sites of the Chesapeake Bay” one of the state’s </span><a href="https://preservationvirginia.org/our-work/most-endangered-historic-places/?mc_cid=f8ac8f9308&amp;mc_eid=69330060b7" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">most endangered historic spaces</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The renowned seafood industry of the Chesapeake Bay would not have been possible without the contributions of generations of African Americans,” the Virginia Department of Historic Resources </span><a href="https://www.dhr.virginia.gov/news/african-american-watermen-project/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wrote in its announcement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the agency’s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">African American Watermen Project in 2021. That effort to survey, study and preserve sites of significance to Black watermen culture spans three states – Virginia, Maryland and Pennsylvania – under the purview of the National Trust for Historic Preservation, National Park Service Chesapeake Bay and Chesapeake Conservation Partnership. Norfolk-based Commonwealth Preservation Group is leading the Virginia arm of the project and has identified about 80 sites where Black watermen lived, worked and contributed to the cultural fabric of the commonwealth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Women were predominantly in the crab picking and oyster shucking houses, while men were on the water,” said Kayla Halberg, manager of the project, who co-authored its </span><a href="https://www.dhr.virginia.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/500-0007_African_American_Watermen_MPD_2023_NRHP_Final.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Multiple Property Documentation form</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that her group submitted to the National Park Service for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places.</span></p>

(courtesy Commonwealth Preservation Group)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These are real people and real communities; we [were able] to go out to their homes and see where they live and talk to them,” Halberg said. “What we want to preserve about these communities is their culture — the songs, the tools, the expertise, the lifestyle of the watermen communities. It was a thriving, rich culture that is unfortunately fading away; that’s why it’s essential to preserve what remains.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Douglas’ wife Daisy, a gifted storyteller and retired educator who used to drive an hour and a half each way each day to teach in Richmond City Public Schools, recalled the dangers and the joys of her husband’s long career.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“James and those watermen before him, they were extremely strong, with powerful legs that they stood up on all day in the boats while they were hunting oysters. A lot of them ended up on disability because their arms gave out, after they spent years lifting those heavy tongs in and out of the water all day, catching up oysters. Some of them drowned; sometimes they would get lost in a storm. You remember the snowstorm, Jim?” she asked her husband, before describing the time he had come home with a “completely frozen” beard and eyelashes after braving a surprise bout of wintry weather. He didn’t leave the water when other oystermen did, he recalled with a sheepish grin, because he had a strong feeling that he was about to find a big oyster bed; he was right.</span></p>

(Samantha Willis/The Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was not an easy profession at all, but they took great pride in it, great pride, because they had a certain level of independence working on the water,” Daisy continued.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_35326" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/DSCF5195-scaled.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-35326" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/DSCF5195-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1707" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/DSCF5195-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/DSCF5195-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/DSCF5195-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/DSCF5195-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/DSCF5195-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/DSCF5195-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Daisy Douglas holds a photo of oystermen, including Captain Billy Smith and Douglas&#8217; husband James Douglas, tonging in the Nomini River. (Samantha Willis/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is heartening to see the significance of African American water workers recognized. Not only did these people embody Black self-determination, collaboration and entrepreneurship, even when some of them were in bondage, but the Chesapeake Bay’s maritime and seafood industries could not have developed or been sustained without these skilled tradesmen and women. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are the stories that Virginia schoolchildren and citizens should learn. Some might label them “divisive concepts,” but actually, they are factual accounts of local African Americans who worked tirelessly to overcome systemic, structural racism that plagued every facet of their lives for the better part of the state’s existence. The Black history of these communities is Virginia history and American history that might be lost to time if not for efforts like Halberg’s project and the Douglases&#8217; determination to keep their stories alive. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was good while it lasted, but it’s just about over with now,” James Douglas said, looking out over the river to Northumberland County on the other shore. He has lived the entirety of his 85 years here; the water is in his blood, he said. “It’s up to us now to tell people about it, to teach it to young people, to keep it going.”</span></p>

(Samantha Willis/The Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having devoted the latter part of his life to preserving Pocahontas Island in Petersburg, </span><a href="https://www.jmwilkersonsince1874.com/obituary/richard-stewart" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richard A. Stewart</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the island’s honorary mayor, is gone, dead at age 79. In the wake of the stalwart community historian’s death, though, the island lives on, primed for its second wind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As it did during his lifetime, Stewart’s presence looms large on Pocahontas Island, a community of some 70 acres bordered on three sides by the Appomattox River, just over the bridge from mainland Petersburg. The</span><a href="https://www.nps.gov/articles/pocaisla.htm" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> island’s roots</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reach back to 1732, when enslaved people were first brought there to work in tobacco warehouses; by 1800, over 300 free Black people lived and worked there, making it one of the largest communities of its kind in America. Stewart owned and operated the island’s Black history museum, founded in 2006. The two-story yellow clapboard house trimmed in brown today is stuffed to the gills with artifacts he collected during his lifetime, including old-fashioned agricultural tools, 19th-century horseshoes, photographs and art, a Ku Klux Klan robe and a set of shackles likely used in the restraint of enslaved people. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stewart’s funeral was observed at Petersburg’s Tabernacle Baptist Church on April 22. The day before, a balmy Friday afternoon, a “Sorry, we’re closed” sign hung above the green chalkboard where Stewart had previously scrawled the museum’s tour hours. It felt like he had just stepped away and would be back any minute, eager to educate anyone who’d listen about Pocahontas Island’s history. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That history is evident in more than just the museum. The island is home to the </span><a href="https://preservationvirginia.org/saving-petersburgs-jarratt-house/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jarratt House</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, built in 1820 and at one time a stop on the Underground Railroad; Stewart and other island residents led the push for the house to be preserved, rightly recognizing it as a portal to freedom for Blacks fleeing bondage in the Petersburg area before the Civil War.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stewart also </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nucCygfhj_c" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">consistently spoke</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the area’s days as a manufacturing and railroad hub, and as a haven for free Black tradespeople, artisans and farmers in antebellum Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stewart’s neighbor Dorothy Kelley, who has lived on the island for over 50 years with her husband and his family — who were born and raised there — said the museum was one of several buildings Stewart owned on the island. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And he made sure that grass stayed cut, too,” she said. “I don’t know what’s going to happen with the museum now.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What happens next?” is a fair question to ask, both about the museum and about the island itself. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the years, the number of residents living on Pocahontas Island has steadily shrunk down to about 100 people, Kelley said. Several of the homes there are dilapidated and in need of repair; some stand vacant. There are no employment prospects on the island, and nearby Petersburg faces a </span><a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LAUCN517300000000003A" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">10.5% annual unemployment rate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A lot of the younger people are gone; we don’t have as many children around,” said Kelley, 76, but spry and chatty as she led me around the island on an impromptu tour.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She showed me the community’s tiny chapel, which had to be rebuilt after a </span><a href="https://www.weather.gov/akq/severe_Aug061993" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tornado tore through the island</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in August 1993, damaging or destroying 80% of the homes there. She introduced me to Mrs. Mary Bragg Cox, 98, the daughter of a man who, before Stewart took up Pocahontas Island’s banner, advocated for the paving of the neighborhood’s streets and the laying of its sidewalks. Cox later donated land to create a park in her father’s honor, up the street from her home. She nodded in agreement as Kelley told me what she sees as the solution to sustaining the island for the next generation: “What we need is for families, for people to come back here, help us build this place up again.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enter Marlo Green.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, Green broke ground on the first in a series of homes she’s developing on the island, slated to be priced right for area families looking to settle down. A certified public accountant and first-time developer who works at Virginia State University, Green has lived in Petersburg since 2016 and believes the homes will simultaneously bring more people to Pocahontas and help local Black families build wealth through homeownership.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her vision is to “help close the wealth gap locally and bring more resources to the island,” she said as she showed me the first home of the project, which she will live in when it is completed in another few months; as we spoke, workers were nailing on its siding. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Green began the effort by purchasing an acre plot from the city and plans to buy more soon. Before she started, she introduced herself to her future neighbors on the island, including Kelley, who said she feels “completely positive” about the undertaking. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another neighbor took a little more convincing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the first people I met was Mr. Stewart. He was kind of skeptical because he had seen a lot of people come to the island with a lot of hopes and dreams, but nothing had been done,” Green said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One such dream was the much-hyped </span><a href="https://wilder.vcu.edu/media/wilder/murp-studio-plans/ursp762/pdfs/s14/S14_JGriffiths_Pocahontas_Island.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pocahontas Island Neighborhood Pla</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">n, a complex set of social, economic and aesthetic goals for the island with suggested strategies on how to meet them prepared by the Wilder School of Government at Virginia Commonwealth University in 2014. Residents participated in the creation of that and other plans but have yet to see much of it brought to reality, Green explained. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite his initial caution, Green said, Stewart came to support her vision for revitalizing the island and was working to help her realize it before his death.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Green’s project unfolds, other recent developments are reasons to hope Pocahontas Island and the surrounding area will soon see better days. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year Gov. Glenn Youngkin announced the “Partnership for Petersburg,” </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/08/26/innovative-partnership-for-petersburg-shouldnt-be-judged-by-politics/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a set of 42 initiatives</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> designed to boost the economic and social outlook of the city that is no stranger to struggle. Though some correctly pointed out that most of these initiatives were already underway thanks to General Assembly action or federal funds, a bipartisan group of state and local leaders welcomed the fresh attention Youngkin’s plan placed on Petersburg. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Business </span><a href="https://www.virginiabusiness.com/article/economic-healing/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last year that work had begun to make Petersburg</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “a pharmaceutical manufacturing hub and ingredient reserve, bringing economic investment, jobs and ancillary investment to the long-distressed area.” A </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/04/17/petersburg-maternal-hub-opening-reignites-discussion-over-commercial-doula-benefits/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">maternal and infant health center</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> opened in Petersburg a few weeks ago, offering support to expecting and new parents as well as early childhood education opportunities. Multiple efforts are underway to </span><a href="https://www.wric.com/news/local-news/the-tri-cities/a-petersburg-man-is-bringing-together-his-community-through-teaching-kids-a-unique-skill/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fight food insecurity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the area and </span><a href="https://www.vpm.org/news/2022-11-23/new-youth-urban-farm-helps-heal-petersburg-community" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">teach kids how to grow</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> their food. Green is also creating a nonprofit to support the future renovation of homes in need on the island.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It will mean so much to have our elders age in place more comfortably,” said Green, who grew up in public housing in Henrico County. “I saw firsthand how neighborhoods like Church Hill and Jackson Ward [in Richmond] will gentrify and push out the residents that have been there all along. That’s the polar opposite of what we’re trying to do here.”</span></p>

Otieno, 28, died of asphyxiation after a group of deputies and Central State Hospital workers piled atop his shackled body following a mental health crisis Mar. 6. (Samantha Willis/The Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Within the cavernous sanctuary of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">First Baptist Church of South Richmond on Wednesday, hundreds of mourners viewed a vignette of Irvo Otieno&#8217;s brief life. Photos and videos showed him sporting a wide grin alongside classmates and football buddies. His rich baritone voice rapped lyrics to a song he&#8217;d written about his love for his family. Altogether, these elements gave a glimpse of who he was, and who he could have been, had his life not been smothered out of him on the floor of a mental hospital a few weeks ago.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yuxu-1iYzSI" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The funeral</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> started almost an hour late; the delay gave me time to ponder how many premature deaths like Otieno&#8217;s — the tragic deaths of Black people who perished at the hands of people entrusted to uphold public safety — I&#8217;ve covered in the last decade. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the choir sang, &#8220;God is my rock, hope of salvation, a strong deliverer; in Him will I always trust,&#8221; and the crowd erupted in shouts of praise, I saw again the faces of those </span><a href="https://interactive.aljazeera.com/aje/2020/know-their-names/index.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lost ones</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in my mind&#8217;s eye. Michael Brown of Missouri, Tamir Rice of Ohio, Breonna Taylor of Kentucky, Philando Castile of Minnesota, Eric Garner of New York, George Floyd of Minnesota, Marcus-David Peters of Virginia. I saw Otieno&#8217;s mother Caroline Ouko and scores of relatives staring at his casket covered in white flowers, pain painted on their faces, and I asked myself why.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why was Otieno asphyxiated to death, shackled and sprawled on that hospital floor, 10 people having piled atop him? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why did Virginia&#8217;s Marcus Alert system not prevent this tragedy that stemmed from Otieno&#8217;s mental distress? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why was Otieno treated as a criminal and not someone in desperate need of medical help? And, even if Otieno had been a criminal, as </span><a href="https://twitter.com/MercuryVirginia/status/1638982623778291712" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">some fools on Twitter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are quick to allege, why would that justify his indecent, barbaric death? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Will one of my brown-skinned sons meet the same fate as Otieno one day? Will my husband, father, uncles or loved ones? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How many more of these tragedies will happen, how many more Black people must needlessly die, before a change comes? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Civil rights leader Rev. Al Sharpton posed some of these same questions during his delivery of Otieno&#8217;s eulogy and asked one directly of Gov. Glenn Youngkin too: &#8220;Mr. Governor, on your way to wherever you&#8217;re going, what about Irvo?&#8221;</span></p>

Al Sharpton delivered the eulogy at Irvo Otieno&#8217;s funeral at First Baptist Church of South Richmond on Mar. 29. (Samantha Willis/The Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The governor, who did not attend Otieno’s funeral but sent two members of his administration instead, proposed a </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/12/14/youngkin-proposes-230-million-behavioral-health-overhaul/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$230 million mental health overhaul plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this budget cycle. While sweeping, it includes no specific provisions to address the types of mental health crisis situations that seem to leave a lot of Black folks dead. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So here’s another question: If legislators fund the &#8220;Right Help, Right Now&#8221; plan, will it be enough?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sharpton called for an &#8220;Irvo Law&#8221; at the funeral that sounded great but brought up a bit of bitterness in me. We already have a </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/02/09/in-virginia-people-suffering-mental-health-crises-too-often-become-felons-when-police-intervene/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">law that is supposed to help people like Irvo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but it didn’t save his life. We need a real solution, and</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it must start with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">police, medical professionals, lawmakers and everyday citizens seeing, affirming and valuing the humanity of Black people every day, in every way. </span></p>

(Courtesy of Ben Crump Law)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Irvo Otieno departed this life on </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/21/us/irvo-otieno-virginia-police-video.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">March 6</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, sprawled on the floor of Central State Hospital, his hands and feet shackled. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Otieno died from asphyxiation after Henrico sheriff&#8217;s deputies and Central State Hospital employees took turns kneeling on him for almost 11 minutes. Earlier this week, a Dinwiddie County grand jury indicted seven deputies and three hospital staff on second-degree murder charges in relation to the incident.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Somehow, the presence of the hospital workers and the fact that the tragedy took place in a mental health facility didn’t prevent Otieno from being treated like a violent criminal instead of who he was: a sick person who needed help. In a way, that isn’t surprising. Otieno’s death represents Virginia’s historic legacy of mistreating and criminalizing Black people with mental illness</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Central State Hospital was first known as Howard’s Grove Hospital, a former Confederate facility that was designated for “colored” patients in 1869. In 1870, the hospital transformed into the segregated </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Central Lunatic Asylum for the Colored Insane, making it the nation’s first mental hospital for Black people. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During and after the Civil War, a leading discourse among medical professionals held that Black people freed from slavery were bound to become “insane” if they were no longer engaged in forced manual labor. These founding fathers of American medicine ascribed an enslaved person’s natural, human desire to be free to an unsound mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Antebellum southern physician and open racist Dr. Samuel Cartwright famously concocted the term </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">drapetomania</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a fictitious mental disorder he claimed caused enslaved people to run away. Cartwright said in an 1851 report that drapetomania and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">dysaesthesia ethiopica</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – another nonsense condition he said made Black skin less sensitive to pain – </span><b> </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">“is the natural offspring of negro liberty – the liberty to be idle, to wallow in filth, and to indulge in improper food and drinks.” He recommended hard work and institutionalization as the remedy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Horrifyingly, Cartwright’s sensibilities formed the basis of his time’s accepted medical ideology and practice. Sadly, those views still persist in some forms today. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020, a </span><a href="https://batten.virginia.edu/about/news/black-americans-are-systematically-under-treated-pain-why" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">University of Virginia study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found that medical students and residents “who endorsed biological differences between Black and white people also believed that [a] fictional Black patient felt less pain.” A 2016 </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4843483/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Library of Medicine report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> included evidence that “false beliefs about biological differences between blacks and whites continue to shape the way we perceive and treat black people — they are associated with racial disparities in pain assessment and treatment recommendations.” The </span><a href="https://www.minorityhealth.hhs.gov/omh/browse.aspx?lvl=4&amp;lvlid=24" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Health and Human Services Office of Minority Health has found</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Black adults are more likely than white adults to report persistent symptoms of emotional distress like feeling sadness, hopelessness and worthlessness, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">but have less access to mental health care and medications. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The roots of this medical racism and bias stem from Cartwright’s era, but bear fruit as modern tragedies like Otieno’s senseless death.

Initially, he had been taken to a hospital, but instead of staying there, where presumably he’d have been able to get the medical help he needed, he was thrown in jail and subsequently bum-rushed by officers, apparently beaten and carried limp to a transport van.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why was Otieno treated more like a criminal than an ill person who needed aid? The past provides a clue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“From the beginning, insanity – a medical condition – has been criminalized in Black people,” said </span><a href="https://news.vcu.edu/article/2022/09/documentary-the-history-of-the-first-psychiatric-facility-for-african-americans" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. Shawn Utsey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a clinical psychologist and Virginia Commonwealth University professor whose 2022 film </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzpr2Yvy2yw" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Central Lunatic Asylum for the Colored Insane”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> uncovers the harsh reality of life for Black patients at the facility that’s now Central State Hospital. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It wasn&#8217;t seen as a health condition, it was seen as a criminal disposition of Black people. So that&#8217;s where it starts.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Utsey’s research and interviews for the film revealed accounts of patient abuse and neglect by hospital workers, Utsey doesn’t wholly fault the staffers, who, like those at many mental institutions nationwide, were doing what they could with limited personnel and resources in an atmosphere tainted by pervasive racism.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don&#8217;t blame the workers for a culture that prescribes that Black people are basically criminals, and insanity is basically a symptom of criminality, not mental illness,” he said. “‘Mental illness in Black folks is a reflection of their criminality,’ that was the thought process.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">March 6 video shows deputies pinning Otieno to the floor of Central State’s admission area for 11 minutes as hospital staffers watched. What’s so striking and so damning from that footage is how Otieno was criminalized. He couldn’t even get help in a facility designed to treat people like him – a son, a brother, a person living with mental illness. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our system failed Irvo Otieno because it is built on a legacy of bias. Until we root out that root cause, it will most certainly fail many others. </span></p>

("History of the American Negro and His Institutions"/Arthur Bunyan Caldwell)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It took years of community outcry, the urging of a governor, being sued by the NAACP and national media scrutiny for the Hanover County School Board to finally be shamed into voting to </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/07/08/as-other-virginia-school-systems-act-one-is-still-clinging-to-its-racist-confederate-names/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">remove the names of Confederate treasonists</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from two schools’ monikers in 2020. Now, this same board is proposing that the one school in the district with a name representative of Black history and Black excellence be renamed, in a move that smells like spite and looks like regression.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last Tuesday, a packed School Board meeting saw over a dozen members of the public speak up about </span><a href="https://ashlandmuseum.org/tour/john-m-gandy-school/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">John M. Gandy Elementary School</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an institution that was once one of the only schools for Black students in Hanover County. A new school building under construction on the current Gandy site that will replace Gandy and consolidate it with Henry Clay Elementary was slated to retain the school name at the project’s inception in 2018.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_34702" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:300px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/homeslide_101419_01.jpeg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-34702" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/homeslide_101419_01-300x88.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="88" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/homeslide_101419_01-300x88.jpeg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/homeslide_101419_01-1024x301.jpeg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/homeslide_101419_01-768x226.jpeg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/homeslide_101419_01.jpeg 1427w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  John M. Gandy Elementary School (Hanover County Public Schools)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Back then, board members assured community members that they had no intention of removing Gandy’s name from the replacement school. What has changed since then?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, the board became embroiled in a firestorm over its refusal to change the Confederate school names starting in 2019. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then, that same year, the Ku Klux Klan – a group of domestic terrorists known for lynching Black people throughout the South –  hosted a recruitment rally on the county’s courthouse grounds. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020, current Board Chair John Axselle </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/maggie-walker-schools-new-5-year-plan-addresses-diversity-but-with-no-metrics-critics-question/article_aec411a7-c3f7-54cf-ba22-0882f39a431a.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said the quiet part out loud</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at a meeting of regional school leaders about the lack of racial diversity at Maggie L. Walker Governor’s School, asserting that such schools for gifted students “don’t appeal to everyone, nor do I think we should. …I think it might change our vision, mission or our uniqueness if we try to look like a general public school. We’re not. This is a gifted school.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His comments came off as elitist, exclusionary and tone deaf. And considering that in Hanover schools Black students are </span><a href="https://www.wric.com/news/local-news/hanover-county/after-years-community-equity-board-member-says-no-movement-on-top-proposals-to-hanover-school-board/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">overrepresented in disciplinary actions but underrepresented in advanced and gifted courses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Axselle was in no position to give advice on the subject, anyway. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another change was the addition of </span><a href="https://www.wtvr.com/news/local-news/some-hanover-county-parents-concerned-over-school-board-july-26-2022" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">John Redd to the school board</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This controversial, self-declared Christian conservative figure publicly railed against the changing of the Confederate school names in 2020, before his appointment by the majority-white, majority-male Board of Supervisors in 2022 to replace a School Board member who had voted to change the Confederate school names.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The biggest change since the board’s 2018 promise to leave the Gandy name intact is that Hanover County’s legacy of systemic racism, pervasive in many of its sectors, including education, has been laid bare for all the world to see. It cannot, it will not, be hidden any longer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">John M. Gandy was born to parents who had recently been delivered from slavery. He went on to become a world-class educator and the third president of what is now Virginia State University. Since then, Gandy has been a symbol of Black self-determination and elevation through education.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At last Tuesday’s School Board meeting, several Gandy Elementary alumni spoke about the lasting impact their experience there had on their lives and its cultural significance to the community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What makes John M. Gandy so special is that it still sits in the middle of a Black community,” said Gandy graduate Shirley Quash. “The African Americans here fought against discrimination in all sectors of life – and it is not over. To strip this school of John M. Gandy&#8217;s historical brand will bring a slap to the face of all the African Americans who carry it close to their hearts every day.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;m speaking to you because I want you to remember us Black students who attended this school,” said John Williams, a 1961 Gandy graduate. “Kids had to get up at daybreak to attend this school, and get home at night; do you understand what I&#8217;m saying? Had to pass all these Caucasian schools and couldn&#8217;t attend them; do you understand? Believe it or not, John M. Gandy will always stand regardless of what you do, because it&#8217;s a God up above who rules everything. Watch yourself.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My father and his three sisters all attended Gandy. My great-uncle Rev. Dr. Robert Bowles was a teacher there, as strict as he was caring, I’m told. Almost every elder in Hanover’s Black community has been influenced in some way by the school, which bears “a healthy name, a name to be proud of,” as another alumna said at Tuesday’s meeting. </span></p>

(Samantha Willis/The Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The school is located within the </span><a href="https://www.dhr.virginia.gov/historic-registers/166-5073/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Berkleytown Historic District</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a Black community established after Ashland mandated segregation in 1911. Despite the atmosphere of virulent racism and discrimination surrounding it, Berkleytown “functioned as a largely self-sufficient community, as it included not only single-family houses but also restaurants and shops, a school, funeral homes and other resources</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> according to the Virginia Department of Historic Resources.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A key part of Berkleytown, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gandy is one of the very few public examples of Black history, culture and contributions that the majority-white Hanover powers-that-be have authorized, until now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The board cites its </span><a href="https://go.boarddocs.com/vsba/hcpsva/Board.nsf/goto?open&amp;id=CFTKFE515CE9" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Policy 4-3.8</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as its excuse for reneging on the promise to retain Gandy’s name for the replacement school. The policy, adopted in 2000 and revised just a month after Redd took his board seat in 2022, states: “No school, school building, school room, track, gymnasium, stadium, media center or library, field, nor any other portion of the campus or facility on the campus will be named for a person (living or deceased).” The board has also appointed a 2023 Elementary School Naming Committee, charged with making a single recommendation of a name for the replacement school to the board. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chairman Axselle declined to speak with me about the renaming but sent a statement that reads in part: “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of us on the School Board believe that with the construction of this new school – combining two schools into one – our longstanding policy, which we are obligated to uphold, requires us to name this new school building. … Additionally, this policy, which was originally adopted in August 2000, does not distinguish between newly built or existing schools, so the School Board may decide to change the name of a school at any time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where was the board’s obligation to this so-called “longstanding policy” in 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021 and half of 2022? During that time period, in meetings, </span><a href="https://go.boarddocs.com/vsba/hcpsva/Board.nsf/goto?open&amp;id=BNEUAJ77EADF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">public information sessions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://go.boarddocs.com/vsba/hcpsva/Board.nsf/files/B6XHWS4A85B0/$file/HCES-JGES%20Community%20Information%20Session_11-27-18_full.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">presentations,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and on the Hanover County Public Schools’ </span><a href="https://www.hcps.us/community/consolidated_elementary_school" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the forthcoming school was referred to as a “replacement school” and/or a “consolidated school,” not a new school. Nor did the board during that time recommend Gandy’s name be stripped from the newly built replacement/consolidated school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last July, Ashland Town Manager Josh Farrar stated in the </span><a href="https://www.ashlandva.gov/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=561" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">town newsletter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, “We are a tight-knit community and keeping this historic school in the town is important to build trust and strengthen relationships. We appreciate that Hanover County and Hanover County Public Schools heard and honored that request by selecting a location and design that reflects the future John M. Gandy Elementary School that our families and kids deserve.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the same publication, Faye Pritchard, who represents Ashland on Hanover’s Board of Supervisors, stated of the new facility: &#8220;It&#8217;s important that the school is reflective of the community, not only architecturally but also of the goals the community has for itself. It should honor the Town of Ashland&#8217;s history and speak to our aspirations for its future.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It appears the School Board is acting against the desires of not only the Ashland community, but also some of its own county leaders. At a time when the </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/03/16/in-virginia-school-boards-will-be-the-primary-deciders-on-ap-african-american-studies/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">teaching of African American history</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is under threat, when some Virginia schools are opting to </span><a href="https://www.windsorweekly.com/2023/03/10/isle-of-wight-county-schools-bans-teaching-on-systemic-racism/?eType=EmailBlastContent&amp;eId=44444444-4444-4444-4444-444444444444" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">straight up lie to students</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about the existence of systemic racism and its consequences, and when Virginia’s own governor seems to deem diversity and inclusion “inherently divisive concepts,” the proposed stripping of Gandy’s school name is another step in the wrong direction. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The board plans to vote on the replacement school’s name at its May 9 meeting. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The School Board and School Naming Committee are now </span><a href="https://hcps.us/events/what_s_new/elementary_school_naming_committee_input" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">seeking the public&#8217;s perspectives</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the renaming</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. I, and many other Black Hanoverians I know, plan to call in support of keeping the John M. Gandy school name. It will be up to the board to answer these calls in a way that either respects the wishes of its constituents or reflects its reputation of racism, exclusion, intolerance and regressive thinking. </span></p>

(Richmond Times-Dispatch)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In what can only be characterized as a stunningly callous decision, last week members of a Rules subcommittee of Virginia’s House of Delegates killed a resolution to acknowledge and apologize for the state-sanctioned medical misuse of Black bodies in Virginia, a common practice in the 19th and 20th centuries. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Four of the subcommittee’s five members – including House Majority Leader Terry Kilgore, R-Scott, Speaker Todd Gilbert, R-Shenandoah, Del. Barry Knight, R-Virginia Beach, and Del. Kathy Byron, R-Bedford – voted to lay </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=231&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=sj274" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SJ 274</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the table, politi-speak for postponing any action on the legislation indefinitely. The measure had sailed through the Senate with unanimous approval and, at least in the mind of Phillip Thompson, who came up with the idea of the bill, was a no-brainer, low-lift way for the state to recognize the wrongs of the past.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I thought it had a chance because it’s a very innocuous bill,” Thompson told me. “We weren’t asking for reparations, nothing like that; we just wanted a real apology.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An apology would be the very least the state could do, considering Virginia institutions’ horrible history of using Black people, living and dead, as guinea pigs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thompson said he got the idea for the resolution after reading a </span><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/12/18/black-mistrust-healthcare-00060324" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Politico article</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in late 2022 that explained how Black laborer Bruce Tucker’s body was violated in the name of a medical miracle after his accidental death in 1968.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A day after he died from a fatal fall, and without his family’s knowledge or consent, Tucker’s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“heart was sewn into the chest of a white business executive” at the </span><a href="https://medschool.vcu.edu/about/history/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Medical College of Virginia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the forebear of what is now Virginia Commonwealth University’s School of Medicine, according to Politico’s report. “It was one of the first heart transplants in the country, and it gave the med school the status it had sought at the forefront of transplant science.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tucker’s sad fate also underscored Richmond’s record of body snatching, the practice of stealing the bodies of deceased Black people for doctors-in-training to practice dissection. “Resurrectionists” were known to lurk in Black cemeteries in Richmond, seeking to abscond with the remains of the newly dead, according to the </span><a href="https://vimeo.com/28188054" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">documentary</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “Until the Well Runs Dry: Medicine and the Exploitation of Black Bodies,” directed by </span><a href="https://afam.vcu.edu/about/history/2010s/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. Shawn Utsey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, former chair of VCU’s African American Studies Department. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thompson asked one of his representatives, Sen. Jennifer Boysko, D-Fairfax, to sponsor the bill and advocate for its passage. In her presentation to the House Rules subcommittee last week, Boysko said the healing of old wounds can’t precede acknowledgment that the wounds were inflicted in the first place. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think it&#8217;s important that we address problems so we can move forward collaboratively,” Boysko told me in a phone interview after her bill was dashed. “We know there are Black people who live in Virginia and around the country who are suspicious of health care because of what has happened in the past. Our bill would have at least admitted that and given people a small peace of mind.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thompson agreed, citing some Black Americans’ distrust of the medical community stemming from its past unethical actions that had a deleterious impact on African American health, such as the 40-year-long </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tuskegee/timeline.htm" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tuskegee Experiment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In that case, the government withheld syphilis treatment from hundreds of Black men to study the disease without telling them and then continued to let the disease ravage the men’s bodies, even after penicillin became widely available for treatment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Tuskegee Experiment and many other instances of medical mistreatment is “why we had difficulty with the COVID vaccines in the African American community,” Thompson said. “Many of us still don’t trust the system, and when you look at history, that distrust is justified.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In learning all of this, the question that persists for me is simply, why? What possible reason did Republican lawmakers have to dismiss SJ 274? Kilgore didn’t return my emails or calls seeking an answer, so I have to rely on the sorely lacking response to the legislation by Gilbert, given during the </span><a href="https://sg001-harmony.sliq.net/00304/Harmony/en/PowerBrowser/PowerBrowserV2/20230217/-1/17015#agenda_" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">subcommittee meeting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Feb. 17.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I feel like there are thousands upon thousands of equally painful and hurtful and regrettable stories that could be told about how we treated one another, how Black Americans were treated for a very long time in this country. And I just worry that there&#8217;s no end to these resolutions, and maybe that&#8217;s the intent, I don&#8217;t know,” Gilbert said. “But certainly if it helps for me to acknowledge that fact – that there are these many, many hurtful, painful memories and events and actions that hurt so many people – you know, I&#8217;m doing that publicly right now. But I just don&#8217;t know in the way of legislation how we contribute to that healing by acknowledging one or two a year at a time. That&#8217;s my main concern.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let me paraphrase how this message comes across to me, as a Black Virginian interested in righting the wrongs of the past: “There are way too many instances of Black people’s human and civil rights being trampled in the dirt for us to acknowledge them all, so we won’t even try.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What a cowardly, callous stance to take – and during Black History Month, no less. And while the governor’s administration continues to </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2023/02/18/states-review-ap-african-american-studies-class/?eType=EmailBlastContent&amp;eId=125e8ff6-8fbd-4024-9e01-631023e9563d" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">threaten the teaching of African American history</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in our schools, and as </span><a href="https://apps.vdh.virginia.gov/HealthStats/stats.htm" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">health disparities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> persist among Black Virginians. As my late grandmother would say, it is a sin and a shame.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bruce Tucker’s body parts were stolen, and one of the state&#8217;s current leading medical schools pioneered its practice on the literal strength of his heart. To acknowledge and apologize for this horror is the very least this legislature could have, and should have, done. Thompson and Boysko plan to bring the measure before the legislature again next year; let’s hope more sensitive and sensible legislators will then advance what is long overdue. </span></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong/The Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Janet Rainey, Virginia’s </span><a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/state-registrar-retires-after-nearly-a-half-century-of-service-to-the-commonwealth/?utm_campaign=20230131_&amp;utm_content=&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recently retired state registrar</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, has come a long way from the tobacco fields of Chase City, the small metropolis that is her hometown in Mecklenburg County. Her parents, God-fearing farmers James Sr. and Inez, encouraged Rainey and her five siblings to get educated, and get moving.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They encouraged us to leave home because the only thing that was there was tobacco or factory work,” Rainey told me in an interview in her first days of retirement. “They wanted us to get an education but told us, ‘Always remember your roots.’”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That strong foundation of family supported Rainey throughout her 47-year career in the Office of Vital Records, the state’s official steward of birth, death, marriage and family records. She started at age 19, after a stint in business college, and for decades worked her way up through the ranks, learning all she could along the way from more senior colleagues. Soon, she saw firsthand the devastating effects Virginia’s racist, since-abolished Racial Integrity Act of 1924 was still having on families statewide – particularly Native American ones.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I was promoted to the unit that did amendments – corrected spelling of names, birth records and race on important documents – in 1975,” Rainey said. “Every month, we were processing amendment requests from Virginia Indians who had been wrongly classified as ‘colored.’ I said to my coworkers, ‘How can somebody just do that, change your race from what you’ve always identified as to what they want you to be?’&#8221; </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The architect of the Racial Integrity Act was Walter Plecker, the state’s first registrar of vital statistics. Plecker was a physician and a staunch proponent of eugenics, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“a discredited movement aimed at scientifically proving white racial superiority and thereby justifying the marginalizing of non-white people,” </span><a href="https://encyclopediavirginia.org/entries/plecker-walter-ashby-1861-1947/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">accordin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">g to Encyclopedia Virginia. Over the years Virginia enacted eugenics-based practices like restricting or removing the </span><a href="https://encyclopediavirginia.org/entries/buck-v-bell-1927/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reproductive and parental rights</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of developmentally disabled people and </span><a href="https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/today-in-supreme-court-history-loving-v-virginia" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">banning interracial marriage</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The state’s former systemic segregation of whites from non-white people was also based on the eugenics principle of white supremacy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Racial Integrity Act codified this racist system and, under Plecker’s purview, required non-white people like the ancestors and fellow tribal members of Diane Shields, director of the </span><a href="https://www.minculturalfoundation.org" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monacan Nation Cultural Foundation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, to be assigned a racial designation that misrepresented their true identity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bear Mountain, located in Amherst County, Virginia, has been the </span><a href="https://www.monacannation.com" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monacan Nation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8216;s ancestral home for over 10,000 years. The Monacan were among the first Native American tribes recorded in Virginia history, but after 1924, the Racial Integrity Act deemed its members “colored” or other terms that indicated they were not white, leading to the misrepresentation of the identities of untold thousands of people. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shields began working with Rainey in 1994 to correct the birth records of hundreds of members of her tribe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A lot of times in the early days, people were born at home. My grandparents married as ‘colored,’” said Shields. “Their three children that were born here in Amherst County, by midwife, had ‘Indian’ on their birth records. But then they moved over to the Eagle Rock area, and the rest of their children were [classified as] white. So it was who was looking at you, what time of year it is, what they think your skin tone is, and that’s how they’d classify you. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of our older people didn&#8217;t have birth certificates; we’re still dealing with that.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These long-standing errors made it difficult not only for individual tribal members to prove their identities, but also for tribes to obtain state and federal recognition. The Monacan earned federal recognition in 2018, one of just seven tribes that have that designation statewide. Shields said that although she and Rainey experienced “growing pains” as they both learned how to navigate the process of correcting Monacan members’ vital records, she appreciated Rainey’s commitment and compassion. The next state registrar has big shoes to fill, Shields said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I hope whoever takes over does it as well as Janet did,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rainey also spearheaded changes in the way marriages and adoptions of same-sex couples and families are officially recorded in Virginia during her stint as state registrar.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a 2014</span><a href="https://casetext.com/case/bostic-v-rainey" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Norfolk-based lawsuit centered on same-sex marriages</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Rainey was named as one of the defendants in a case that preceded the Supreme Court </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/06/26/417717613/supreme-court-rules-all-states-must-allow-same-sex-marriages" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ruling that made same-sex marriage legal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in all 50 states.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_34408" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:1024px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Obergefell_Getty.jpeg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-34408 size-full" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Obergefell_Getty.jpeg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Obergefell_Getty.jpeg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Obergefell_Getty-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Obergefell_Getty-768x512.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Plaintiff Jim Obergefell speaks to members of the media after the U.S. Supreme Court handed down a ruling regarding same-sex marriage June 26, 2015 outside the Supreme Court in Washington, DC.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consequently, she and her department “came up with a policy to recognize same-sex partners as parents on birth certificates and adoption records, because at the time, Virginia only recognized parents as a mother and a father,” she said. Later, Rainey also oversaw new policies for the changing of transgender peoples’ vital records.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rainey’s own life experiences as a Black woman from a rural community influenced how she understood and related to each person she helped to amend records related to their identity, she said. Earlier in her career, she sometimes experienced racism from members of the public who had come to her office seeking help. Despite this and other challenges, she persisted and left in her wake a legacy of excellence through actions that made Virginia a more inclusive commonwealth for all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There were times when I was looked down upon,” she said. “They would ask to see a supervisor, and when I walked in, they were surprised to see me. I encountered that, but I didn&#8217;t let it sway me from doing the job I was hired to do.”</span></p>

(Lenora McQueen)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Jan. 20, the federal government reopened historic review of the 123-mile</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Washington, DC to Richmond (</span><a href="https://www.dc2rvarail.com" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">DC2RVA</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) segment of the proposed Southeast High-Speed Rail project, which when complete will increase intercity passenger rail travel throughout the southeast region. Initially, the railway was planned to be built through one of the largest cemeteries for enslaved people in America, the Shockoe Hill African Burying Ground. Plans, apparently, have changed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s been nearly four years since I wrote about the cemetery, then known as Richmond’s </span><a href="https://scalawagmagazine.org/2019/08/black-graveyards/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grave Yard for Free People of Color and Slaves</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a formerly unrecognized resting place of over 20,000 Black people in the belly of what was once the nation’s second-largest slave trading epicenter. Some things have changed; many things haven’t.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cemetery has finally earned the local and national attention it deserves and, renamed the Shockoe Hill African Burying Ground, was added to the </span><a href="https://www.dhr.virginia.gov/historic-registers/127-7231/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">state’s historic landmarks register</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the </span><a href="https://www.nps.gov/subjects/nationalregister/weekly-list-2022-06-17.htm" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Register of Historic Places</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2022. Much of this progress is thanks to Lenora McQueen, a descendent of at least three people buried in the cemetery whose dogged efforts to preserve the place pushed boundaries – literally and figuratively. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before the historic designations, “they had totally pushed this burial ground out of the way, minimized it, cut it down to its 1835 site size of a little over 3 acres, pushed it south on maps. But at the time it closed, it was about 31 acres,” said McQueen in a phone interview last week. “The minimization was purposeful.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Making the cemetery seem smaller would make it easier for the high-speed rail to be built through it, McQueen believes. For the past five years, she and a volunteer team of archaeologists and public historians have advocated fiercely for the burial ground’s full boundaries to be recognized by the city of Richmond, Federal Railroad Administration, Virginia Department of Rail and Public Transit and Virginia Department of Transportation, which oversaw the DC2RVA project at its start, in 2014.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020 the General Assembly created the Virginia Passenger Rail Authority; its flagship program,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Transforming Rail in Virginia, oversees more than a dozen passenger rail projects statewide, now including DC2RVA. Authority spokeswoman Gerica Goodman said she learned of the cemetery and McQueen’s work to protect it on her first day on the job in early 2022. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I took an interest because I knew it was not something that was going away,” Goodman told me in a phone interview. “Our sole focus are these rail projects, and the major core of what we do is building infrastructure; [the cemetery] isn&#8217;t something that we could close our eyes to.  We&#8217;re in Richmond, we&#8217;re in these communities, we have to work with communities to make sure we&#8217;re not being disruptive and to gain their trust.”</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.achp.gov/sites/default/files/regulations/2017-02/regs-rev04.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Section 106</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 requires that federally funded or managed projects be reviewed to determine if and how the project will impact historic spaces, and</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “seek ways to avoid, minimize or mitigate any adverse effects on historic properties.” As part of the Section 106 process for DC2RVA, the Department of Rail and Public Transit and its partner agencies conducted environmental, architectural and cultural studies in central Virginia starting in 2014, and consulted with property owners and other community stakeholders to identify historic properties that the project might impact. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In July 2019, the final Section 106 </span><a href="https://www.dc2rvarail.com/files/3515/6803/2873/DC2RVA_ROD_Attachment_A-Final_Section_106_MOA_05Sep2019.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Memorandum of Agreement </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">was released and revealed that 120 historic Virginia properties stood to be impacted by the rail project; 21 of these sites would be adversely affected. The Shockoe Hill African Burying Ground didn’t make the cut, despite McQueen’s insistence via letters, emails and phone calls that the cemetery was sacred ground that deserved protection.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">[The cemetery’s] size and importance were pretty much dismissed by their official reports, because there was no proof that the site housed anything beyond a jail and gallows,” said McQueen. “I told them, ‘I am the proof. My ancestors are buried there.’”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Something shifted in November 2022, when the 2019 memorandum was amended twice. Cory Gattie with the Federal Railroad Association explained via email “that the boundaries of the Shockoe Hill site were expanded due to its acquisition by the City of Richmond and listing in the National Register of Historic Places in 2022.” The changes also laid out what they called “a process for further consultation to assess effects and then seek ways to avoid, minimize or mitigate any adverse effects to the Shockoe Hill site.” </span></p>

(Lenora McQueen)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goodman said the Virginia Passenger Rail Authority’s current goal as it relates to the burial ground “is to avoid it completely. Right now, [DC2RVA] would have an adverse effect on it, and we don&#8217;t want to do that.” Though no official determinations have been reached, Goodman added, the agency and its partners are analyzing alternative routes for the rail line that would not go through the Shockoe Hill African Burying Ground. I, and I’m sure McQueen and other descendents of those interred there, eagerly await updates on that. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cemetery has already seen state- and city-sanctioned desecration multiple times. In the 1880s, when the city regraded and expanded Fifth Street, some of the cemetery’s “dead bodies and bones” were exposed and used as fill in the road construction project, </span><a href="https://www.richmondcemeteries.org/potters-field/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">writes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> historian and historic preservation expert Dr. Ryan K. Smith. Ten years after that, the construction of the Fifth Street Viaduct further disturbed the burial ground. In the 1950s, under new zoning, the city sold a portion of the cemetery; that part eventually housed a gas station. </span></p>
<p>All of this was public knowledge, but the cemetery still didn’t merit full recognition until last year. What changed?</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McQueen and others’ tireless advocacy for the Shockoe Hill African Burying Ground most certainly drove the change. But the continued racial, social and economic turbulence in this country also moved the needle; all of it has forced Americans to reckon with our hard history and has made us admit how flawed a democracy we still are, one that, hundreds of years after abolishing slavery, is still not a fully equitable or equal country for the descendants of enslaved and other people of color. And the continued neglect of the cemetery would be nothing if not shameful; perhaps some state and city leaders don’t want to be embarrassed by their inaction any longer (as they should have been). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whatever the cause, for me it is a reason for renewed hope. Hope that we can finally acknowledge and repair the harm reflected in the cemetery’s sad history. Hope that the cemetery continues to be recognized as the sacred space it is, and likewise protected from all future development. Hope that McQueen’s and others’ ancestors’ remains there can finally rest in peace. Hope that the cemetery will be just one of many formerly ignored sites of historic importance to Virginia’s communities of color that will gain attention and preservation. The work isn’t over yet; it has just begun.</span></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong / Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soon, statues of </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/01/05/1147079130/maryland-artist-chosen-to-create-u-s-capitol-statute-of-teen-who-fought-segregat" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Barbara Johns</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/23/us/henrietta-lacks-statue-robert-e-lee-virginia/index.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Henrietta Lacks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – two Black, Virginia-born women who contributed to significant educational and scientific progress in America – will be erected, one in Roanoke and the other in the U.S. Capitol. These new figures emerge after the eviction of the Confederate warmongers memorialized in metal that used to tower over Richmond and Charlottesville, and as Virginians reckon with the contemporary implications of the complicated history these emblems reflect. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scrutiny of monuments nationwide has in recent years raised the question: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whom do we choose to venerate through monuments in public spaces, and why? </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The answer to the first query is obvious, and backed by recent research: Historically, monuments in America depict mostly white, wealthy, land- and slave-owning men, </span><a href="https://monumentlab.com/audit?section=key-finding-2" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> compiled by The Monument Lab, a public art and history studio based in Philadelphia. The answer to the second query, the why, depends on who you ask. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Monuments are seldom about actual history; they&#8217;re a reflection of our present-day reality and aspirations,” said </span><a href="https://www.justingreid.com" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Justin Reid</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a Charlottesville-based public historian and cultural organizer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reid hails from Farmville, where in 1951, the 16-year-old Johns organized her classmates in a</span><a href="https://motonmuseum.org/learn/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> walkout protest</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the inadequate educational facilities, resources and opportunities in Prince Edward County. Johns and her fellow students’ activism paved the way for Brown v. Board of Education and changed the course of American history. A statue of this young trailblazer belonged in the U.S. Capitol long before now, but perhaps more importantly, her monument should serve as a reminder of the current inequalities facing Black Virginians that need rectifying — inequalities that Johns would have no doubt railed against. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Black Virginians are more likely to be at the bottom rungs of the economic ladder, more likely to rely on public benefits, and less likely to own homes or have accumulated wealth than other racial or ethnic groups,” found a January 2022 </span><a href="https://www.law.virginia.edu/system/files/news/2022/2022-report.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the Commission to Examine Racial Inequity in Virginia Law, convened by former Gov. Ralph Northam. The report laid out the several areas in which racial disparities persist statewide and shared policy recommendations to improve them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Health inequities are a prime example of these disparities. Lacks, whose likeness will be erected in the form of a statue in Roanoke later this year, was a victim of racist health care practices in her short lifetime. White doctors at Johns Hopkins Hospital reaped cells from Lacks’ body while she was being treated for cancer, without her knowledge or permission. Lacks’ “HeLa” cells enabled pioneering scientific research and </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/23/us/henrietta-lacks-statue-robert-e-lee-virginia/index.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">medical breakthroughs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> like the “polio vaccine, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in-vitro fertilization, and gene mapping.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her statue must also be more than artfully crafted metal memorialization. Done right, it should be a reminder of the healthcare inequities of the past and present in rural and Black communities. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lacks&#8217; bodily autonomy was violated during her lifetime when white doctors didn&#8217;t give her a say in their plans to slice cells from her cervix while she was under their care and purported protection. Such threats aren’t just a relic of history: If Gov. Youngkin&#8217;s</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/01/11/as-election-year-general-assembly-session-begins-youngkin-says-virginia-is-on-right-path/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bill to ban abortion after 15 weeks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> passes, the bodily autonomy and reproductive rights of women in the commonwealth will also be compromised.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Further, we need to be extremely careful not to hijack the potential power of the new statues of Johns, Lacks and other figures formerly excluded from monumentalization by turning them into storybook characters to conveniently fit our own motives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think we need to do more to uplift the stories of Black women and young people and rural communities involved in the civil rights movement,” said Reid. “At the same time,” he warned, “I see Barbara Johns and the student strike being mythologized in real time. This has happened with many civil rights figures – Martin Luther King, Rosa Parks, et cetera. Their legacies have often been co-opted by politicians to fit specific narratives.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One glaring example of this is Youngkin’s quoting of King’s iconic “I Have a Dream” speech in his </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/governor-of-virginia/pdf/eo/EO-1-Ending-the-Use-of-Inherently-Divisive-Concepts.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">very first executive order</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> banning “inherently divisive concepts” and “critical race theory” from being taught in Virginia schools, a move that was followed by the canceling of </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/02/25/youngkin-administration-ends-equity-initiatives-at-the-virginia-department-of-education/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">equity initiatives</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the Department of Education and the </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/11/30/separation-of-virginia-history-standards-and-curriculum-causes-questions/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bungling of the revision</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of state history education standards. King would no doubt be horrified that his words were used as political propaganda by an administration seemingly bent on limiting what students learn about Virginia’s history, especially Black history. It was a ridiculous and dangerous misuse of King’s legacy, and exactly what we cannot, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">must not</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> do with the legacies of those depicted in Virginia’s forthcoming monuments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week in Charlottesville saw the continuation of </span><a href="https://dailyprogress.com/news/august12/charlottesville-statue-trial-moves-forward-as-judge-tosses-artsy-witnesses-and-one-legal-tactic/article_b9fba5d2-9084-11ed-9f2d-b7ff00e35bb7.html#tracking-source=home-top-story" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the trial</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to decide what will become of the disassembled Robert E. Lee statue, the statue that, before its removal, galvanized the deadly Unite the Right white supremacist rally in 2017. After ousting Lee from his pedestal in the park, the city voted to give it to the </span><a href="https://jeffschoolheritagecenter.org/about-us/#venue-rental" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jefferson School African American Heritage Center</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The center, in conjunction with the group Swords into Plowshares (a reference to the prophetic words of Isaiah 2:4 that envision a war-less and productive society), plans to melt down the statue, reclaim the bronze and turn it into a new, community-informed piece of public art. The destruction, said Jefferson School director and art historian Dr. Andrea Douglas, isn’t the end game. It’s a critical step in the process to create something meaningful from an object that had prompted pain for many.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;re working in a process that wants to contextualize the space we have here. &#8230; Charlottesville was every bit as much a southern city as any other southern city that you can name in the Deep South,” she said. “The histories of racial politics were just as much created here as they were anywhere else. What we&#8217;re attempting to do is to come to terms with our living space today, with those facts.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to the “why” part of the question about who we choose to venerate through monuments, Douglas poses a question of her own: “What is appropriate for public space?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;re not talking about a private cemetery, not someone&#8217;s backyard; [we’re talking] about public space that is supposed to be egalitarian, by its very description,” she said. “This is not a chess game; we&#8217;re not taking white symbols and replacing them with black symbols. We&#8217;re recontextualizing what we want our public space to be.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2023 and in every year beyond, my earnest hope is that public spaces in Virginia and America will continue transforming to reflect the rich, deep legacy of people like Lacks and Johns, people whose voices and missions may have been silenced in life but may now speak loudly in a language of justice, equality and renewed hope, represented not just in their metal likenesses, but in the progress of their ideals and dreams. That progress rests not in the hands of statues, but in ours.</span></p>

dedicated in 1856. Colonial Williamsburg purchased the site in 1954. Two years later, First Baptist
Church relocated to its current location at 727 Scotland Street. In 1957 Colonial Williamsburg
demolished the 19th-century structure and conducted an archaeological investigation of the site,
uncovering evidence of structures dating to the late 18th and early 19th centuries. This year a
partnership led by First Baptist Church and Colonial Williamsburg has resumed archaeological
investigation of the site, which last took place in 1957. (Colonial Williamsburg)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Colonial Williamsburg, experts are </span><a href="https://www.colonialwilliamsburg.org/learn/research-and-education/archaeology/first-baptist-church/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">unearthing </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">the foundations of </span><a href="https://firstbaptistchurch1776.org" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">First Baptist Church</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, among the oldest African American congregations in the country, as part of an attempt to uncover a more complete narrative of early American history, centering the Black people — enslaved and free — who contributed much to the fledgling nation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First Baptist Church, founded in 1776, is still a thriving hub of Williamsburg&#8217;s Black community, says the Rev. Reginald Davis, who has served as the church&#8217;s pastor since 2004. The church&#8217;s origin story — it was founded by enslaved and free Blacks at the start of the American Revolution, in defiance of laws forbidding Blacks to congregate — reflects a spirit of self-determination and resilience, says Davis, and confirms that Black people were present and participating in the building of early Virginia and America.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Every American war, we have had </span><a href="https://www.pbs.org/opb/historydetectives/feature/african-americans-in-combat/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">African Americans serving</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in every one of them. Blacks were fighting for freedom for America, even when we were not free. &#8230; We were part of the destiny of this country, we were part of the dream of this country, we were part of the economics of this country, and everything that makes America what it is today, but we have been largely written out of our own story,&#8221; Davis said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The original church began in a brush arbor outside Williamsburg, under the leadership of free Black preacher Rev. Moses, in 1776. In 1781, guided by enslaved minister </span><a href="https://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Pamphlet_Gowan_fl_1779-1807#start_entry" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gowan Pamphlet</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — who worked in his owner&#8217;s upscale tavern serving Virginia gentry including George Washington and William Byrd III —  the church body became Baptist. Later, the members started meeting in a structure donated by a White landowner, Jesse Cole. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That building, located in present-day Williamsburg&#8217;s Historic Area on Nassau Street, was then known then as the Baptist Meeting House. A tornado destroyed the structure in the early 1830s, but congregants built a new building on the same site in 1856, and were by then known as the African Baptist Church. Less than 10 years later, the tabernacle was renamed the First Baptist Church. The church is believed to be one of the first in America to have been built and led entirely by Black people from its founding, says Connie Harshaw, a member of the church and the president of First Baptist&#8217;s Let Freedom Ring Foundation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recalling her first visit to Colonial Williamsburg as a middle schooler in the 1960s, Harshaw felt “there was nothing there to reflect me or my people. &#8230; I wondered, where were the Black people in Colonial Virginia?” After retiring from a position with the federal government, Harshaw moved to Williamsburg and joined First Baptist Church in 2007. </span></p>

(Let Freedom Ring Foundation)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Colonial Williamsburg purchased the Nassau Street church property in the mid-1950s and demolished the 19th century church building. “Payment for the Nassau Street property covered the land and construction costs of the congregation’s current church at 727 Scotland St.,” a </span><a href="https://media.colonialwilliamsburg.org/media/documents/FINAL_FBC_news_release.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> news release</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about the excavation project says. Harshaw wondered what happened to the physical remains of the Nassau Street church building and if long-dead parishioners might still be buried beneath the pavement that had partially covered the site for years. Davis urged her to investigate by leading the church’s Let Freedom Ring Foundation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Harshaw says her own family roots are not associated with First Baptist, she and the Let Freedom Ring Foundation serve as a “voice alongside the descendent community, whose ancestors were the Black people who formed this congregation. It is critical that everything we do be informed by the views of the descendent community.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The group formed in 2018, and its namesake is the church’s historic </span><a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/historic-bell-helps-ring-new-african-american-history-museum-180960545/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Freedom Bell</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, cast in 1886. The church partnered with Colonial Williamsburg to restore the historic bell and in 2016, it was rung by then-President Barack Obama, First Lady Michelle Obama and a woman whose father had been enslaved, Ruth Odom Bonner (now deceased), at the dedication of the Smithsonian Institution’s National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, D.C. With Harshaw helming the organization, its continued mission is to conserve and preserve First Baptist Church’s historically-significant objects — including pieces of its 19th century church building, if found — and the legacy they represent.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Even if we don&#8217;t find anything, the sheer acknowledgement that we were there, that our ancestors were contributing to this community, would be worth it,” Harshaw saids of the project. “We would like to see the building re-constructed,” said Harshaw. “I would love for our great-grandchildren to walk down Nassau Street, and learn about the African Americans who built our church and who were brave enough to serve their God.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this year, ground-penetrating radar confirmed evidence of an 18th or 19th century structure, said Jack Gary, Colonial Williamsburg’s Director of Archaeology. Gary is guiding the science of the dig, with assistance from the Jamestown Rediscovery Foundation and scholars and students from the</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">College of William &amp; Mary.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are taking a high-tech and low tech approach,” Gary said. “High tech, we used ground-penetrating radar, which uses radar waves to look underneath the ground, as shallow or deep as you want. … Our low-tech method is to do what archeologists do best: dig holes in the ground. We&#8217;re digging to see what [the church’s foundational remains] look like, and what condition it is in, and what info we can get from this site.” In the event that human remains are found, Gary said the descendent community will guide the process of memorializing the interred. Work began in September, and is estimated to continue for the next seven to eight weeks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Everything that we recover from the field comes into [Colonial Williamsburg’s] laboratory where it&#8217;s cleaned and catalogued,”  Gary said, noting the church excavation will follow the same process. Importantly, “We will make sure the church has access to these materials themselves, for study or utilization or exhibits at the church.” How they interpret the site and incorporate it into the living landscape of Colonial Williamsburg remains to be seen and depends on what the excavation reveals, Gary added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The project represents an opportunity for Colonial Williamsburg to broaden the lens of the historical narratives portrayed there, to include a more whole, honest depiction of Black people who built early Virginia, whether enslaved or free. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the suggestion of First Baptist and its Let Freedom Ring Foundation, “We removed the parking lot [that covered part of the Nassau Street church site],” Gary said. “It&#8217;s symbolic of rectifying historical narratives that discounted and suppressed Black history. Colonial Williamsburg has strived for a long time to be inclusive with its interpretation of history; this project is a chance to put our money where our mouth is.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As seismic demonstrations against racial and social injustice roil the nation, state officials continue to prioritize sharing a more complete history of the state and its inhabitants. Gov. Ralph Northam established the Virginia Commission on African-American History Education by executive order in August 2019. In the commission&#8217;s </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/08/31/state-commission-recommends-changes-to-how-african-american-history-is-taught-in-virginia-schools/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">final report released last month</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it recommends major changes in how history is taught in Virginia, honing in on curriculum </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/05/01/virginia-explained-how-virginias-history-textbooks-are-vetted/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">inaccuracies and whitewashed information</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in textbooks about slavery and aspects of the African American experience long cited by educators. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The commission’s recommendation would make African American history a graduation requirement for Virginia students; a </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/all-releases/2020/august/headline-860129-en.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">high school-level elective class</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — formulated by the Virginia Department of Education in collaboration with WHRO Public Media, educators and advocates — is being offered this academic year in at least 16 school districts statewide. Against that backdrop, the excavation project isn&#8217;t just </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">an opportunity to illuminate a more comprehensive history of First Baptist Church and its founders, Davis said. It is a chance for Colonial Williamsburg, the state and the nation to take a concrete step forward in good faith by elevating Black history that has, for centuries, been intentionally suppressed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We talk a lot about racial reconciliation. But reconciliation is on the other side of justice, not before it,” Davis said. “You can&#8217;t ask me to reconcile an unjust past. First of all, you have to acknowledge the unjust past, then we can work towards justice now, and then reconciliation.”</span></p>

Yet, here in Virginia, breastfeeding in all public spaces became legally protected just  <a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/breastfeeding/virginia-public-breastfeeding-law/#:~:text=Mothers%20Have%20A%20Legal%20Right,the%20mother%20is%20lawfully%20present%E2%80%A6%E2%80%9D" target="_blank">five years ago</a>. Now, as the state observes August as Breastfeeding Awareness Month, health care workers, community advocates and state legislators are working together to make breastfeeding more accessible and sustainable for families.</p>
<p><a href="https://uvahealth.com/findadoctor/profile/porsche-l-roberson" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. Porsche Roberson</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an assistant professor of pediatrics at UVA Health who practices in Orange, cites a plethora of benefits of breastfeeding for babies. Mother&#8217;s milk strengthens a baby&#8217;s budding immune system – &#8220;it&#8217;s like giving your baby a shot of antibiotics,&#8221; – and increases cognitive development. Breastfeeding can also be a plus for moms, as noted by the American Institute for Cancer Research, which found that lactating mothers faced </span><a href="https://www.wcrf.org/dietandcancer/exposures/lactation-breastfeeding" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lower risk</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of breast and ovarian cancer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The American Academy of Pediatrics </span><a href="https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/129/3/e827" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recommends</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> babies be fed breast milk exclusively for the first six months of life. But the best way health care workers can support families is by respecting their decisions, says Roberson.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s a very personal choice to breastfeed or not, and it&#8217;s up to the families to lead that, not doctors. We should also give [families] the resources they need, whether that&#8217;s information about breastfeeding support groups, advising them on what type of formula works best for their baby&#8217;s needs, or perhaps referring them to a lactation consultant.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She stresses to the future pediatricians she teaches that, &#8220;our job is to support families in their goals, first of which is to feed their baby. &#8230; Whether a family chooses to breastfeed or not, they will be doing the right thing by nourishing their child.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">August is Breastfeeding Awareness Month in Virginia, in accordance with the United States Breastfeeding Committee&#8217;s declaration of August as National Breastfeeding Month. Sen. Jennifer McClellan, D- Richmond, has a track record of sponsoring bills dealing with maternal-infant health, and has in recent years lobbied for increased breastfeeding awareness and access. McClellan sponsored the state&#8217;s Breastfeeding Awareness Month </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+sum+SJ298" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">resolution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2019, and made history in 2011 when she became the first breastfeeding member of the House of Delegates. The </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+sum+SB712&amp;201+sum+SB712" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pregnant Worker Fairness Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, introduced by McClellan in the Senate this year, became law in July.  Del. Jennifer Carroll Foy, D-Prince William, <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+sum+HB827" target="_blank">carried the House version</a>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Essentially, this requires employers to make reasonable accommodations for pregnant and nursing mothers in Virginia,&#8221; McClellan explains. These types of employer accommodations include, for example, providing a private space to pump breastmilk or nurse – that is not a bathroom. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t eat in the bathroom or cook in the bathroom; why would you make mothers feed their children in the bathroom?&#8221; says McClellan. The law also prohibits discrimination against breastfeeding workers, specifically banning employers from &#8220;taking any adverse action against an employee who requests or uses a reasonable accommodation.&#8221; The law also provides guidance to employers on how to accommodate lactating employees. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While this recent legislation is a major step forward, McClellan says &#8220;We still have a lot of work to do to educate policy makers,&#8221; recalling when an older, male colleague asked why lactating working moms couldn&#8217;t just pump breast milk on their lunch break. McClellan helped him understand that lactating mothers need to pump their milk frequently throughout the day, or risk </span><a href="https://www.llli.org/breastfeeding-info/mastitis/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">mastitis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – a painful condition when breasts become engorged with milk, resulting in inflammation and infection. The exchange, McClellan says, demonstrated why it is critical that the perspectives and needs of groups directly affected by a law – in this case, nursing mothers – be represented in legislative processes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Women who can and would breastfeed, they need institutional and policy support. They need the ability to know they can do what they need to do to provide a healthy meal to their child, even while working.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like in maternal health outcomes, Black and Brown families face racial disparities when it comes to breastfeeding. In a </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/66/wr/mm6627a3.htm" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recent report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the Centers for Disease Control found that 83 percent of American mothers breastfed their babies at birth; of this number, 85 percent of White mothers nursed their newborns, compared to only 69 percent of Black mothers, the lowest percentage of any group. African American mothers face barriers to breastfeeding that other groups don&#8217;t, including &#8220;earlier return to work, inadequate receipt of breastfeeding information from providers, and lack of access to professional breastfeeding support,&#8221; write the study&#8217;s authors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://vabreastfeedingcoalition.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Breastfeeding Coalition</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> exists to break down these and other barriers to breastfeeding, says Angela Love-Zaranka, chair of the group. The coalition&#8217;s statewide network of members include individuals, organizations and state agencies, all advocating for Virginia families to have more equitable opportunity and access to breastfeeding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We want to work towards a culture of health and wellness for all, and breastfeeding is a critical part of that. To the mothers and families who choose to breastfeed, we are here [to be] a resource for them, and to do everything we can to ensure they can meet their goals.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To redress racial disparities, the coalition supports national efforts like Black Breastfeeding Week, starting this Tuesday. In recent years, the coalition worked with VDH&#8217;s Virginia Maternity Care Quality Improvement Collaborative to &#8220;adopt best practices and evidence-based principles about birth and breastfeeding throughout Virginia,&#8221; says Love-Zaranka. &#8220;We&#8217;ve had meetings to help hospitals integrate these changes, and feel strongly that they are of great benefit to our entire community.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, the coalition sponsors the</span><a href="https://vabreastfeedingcoalition.org/virginia-breastfeeding-friendly-workplace-settings-awards/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Virginia Breastfeeding Friendly Workplace Awards</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in partnership with the Virginia Department of Health, bestowing bronze, silver and gold honors to companies that enact policies which support breastfeeding workers, above and beyond what the state mandates. Nominations for the 2021 awards run through Aug. 31. </span></p>
<p>UPDATE: <em>This post has been updated to add that Del. Jennifer Carroll Foy, D-Prince William, carried the House version of legislation requiring Virginia employers to make reasonable accommodations for pregnant women and nursing mothers. </em></p>

(NBC12)</p><h3><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Renaming schools and removing monuments is only the beginning; real change can come only by dismantling Virginia’s systems of racial inequity</span></i></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week, Hanover County School Board </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/hanover-school-board-votes-to-change-name-of-lee-davis-high-stonewall-jackson-middle-schools/article_a7c0e2b9-75e8-5e10-912c-c1e213d8d30e.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">voted to rename</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Lee-Davis High School and Stonewall Jackson Middle school, joining a slew of school systems </span><a href="https://richmond.com/opinion/columnists/rodney-robinson-column-no-more-confederate-school-names-or-mascots/article_e899b4cb-0464-5a5f-a415-94d82298150d.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">across the state</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> choosing to remove from their campuses longstanding symbols and signals of confederate veneration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As my 5- and 2-year old sons roughhoused on our living room floor like a pair of playful puppies, I settled my baby boy on my lap, muted my phone and tuned in to the school board&#8217;s Zoom meeting from the couch, one of a reported 1,860 people to do so. I&#8217;d wager that most folks were watching for the same reason I was: to witness whether our public school leaders would finally decide to do away with the racist school names that have come to define a part of </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/07/08/this-is-hanover-but-it-doesnt-have-to-be/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hanover&#8217;s identity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The clerk read 33, pre-submitted public comments; most of them urged the board to change the school names. When it came time for the vote, I was fully prepared for the board to ignore or reject the chorus of calls to change the names, </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/07/08/as-other-virginia-school-systems-act-one-is-still-clinging-to-its-racist-confederate-names/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">like they have</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> so many times before. Instead, I was shocked to hear a motion to change the names pass 4 to 3. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the midst of my excitement at the news, I realized that it was a pretty slim margin of victory for all of us who&#8217;ve been advocating for the school names to change. The three board members who voted to keep the racist names – school board chair John Axselle among them – represent nearly half of Hanover County&#8217;s school board leadership. If these leaders can&#8217;t even be counted on to give up their affinity for school monikers that represent Lost Cause mythology and a legacy of racism that demonstrably harms Black students, can they commit to the rigorous work of ensuring our schools are equitable learning environments for all students?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This chunk of board members help pilot Hanover&#8217;s education system, and they voted publicly to keep school names that perpetuate racism. As a Black parent to Black children, their actions say clearly to me, &#8220;We don&#8217;t care that these racist school names negatively impact African American students and parents. We don&#8217;t care that the school names create an unwelcoming environment for your children. We don&#8217;t care that a long, litigious battle to keep the racist school names would diminish resources meant to enhance the educational experience of Hanover students. We don&#8217;t care.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a time of continuous change, we must hold our leaders accountable for their words and deeds; they are supposed to serve their constituents, not outdated ideologies. They are supposed to care. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Hanover, and elsewhere in the state, we still have much work to do. The conversation can’t stop at the renaming of the schools, because the school names represent the larger problem: ingrained systemic racism and racial injustice. We can’t settle for simply removing confederate monuments without excising the spirit of bigotry and intolerance they represent. Councils and committees that examine inequality in Virginia’s education, healthcare, housing, social and economic systems are meaningless without policy that eradicates it. Treat the cause, not the symptoms.</span></p>

(NBC 12) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Monday, Gov. Northam </span><a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/local/government-politics/northam-urges-education-leaders-to-remove-confederate-names-from-schools/article_0b44540e-d6c8-524f-a766-2070520eaf12.html?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=user-share" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sent a letter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to school board leaders statewide, asking them to rename schools that still bear the names of Confederates, of which there are 14. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next day, a statue of Confederate general J.E.B. Stuart was plucked from its pedestal on Richmond’s Monument Avenue, leaving Lee as the lone Lost Cause icon remaining on the street. Virginia is home to </span><a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/virginia/by-the-numbers-virginia-has-the-most-confederate-monuments-flags-and-other-symbols-in-the/article_504277a5-abeb-5451-b1e9-6df44b0241e0.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more Confederate iconography</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – including monuments, roadway monikers and school names – than any other state in the nation; but now, totems of the Confederacy are coming down all over the Commonwealth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we witness a racial reckoning in real time across the state — including school systems in </span><a href="https://www.nbcsports.com/washington/high-school/fairfax-high-school-changes-mascot-rebels-lions" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fairfax</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.princewilliamtimes.com/sports/for-sports-teams-changing-stonewall-schools-names-means-eliminating-a-lot-of-signs-logos/article_010f51f4-b229-11ea-9803-3ff3f8b928be.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prince William</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/virginia-schools-confederate-names/2020/07/06/4c67faec-bc75-11ea-80b9-40ece9a701dc_story.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">elsewhere</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> taking action — in Hanover County leaders continue clinging to racist history by blatantly ignoring thousands of residents urging them, for years now, to rename Lee-Davis High School and Stonewall Jackson Middle School.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soon after news broke of Gov. Northam’s appeal to school boards to ditch Confederate names, I called every member of the Hanover County School Board to hear their thoughts. Sterling H. Daniel of the Mechanicsville District told me he couldn’t comment on the school names, “because the [Hanover County] NAACP has informed us they intend to appeal the lawsuit, so I can’t speak on ongoing litigation.” School Board members Robert Hundley and George Sutton also said they couldn’t comment. In May, a federal judge </span><a href="https://www.wtvr.com/news/local-news/federal-judge-dismisses-naacp-lawsuit-over-confederate-school-names-in-hanover" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">dismissed the lawsuit </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">the civil rights group brought last August. The NAACP argued, rightly, that schools named after Confederates harmed African American students and other pupils of color and impeded their right to an equal education.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It doesn’t take a whole lot of sense, as my grandmother would say, to understand why Black students are discouraged and distracted by school names and mascots that glorify the racist traitors who fought and died for the right to enslave Black people, perhaps even some of their ancestors. What it does take is empathy, compassion and a willingness to change, none of which the school board has displayed in its staunch refusal. School Board Chairman John Axselle of the Beaverdam District returned my call only to say he also couldn’t comment on the school names. The other board members never responded. In times like these, a new era that demands we speak truth to power, Hanover school board’s collective silence is deafening. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the continued absence of any meaningful words or actions by the school board to change the school names, former and current residents of Hanover are speaking out instead. Four fellow Hanoverians I talked with hold a common conviction: the Confederate school names and Hanover leaders’ unwillingness to change them is a reflection of the county’s long-festering </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/07/08/this-is-hanover-but-it-doesnt-have-to-be/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">culture of racism</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It’s the same invisible, insidious culture of racism that made the Ku Klux Klan feel welcome to host a recruitment rally in front of the county courthouse last summer. It’s the same culture of racism that spurred a Hanover County man to </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/08/us/virginia-kkk-leader-harry-rogers.html?auth=login-email&amp;login=email" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">self-identify</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as a “leader of the Ku Klux Klan and a propagandist for Confederate ideology” when he was arrested and charged for driving his truck into a crowd of people protesting police violence and racism in Henrico last month.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It’s a culture of racism that must cease, by any means necessary.</span></p>
<h2><strong>&#8216;We have a real chance now&#8217;</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alexsis Rodgers, the Virginia state director for domestic workers advocacy group Care in Action and a Richmond mayoral candidate, grew up in western Hanover. She is a 2009 graduate of Hanover High School and said she always had great relationships with her teachers. It wasn’t until she was an adult that she began to reflect on the racist microaggressions she experienced as a student. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was subtle stuff, like when people said I was ‘the Black friend,’ or their only Black friend,” she said. “It wasn’t until I grew up that I realized how bizarre that was, how they, basically, tried to tokenize me.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rodgers said her parents, transplants who moved to Hanover in the late ‘80s, tried to shield her and her brother from racism in the community largely by not acknowledging it. Her parents, and mine, belong to a generation of Black people who sometimes avoid talking about the racism they’ve encountered; it can be traumatizing to revisit. In May, authorities </span><a href="https://www.nbc12.com/2020/05/14/deputies-charge-juvenile-connection-racist-social-media-post/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">charged a Hanover </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">youth in connection with a Snapchat post of two white juveniles, one posing with a gun, plastered with the message “Let’s hunt some n*ggers.” The Hanover school district reported the post to police, although it wouldn’t confirm if the teens were Hanover students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I would love to see the names change,” Rodgers said of Hanover’s Lee-Davis High School and Stonewall Jackson Middle School. “I think it&#8217;s very exciting to see what&#8217;s happening on Monument Avenue. I won’t hold my breath, but I’m very hopeful that one day it will happen.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rachel Levy, a longtime education advocate and Caroline County teacher, has raised her three children in Hanover. She recalled her shock and concern when one of her sons, then in third grade at an Ashland elementary school, returned from class with a troubling assignment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He came home with this handout about Robert E. Lee, and it said ‘[Lee] hated slavery, but loved his state.’&#8230;  I was horrified. My other son’s assignment was on Benjamin Banneker; they were supposed to dress up as these characters.” At a meeting with her son’s teacher and school librarian, Levy says she and her husband told them, “We don&#8217;t believe in the Lost Cause, we don&#8217;t teach our children that. They were kind of miffed.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Levy is an organizer with </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/TogetherHanover/about/?ref=page_internal" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Together Hanover</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which describes itself as a non-partisan group whose members “support progressive policies and candidates.” The organization has been vocal about the need to change the racist school names, and its members have helped plan recent demonstrations in front of the Hanover County School Board office in Ashland ahead of board meetings. At a June 9 event, more than a dozen people, many of them Black graduates and current students, spoke about their experiences with racism in Hanover, detailing moments of humiliation, anger and sadness. Levy, who is White and has lived in the county since 2009, said the national climate presents an opportunity for progress in Hanover. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“People&#8217;s minds have been so poisoned by the Lost Cause mythology, that the truth is often obscured. &#8230; But we have a real chance now in this moment to get some leverage on this issue. The school names are harmful and need to be changed.” </span></p>

<h2><strong>&#8216;Making them feel lesser&#8217;</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sheri Shannon, director of Shannon Strategies communications firm, was raised in Hanover, the daughter of the beloved pastor and first lady of Shiloh Baptist Church, a historic Black congregation in the heart of Ashland. Where the school system failed Black students and families, Shannon said, Black churches supported and encouraged them. Her own parents were strong advocates for Black students, inside and outside their church family. They, and leaders from other churches, often raised issues, like the high rate of Black male students being suspended during her years at Patrick Henry High School.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I just know that the Black churches in Hanover, if it wasn&#8217;t for them, &#8230; a lot of the kids who are products of Hanover County public schools may not be where we are today.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Issues of systemic racism are a chief concern for Shannon, who recently moved to North Chesterfield but still visits Hanover frequently. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There&#8217;s a lot of institutional racism that Hanover has to deal with as well, not just in its school systems, but also with the county board of supervisors, and the resources [that are] allocated to the county to ensure people have internal plumbing, people have access to broadband internet, folks who are dealing with substance abuse issues [get help], people who need transportation [get assistance] &#8230; those numbers are very startling, when you start to look at the disparities within Hanover.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pat Jordan is a Hanover native whose heritage here dates back to at least the early 1800s. Jordan’s mother, a teacher, moved the family to Henrico to escape the racism in the school system. Jordan returned to Hanover when she married and started a family; both of her sons are graduates of Lee-Davis High School. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One of my sons was in the band,” said Jordan. “He didn&#8217;t want to wear a uniform that had ‘Confederates’ on it. So we would put a jacket around his band uniform to hide the Confederates name.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to being a longtime Hanover Schools volunteer, Jordan is vice president of the Hanover County NAACP, said the school names have done damage to Black students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What the school system is acknowledging is the Lost Cause, the Confederacy, not the Black children who are attending these schools every day. … It has the effect of making them feel lesser.” Hanover County leaders must have “a heart change,” Jordan believes, to begin to understand and mitigate the corrosive racism that is an undercurrent of life here. </span></p>
<h2><strong>Doing what&#8217;s right</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On June 30, Longwood University </span><a href="http://www.longwood.edu/news/2020/campus-building-names/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that its new, 43,000 square foot interdisciplinary academic building would be named in honor of Dr. Edna Allen Bledsoe Dean, the school’s first Black tenured professor. Longwood will also rechristen Ruffner Hall, a campus building named after 19th-century slave owner, pioneering education leader and segregationist Henry Ruffner. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The decision came less than two weeks after a petition asking the university to remove Ruffner’s name was spearheaded by Justin Reid. Reid, a public historian, director of community initiatives at Virginia Humanities, Farmville native and relative of Dr. Dean, said a series of questions he asked himself and others in his community compelled him to create the #RenameRuffner petition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Why not name these [campus] buildings after people whom a wide variety of people in the community will be proud of? Why uplift someone or something that is harmful to a portion of your community?” In truth, said Reid, changing a school building’s name is the easy part.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our schools need more funding, more diverse staffing, updated curriculum and other resources. But if you won&#8217;t change the name of a building, how can we trust that you&#8217;ll be committed to the more difficult parts of the discovery process? If you can&#8217;t do that, how can we trust you to do the hard work that&#8217;s necessary to make educational environments more equitable?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are questions I implore Hanover School Board to think and act on in their next meeting on July  14. In the words of Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., “The time is always right to do what is right.”</span></p>

There were 22,965 births in Virginia between March 1 and Monday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And the United Nations estimates </span><a href="https://population.un.org/wpp/Download/Standard/Population/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">116 million babies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will be born globally before the pandemic ends. The uncertain nature of COVID-19 has challenged doulas and other birth workers to innovate in providing support to mothers and infants, inside and outside of hospital settings. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The main way my practice has changed is that I am no longer seeing clients in person,&#8221; said </span><a href="http://cheyennevarner.com/doula" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cheyenne Varner</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a doula based in Richmond. &#8220;Prenatal meetings &#8230; [now] happen through Zoom. So I&#8217;m not able to offer some of the physical education to clients, like demonstrating hip squeezes and counter-pressure techniques, and showing how they can move around during labor to relieve pain.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nikiya Ellis, a doula, reproductive justice and food advocate and executive co-director of </span><a href="https://birthincolorrva.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Birth in Color RVA</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, also had to adjust her methods in recent months. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Most of my clients were already pregnant [before the pandemic], and we&#8217;d met in person. When COVID came, we had to go to phone conversations,&#8221; Ellis said. &#8220;Another one of my clients, I didn&#8217;t have the opportunity to meet her until she came to the hospital in labor.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most hospitals limited visitors to reduce the spread of the virus, starting in the early weeks of the pandemic in March. Doulas in the Richmond region say they were shocked, however, to find that they had been barred from visiting some of their laboring clients, as well. Some Richmond-area Bon Secours hospitals — including St. Mary&#8217;s, St. Francis, and Memorial Regional Medical Center — enacted a visitation policy that barred doulas from assisting their clients giving birth inside their facility.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It felt like a slap in the face,&#8221; Ellis said, &#8220;especially with the years of work and advocating we&#8217;ve been doing to get hospitals to see us as part of a pregnant person&#8217;s care team.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although they are not medically trained, doulas provide education and support to expectant mothers and families, and </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3647727/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">studies have shown</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that doula care increases healthy birth outcomes for mothers and infants. Additionally, Ellis said doulas are strong advocates for laboring mothers in medical settings, and can help ensure Black women – who die giving birth at three times the rate of white women in Virginia – receive quality, equitable care. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There have been small microaggressions against Black women, and I think that&#8217;s because experienced doulas and birth workers were not in the room to advocate for them.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In early April, Emily Bruno, a doula and co-founder of MyBirth in Richmond, spearheaded an effort to get doulas back into birth rooms. She, in collaboration with Mellisa Wirt of Latched Mama nursing apparel, drafted an </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BiX-9eBB46E08BvftG3kplLD3B6Z8UkGgXLrA21vgYA/edit" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">open letter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the hospitals asking for access, and sent it with the support of dozens of area doulas on April 20. Bruno says the needs and concerns of her clients pushed her into action.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I personally have had five clients change to [an] out of hospital birth, either birth center or home births,&#8221; she said. Once some expectant mothers learned that restrictive hospital visitation policies would block their doulas from being present during labor, &#8220;A lot of people were like, &#8216;if this is the system you&#8217;re offering, I&#8217;m not going to give birth in that system,'&#8221; Bruno said. While they have not attended home births, both Ellis and Varner said more people have reached out to them with questions about if or how they could birth at home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8220;The visitation policy changes at Bon Secours have been very fluid during the COVID-19 outbreak,&#8221; Bon Secours said in a statement provided to the Mercury. &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, those decisions were made based on the current information available to the hospitals and regions they exist in. All policies were made to protect our patients, staff, providers, and community with best intentions.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The statement adds that hospitals allowed doulas to FaceTime with their laboring clients, and that &#8220;several&#8221; of their labor nurses are &#8220;doula trained.&#8221; Bruno says that hospitals opened up to doulas on June 1. Bon Secours&#8217; statement ends, &#8220;Currently, we are delighted to have the doulas back in the hospital and have received very positive feedback from them.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+sum+HB687&amp;201+sum+HB687" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB 687,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> introduced by </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Lashrecse Aird</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, D-Petersburg,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">and passed during Virginia&#8217;s 2020 General Assembly session, is what Aird calls the &#8220;first step&#8221; towards state certification of doulas and streamlining doula care in hospitals and birth centers statewide.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Confronting and reducing the reality of maternal health disparities is at the center of this piece of legislation,&#8221; Aird said. When she started studying these disparities in 2018, she learned that Virginians&#8217; access to doulas was limited.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="mxPB2ffN8A"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2019/03/05/birthing-while-black-african-american-women-face-disproportionate-risks-during-pregnancy/">Birthing while black: African-American women face disproportionate risks during pregnancy</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Birthing while black: African-American women face disproportionate risks during pregnancy&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2019/03/05/birthing-while-black-african-american-women-face-disproportionate-risks-during-pregnancy/embed/#?secret=vMcoQhFYCn#?secret=mxPB2ffN8A" data-secret="mxPB2ffN8A" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In reviewing existing law and talking with community birth workers, she found that &#8220;there have been mixed messages around doulas and their access and role as part of a pregnant person&#8217;s team.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an effort to lay the groundwork for doula reimbursement through Medicaid — a critical factor that could determine whether </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">expectant mothers can access a doula — Aird&#8217;s plan is trifold. Her </span>legislation, which was signed by the governor in April and takes effect today<span style="font-weight: 400;">, creates </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> state doula certification that &#8220;codifies the rules concerning doulas, so the state [Board of Health] will recognize them,&#8221;</span> Aird said<span style="font-weight: 400;">. Secondly, the legislation establishes </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a state registry of doulas, &#8220;so that they are easily identified, and more women will have more access to their services,&#8221; she added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, Aird said the legislation will empower a workgroup of advocates and medical professionals to review standards of doula certification and reimbursement across the country, &#8220;to ensure Virginia&#8217;s best practices are in line with the best practices of states who have emerging doula reimbursement programs, such as </span><a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/03/new-yorks-medicaid-reimbursement-plan-for-doulas.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aird, with Del. Cia Price, D-</span>Newport News, pushed<span style="font-weight: 400;"> an amendment to the state budget that earmarks $365,000 to support the efforts of the </span><a href="https://virginianpc.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Neonatal Perinatal Collaborative</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a group that works to ensure Virginia mothers have &#8220;the best possible perinatal care,&#8221; and every infant in Virginia &#8220;has the best possible start to life.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aird called it a step in the right direction for Virginia, to the benefit of birth workers and families. &#8220;We are taking an active stance, and Virginia is beginning to fully embrace doulas and recognize their work, which is so important for the health and well-being of our whole community.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though Varner, Ellis and Bruno have all worked through the challenges posed by the pandemic, Bruno says there’s a silver lining to the situation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“it&#8217;s really reinforced that [doulas] are very good at innovating, and thinking fast, and changing everything that we normally do to meet the needs of our clients.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Dec. 11, the Board of Supervisors in my county, Hanover, </span><a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/local/government-politics/hanover-supervisors-ok-measure-saying-county-will-oppose-legislation-that/article_8e665d20-ebd0-518c-8279-671741e14998.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">adopted a resolution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to oppose &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">any law that would unconstitutionally restrict the rights under the Second Amendment of the citizens of Hanover County to keep and bear arms.&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">  In no uncertain terms, the majority-white, majority-male, majority-Republican leaders of the county rushed to the defense of gun rights, and a packed chamber of majority-white Hanoverians heartily agreed with the decision.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In July of this year, <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/07/08/this-is-hanover-but-it-doesnt-have-to-be/" target="_blank">the Ku Klux Klan rallied in Hanover</a>, mere feet from the historic courthouse where Patrick Henry argued his Parsons&#8217; Cause case. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The courthouse grounds — a symbolic harbinger of the American Revolution and our fledgling nation&#8217;s fierce fight for liberty — became the stomping grounds of America&#8217;s oldest racial hate group, whose reign of terror in the Jim Crow years was characterized by their deadly violence and cruelty to black Americans. I, like many Hanover County residents (especially those of color), was appalled and outraged by the KKK&#8217;s flagrant display a few miles from my home and found it unacceptable that they came here to drum up members. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We voiced our concerns on social media, in our homes and churches, and, at the July 24 Board of Supervisors meeting, looked to our leadership for a response to this troubling incident.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To say we were disappointed by the board&#8217;s reaction would be a gross understatement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chairman W. Canova Peterson initially told the Richmond Times-Dispatch that he supports &#8220;citizens of this community and country being able to express their opinion — as long as they do it peacefully.&#8221; (Later, at the meeting, <a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/local/hanover/we-have-to-speak-up-now-hanover-supervisors-met-with/article_938404a0-1d02-5813-8ebc-e96996a4f7b0.html#1" target="_blank">Peterson said</a>: “We were shocked at this unwelcome surprise visit because, let there be no mistake, we condemn the message they espouse and we do not want them here,” he said. “The KKK and other groups who preach and spew venom of hatred are not welcome in this county.”)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I prefer mustard on my hot dogs, not ketchup; that&#8217;s an opinion. A group which has lynched and burned human beings because they have a different skin color is not expressing an opinion, they are expressing pure, virulent racism. The fact that the head of my county&#8217;s leadership equated the KKK&#8217;s bigoted beliefs with an &#8220;opinion&#8221; remains sickening to me. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My mind reels when I consider that this is the same </span><a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/local/government-politics/facing-naacp-lawsuit-hanover-school-board-punts-on-confederate-school/article_5841e9cf-4c03-575f-8c43-7851700a529c.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">county currently embroiled in a lawsuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with the county NAACP, which has lobbied on behalf of thousands of black Hanoverians to change the names of two public schools which bear the monikers of Confederates whose traitorous army fought to preserve the inhumane institution of American slavery. I burn with anger when I watch these same county leaders, they who sat in stony silence in that July meeting, pass with swift and firm intention a knee-jerk resolution to oppose not-yet-written laws that may try to curb the epidemic of gun violence in this country. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My father, my husband and several members of my family who live in Hanover are responsible gun owners. Like many kids raised in rural communities, I learned early how to shoot a BB gun in the backwoods of my family’s property. I do not condemn guns when they are used in the proper context and with the highest regard to safety. But according to an </span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/10/22/facts-about-guns-in-united-states/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">October 2019 report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the Pew Research Center, “nearly 40,000 people died of gun-related violence in the United States in 2017, the </span><a href="https://www.thetrace.org/rounds/gun-death-rate-2017-increase-cdc-suicide/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">highest annual total in decades</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.” The same report, which utilizes the most recent data available, highlights </span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/10/16/share-of-americans-who-favor-stricter-gun-laws-has-increased-since-2017/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an increase in the number of Americans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who feel gun laws should be stricter, as found in a September 2019 survey.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My husband and I were college students in 2007; he was at Virginia Tech and I was enrolled at nearby Radford University. He was on campus during the tragic mass shooting on April 16 of that year. We will never forget that horror, nor the lives of 32 innocent people that were snuffed out by the gunman’s bullets. What these statistics and situations point to is a need for more measured dialogue on gun rights and gun ownership, not reactionary resolutions like the one adopted in Hanover and other localities across the state. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through their bare-minimum reaction to rampant racism in our backyard, and their rapid reaction to perceived threats to citizens’ gun rights, my county&#8217;s leaders send to me, my family and everyone who cares about racial justice and inclusivity in Hanover a clear message: “Gun rights are a far more serious issue to us than racism in the county. We&#8217;ll immediately address the former but keep quiet as church mice about the latter. Get over it.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This attitude reflects very poorly on our county, and doesn&#8217;t represent the true feelings of all Hanoverians. In Hanover County, in Virginia, in America, the Second Amendment cannot be weighed more important than the </span><a href="https://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&amp;fileName=014/llsl014.db&amp;recNum=389" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fourteenth Amendment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which promises to protect the “life, liberty and property” of all citizens, granting us “equal protections” of our civil rights and humanity. </span></p>

(NBC12)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hanover County is my home. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At least seven generations of my family were born and raised here; freedmen founded our community’s church 151 years ago. I was horrified and disgusted to witness the tail end of a small Ku Klux Klan gathering 10 minutes from my house on Saturday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Horrified and disgusted, but not surprised. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is, after all, Hanover.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of America&#8217;s most famous founding fathers, Patrick Henry, was born in Hanover County. Henry launched his career as a lawyer at Hanover Courthouse, and argued his Parson&#8217;s Cause case there; it was one of the earliest oppositions against English rule in the American colonies ahead of the Revolutionary War. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Saturday, members of the Loyal White Knights of the <a href="https://www.nbc12.com/video/2019/07/08/hanover-mother-confronts-kkk-group/" target="_blank">Ku Klux Klan from North Carolina</a> stood outside Hanover Courthouse, waving Confederate flags, wearing white robes and holding up signs that read &#8220;America for Americans.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Southern Poverty Law Center </span><a href="https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/ideology/ku-klux-klan" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">describes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the KKK as &#8220;the most infamous — and oldest — of American hate groups,&#8221; founded during Reconstruction with a long history of deadly violence against African Americans and other minorities. The Loyal White Knights who came to Hanover have established chapters in North Carolina, Florida, Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania, Texas and Virginia; though their numbers have dwindled through the years, they are not the tiny fringe movement that some of us claim them to be.</span></p>

(NBC12)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a kid, I had nightmares about the KKK after learning how they terrorized people who looked like my family and me. I learned this history from my family and church, not from my public elementary school in Hanover. Black history didn&#8217;t factor greatly into our curriculum, as I recall.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> In response to the outcry of embarrassed and enraged Hanoverians over the weekend, Board of Supervisors Chairman W. Canova Peterson offered a </span><a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/white-supremacists-in-klan-robes-hold-surprise-rally-outside-hanover/article_15e58460-1a15-5919-9e81-004d59ddbba1.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tepid statement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the Richmond Times-Dispatch, disagreeing with the group but pledging his &#8220;100% support&#8221; for citizens &#8220;being able to express their opinions — as long as they do it peacefully.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is Hanover.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Robert E. Lee, Jefferson Davis and Stonewall Jackson were southern Civil War heroes, men whose service to the secessionist, traitorous Confederacy upheld the deepest rift the country has ever endured, and firmly cemented racism and white supremacy as traditional, if unspoken, American values. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two weeks ago, the all-white, majority male </span><a href="https://www.hanovercounty.gov/427/Board-of-Supervisors" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hanover County Board of Supervisors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> voted unanimously to oust school board member Marla Coleman from her appointed position on the board after just one term, selecting George Sutton to replace her. Coleman <a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/plus/williams-hanover-school-board-member-lost-her-seat-but-won/article_9fc07fc1-8321-5785-8344-703abb8dde92.html" target="_blank">was one of only two</a> school board members who voted to change the names of Lee-Davis High and Stonewall Jackson Middle Schools in 2018.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Board of Supervisors members said their decision wasn&#8217;t tied to Coleman&#8217;s vote to change the names of public schools whose monikers reflect the county&#8217;s strong tradition of honoring white supremacists. The state of Virginia, including Hanover County, still commemorates Lee and Jackson each year as an official holiday on the Friday before Martin Luther King Jr. Day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is Hanover.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a place in Western Hanover called N*ggerfoot. I learned of it at age 9 or 10 by eavesdropping on an after-dinner discussion between my grandmother and other elders recounting past episodes of racist violence against black people in our area. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Somebody mentioned an enslaved black man who was tortured by white men in the area; according to local legend, they cut off the man&#8217;s foot as punishment for running away. This is <a href="https://www.richmond.com/archive/hinkle-would-you-ask-a-friend-to-lunch-at-negro/article_017ce54c-8508-5c07-926c-a5d2a6e7ff88.html" target="_blank">one of the origin stories</a> of the place called N*ggerfoot, whose name was cleaned up as Negro Foot on historic maps, in a 1981 United States Geological </span><a href="https://geonames.usgs.gov/apex/f?p=gnispq:3:0::NO::P3_FID:1471367" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, in a 1990 Hanover County Historic Resources </span><a href="https://www.dhr.virginia.gov/pdf_files/SpecialCollections/HN-042_Survey_Historic_Resources_Hanover_1990_LCA_report.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. I think of the agony that unnamed black man must have felt every time I drive past the area on Route 54. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is Hanover. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My father and I are both graduates of Patrick Henry High School in western Hanover. When he was a student in the late 1960s and early 1970s, his white classmates would get up from the lunch table as soon as he sat down, as if he were diseased. When I was a student, the self-proclaimed &#8220;redneck&#8221; kids wore Confederate flag T-shirts and picked fights with black kids throughout the school year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One time, I found a note on my car&#8217;s windshield in the senior parking lot, bashing my activities as president of Hanover County NAACP&#8217;s Youth Council, signed by the &#8220;KKK.&#8221; A quick investigation revealed that a white male classmate had actually written the note; we were in AP English together and I had considered him a friend. The first time I heard the racist word &#8220;pickaninny&#8221; was from the lips of a well meaning, older white lady inside Ukrops in Ashland in the 1990s. I was grocery shopping with my grandmother, and the lady thought she was complimenting me by saying I was the &#8220;cutest little pickaninny&#8221; she&#8217;d ever seen. This is Hanover.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Racism is as repugnant in Hanover as it is anywhere, but it is neither unknown nor unfamiliar here, depending on whom you ask. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Part of the public&#8217;s response to the KKK&#8217;s brazen bigotry on display in Hanover deeply troubles me. &#8220;This is not Hanover,&#8221; I&#8217;ve seen dozens of my fellow citizens post on social media; these people are mostly white. But a quick glance at our history, or a conversation with the black people who have lived here for generations shows plainly, this</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Hanover. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a reason the KKK felt comfortable and welcome here. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saying “this is not Hanover” is an affront to me, my family, and all the black Hanoverians who have endured generations of racism both conspicuous and latent. In Hanover, we can&#8217;t change our past. We can, however, change our present and build a more inclusive, progressive, equitable future. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It starts with being honest with ourselves; we cannot reconcile racism if we don&#8217;t recognize its prevalence and power here, and ignoring it will not make it go away. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is Hanover – but it doesn&#8217;t have to be. </span></p>

<p>A group of black Virginia pharmacists — barred from joining the state&#8217;s longstanding professional pharmacist association due to segregation — united their visions and resources to create the association, which functioned as a network of support and resources for minority pharmacists for 40 years.</p>
<p>The group went dormant in the 1980s, but now a new generation of pharmacists of color are relaunching the association, with revamped goals: mentoring and supporting pharmacists of all backgrounds in all stages of their careers and enhancing the quality of care they provide to patients in the commonwealth.</p>
<p>&#8220;In many southern states, black pharmacists couldn&#8217;t belong to the state pharmacy associations,&#8221; says Dr. Leonard Levi Edloe, a part time community pharmacist in Richmond and president of the <a href="https://virginianpha.org/" target="_blank">association.</a> &#8220;This didn&#8217;t happen only in Virginia.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="auto">Edloe is the son of Dr. Leonard Lacy Edloe (now deceased), a pioneering African-American pharmacist who owned and operated Harrington&#8217;s Pharmacy in Richmond for decades. Born in 1907 in Staunton and educated at Howard University, the elder Dr. Edloe cofounded the ODPhA in 1947 with African-American pharmacists from Richmond, Petersburg, Newport News, Hampton and South Hill.</p>
<p dir="auto">The association was designed as the state branch of the National Pharmaceutical Association, founded the same year by the dean of Edloe&#8217;s Alma mater, Dr. Chauncey Cooper.</p>
<p dir="auto">The ODPhA&#8217;s founders were &#8220;medical professionals simply striving to improve themselves in their calling,&#8221; says Edloe. &#8220;When they were not permitted to do that by joining the existing pharmacist association, they persevered and created an association that was inclusive and that met their needs as minority doctors of pharmacy.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="auto">It was truly a homegrown effort, says Edloe, who recalls as a teen &#8220;riding all over Virginia&#8221; with his dad to meet with ODPhA members.</p>
<p dir="auto">&#8220;Sometimes we&#8217;d meet in homes of the members,&#8221; says Edloe, &#8220;sometimes restaurants; wherever we could meet and sit down and talk openly.&#8221; They always talked about &#8220;helping people go to school, black people who were interested in pharmacy,&#8221; says Edloe.</p>
<p dir="auto">Also up for frequent debate at ODPhA&#8217;s former gatherings: the unique healthcare needs of communities of color — and how pharmacists of color could help address and navigate them. It&#8217;s a topic that the relaunched association plans to keep in the forefront of its mission.</p>
<p dir="auto">&#8220;We plan to address health disparities in the African-American community and other communities of color in the state,&#8221; says Dr. Starr Shands, a community pharmacist and Hampton University School of Pharmacy graduate based in Dinwiddie, and the ODPhA&#8217;s treasurer. In Virginia, &#8220;We&#8217;ll have events to promote awareness about health disparities and make sure it&#8217;s known that it&#8217;s a priority for our organization.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="auto">Health disparities and inequities are &#8220;rooted in the reality that socioeconomically, racially/ethnically, and geographically diverse populations do not have the same opportunities to live long, healthy lives,&#8221; the Virginia Department of Health found in its <a href="http://www.vdh.virginia.gov/content/uploads/sites/76/2016/06/Health-Equity-Report-2012.pdf" target="_blank">2012 Health Equity Report</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">&#8220;Factors such as food security, perceived neighborhood security and racism are statistically associated with poorer self-reported health among Virginians,” the report found.</p>
<p dir="auto">Additionally, &#8220;individuals and families that experience poverty, along with racial and ethnic minorities (regardless of income), are more likely to live in neighborhoods that lack various resources and opportunities to be healthy such as full-service grocery stores and safe and affordable places to be physically active, health care providers and pharmacies.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="auto">Ultimately, health disparities and inequities can be a matter of life and death. &#8220;African Americans in Virginia, on average, live three to five fewer years than whites,&#8221; the report stated.</p>
<p dir="auto">Improving the health of Virginia&#8217;s underserved patient populations and amplifying their access to quality health care is a driving force of Dr. Kalyann Kauv&#8217;s work as a clinical pharmacist with Anthem, Inc. in Virginia Beach. A 2017 graduate of Virginia Commonwealth University&#8217;s School of Pharmacy, Kauv is the ODPhA&#8217;s secretary and helped galvanize its reorganization earlier this year.</p>
<p dir="auto">Kauv joined the student branch of ODPhA&#8217;s progenitor, the <a href="http://nationalpharmaceuticalassociation.org/?fbclid=IwAR0ay2tHwunWve1MXfJDkxm4vaiAJW0UfXeyS9A_PI8ze4skSMmDWq3JGy8" target="_blank">National Pharmaceutical Association</a>, in college. A group that works &#8220;toward the improvement of the health, educational, and social environment of minority communities,&#8221; the Student National Pharmaceutical Association resonated deeply with Kauv, the daughter of Cambodian genocide refugees who fled to the United States in the 1980s.</p>
<p dir="auto">&#8220;My parents lost everything except their lives; they had to start over completely and work low-wage jobs to survive,&#8221; says Kauv, whose uncle was killed during that era, marked by the brutality of the genocidal,<a href="http://time.com/5456749/cambodia-khmer-rouge-genocide-verdict/" target="_blank"> totalitarian Khmer Rouge regime</a>. &#8220;So, I come from humble beginnings. SNPhA was the first organization I&#8217;d ever seen that specifically helps people like me, like my parents who are immigrants, and other underserved groups.</p>
<p dir="auto">Edloe, Kauv and Shands all emphasize that though it was founded by and for black pharmacists, today&#8217;s ODPhA is open to any licensed Virginia pharmacist and pharmacy students.</p>
<p dir="auto">&#8216;This chapter is going to serve as a resource, through materials and mentorship, for pharmacy students,&#8221; says Shands, &#8220;and a way for new practitioners  to connect, and for licensed pharmacists to network and collaborate with each other.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="auto">After an initial interest meeting at Howard University in February, the ODPhA&#8217;s membership rank is small but growing.</p>

</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, black women are </span><a href="http://www.vdh.virginia.gov/content/uploads/sites/18/2016/04/Pregnancy-Related-Death-in-Virginia-1999-2003.pdf" target="_blank">three times more likely to suffer a pregnancy-related death</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> than white women, reflecting a national pattern of racial disparities in maternal health outcomes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each year in America, more than 700 women die during or soon after pregnancy, according to the </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/maternalinfanthealth/pregnancy-relatedmortality.htm" target="_blank">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and the </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/maternalinfanthealth/pregnancy-mortality-surveillance-system.htm?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Freproductivehealth%2Fmaternalinfanthealth%2Fpmss.html#trends" target="_blank">ratio of maternal deaths</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> per 100,000 live births has been steadily increasing since the late 1980s.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/general-assembly-passes-legislation-ordering-review-of-maternal-mortality/" target="_blank">State lawmakers turned their attention<span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">to the problem in the last days of the General Assembly session, tasking the Virginia Department of Health with examining maternal deaths and making prevention recommendations to the governor. Meanwhile, birth workers in Richmond are raising awareness about the issues facing mothers of color, and empowering expectant moms with various means of support and advocacy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Black women are three and a half times more likely to die in childbirth; we&#8217;re working to change that,&#8221; Kenda Sutton-El told a crowd of about 100 last month in downtown Richmond at a panel event on birth equity co-presented by </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/Birthincolorrva/" target="_blank">Birth in Color RVA</a>.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The group, of which Sutton-El is a principal member, is a central Virginia network of doulas and birth workers providing &#8220;culturally-centered support to pregnant women, families, and the birth community.&#8221; The event was held in mid-February inside the airy top floor of </span><a href="https://www.wethebroad.com/about" target="_blank">The Broad</a><b>, </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">a coworking space and &#8220;social club for women and gender minorities&#8221; housed inside a historic building in the city&#8217;s arts district. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We consider ourselves a network of practitioners,&#8221; says Courtney Glenn,  a co-founder of Birth in Color RVA. &#8220;Culturally centered support is integral to the success of birth outcomes for women of color.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Glenn is a birth worker — a category that includes doulas and midwives </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><b>—</b> and an advocate who calls America&#8217;s rising maternal death rates a &#8220;public health crisis&#8221; that particularly affects black mothers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We already know black women are three to four to times more likely to die of a pregnancy- related cause than white women, right? Black women also have the highest infant mortality rate in the country,&#8221; states Glenn. African American babies are now twice as likely to die as white babies, </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/11/magazine/black-mothers-babies-death-maternal-mortality.html" target="_blank">The New York Times</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reported last year, a racial disparity wider than it was in 1850, when most American black women were enslaved. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, the mortality rate for black infants was twice that of white infants, according to a 2008<strong> </strong></span><a href="http://www.vdh.virginia.gov/HealthStats/documents/2010/pdfs/VAHE06.pdf" target="_blank">report</a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">by the state&#8217;s Office of Minority Health and Public Health Policy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The same New York Times report, sourced from government data and research entities like the Brookings Institute, found that disparities persisted for black mothers across socioeconomic markers like education or income level: the babies of black women with advanced college degrees are </span><a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/social-mobility-memos/2016/10/21/6-charts-showing-race-gaps-within-the-american-middle-class/" target="_blank">more likely to die within their first year</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> than babies born to white moms who did not complete high school. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8220;A lot of this can be attributed to substandard care and racism in the medical industry,&#8221; says Glenn. In hospitals, Glenn says, white doctors and nurses often downplay laboring black mothers&#8217; pain management requests. A 2016 University of Virginia </span><a href="https://news.virginia.edu/content/study-links-disparities-pain-management-racial-bias" target="_blank">study</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found that racial bias plays a part in how soon-to-be-doctors at the school assessed and treated patient pain. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Researchers find that a substantial number of white medical students and residents hold false beliefs about biological differences between black and white people (e.g., black people’s skin is thicker; black people’s blood coagulates more quickly) that could affect how they assess and treat the pain experienced by black patients,&#8221; reads the study. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m sort of putting some of my colleagues on blast, but it&#8217;s true — everybody doesn&#8217;t receive the same experience,&#8221; said Dr. Nicole Rankins, a Henrico obstetrician-gynecologist and hospitalist who also participated in the Birth in Color panel. Rankins said she sometimes witnesses doctors and other care providers treat laboring women unequally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8220;It can literally be from one room to the next room in the hospital, and people will have a completely different experience.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The state of birth equity in Virginia and elsewhere in the country is &#8220;terrible,&#8221; Rankins said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Birth equity to me means that every woman should have a safe and fulfilling experience giving birth,&#8221; said Rankins, &#8220;where she feels respected and supported throughout the process, from the moment she finds out she&#8217;s pregnant, until long after she&#8217;s given birth. That is not happening for all moms, especially moms of color.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/The-Diverse-Doula-Pregnancy-Services-442038129567022/" target="_blank">Nikiya Ellis</a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a doula and Birth in Color RVA co-founder, says the group formed in part because African-American birth workers felt unwelcome in existing associations in the Richmond area. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We are a network to not only support black mothers and mothers of color through our work, but to also to support black birth workers, too,&#8221; she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The panel was moderated by Cheyenne Varner, a photographer and publisher of the bi-annual </span><a href="https://www.everydaybirth.com/" target="_blank">Everyday Birth Magazine</a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Varner has been a doula for three years, a calling she says she&#8217;s felt since girlhood, when at seven years old, she became &#8220;fully fascinated and engaged&#8221; by her mother&#8217;s pregnancy with her younger sister. Varner, who is black, has assisted in 25 births across three states, and most of her clients are black women. Varner says they are increasingly seeking support while navigating a flawed medical system.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There are so many reasons to choose a birth worker, but that piece of choosing somebody who is not going to view you through their bias, who is not going to disbelieve your pain, who won&#8217;t make assumptions about you before you open your mouth — that is so important to black women who are giving birth.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elsewhere in Virginia there are other culturally-centered efforts to decrease the life-threatening risks black women face during pregnancy and childbirth. </span><a href="https://www.sisterskeeperdoulas.org/" target="_blank">Sisters Keeper Collective</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a Charlottesville-based, woman of color-led organization whose trained doulas, called birth sisters, offer &#8220;child birth education, labor support and post-partum care&#8221; to women of color. The group formed in 2014 &#8220;in response to the poor birth outcomes that disproportionately affect black women in the U.S.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Varner says her African-American clients often express anxiety during their pregnancies as a reflection of increased media scrutiny of black mothers&#8217; alarming maternal death rates. &#8220;These articles and TV news segments often don&#8217;t include enough context,&#8221; says Varner. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To combat this, in early February she released </span><a href="https://www.everydaybirth.com/lifes-work" target="_blank">Life&#8217;s Work</a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a multimedia project that acts as an immersive primer and digital resource for expectant moms. Varner shot a series of photos of pregnant women and their care providers from a &#8220;fly on the wall perspective&#8221; at Roots Community Birth Center, a black-owned birthing space in Minneapolis, Minn. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For part of the project, Varner recorded the unmistakable swish and beat of an unborn baby&#8217;s heart as a midwife held a Doppler ultrasound device to the laboring mother&#8217;s swollen belly. By recreating the pregnancy and birth experience through photos, audio and short written descriptions, Varner hopes her project informs and reassures expectant mothers. Still, she holds other healthcare professionals accountable for how mothers of color experience childbirth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Doulas can&#8217;t fill the gap entirely. &#8230; The medical system needs to make strides to serve people more comprehensively.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Until then, moms-to-be should educate themselves and remember that they have the ultimate authority over what happens to their bodies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The two biggest things that will influence your birth experience are your provider and the hospital,&#8221; said Rankins at the panel event. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Don&#8217;t think you have to stay with [a provider] if you get that feeling of, &#8216;this is not the right person for me,&#8217; or &#8216;this person doesn&#8217;t respect me or listen to me.&#8217; Advocate for yourself at all costs.&#8221;</span></p>

Public Domain via Wikimedia Commons.</p><p><em>Virginia&#8217;s political scandals reflect a troubled history and intersect racism,</em><br />
<em>gender and sexual violence — issues some of us navigate daily.</em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Journalist and professor Melissa Harris-Perry <a href="https://twitter.com/MHarrisPerry/status/1094074584691892224" target="_blank"><b>tweeted</b></a> Friday night that &#8220;observers are wringing hands over the &#8216;racist v rapist&#8217; dilemma facing [Virginia],&#8221; a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reference to the troubling trifecta of scandals embroiling Gov. Ralph Northam, Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax and Attorney General Mark Herring. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The transgressions of Northam and Herring, both white, are racist in nature. Each admitted to wearing blackface as adult men not much more than three decades ago. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Further, on Monday Northam referred to the first enslaved Africans brought to Virginia 400 years ago as &#8220;indentured servants&#8221; in a disappointing <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/virginia-governor-ralph-northam-said-racist-photo-controversy-happened-for-a-reason/" target="_blank">CBS </a> interview. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fairfax, currently the only black person elected to statewide office, is adamantly denying sexual assault allegations leveled against him by two women. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginians now find ourselves at a crossroads, a point where we must decide if we will weigh racist behavior as strongly as alleged sexual violence in determining how we hold our leaders — and ourselves — accountable. For Virginians like me – those of us who are black, female and disgusted by both racism and rape  — this is an uncomfortable position to be in but not at all an unfamiliar one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8220;Welcome,&#8221; Harris-Perry, a biracial black woman, ended her tweet, &#8220;to the intersection where black women live.&#8221;</span></p>
<h2><strong>No surprise</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the crux of the slow-motion implosion of Virginia&#8217;s political leadership are the admissions by Northam and Herring that they both donned blackface in the 1980s to portray African American musical artists. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If there is, somehow, still confusion about what blackface is and why it is abhorrent, the National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, D.C.,  </span><a href="https://nmaahc.si.edu/blog-post/blackface-birth-american-stereotype" target="_blank"><b>explains</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that blackface was an essential element of minstrel shows, an American stage entertainment tradition dating to the 1830s. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;White performers with blackened faces &#8230; and tattered clothing &#8230; imitated and mimicked enslaved Africans on Southern plantations.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blackface performances &#8220;characterized blacks as lazy, ignorant, superstitious, hypersexual, and prone to thievery and cowardice,&#8221; the museum says. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Blackface is repugnant, a disfigurement of black peoples&#8217; image and a disrespect to our identity. There is nothing excusable or minor about the blatant racism blackface represents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My ire is not limited to Northam and Herring, elected officials I voted for, participating in the racist tradition of blackface. I am no longer surprised when white people in Virginia wear blackface. White people, after all, created blackface and, as the dominant social class throughout America&#8217;s history, they molded it into one of the nation&#8217;s most treasured pastimes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">American </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/yes-politicians-wore-blackface-it-used-to-be-all-american-fun/2019/02/08/821b268c-2b0d-11e9-b011-d8500644dc98_story.html?utm_term=.fbba8762c5ba" target="_blank"><b>presidents applauded</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> blackface.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blackface is an almost two-century-old tradition that continues today not through minstrel shows, but through Halloween costumes. </span><a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/02/11/about-a-third-of-americans-say-blackface-in-a-halloween-costume-is-acceptable-at-least-sometimes/" target="_blank"><b>A third of Americans think this is acceptable</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, according to the Pew Research Center. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Northam continued the ugly tradition with an imitation of pop icon Michael Jackson to win a dance contest (was it Northam&#8217;s costume — replete with a glove and &#8220;a little bit of shoe polish&#8221; daubed on his cheeks — that clenched the contest for him, or <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/02/02/in-his-own-words-northam-describes-moonwalking-in-blackface-denies-appearing-in-kkk-photo/" target="_blank">was it his moonwalking?</a>).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The same goes for Attorney General Mark Herring, who admitted wearing a </span><a href="https://twitter.com/MarkHerringVA/status/1093187229533519872" target="_blank"><b>&#8220;wig and brown makeup&#8221;</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to college parties to imitate hip hop pioneer Kurtis Blow. That these white men in particular are elected political leaders only serves to make their lack of self-awareness, insight and cultural competency all the more alarming.</span></p>
<h2><strong>A mess of his own making</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Northam has lost my trust and respect; not only because he made a mistake 35 years ago by wearing blackface. Many people in historic and </span><a href="https://richmondmagazine.com/arts-entertainment/why-is-blackface-back-again/" target="_blank"><b>contemporary</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Virginia have worn blackface, and all people have made mistakes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My main problem is the way Northam has responded to this mess of his own making.</span></p>

Ralph Northam denied appearing in a KKK yearbook photo but admitted to moonwalking in blackface. (Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Herring&#8217;s handling of his blackface blunder was the opposite of Northam&#8217;s ham-handed approach. Herring not only took responsibility for his actions, he seemed to remove his desires from the equation instead of clawing to keep his position.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In the days ahead, honest conversations and discussions will make it clear whether I can or should continue to serve as attorney general,&#8221; Herring wrote in a statement apologizing for his conduct.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> He sounds like a man who wants to move forward by acting in the best interest of the people he serves. He sounds ready to listen and learn.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are two men wearing heinous &#8220;costumes&#8221; on Northam&#8217;s yearbook page, one in blackface and one in a KKK robe.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_5911" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:300px;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-5911" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image2-300x199.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="199" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image2-300x199.jpeg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image2-632x420.jpeg 632w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image2.jpeg 677w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  The page from Gov. Ralph Northam&#8217;s medical school yearbook that has ignited widespread calls for his resignation.</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Northam initially issued an apology for appearing in the photo — an apology that seemed as sincere as his most recent apology on CBS. But then, he recanted. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s not him in the photo on his yearbook page and he has no clue how it got there, he says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Even if I believed that, which I don&#8217;t, the governor&#8217;s staunch refusal to resign means he is willing to keep dragging Virginia through the mud with him.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Stop talking, start listening</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Northam has resisted calls from every corner of the country to step down, instead branding himself Monday as a &#8220;healer&#8221; who is somehow the best equipped to lead the state in becoming a more equitable place for all of us. To prove this, Northam said, among other things, that he had started reading &#8220;Roots.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the plethora of historic resources available to all of us in Virginia&#8217;s public libraries, despite the many historians a call or email away at our many universities, despite even Google, our governor cited &#8220;Roots&#8221; as a newfound aid to his understanding of slavery, racism and how they connects directly to blackface.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That is inconceivable to me. I can&#8217;t take that seriously. I am an inheritor of the legacy of slavery and racism. The daily discrimination my forebears endured deserves Northam&#8217;s deeper study. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those </span><a href="https://historicjamestowne.org/history/the-first-africans/" target="_blank"><b>20-odd enslaved Angolans</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> brought here in an English pirate ship in 1619 deserve more than his mischaracterizations. If Northam minimizes slavery, how in the world can I not expect him to minimize the legacy of slavery, present at this very moment in the state he leads and in the lives of black Virginians? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I want our governor to stop talking, start listening, and, in the words of comedian Martin Lawrence, get to stepping. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Library of Virginia is about four blocks west of the Executive Mansion where Northam resides, a little ways down East Broad Street. He should walk down to the library and lose himself for an hour or two among the narratives of black people </span><a href="http://www.virginiamemory.com/collections/aan/" target="_blank"><b>enslaved in Virginia from its start</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> until the Civil War. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if he doesn&#8217;t hit the stacks, Northam must make a much more serious effort than he&#8217;s shown to add proper, credible historical context to his study of Virginia&#8217;s deeply racist history. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And I still believe he should resign.</span></p>
<p>Northam&#8217;s actions concerning at least two issues with direct implications for black Virginians and our history do not inspire confidence in his ability to govern us.</p>
<p>I am one of hundreds of people who asked the governor to explain his silence and sidestepping in regards to a Buckingham County compressor station Dominion Energy plans to build in the historic African-American community of Union Hill as part of its Atlantic Coast Pipeline. When Northam took action on Union Hill, he did it by suddenly axing two members of the State Air Pollution Control Board as the board weighed granting a permit for the project, currently considered one of the foremost environmental justice issues in Virginia.</p>
<p>The governor&#8217;s actions spoke loud and clear to me: &#8220;I am not concerned about historic black communities.&#8221;</p>
<p>On the campaign trail, Northam called for the removal of Confederate monuments from public spaces in Virginia.</p>
<p>“I believe these statues should be taken down and moved into museums. As governor, I am going to be a vocal advocate for that approach and work with localities on this issue,” Northam said in August 2017 after the deadly Unite the Right white supremacist rally in Charlottesville.</p>
<p>That stance was one reason he got my vote, as I fully feel these monuments — likenesses of men who fought for the traitorous Confederate army in a war caused by slavery — should never occupy public places.</p>
<p>But after he was sworn in, Northam went mute on the monuments, and gave a puzzling response when asked about them after his blackface scandal began.</p>
<p>“If there are statues, if there are monuments out there that provoke this type of hatred and bigotry,&#8221; he told the Washington Post, &#8220;they need to be in museums.”</p>
<p>&#8220;If?&#8221; How Northam fixed his mouth to even say this, a statement which seems to call into question the existence of the very real, very racist Confederate monuments that he himself said should be moved to museums less than two years ago is beyond me.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s either being insincere, or he doesn&#8217;t understand the gravity of what the monuments represent.</p>
<p>Or both.</p>
<p>Either scenario exemplifies his inability to lead black Virginians or head up a statewide examination of racial history.</p>
<h2><strong>Fairfax should resign also</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Northam and Herring&#8217;s admitted transgressions are moral; the allegations against Fairfax are criminal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a bitter irony within this dynamic that is not lost on me. In the end, the two white men may very well retain their authority, while the lone black man stands to lose his.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Black people in this country and state have already lost so much. But Fairfax should indeed lose his position, should even a shred of what <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/vanessa-tyson%27s-statement/cead9a33-ce09-4f11-a1c2-aa4f95a648e0_note.html?utm_term=.21f90e7e61d0" target="_blank">Vanessa Tyson, who claims Fairfax forced her to perform oral sex,</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/08/us/politics/meredith-watson-justin-fairfax.html?module=inline" target="_blank">Meredith Watson, who alleges that Fairfax raped her in college,</a> say he did to them is proven. I am the daughter of a black man, my husband is a black man, and I am raising two rambunctious little boys who will one day become black men.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I love black men, but I am unwilling to excuse or defend the horrifying things Fairfax is accused of doing simply because he is a black man. I am unwilling to excuse or defend sexual violence by any man. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One in six American women &#8220;has been the victim of an attempted or completed rape in her lifetime,&#8221; reports RAINN (Rape, Abuse &amp; Incest National Network). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enslaved women had no agency over their bodies, and were frequent victims of rape; today, 21.2 percent of black American women will be raped in their lifetime, </span><a href="https://iwpr.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/The-Status-of-Black-Women-6.26.17.pdf" target="_blank"><b>a 2017 report</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the The Institute for Women’s Policy Research states. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fairfax deserves due process, like any American. And I hope he is innocent, as he continues to say he is. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In my heart, however, I believe these women. It would be in all of our best interests, but especially Tyson’s and Watson&#8217;s, if Fairfax would resign and participate in a thorough investigation.</span></p>
<h2><strong>The ghosts of old Virginia</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In all of this turmoil, I wish that racism and racist actions — especially when enacted by elected officials — were met with the same level of intolerance we exercise against sexual violence. Racism, as our history has proven and as my people have experienced, is also a form of violence. </span></p>
<p>From 1940 to 1997, Virginia&#8217;s official state song was bCarry Me Back to Old<br />
Virginia,&#8221; a syrupy ballad written in 1878 by a New York-born, pioneering<br />
Black composer named James A. Bland. White minstrel show star and soft<br />
shoe dancer George Primrose introduced Bland’s song to the world.</p>
<p>Primrose performed Bland&#8217;s ode to the commonwealth in blackface, embodying a<br />
formerly enslaved “old darkey” pining for the past. The composition, whose<br />
lyrics horrify no matter how sweetly sung, remains Virginia&#8217;s state song<br />
emeritus.</p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There&#8217;s where I labored so hard for old massa,</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Day after day in the field of yellow corn,</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />

</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Than old Virginia, the state where I was born.&#8221;</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ghosts of &#8220;Old Virginia&#8221; have come calling; how will a new Virginia answer?</span></p>

(Photo by Julia Rendleman)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the 2019 session of Virginia&#8217;s General Assembly ramps into full gear, state lawmakers are considering a handful of bills that would add at least 10 historic African-American cemeteries to the roster of black burial grounds eligible to receive maintenance funds from the state. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new bills follow </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?171+sum+HB1547" target="_blank"><b>legislation passed in 2017</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and expanded in 2018, which marked the first time the state dedicated dollars to the preservation and maintenance of historic black cemeteries.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+sum+SB1128" target="_blank"><b>SB 1128</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, introduced by Sen. Mamie E. Locke, D-Hampton, would make over 500 graves in three different cemeteries eligible to receive state funds for their ongoing upkeep. The proposed cemeteries are Bassette&#8217;s Cemetery, Elmerton Cemetery and the Tucker Family Cemetery, all in the city of Hampton, part of Locke&#8217;s district, which also includes portions of Newport News, Portsmouth City and York County. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These cemeteries are the final resting places of some of the Tidewater region&#8217;s most notable black leaders, such as late 19th-century educator and lawyer Andrew W.E. Bassette. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bassette, who may have been enslaved at his birth in 1857, &#8220;likely served as assistant commonwealth&#8217;s attorney for [Elizabeth City County] early in the 1890s,&#8221; according to the Library of Virginia&#8217;s </span><a href="https://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Bassette_Andrew_W_E_1857-1942#contrib" target="_blank"><b>Dictionary of Virginia Biography</b></a>;<b> </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">he is buried in Bassette Cemetery in Hampton. The bill was first referred to the Senate&#8217;s Committee on General Laws and Technology, where it passed 14-0 last week. It now sits in the Senate&#8217;s Finance Committee.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+sum+HB1973" target="_blank"><b>HB 1973</b></a><b> </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">by</span><b> </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Chris Hurst, D-Montgomery, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">would make state funds available for the preservation of two cemeteries in Pulaski County: New River Cemetery and the West Dublin Cemetery, which contain a combined total of 77 graves eligible for Department of Historic Resources dollars. Like the other cemeteries which stand to benefit from the legislation, the remains of people who were likely enslaved lie in these southwest Virginia graveyards. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Belle Banks died at age 100 in November 1919; her </span><a href="https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/141992590/belle-banks" target="_blank"><b>death certificate</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> lists sparse details about her, but does affirm that Banks, a &#8220;negro&#8221; woman of &#8220;extreme old age&#8221; at her death, is buried inside West Dublin Cemetery. Hurst&#8217;s bill has been assigned to a subcommittee in the House of Delegates Committee on Agriculture, Chesapeake and Natural Resources alongside </span><a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+sum+HB2311" target="_blank"><b>HB 2311</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Del. Cliff Hayes, D-Chesapeake, recommends that 1,315 graves in Suffolk&#8217;s Oak Lawn Cemetery become eligible for state funds; </span><a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+sum+HB2406" target="_blank"><b>HB 2406</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Del. Les Adams, R-Pittsylvania, calls for four historic burial grounds in Martinsville to gain funding eligibility.</span></p>
<h2><b>The background:</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These bills seek to amend a law first introduced in the 2017 General Assembly session by Del. Delores McQuinn, D-Richmond, and signed into law by former Gov. Terry McAuliffe in March of that year. The law directs $5 per grave — &#8220;the average actual cost of routine maintenance&#8221; — to the care of graves entombing &#8220;African Americans who lived at any time between 1800 and 1900&#8221; and are buried inside historic black cemeteries. When this bill was presented, it named East End Cemetery and Evergreen Cemetery in the Richmond area as the intended recipients of the funds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Initially, the legislation required the cemeteries to be under the purview of &#8220;qualified charitable organizations,&#8221; defined as a government entity or 501c3 nonprofit organization. This stipulation raised concerns about oversight and transparency for some longtime volunteers who had worked to maintain Evergreen and East End, which suffered decades of neglect without the benefit of state maintenance funds — funds the state has put up for </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title10.1/chapter22/section10.1-2211/" target="_blank"><b>care of Confederate veterans&#8217; grave sites</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in every corner of the commonwealth for more than 50 years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As Evergreen and East End cemeteries — and their present condition — show, African-American history has been dismissed for years in this state,” McQuinn said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Family members of the deceased also weighed in. Pioneering 19th century Richmond journalist and newspaper editor John Mitchell Jr. was laid to rest at Evergreen. Mitchell&#8217;s nephew John Mitchell </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/09/10/obligated-to-do-whats-right-state-money-helping-maintain-more-historic-african-american-cemeteries/" target="_blank"><b>said last September</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></a>that <span style="font-weight: 400;">organizations that own black cemeteries newly eligible for state funding should “work directly [toward] the collective vision of the descendants of the people who have been buried there and their communities.” To ensure this vision is realized, Evergreen&#8217;s owner the Enrichmond Foundation formed an advisory board of descendants, volunteers and community members. </span></p>
<p>On Monday at Enrichmond&#8217;s Martin Luther King Jr. Day of Service clean-up event, the organization announced Evergreen had been placed under a conservation easement in partnership with the Virginia Outdoors Foundation, barring future development on the site.</p>
<h2><strong>Unearthing dual legacies</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a landmark year for two of Virginia&#8217;s most significant, lasting legacies. Nearly 400 years ago,<a href="https://historicjamestowne.org/history/the-first-general-assembly/" target="_blank"> 22 members of the inaugural General Assembly convened Virginia&#8217;s first legislative body in a just-built Jamestown church&#8217;s choir</a>. That body, chosen in 1619 by &#8220;the free, white male inhabitants of every town, corporation, and large plantation throughout the colony&#8221; remains the &#8220;oldest continuous law-making body in the Western hemisphere,&#8221; asserts the </span>Jamestown Rediscovery Foundation<span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Concurrently, the state will in 2019 mark 400 years since the arrival of the first enslaved Africans to its shores. These black people were most likely owned by the white men who comprised that inaugural legislative body. Mere weeks after presiding over the General Assembly session now widely considered the harbinger of American democracy, Gov. Sir George Yeardly </span><a href="https://historicjamestowne.org/history/george-yeardley/" target="_blank"><b>&#8220;purchased several&#8221;</b></a><b> </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">of the enslaved Africans, who then lived and worked at his plantation.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first black Virginians were not permitted their liberty, much less the right to participate in the state&#8217;s newborn representative government. The history of black Virginians — aspects of which could be unearthed, preserved and elevated by the bills that propose state funding for 19</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> century African American cemeteries across the commonwealth — is inextricably bound up in Virginia&#8217;s conflicted origin story, and therefore, in America&#8217;s.</span></p>

(Image courtesy of Terence Penister https://www.terencepenister.com/ ) </p><p>Agriculture is the largest private industry in Virginia, making a $70 billion economic impact annually, <a href="http://www.vdacs.virginia.gov/markets-and-finance-agriculture-facts-and-figures.shtml" target="_blank"><strong>according to</strong></a> the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services.</p>
<p>There are more than 44,000 farmers in the commonwealth and the top crops include soybeans, corn and tobacco.</p>
<p>Of those Virginia farmers, 1,865 are African American — about 4 percent.</p>
<p>In 1920, census records show there were 233,222 black farmers who owned and operated 16 million acres of land in the United States, with 31,000 of them in Virginia. The most recent data available reports that 24,672 black farmers nationwide own and work just over two million acres of American farmland.</p>
<p>Coaxing crops from bare earth requires skill, extremely hard work and no small amount of luck for any farmer.</p>
<p>Some of Virginia&#8217;s black farmers, though, say they have an especially tough row to hoe, from a legacy of discriminatory lending and the loss of family-held farmland to difficulty encouraging a new generation to take up the lifestyle.</p>
<h3><strong>&#8216;Black farmers were denied over and over&#8217;</strong></h3>
<p><a href="http://www.johnboydjr.com/index.htm" target="_blank"><strong>John Boyd Jr.,</strong></a> a fourth-generation Baskerville, Va., farmer, has advocated for the rights and interests of African-American farmers for nearly 30 years.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every day, while I was shaving, I&#8217;d look in the mirror and say, &#8216;Today I&#8217;m going to defeat the United States Department of Agriculture,&#8221; Boyd Jr. thundered, his eyes piercing the crowd of about 100 people gathered on Virginia Union University&#8217;s campus at the Faith, Food and Farming Summit, held in Richmond in mid-November.</p>
<p>In the fiery oratorical style of a Baptist preacher, Boyd referred to his work championing a landmark class-action lawsuit in 1999, initiated by thousands of African-American farmers who sued the USDA for longstanding systemic discrimination and unfair lending practices.</p>
<p>The <strong><a href="https://www.usda.gov/non-discrimination-statement" target="_blank">agency maintains</a> </strong>that federal civil rights law prohibits the agency from discriminating “based on race, color, national origin, religion, sex, gender identity” among other characteristics.</p>
<p>Boyd Jr. and the African-American farmers he represents beg to differ.</p>
<p>&#8220;Farmers need land, but they need resources,&#8221; Boyd Jr. said in an interview after his speech in Richmond. In the late 1980s, Boyd Jr. applied for a USDA loan to help keep his farm operating. The USDA’s farm loan programs are intended to help farmers &#8220;start, improve, expand, transition, market and strengthen family farming and ranching operations,” <strong><a href="https://www.fsa.usda.gov/programs-and-services/farm-loan-programs/index" target="_blank">according to its website</a></strong>.</p>
<p>During the 2018 federal fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30, <a href="https://www.fsa.usda.gov/Assets/USDA-FSA-Public/usdafiles/Farm-Loan-Programs/pdfs/program-data/Loan_Applications_Received_By_State_FY2018.pdf" target="_blank">508 Virginia farmers applied for USDA farm loans and 358 were approved.</a> Boyd, however, was denied repeatedly when he applied for USDA loans over the span of several years from the late 1980s to the early 1990s.</p>
<p>Other black farmers he knew experienced the same situation, he said.</p>
<p>“We saw that it was the same thing over and over, white farmers could get loans to start or expand their farms, but black farmers were denied over and over.”</p>
<p>Boyd Jr. and other black farmers met with then-U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Daniel Glickman and President Bill Clinton about their concerns. More than 22,000 black farmers filed suit in 1997. The USDA later <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-farmers-pigford-idUSTRE61H5XD20100218" target="_blank">agreed to a settlement</a> and awarded each farmer in the suit $50,000.</p>
<p>“But then they said the funds would only be awarded to farmers originally named in the suit,” Boyd said, leaving thousands of farmers who said they’d suffered discrimination, but hadn’t learned of the lawsuit in time, without recourse.</p>
<p>For the next 10 years, Boyd Jr. advocated tirelessly for the government to address and correct the obstacles black farmers faced.</p>
<p>In 2008, Congress approved new legislation that amended the Farm Bill and allowed 800 black farmers to have their discrimination claims heard and redressed.</p>
<p>In 2009, President Barack Obama proposed <strong><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/02/18/AR2010021805893.html" target="_blank">a $1.5 billion settlement for 70,000 more black farmers</a> </strong>who said their farms and livelihoods had suffered because of USDA discrimination. Payouts to farmers, however, hit a brick wall, and most haven’t seen a dime of the settlement money, said Boyd. Jr.</p>
<p>“We have to keep the pressure on for the government to make this right,” he said.</p>
<p>Boyd also faults big banks for failing to lend to African-American farmers.</p>
<p>&#8220;We just don&#8217;t have the real access to credit that we need. A tract of land comes up in our community and we want to buy it, we can&#8217;t get credit. And it&#8217;s not just black farmers they’re doing this to, it’s black people, period,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>People of color continue to encounter discriminatory lending practices from loan officers at leading banks nationwide, according to the Center for Investigative Reporting.</p>
<p>The study analyzed millions of 2016 Census Bureau and Home Mortgage Disclosure Act records in 61 cities nationwide. It found that in <strong><a href="https://apps.revealnews.org/redlining/?design=cir&amp;race_ethn=black&amp;metro_area=47260" target="_blank">Virginia Beach, Norfolk and Newport News</a></strong>, for example, “black applicants were 2.4 times as likely to be denied a conventional home mortgage as white applicants.”</p>
<h3><strong>Losing the land</strong></h3>
<p>Land ownership and retention is also a barrier for the sustained success and family wealth building of modern black farmers.</p>
<p>Fleeing frequent threats of violence and lynching that pervaded the Jim Crow era, an estimated six million blacks left the South – and their farmland – behind during the <strong><a href="https://www.census.gov/dataviz/visualizations/020/" target="_blank">Great Migration</a></strong>, pursuing opportunities for higher-paying jobs and an improved quality of life in northern cities.</p>
<p>&#8220;They left their land behind that was then claimed and bought up by white people. So now, we see younger, white farmers returning to their family&#8217;s farmland, taking up the reins,&#8221; said Chris Newman, who left an office job in Washington, D.C., to co-found <a href="https://www.sylvanaqua.com/" target="_blank">Sylvanaqua Farms</a> on rented land in Montross in 2013. &#8220;Many young black farmers don&#8217;t have that opportunity, because their families no longer own their land.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another threat to black farmers’ land ownership is partition sales, enabled when a parcel of land is passed down through a family and split up among several heirs.</p>
<p>Historically, African-American farmers and landowners in the South enacted this “heir property” system without leaving a legal will in place.</p>
<p>“Access to capital and competent legal counsel were problematic and there was often distrust within the African-American community regarding the dominant legal and lending institutions,” the USDA’s Rural Business-Cooperative Service reported in a <strong><a href="http://www.thefederalregister.com/2008/12/05/E8-28805.html" target="_blank">2008 notice</a></strong> about mitigating heir property issues in rural black communities.</p>
<p>As ownership of the land is split again and again between numerous heirs, families risk losing it to tax defaults and unscrupulous property speculators.</p>
<p>Further, partition sale laws in Virginia and all other states allow any of the heir owners, “no matter how small their share and how recently they acquired it, to ask a court to sell the entire property at auction against the will of all of the remaining owners,” explains the <strong><a href="http://southerncoalition.org/hprc/?q=node/3" target="_blank">Heirs&#8217; Property Retention Coalition</a>, </strong>an organization whose legal advocacy work is centered on land loss, particularly among African Americans in the Southeast.</p>
<p>When black farmers can’t get loans to buy or keep their land, they lose it to foreclosure, Boyd Jr. said.</p>
<p>“We’ve got mules, but what happened to our 40 acres?”</p>
<p>The Virginia Farm Bureau did not respond to requests for comment for this article. The USDA <a href="https://www.fsa.usda.gov/programs-and-services/farm-loan-programs/minority-and-women-farmers-and-ranchers/index" target="_blank">says</a> it &#8220;targets a portion of all guaranteed loan funds, direct operating and direct farm ownership loan funds, microloan funding and youth loans, to historically underserved farmers and ranchers,&#8221; including African-American farmers and other groups.</p>
<h3><strong>A dubious legacy                                                    </strong></h3>
<p>Black farmers in Virginia face challenges that others don&#8217;t, predicated on a complex history.</p>
<p>Nearly 400 years ago, the first Africans arrived in Virginia, debarking at Point Comfort in Hampton from an English pirate ship called the White Lion; the captain traded his human cargo for food.</p>
<p>For the next 200 years, a brutal system of slavery forced black men, women and children to labor without compensation for the economic and social benefit of their white owners, much of that labor agricultural.</p>
<p>&#8220;Agricultural slaves mostly cultivated tobacco and wheat&#8221; on small farms in Virginia’s earliest days, <a href="https://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Colonial_Virginia#contrib" target="_blank"><strong>writes Encyclopedia of Virginia</strong></a> editor Brendan Wolf.</p>
<p>For generations to come, enslaved black men, women and children laboring under the threat of the lash grew and harvested untold millions of pounds of tobacco, a hard-to-raise, easy-to-kill crop requiring lots of land and constant care.</p>
<p>After the Civil War ended slavery, wealthy Southern planters — those whose plantations and crops hadn&#8217;t been decimated by the war — needed a new system of cheap labor to work their fields.</p>
<p>Sharecropping was born, wherein blacks, now free but lacking even the most basic rights of citizenship, lived and worked on the land of men who might have previously owned them or their family members.</p>
<p>Sharecropping provided Virginia freedmen and their families with shelter and allowed black men to live as independent heads of their households. Largely, however, it disadvantaged and disenfranchised black workers, who were bogged down in debt to the landowners who advanced them seeds and tools each year.</p>
<p>&#8220;In reality, [sharecropping] more often worked to the benefit the landowner,&#8221; The Virginia Museum of History &amp; Culture <a href="https://www.virginiahistory.org/collections-and-resources/virginia-history-explorer/rural-life-virginia" target="_blank"><strong>says</strong></a>. &#8220;Sometimes sharecroppers were cheated out of wages and disputes were almost always decided in the landowner&#8217;s favor. And the accumulation of debt made the sharecropper&#8217;s nominal control over his family meaningless.&#8221;</p>
<p>These enslaved workers and sharecroppers were the forebears of some black farmers living in today&#8217;s Virginia.</p>
<p>And the inextricable tie between slavery and agriculture prevents many would-be black farmers from ever planting a seed, some African-American farmers say.</p>
<p>Renard “Azibo” Turner owns a 94-acre farm in Charlottesville where he raises myotonic “fainting” goats for meat. In food justice activist and author Natasha Bowen&#8217;s <a href="http://thecolorofood.com/buy-the-book-the-color-of-food/?" target="_blank"><strong>&#8220;The Color of Food,&#8221;</strong></a> a book of narratives by American farmers of color, Turner puts it plainly.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s an uphill battle to find people of color that have an interest in farming. I think it gets back to what I call the &#8216;anti-agricultural Blacklash&#8217; where black folks are still equating farming with slavery. But nothing could be further from the truth. Yes, it is hard work, but at least we are doing for self.&#8221;</p>
<p>Newman finds considerable irony in his rented farmland, which is part of the 1900-acre Stratford Hall plantation that dates to Colonial times.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m literally farming on <a href="https://www.stratfordhall.org/" target="_blank">Robert E. Lee&#8217;s plantation.</a> The amount of crap I get from my own family, wow,&#8221; he laughed. &#8220;They joke with me, but there&#8217;s a kernel of truth. The whole imperative for a lot of our families was to get off the farm. &#8230; Even my own family, my mother grew up on a farm with her brothers. The biggest imperative that my grandfather and grandmother had was to send their kids off to college so they could get off the farm. This was despite the fact that my grandfather was a fairly successful farmer.&#8221;</p>
<p>Additionally, farmers of color face a lack of access to newer, popular agricultural opportunities, he says.</p>
<p>&#8220;The clean food and farm-to-table movements, even though many of the folks leading them claim to be progressive, are still comprised largely of privileged white people, who are more than likely to work with people who look like them,&#8221; Newman said.</p>
<h3><strong>New ground</strong></h3>
<p>What&#8217;s the state of black farming in Virginia?</p>
<p>“We’re in trouble,” Boyd Jr. said simply.</p>
<p>None of his four children wanted to be a farmer, said Boyd Jr., because they witnessed the challenges he faced.</p>
<p>“The next generation of farmers … where are they? For example, my son Wes is 26 years old. He had never been in a tractor until this television show challenged him to see if he wanted to be a farmer,” said Boyd, referring to a forthcoming <strong><a href="https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/history-american-farmer-1202687762/" target="_blank">History docuseries</a></strong> depicting the daily joys and struggles of eight American farmers, including Boyd Jr.</p>
<p>Future black farmers are out there, but they need encouragement, support and resources, some say.</p>
<p>“Farming has changed, and I wish many of us younger folks knew that,” said the Rev. James Banks at the VUU farming summit.</p>
<p>Banks is a fourth-generation farmer from Southampton County as well as a student at VUU’s Samuel DeWitt Proctor School of Divinity. Citing tractor systems piloted by satellites in orbit and other agricultural innovations, Banks said “technology has changed everything.”</p>
<p>Boyd said one of the foremost missions of the National Black Farmers Association is introducing young people to the farming lifestyle. Students get their hands dirty and a close up view of raising crops through the organization’s internship program. In partnership with the Chrysler Foundation, the NBFA gives scholarships to 20 historically black college and university students studying agriculture each year.</p>
<p>“Our goal is to support our youth, because they are the ones who will be growing our food and supporting our agriculture sooner than we think,” said Boyd.</p>
<p>Efforts to create and support urban and rooftop farmers, and to assist African-American communities in correcting food insecurity, food justice and healthy food access issues, are emerging statewide.</p>
<p>Arthur Burton is executive director of <strong><a href="https://kinfolkcommunity.org/" target="_blank">Kinfolk Community Empowerment Center</a></strong> in Richmond and principal project manager of the Food Justice Corridor, a collaborative project that “uses urban agriculture as a community engagement tool to address health and economic inequality,” said Burton.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/plus/williams-richmond-s-growth-is-not-sustainable-unless-we-cultivate/article_8dde7a0a-675d-566e-98a2-e04d09a3449a.html" target="_blank">Economic disparities in Richmond</a></strong> mean some parts of the city — the ones most often inhabited by poor, black residents — lack access to fresh food, even as numerous grocery stores offering organic fruits and vegetables continue springing up in more affluent, whiter parts of the region.</p>
<p>Poor food options lead to poor health outcomes, said Burton, who added that his organization and several others around the city are working directly with residents to reframe this reality.</p>
<p>“We’re developing an urban farm continuum, which right now has seven sites. We’re developing an urban farm ministry program, to train churches on how to get involved in urban farming and how to deliver health-equity messaging.”</p>
<p>Burton said his group has also begun working with the NBFA’s <strong><a href="http://www.nationalblackfarmersassociation.org/projects" target="_blank">Let’s Get Growing</a></strong> initiative. Through the program’s hands-on workshops, Burton said they aim to train 10 black churches in central Virginia in farming and gardening techniques that they may share with their members.</p>
<p>“We are hoping this will impart the importance of farming and urban agriculture to our youth,” said Burton. “We want to be a national model for this type of work and community empowerment.”</p>
<p>“You don’t need 100 acres to farm, you don’t even have to call yourself a farmer,” Boyd said before he left VUU’s campus, a camera crew trailing his brisk steps. “Start where you are: Plant a garden in your backyard, join a farming cooperative, research grants and resources for your farm or for your community. And if you you’ve never had a connection to the soil, build that connection now. It’s important.”</p>
<p>He offered the best advice he could to other black farmers in Virginia facing challenges.</p>
<p>“Keep on working, and keep your hand in God’s hand. Don’t you ever, ever, ever give up.”</p>

Paul Wilson, pastor of Union Hill and Union Grove Baptist churches in Buckingham, speaks at a rally ahead of the State Air Pollution Control Board meeting last year on a crucial permit for a compressor station for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline. (Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>Dozens of detractors and supporters had their say Thursday about a natural gas compressor station Dominion Energy plans to build in Buckingham County as part of its controversial Atlantic Coast Pipeline project, as the State Air Pollution Control Board met to review a proposed permit for the facility.</p>
<p>If the board approves the permit on Friday, the Buckingham compressor station will be one of three such facilities stationed along the 600-mile ACP, and, depending on whom you ask, either a boon or wound to Buckingham.</p>
<p>More than 200 people were at the Greater Richmond Convention Center by 9:30 a.m. Thursday, the first of two days of meetings on the permit, with the board expected to render a decision today.</p>
<p>Virginia State Police officers lined the walls as the Virginia&#8217;s Department of Environmental Quality, which is recommending that the air board approve the permit, presented an outline of the compressor project and a summary of public comments on the facility, totaling some 5,300 written responses and nearly 200 comments shared by attendees of a public meeting on the project.</p>
<p>The board asked elected officials to speak first, followed by members of the public who had pre-registered to make a three-minute comment at the meeting.</p>
<p>Remarks from several elected officials touted the ACP and the compressor station as necessary and safe, contending that the projects would initiate progress within their communities.</p>
<p>&#8220;I fully support the ACP as well as the compressor station, primarily because of the economic development it will bring to our district,&#8221; said state Sen. Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, adding that the &#8220;stringent regulations&#8221; the permit requires bolster her confidence in the facility&#8217;s safety for the Buckingham community.</p>
<p>A spur that is part of the pipeline project will run from Pleasant Hill, N.C., near the Virginia border, to Chesapeake.</p>
<p>Lucas, whose <a href="https://www.vpap.org/candidates/34/top_donors/" target="_blank">top campaign donor is Dominion</a>, says she has not heard or read opposition about the project from any of her district&#8217;s residents.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stringent&#8221; was the word of the day, often repeated by other speakers in favor of the compressor station.</p>
<p>Some of those supporters, who represented a range of businesses and organizations — including a family-owned mining company based in Buckingham, the Metropolitan Business League and the Northern Virginia Tea Party — pointed to the emissions standards for the facility outlined in the draft permit as cause for confidence. Several referred to the DEQ&#8217;s earlier public presentation, which explained that the Buckingham compressor station and its air permit would be classified as &#8220;minor,&#8221; in accordance with DEQ regulations.</p>
<p>&#8220;Facilities are determined to be major or minor based on their potential to emit air pollutants,&#8221; a slide of the presentation reads. &#8220;Major sources generally emit over 100 to 250 tons per year (tpy) of a single criteria pollutant,&#8221; making the Buckingham compressor station&#8217;s maximum emissions — 43 tons per year of toxic particulate matter — appear &#8220;minor&#8221; by comparison.</p>
<p>The Southern Environmental Law Center, however, has said that methodology is flawed.</p>
<p>In a September letter to the DEQ detailing its technical opposition to the compressor station, the SELC stated: “The company’s reported ‘annual potential to emit,’ in terms of tons of pollutants per year, does not reflect the variability of emissions and thus, the potential for local residents to be exposed to elevated concentrations of dangerous pollutants.</p>
<p>&#8220;Operating compressor stations have been observed to have such highly variable emissions, including large spikes of harmful VOC emissions,” the SELC wrote. “One compressor station in Pennsylvania emitted dangerous amounts of ethylbenzene, butane and benzene on some days and hardly detectable amounts on other days, resulting in averages that did not appropriately indicate the compressor station’s threats to human health.”</p>
<p>The same critique was shared by several speakers opposing the facility Thursday, including scientists, health care professionals, university professors and Karen Campblin, chair of the Virginia State Conference National Association for the Advancement of Colored People Environmental Justice Committee.</p>
<p>&#8220;As it stands, the permit does not effectively address all public health concerns,&#8221; said Campblin. &#8220;We urge the board to deny the permit and require a more thorough analysis of this project.&#8221;</p>
<p>Speakers generally adhered to the printed-and-posted rules of engagement the board spelled out at the start of the meeting, save the occasional, quiet hisses following some of the glowing support for the pipeline project or compressor station.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shame on you, Dominion. Shame on you, FERC. Shame on you, DEQ,&#8221; Ruby Laury said during her allotted comment time.</p>
<p>Laury, who lives in Buckingham&#8217;s historic black community of Union Hill, where the compressor station site is planned to be built, stared steadily at the board as she voiced her opposition to the project. Members of the audience waved their arms in the air in agreement and nodded encouragement.</p>
<p>&#8220;God put us here to be good stewards of the earth, we need to protect it. God knows what&#8217;s right, and hopefully you do, too,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The Air Pollution Control Board meets again today, when it is expected to act on the permit.</p>

(Cat McCue/ Appalachian Voices)</p><p>Ella Rose doesn&#8217;t expect to see much of a familiar &#8220;friend&#8221; if and when the compressor station comes to her corner of Buckingham County.</p>
<p>&#8220;I sit here in my living room, and I watch the deer and the turkeys and the wildlife walk through my backyard almost every day,&#8221; said Rose, 74, a native of neighboring Nelson who has lived in Buckingham County since 2012.</p>
<p>Rose&#8217;s home sits about 150 feet from property owned by Dominion Energy, on which the company plans to build a massive gas-powered compressor station as part of its 600-mile, tri-state Atlantic Coast Pipeline.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have a bear friend somewhere back there, too,&#8221; she laughs, &#8220;but he doesn&#8217;t come out too often. Once they start building that compressor, they&#8217;re going to run all the animals away from here. And that&#8217;s just the start of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The State Air Pollution Control Board <a href="https://www.deq.virginia.gov/Programs/Air/BuckinghamCompressorStationAirPermit.aspx" target="_blank">begins two days of meetings today</a> on a proposed air permit for the compressor station, the last remaining Virginia approval for the energy giant&#8217;s natural gas pipeline and the last chance for residents of the <span style="font-weight: 400;">majority-black, historic community of Union Hill and their allies to voice objections to regulators in a position to do something about it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Union Hill, where Rose lives, a community founded by freedmen and the formerly enslaved after the Civil War, has emerged as the epicenter of an environmental justice battle between the energy company, the community, anti-pipeline groups, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the Governor’s Advisory Council on Environmental Justice and the commonwealth&#8217;s branch of the oldest civil rights organization in the country. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2016, Preservation Virginia named Union Hill one of the state&#8217;s </span><a href="https://preservationvirginia.org/press_release/2016-virginias-most-endangered-historic-places/" target="_blank"><b>most endangered historic places</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Post-Emancipation African-American settlements and burial sites, like those at Union Hill in Buckingham County, reveal the successes and struggles of generations of African Americans in Virginia,&#8221; the organization said in a statement.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_1944" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:696px;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-1944 size-large" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/compressor-station-1-1024x576.png" alt="" width="696" height="392" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  A rendering of the compressor station proposed for rural Buckingham County as part of Dominion Energy&#8217;s Atlantic Coast Pipeline. (Image via Buckingham County Board of Supervisors)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ACP was one of several utility proposals statewide which &#8220;threaten to undermine the integrity of key natural and historic resources,&#8221; the group said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> In 2017, Preservation Virginia proposed Buckingham County for inclusion on Virginia&#8217;s National Register of Historic Places. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most recently, the </span><a href="http://publichistory.as.virginia.edu/buckingham-county-history-project" target="_blank"><b>Buckingham County History Project</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, run by the University of Virginia&#8217;s Institute for Public History, notes that Union Hill &#8220;has been historically, and remains today, populated primarily by African-American families,&#8221; such as Rose and her brother William Rose, who lives with his wife across the road from his sister&#8217;s home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Many Union Hill residents are descendants of formerly enslaved people who now &#8220;own land and reside in the proposed district, including [a] cattle farm and orchard on land owned by a descendant of slaves,&#8221; an outline of the project states. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We have a rich, rich history here,&#8221; says Rose. &#8220;And it is being completely disregarded.&#8221;</span></p>
<h3><strong>&#8216;Would they want it in theirs?&#8217; </strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 54,000-horsepower Buckingham compressor station is one of three along the pipeline route but the only one in Virginia.  Large turbines will compress the natural gas, keeping it flowing at a steady clip through the pipeline from West Virginia to North Carolina. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If it is built, it will be the largest such facility in Virginia, according to the Virginia State Conference of the NAACP.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.deq.virginia.gov/Portals/0/DEQ/Air/BuckinghamCompressorStation/ADA_Attachment_A_-_21599_BCS_DRAFT_Permit_(clean).pdf" target="_blank"><b>draft air permit </b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the Department of Environmental Quality, which the air board will consider during what promise to be two days of lengthy and contentious meetings today and Friday, sets limits for volatile organic compounds, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides and particulate matter. </span></p>
<p>Technical<a href="http://www.vcnva.org/pipeline-comments-air-permit/?eType=EmailBlastContent&amp;eId=d52a6db2-736e-4abc-a167-f49dff474840" target="_blank"> opposition to the permit</a>, which DEQ has argued will make the facility “among the most, if not the most stringently controlled compressor station in the country,” centers on its greenhouse gas releases, size, lack of best available technology to control emissions, monitoring requirements, limits sets for certain pollutants and flaws in the air modeling used, among other objections.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Particulate matter can cause respiratory problems, decreased lung function, heart attacks and premature death in people with lung or heart disease, warns the </span><a href="https://www.epa.gov/pm-pollution/health-and-environmental-effects-particulate-matter-pm" target="_blank"><b>Environmental Protection Agency</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Particulate matter is one of at least eight pollutants that the compressor station will produce and release; all of them pose serious health risks, and, according to a diverse, vocal contingent of Buckingham residents, community groups and the </span>Virginia State Conference of the  NAACP<b>, </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">will disproportionately impact Union Hill.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The company’s reported &#8216;annual potential to emit,&#8217; in terms of tons of pollutants per year, does not reflect the variability of emissions and thus, the potential for local residents to be exposed to elevated concentrations of dangerous pollutants,&#8221; the Southern Environmental Law Center wrote in its comments on the permit, adding that emissions from compressor stations can &#8220;highly variable.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Operating compressor stations have been observed to have such highly variable emissions, including large spikes of harmful VOC emissions,&#8221; the SELC wrote. &#8220;One compressor station in Pennsylvania emitted dangerous amounts of ethylbenzene, butane and benzene on some days and hardly detectable amounts on other days, resulting in averages that did not appropriately indicate the compressor station’s threats to human health.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The whole proposal is tantamount to environmental racism, says Rose. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;They are putting this [compressor station] in this neighborhood because we are black,&#8221; says Rose, a claim she says she has voiced at every public meeting about the station without a response from Dominion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;They are putting it right in the middle of our community. Would they want it in theirs, with the pollution and noise and everything it&#8217;s going to bring? What makes it all right to put in ours?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Spokesmen for Dominion Energy did not respond to several requests for interviews. In past statements and meetings, the company has said the compressor station&#8217;s location is a matter of necessity — it must be sited near the existing Transco pipeline, which the ACP will connect to —  and has no relation to the demographics of the community.</p>
<p>Dominion did purchase a second site in Buckingham to use for the station, though the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s Environmental Impact Statement says the other location “would require additional pipeline and would increase the construction footprint of ACP.”</p>
<h3><strong>&#8216;We know it&#8217;s going to cause problems&#8217;</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Environmental justice is defined by the Environmental Protection Agency as &#8220;the fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people regardless of race, color, national origin, or income, with respect to the development, implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations, and policies.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s not a new concept: it emerged in the 1980s, spurred by the </span><a href="http://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/unitedchurchofchrist/legacy_url/13567/toxwrace87.pdf?1418439935" target="_blank"><b>first national study</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">which revealed that race was a major factor in where toxic waste could be found in residential communities nationwide. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report found that three out of the five biggest commercial hazardous waste landfills were located in predominantly black or Latino communities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 1987 study highlighted the work of environmental justice activism, led by people of color, for decades in the second half of the 20th century: farm workers rights protests in California championed by Latino workers in the 1960s; Harlem, N.Y., residents who in the late 1960s fiercely opposed a sewage treatment plant destined for their neighborhood; Warren County, N.C., residents — mainly low-income African Americans — waged war against the state government to prevent soil laced with toxic PCBs from entering a landfill in their community. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Warren County campaign, though ultimately unsuccessful, launched a nationwide </span><a href="https://www.nrdc.org/stories/environmental-justice-movement" target="_blank"><b>environmental justice movement</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, environmental racism and environmental justice continue to be major challenges for communities of color, evidenced by the </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/04/20/465545378/lead-laced-water-in-flint-a-step-by-step-look-at-the-makings-of-a-crisis" target="_blank"><b>lead-laden water crisis in Flint, Mich.</b></a><b>, </b>and <span style="font-weight: 400;">a civil rights case in</span><b> </b><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/06/environmental-racism-alabama-landfill-civil-rights" target="_blank"><b>Uniontown, Ala.,</b></a><b> </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">brought by black residents who say they&#8217;ve suffered frequent nosebleeds, headaches and even mental health problems spawned by 4 million tons of toxic coal ash in a nearby landfill for the past 10 years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Governor’s Advisory Council on Environmental Justice </span><a href="https://www.naturalresources.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/secretary-of-natural-resources/pdf/ACEJ-Letter~-approved-8_28_18.pdf" target="_blank"><b>identified several environmental justice concerns</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> stemming from the Buckingham compressor station earlier this year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Union Hill Compressor Station in Buckingham County may have a disproportionate impact on this predominantly African-American community and could be perceived as exhibiting racism in siting, zoning and permitting decisions and public health risk,” the group wrote in an August 2018 review of Virginia’s gas infrastructure. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Further, the council recommended Gov. Ralph Northam convene an emergency task force to examine “evidence of disproportionate impacts for people of color and for low-income populations due to gas infrastructure expansion.”</span></p>

<p>The administration thanked the advisory council for its work but has <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/10/18/virginias-pipeline-projects-and-the-aura-of-inevitability/" target="_blank">largely ignored its recommendations</a>.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia State Conference of the NAACP <a href="http://www.vanaacp.org/index.php/item/31-virginia-naacp-calls-for-halt-to-all-mvp-and-acp-construction" target="_blank">denounced the ACP</a> in recent months, and now also opposes the Buckingham compressor station. Rev. Kevin Chandler, the group&#8217;s president, says the organization filed a lawsuit to halt the ACP in early October, based on findings from its environmental justice committee. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Environmentally, we know it&#8217;s going to cause problems,&#8221; said Chandler, pastor of Trinity Baptist Church in South Boston. &#8220;We&#8217;re concerned about the impact on the drinking water, and the impact the vibrations from the [compressor] station will have on cattle and livestock. We&#8217;re concerned about the noise level for people who will have to live very near this facility, and how their general quality of life will be affected.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Safety is also a major concern, Chandler said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The local firefighters and first responders in that area of Buckingham are simply not prepared for a disaster, should one occur at the compressor station,&#8221; he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Though </span><a href="https://atlanticcoastpipeline.com/construction/buckingham.aspx" target="_blank"><b>Dominion promises</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8220;onsite, multi-layered safety controls, an intensive inspection program and rigorous monitoring on a 24/7 basis&#8221; at the facility, the state NAACP wants additional safety resources made available to local emergency workers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;They need proper training, which Dominion should provide,&#8221; Chandler said.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the compressor station will become a permanent fixture in Union Hill, residents should be fairly compensated, Chandler said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There are some financial needs in that community, and if the project continues to move forward, the people who live there should not be worse off because of it,&#8221; he said. </span></p>
<p>Chandler says Dominion has &#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">yet to answer many of our concerns, in terms of environmental safety and air quality.&#8221; </span></p>
<p>However, on Thursday evening, the Richmond Times-Dispatch <a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/plus/dominion-offers-million-in-plan-to-aid-buckingham-community-next/article_6ce2637f-7d2c-5d70-9329-f989f3b05a78.html" target="_blank">reported that Dominion has offered $5.1 million</a> to pay for a range of improvements in the Union Hill area, including additional emergency infrastructure and a new community center.</p>
<p>“They’re using it as a divide-and-conquer technique,” the Rev. Paul Wilson, pastor of the Union Hill and Union Grove Baptist churches, a locus of opposition to the project, told the paper.</p>
<p>Others saw it as way to ensure that the community gets something out of the deal if it is forced to live with the compressor station.</p>
<h3><strong>Pipeline &#8216;sensationalism?&#8217;</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The mission of the </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/vlbc2/about/?ref=page_internal" target="_blank"><b>Virginia Legislative Black Caucus</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is to &#8220;improve the economic, educational, political and social conditions of African Americans and other underrepresented groups&#8221; in Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Hampton-based group is comprised of black legislators and chaired by Del. Lamont Bagby, D-Richmond. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When reached by phone, Bagby says his office and the caucus have been &#8220;readily available and willing&#8221; to address concerns about the Buckingham compressor station.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While he appreciates the perspectives of people like Wilson, Bagby says &#8220;challenges associated with the pipeline in Buckingham have been exploited&#8221; by some individuals, whom he would not name directly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It is my hope that we continue to work to make sure everyone is informed of who is making the decisions, as opposed to sensationalism. Buckingham citizens deserve to get factual information,&#8221; Bagby said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bagby says he has set up a meeting with Basil Gooden, a Dominion Energy-hired community liaison and former Virginia secretary of agriculture with deep ties to Union Hill, to get an update on Dominion&#8217;s response to residents&#8217; concerns. A date has not been set for that meeting, Bagby says. </span></p>
<p>State Sen. Jennifer McClellan, vice chair of the caucus, who also serves on the state Senate&#8217;s Agriculture, Conservation and Natural Resources committee, could not be reached for a phone interview due to scheduling conflicts, her office said.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the trees fall, and the state board takes up the permit to move the compressor project forward, Buckingham residents and their supporters are airing their criticism of the ACP compressor station <a href="http://appvoices.org/fracking/buckingham-permit/" target="_blank">at a news conference this morning in Richmond</a>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black Buckingham residents have been speaking out for the duration of the ACP process, Chandler said, &#8220;but they are just now having their voices heard.

A major landfill is planned to built nearby. (Photo courtesy of Muriel Branch)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CUMBERLAND — Just inside the front door of the 100-year-old Pine Grove School in Cumberland County’s small Cartersville community, the soft wood underfoot groans and gives under Muriel Branch&#8217;s steps. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I walked three and a half miles to get here, each way, each day,&#8221; says Branch, sweeping her gaze around the one-room schoolhouse where she received her elementary education from 1949 to 1955. &#8220;Pine Grove School really means something to me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of at least 360 </span><a href="https://preservationva.maps.arcgis.com/apps/Cascade/index.html?appid=8e99b251059e4f57b192cf5347854618" target="_blank"><b>Rosenwald Schools built in Virginia</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from 1917 to 1932, Pine Grove School was founded to better educate African-American students in Cumberland.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Venerable black educator Booker T. Washington created the Rosenwald Schools model in a multi-pronged effort to improve the quality of education for black children in the South  in the early 20th century. Then, in the thick of the Jim Crow era where nearly all advancement opportunities for black Americans — including education — were severely limited, philanthropist Julius Rosenwald of Sears, Roebuck and Company partnered with Washington, creating a fund to help build the schools. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pine Grove School sits on four acres adjacent to land recently acquired by </span><a href="http://greenridgeva.com/" target="_blank"><b>Green Ridge Recycling and Disposal Facility</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Green Ridge, owned by County Waste of Virginia, is a proposed landfill to be built on 1,200 acres in the extreme east of Cumberland County, bordering Powhatan County.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The landfill, for which the Cumberland County Board of Supervisors has </span><a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/local/central-virginia/powhatan/powhatan-today/cumberland-county-board-of-supervisors-approves-landfill-in-split-vote/article_593ad4c0-7e14-11e8-a9d9-571cfd8fbfff.html" target="_blank"><b>granted rezoning and conditional land use permits</b></a>,<span style="font-weight: 400;"> has been met with ire from some residents of several counties for a laundry list of reasons. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Love Central VA, a citizens group comprising residents of five counties including Cumberland and Powhatan, are </span><a href="http://www.lovecentralva.com/petition/" target="_blank"><b>petitioning state regulators</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who must sign off on the soundness of the proposed facility’s environmental standards before it can be built. Citing numerous concerns about the &#8220;environmental, health and safety impact&#8221; Green Ridge could have on the area, the petition “respectfully demands” that the Department of Environmental Quality and Virginia Department of Transportation deny approval to Green Ridge.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_694" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:696px;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-694" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/dumpME-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="696" height="522" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/dumpME-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/dumpME-300x225.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/dumpME-768x576.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/dumpME-80x60.jpg 80w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/dumpME-265x198.jpg 265w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/dumpME-696x522.jpg 696w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/dumpME-1068x801.jpg 1068w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/dumpME-560x420.jpg 560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/dumpME.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  A sign opposing a proposed Cumberland County landfill was placed U.S. Route 60 in Cumberland County.

<p>Green Ridge representatives said in an email that the company has not yet submitted applications to the agencies. In the next month the company will submit a notice of intent to DEQ, followed by an application. Green Ridge’s application to VDOT is forthcoming.<span style="font-weight: 400;">  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those who own homes near the proposed landfill say they will suffer a permanent decrease in property value or, as lifelong Cumberland resident Jacqueline Hamlette fears, face more serious challenges. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hamlette&#8217;s mother Cora Cooke attended Pine Grove School, and has lived the last 55 years in a home she inherited from her mother. Hamlette says, historically, their land was part of an antebellum-era plantation and that her family may be descended from formerly enslaved people who stayed on the site after the Civil War. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cooke’s home is less than a mile from the proposed landfill&#8217;s site. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It took every effort possible for my grandmother to build this home; she grew old and died here, she passed it on to my mother. Now, my mother is elderly, she&#8217;s not in the best health, and here comes this landfill,&#8221; Hamlette said. Green Ridge, she added, offered to buy the property of homeowners in the area, but says it&#8217;s not a realistic option for her mom. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You mean to tell me she should just uproot her entire life, go through the process of finding or building a new home away from the land she inherited, at her age and in her condition?&#8221; Hamlette said. &#8220;It&#8217;s not right.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><a href="http://greenridgeva.com/frequently-asked-questions.html#location" target="_blank"><b>Green Ridge estimates</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 3,500 to 5,000 tons of nonhazardous waste will be processed at its facility each day. Scheduled to operate 24 hours a day, the facility will have capacity to contain the garbage for at least 35 years. Though the Pine Grove School is just outside the land boundary of Green Ridge&#8217;s planned facility, Branch says it is too close for comfort. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;[Green Ridge] is going to encroach on a historic site. If the proposed road for the facility is put in, that will impact access to the school site. Not to mention the smell, the unsightliness of it. Who wants a dump in their backyard?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Branch is chairman of the Agee Miller Mayo Dungy Family Association, which paid back taxes on the school in May and plans to restore the school and transform it into a community center. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We have partnered with Preservation Virginia, and we&#8217;re waiting to meet someone to do an assessment of the building,&#8221; says Branch. In 2013, Preservation Virginia named Rosenwald Schools like Pine Grove among the state’s </span><a href="https://preservationvirginia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Pres.Va_EndangeredSites2013_v7.pdf" target="_blank"><b>most endangered historic sites</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The entity has since then created a mobile </span><a href="https://preservationva.maps.arcgis.com/apps/GeoForm/index.html?appid=6b091903752c4ea1a4d495221c3f3382" target="_blank"><b>survey program</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help former students and other groups statewide find, document and help preserve Rosenwald schools in their communities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;re trying to get the building listed on the register of historic places, because it certainly qualifies,&#8221; says Branch. Her group and others will host a clean up and beautification day at the Pine Grove school on Oct. 6. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond the environment, their homes and the historic school in their community, Green Ridge’s planned facility may also disturb the dead. In August, a group of local hunters discovered what they believe to be grave sites within Green Ridge&#8217;s land boundary, says Victoria Ronnau of the Love Central VA group.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After learning that human remains may be resting on part of the 1,200-acre parcel, &#8220;we walked the land and found about 12 to 15 depressed areas marked with stones,&#8221; Ronnau says. &#8220;This is yet another reason, one of the most serious reasons, that Green Ridge should not be built here or anywhere in the state of Virginia.&#8221;</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_2351" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:696px;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-2351 size-large" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/gravemarker_maybe-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="696" height="522" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/gravemarker_maybe-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/gravemarker_maybe-300x225.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/gravemarker_maybe-768x576.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/gravemarker_maybe-80x60.jpg 80w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/gravemarker_maybe-265x198.jpg 265w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/gravemarker_maybe-696x522.jpg 696w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/gravemarker_maybe-1068x801.jpg 1068w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/gravemarker_maybe-560x420.jpg 560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/gravemarker_maybe.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Opponents of a proposed Cumberland County landfill believe there may be graves on the site. (Samantha Willis/ For the Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kevin Ingle is chairman of the Cumberland County Board of Supervisors, serving the county&#8217;s third district. Ingle&#8217;s was one of two votes opposing Green Ridge&#8217;s rezoning and land use permit requests. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I wanted to be sure the people living closest to the landfill and who would be most impacted by it were treated fair,&#8221; he says. &#8220;And my other big concern at first was traffic on Route 60,&#8221; which would be increased by the trucks hauling tons of trash eastbound on Route 60 to Green Ridge&#8217;s facility daily, says Ingle. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, he&#8217;s among the increasing number of residents who believe both Pine Grove School and the nearby possible grave sites should be protected and preserved.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I feel surely that those are graves,&#8221; says Ingle, &#8220;because I&#8217;ve seen quite a few of them out here in the backwoods, in places that 200 years ago were open fields and are now forests. We need to all be extremely mindful of that.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Aug. 28, Branch, Hamlette, Ronnau and other Cumberland residents led Del.</span> Delores McQuinn, D-Richmond, and Green Ridge manager Jerry Cifor on a boots-on-the-ground survey of the land. The hunters who found the graves led the group through the woods, slashing through thick brush and pointing out weathered stones on what appear to be burial plots.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cifor admitted at that time that citizens had told Green Ridge previously that there may be graves on the land, but he had not seen them in his &#8220;many&#8221; previous tours of the property. Cifor said Green Ridge had previously conducted a LiDAR survey – defined by the </span><a href="https://www.neonscience.org/lidar-basics" target="_blank"><b>National Ecological Observatory Network</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as &#8220;a remote sensing method that can be used to map structure including vegetation height, density and other characteristics across a region&#8221; – but found no evidence of graves on the site. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;ve now engaged our own archaeologist, and he will be completing his work over the next several weeks, over the entire 1,200 acres,&#8221; Cifor said that day. &#8220;And we&#8217;ll know if there are any sites of historical significance on our property, as well as any grave sites. &#8230; We will respect the grave sites; we&#8217;ll probably fence [them] in and put up a sign and be very respectful.&#8221; </span></p>
<p>The archaeological team, Browning &amp; Associates, is completing its survey, a process they anticipate taking “several more weeks,” company officials said in an email this past weekend. Wet weather delayed the survey process, but the findings will be posted on Green Ridge’s website, they said.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McQuinn says that if there are indeed graves on the site, they may include the remains of people born enslaved, since most of the area used to be plantations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;My office is investigating this, and we are interested to learn what the archaeologist&#8217;s report will reveal,&#8221; she says. </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/09/10/obligated-to-do-whats-right-state-money-helping-maintain-more-historic-african-american-cemeteries/" target="_blank"><b>McQuinn headed up two bills</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which for the first time in Virginia history makes state funding available for the restoration and upkeep of historic black cemeteries. Also concerned about the future of the historic Pine Grove School, McQuinn says it holds &#8220;great significance in terms of African-American history in the state of Virginia.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Branch remembers her teacher, Mary Gilliam,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">corralling kids in the school&#8217;s one classroom, patiently teaching reading and arithmetic, but also skills that translated outside the classroom like public speaking. Gilliam instilled in her students a deep respect for their community and its heritage, says Branch, and that is why she will continue to oppose the Green Ridge facility.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You feel like David going up against Goliath. But I just have faith that right is going to prevail here. Our history is worth preserving and fighting for,&#8221; Branch said. </span></p>

(Photo by Brian Palmer)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Old oaks loom over the graves inside East End Cemetery, a 16-acre burial ground bordering the city of Richmond and Henrico County.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shafts of sunlight filtering through the foliage illuminate the final resting places of the thousands of black men and women interred there since it opened in 1897. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For years, East End — and its larger counterpart, Evergreen Cemetery — were neglected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was only through efforts of determined community volunteers and families of the deceased that the privately-owned cemeteries and the ugly Virginia history they bore witness to — when segregation by race separated Virginians from the cradle to the grave — weren&#8217;t left completely to weeds. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?171+sum+HB1547" target="_blank">A bill that passed in 2017</a> dedicated state dollars to help maintain black cemeteries in the care of qualified charitable organizations, including the pair of Richmond cemeteries. And <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?181+ful+CHAP0818" target="_blank">a second piece of legislation</a> that passed this year broadened eligibility for the funding to anyone who owned one of the cemeteries, of which there are potentially hundreds of others across the state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both were spearheaded by Del. Delores McQuinn, D-Richmond. Supporters say the laws mark a big shift in how the state, long keen on providing money to maintain graves of Confederate soldiers, supports the preservation of African-American history.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As Evergreen and East End cemeteries — and their present condition — show, African-American history has been dismissed for years in this state,” she said.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&#8216;TRULY IMMORAL AND UNCONSCIONABLE&#8217;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2017 bill, which sailed through both the House and Senate with unanimous support and was signed by former Gov. Terry McAuliffe, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">set strict qualifying guidelines for burial grounds to receive the funds. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cemeteries must have been established before 1900, and had to be owned and operated by a government entity or 501c3 nonprofit organization.</span></p>
<p>There are more than 150 historic black cemeteries in central Virginia alone, according to researcher and author Lynne Rainville, an anthropological archaeologist and an associate dean at Sweet Briar College. Rainville detailed her years of studying black graveyards in her 2014 book “Hidden History: African-American Cemeteries in Central Virginia.”</p>
<p>“Most gravestones compress a life story into a name and date of birth and death, but … an individual’s passage [is] part of a larger story – a story of families and neighborhoods, successes and failures,&#8221; <a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Hidden_History.html?id=mHpHAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=kp_read_button#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" target="_blank">Rainville writes.</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eligible cemeteries can get $5 per grave, monument or marker to interred individuals who &#8220;lived at any time between 1800 and 1900,&#8221; the law reads</span><b>.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia still subsidizes the care of Confederate graves, markers, monuments and memorials <a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title10.1/chapter22/section10.1-2211/" target="_blank">per state law</a>. In 2017, McAuliffe said it was &#8220;truly immoral and unconscionable that we would spend money to honor the Confederate dead without making an equal investment to preserve our historic black cemeteries.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And in 2017, displays of intolerance and racism, including the deadly Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">underscored the importance of expanding and preserving Virginia’s historical narratives, including providing state funds for the upkeep of black burial grounds and remembrance spaces, McQuinn said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I think Virginia lawmakers looked at that, and believed we are obligated to do what&#8217;s right, under these circumstances,&#8221; said McQuinn, who has led volunteer groups in clearing brush and debris from Evergreen Cemetery since the 1990s.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “Trying to address the vegetation issue … was a monumental undertaking, and it was overwhelming. It sort of leaves you walking away feeling like, ‘How can we overcome this?’” she said.</span></p>
<p><strong>&#8216;I&#8217;D NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS&#8217;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That challenge is one John Shuck has done his best to meet for the past five years. A longtime volunteer and retired IT analyst, Shuck coordinates groups of volunteers to work inside East End Cemetery and in past years volunteered at Evergreen Cemetery. Every weekend and several weekdays, Shuck leads teams of students, church groups and other volunteers in pulling weeds, clearing kudzu vines and hauling away branches from the grave sites. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m from the Midwest, and all the cemeteries I’d seen were pretty well-maintained,” says Shuck, who moved to Richmond in 2001. Gesturing to the overgrown, shady back sections of the graveyard, he says, “I’d never seen anything like this.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shuck’s group, </span><a href="https://friendsofeastend.com/" target="_blank"><b>Friends of East End Cemetery</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, uploads information they uncover on the tombstones to FindAGrave.com.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “It’s an effort to tell these stories and find out who these people were before they are completely lost,” Shuck said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">African-American veterans, doctors and businessmen lie in East End Cemetery, among thousands of men and women who contributed to the fabric of late 19</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">-century Richmond. In neighboring Evergreen, Maggie Lena Walker, civil rights activist, businesswoman and the first black woman to charter a bank in America, is buried. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, too, is John Mitchell, Jr., the venerable journalist, anti-lynching activist and editor of The Richmond Planet newspaper. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mitchell’s nephew and namesake, John Mitchell, says at least four of his family members rest in Evergreen. The state funds for the cemeteries&#8217; care come “better late than never,” he says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My father and uncle paid for someone to take care of the cemetery back in the 1960s, so I think a lot of us feel that it’s about time the state decided these spaces were worthy of sustained support.”</span></p>
<p><strong>&#8216;WE NEED TO HAVE A SEAT AT THE TABLE&#8217;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since HB 1547 was enacted last year, other historic black cemeteries across the state have become eligible for funding as well, including the Mount Calvary Cemetery Complex in Portsmouth and the African-American Burial Ground for the Enslaved at Belmont in Loudoun County. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like the cemeteries in Richmond, these graveyards qualified for funding because they are owned by nonprofit organizations, as mandated in the original bill, though <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?181+oth+HB284FER122+PDF" target="_blank">the changes enacted this year</a> open up funding to any individual or locality to the list of organizations that can receive the maintenance money.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://enrichmond.org/evergreen-cemetery/background/" target="_blank"><b>Enrichmond</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a nonprofit that supports the City of Richmond’s Department of Parks, Recreation, and Community Facilities, acquired Evergreen Cemetery in 2017 and is also poised to gain ownership of East End. </span></p>
<p>Evergreen was previously owned by UK Corp, a private business headed by <a href="http://richmondfreepress.com/news/2016/sep/02/woodland-evergreen-cemeteries-sale/" target="_blank">Isaiah Entzminger</a>. The same company owns Woodland Cemetery, where tennis legend Arthur Ashe is buried.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enrichmond in 2016 </span><a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/local/city-of-richmond/foundation-approves-grant-for-historically-african-american-cemeteries/article_95beec0d-bf67-5ad5-aa21-94294fce783c.html" target="_blank"><b>received a $400,000 grant</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the Virginia Outdoors Foundation and together, the organizations are working to place Evergreen and East End under a conservation easement, to protect them from future development.<strong> </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brian Palmer, a multimedia journalist and filmmaker, has worked to clean and clear at least five acres of East End Cemetery alongside his wife, Erin, since 2014. Palmer remains concerned about the role nonprofits like Enrichmond play in not only reclaiming the burial grounds from nature, but also reclaiming the history there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If all of this state funding is being directed or given to a private entity, there should be both transparency and accountability,” Palmer said. “The volunteers, the descendants of those interred, we need to have a seat at the table, and to be able to continue the work we’ve been doing for years to restore dignity to these cemeteries.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mitchell agrees, and says the main goal of the nonprofits or agencies that own historic African-American cemeteries across Virginia should be to “work directly [toward] the collective vision of the descendants of the people who have been buried there, and their communities.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new state money will assist Enrichmond in returning Evergreen, and eventually East End, to places of quiet reflection and respect, befitting the people buried in both cemeteries, says John Sydnor, Enrichmond’s executive director. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We worked for over six years to acquire Evergreen, because we feel it is vital to understand the history of these places. They tell the story of the city, and a part of the story that has been left out for generations,&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He added the nonprofit&#8217;s work has &#8220;relied on community guidance and input on how … the restoration process should happen.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “We continue to value these voices, and we are showing that,&#8221; Sydnor said.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To that end, Enrichmond has formed a 25-member </span><a href="https://enrichmond.org/2018/07/descendant-family-community-guiding-restoration-of-historic-evergreen-cemetery/" target="_blank"><b>advisory team</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of longtime cemetery volunteers, descendants and community leaders to crystallize and implement that vision at Evergreen and East End. The group meets monthly at Virginia Union University.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Formed in October 2017, Mitchell and Shuck are part of the team, which includes descendants like Johnny Mickens III, the great-grandson of Maggie Walker. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to Shuck, Veronica Davis, author and former director of black cemetery restoration volunteer group Virginia Roots, contributes to the team, as well as representatives from the Black History Museum &amp; Cultural Center of Virginia, the Maggie L. Walker National Park Service site, and other organizations central to Richmond’s black community. Ted Maris-Wolf, who became caretaker of Evergreen Cemetery in 2017, leads the team. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Enrichmond may be the legal owner of Evergreen, and may become the legal owner of East End, but these are sacred sites that belong to communities in Richmond, and to the historical memories of those communities,” says Maris-Wolf, who formerly oversaw research and historical interpretation at Colonial Williamsburg. “The volunteers — including John Shuck, Friends of East End, [longtime Evergreen Cemetery volunteer] Marvin Harris — and the family members have taught us so much. We could not do this work without them.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Janine Bell founded Elegba Folklore Society 28 years ago to elevate African and African-American culture in Richmond. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bell says she joined Enrichmond’s advisory team to ensure Evergreen and East End Cemeteries would be restored with “sensitivity and respect” for the wishes of the descendant community. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the state’s new funding stream for historic black burial grounds is “encouraging,” Bell says that the effort to newly illuminate these histories will not be complete unless the organizations entrusted with state money to oversee the cemeteries, collaborate with existing volunteers and those descended from the dead.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The reality is, and we see this with Enrichmond, these nonprofits and entities may have the monetary resources but not necessarily the cultural resources to complete this mission,&#8221; Bell said. &#8220;We have to work together. It is imperative that any organization getting these [state] funds understands that the descendant community knows what’s best for the places their ancestors rest.” </span></p>
