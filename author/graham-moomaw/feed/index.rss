(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a series of problems figuring out how to fairly distribute a limited number of highly desired bottles of liquor, the Virginia Alcoholic Beverage Control Authority </span><a href="https://www.abc.virginia.gov/products/limited-availability" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced Tuesday</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that it will implement a more randomized system to determine when and where rare products appear on store shelves. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The changes will leave customers more reliant on blind luck to discover sought-after products at ABC stores across the state. Customers will also be restricted to buying one limited availability bottle per day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The liquor authority said it will “no longer” notify customers when those products will be available. Inventory data for limited availability products won’t be accessible on ABC’s website, and store workers won’t be allowed to give information over the phone about whether they’ve been authorized to sell limited availability products at their location.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We know that customers in all regions of the commonwealth want an equal opportunity to get these highly sought-after spirits,” ABC said in an announcement about the change. “By selling products at random locations, dates and times, we limit possibilities for individuals or groups to abuse the system.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The changes come two years after a scandal in which an ABC employee and an associate were caught </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/07/13/inside-job-abc-embezzlement-case-points-to-leaks-in-hunt-for-rare-bottles-of-bourbon/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">selling bourbon collectors inside info</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on where ABC was sending hard-to-find bottles. Both men pleaded guilty to computer trespassing, but </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/04/03/neither-man-convicted-in-scheme-to-sell-abc-bourbon-info-will-face-active-jail-time/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">avoided active jail time</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for their felony convictions on that charge.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bourbon enthusiasts were also outraged last year after experiencing what they felt were clear statistical anomalies in the way ABC was conducting random lotteries for rare bottles. At the time, ABC officials said a “breakdown in Excel sorting” caused some lottery entrants to win multiple bottles despite steep mathematical odds of that happening in a truly random system. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ABC officials said they will still conduct online lotteries for the rarest bottles like Pappy Van Winkle, and will send out text message notifications for some limited availability releases “as appropriate.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The authority said it decided not to release limited availability products on a particular day because, in the past, some buyers would camp outside stores to get the first shot at buying them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ABC won’t put rare bottles on shelves immediately after they arrive at stores, the authority said, because that would allow customers to “follow the delivery trucks to each store and purchase bottles along the truck’s route.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ABC said it can’t impose a statewide one-bottle limit on customers purchasing rare products because the authority only scans buyers’ identification cards for age verification and doesn’t collect data on how much liquor individual customers are buying.</span></p>

(Photo by Chris duMond/Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Virginia man is being prosecuted in federal court after he allegedly made a series of online posts threatening to kill or harm Vice President Kamala Harris, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Virginia announced Monday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frank Carillo, a 66-year-old from Winchester, was arrested last week at his home after authorities said they traced a series of posts on the conservative-leaning social media site Gettr back to him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harris, who is now the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, was mentioned 19 times in the posts allegedly written by Carillo under the username “joemadarats1.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Harris is going to regret ever trying to become president because if that ever happened I will personally pluck out her eyes with a pair of pliers but first I will shoot and kill everyone that gets in my way that is a f****** promise,” read one of thousands of posts from the account that targeted public officials.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another post said “I HAVE MY AR-15 LOCKED AND LOADED.” Authorities said they seized an AR-15 rifle, a pistol and “thousands of rounds of ammunition” from Carillo’s home during a search carried out Aug. 2.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carillo told federal authorities he had purchased the rifle in February. He also indicated during the search that he was the one who had made the online comments that had drawn the attention of the Secret Service and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, according to federal court documents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Federal law makes it a crime to threaten the president or anyone in the line of succession to the presidency. The offense is punishable by up to five years in prison.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Open political discourse is a cornerstone of our American experience. We can disagree. We can argue and we can debate. However, when those disagreements cross the line to threats of violence, law enforcement must step in,” Western District U.S. Attorney Christopher R. Kavanaugh said in a news release announcing the case.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Threats of violence against political figures have been a heightened concern this summer following the July 13 assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump, who is now competing against Harris after President Joe Biden abandoned his bid for a second presidential term.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several of the alarming posts from the Gettr account linked to Carillo were made on July 27, almost one week after Biden dropped out of the race.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carillo made an initial court appearance Monday and remains in federal custody, court documents show. Another hearing in the case is scheduled for Thursday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Efforts to reach Carillo’s court-appointed attorney were unsuccessful Monday.</span></p>

Charlotte Rene Woods/ Virginia Mercury</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares announced Friday that he’s going after the online Democratic fundraising platform ActBlue for potentially improper activity, without offering detailed evidence of what he believes the organization has done wrong.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ActBlue rejected the attorney general’s allegations as “false” and politically motivated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a </span><a href="https://x.com/JasonMiyaresVA" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">letter posted to X</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Miyares made broad accusations of questionable donations made through the service that acts as a conduit between small-dollar contributors and a variety of Democratic candidates and causes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This includes hundreds of thousands of dollars of contributions through individual donors in the Commonwealth in volumes that are facially implausible and appear suspicious,” Miyares wrote. “Some of these Virginia donors are reported as making multiple daily contributions over the course of multiple years amounting to tens of thousands of dollars in aggregate.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The attorney general demanded “a detailed description of ActBlue&#8217;s processes and procedures for verifying the legitimacy and accuracy of donor and contribution information as well as the processes and procedures used in verifying information reported to regulatory bodies.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Given the seriousness of these allegations, I expect to receive your substantive response by August 12, 2024,” Miyares concluded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In </span><a href="https://x.com/actblue/status/1819438054534181083" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a statement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, ActBlue said Miyares was perpetuating misinformation in order to attack political opponents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This investigation is nothing more than a partisan political attack and scare tactic to undermine the power of Democratic and progressive small-dollar donors,” ActBlue said. “We welcome the opportunity to respond to these frivolous claims.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ActBlue has faced similar accusations from conservative activists in the past, but </span><a href="https://marylandmatters.org/2023/06/20/expert-claims-of-campaign-finance-irregularities-are-dubious/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">campaign finance experts contend</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the claims are overblown and based partly on quirks in how the Federal Election Commission reports small donations made through ActBlue and WinRed, its counterpart for GOP fundraising.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s unclear what inspired Miyares to target ActBlue. The attorney general’s letter didn’t point to specific donors or contributions made via ActBlue that he felt were problematic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The letter the AG released today speaks for itself,” said Miyares spokesperson Ian Lichacz. “Our office has reviewed allegations involving donor information of many individuals. No single donor or single allegation inspired this action.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The announcement follows conservative social media chatter about an unusually high number of political donations from one person who apparently lives in the Richmond suburbs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Miyares amplified social media posts pointing to that particular donor, but federal campaign finance records show most of the contributions from the donor went to Republicans, not Democrats. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While a few of the donations seemingly did occur through ActBlue, vastly more were made through WinRed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Miyares reposted a social media message by hard-right figure Charlie Kirk, the founder of the conservative group Talking Points USA, which </span><a href="https://x.com/charliekirk11/status/1816867982330499419" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">incorrectly implied</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> thousands of small donations from the Richmond-area contributor were going to Democrats via ActBlue. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My office is aware of these allegations and rest assured, we are looking into it,” Miyares said as he reposted Kirk’s misleading allegation a few days before announcing he had sent the letter to ActBlue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former President Donald Trump also reposted Kirk’s message on social media, with commentary added by another user suggesting Miyares would suffer politically if he failed to prosecute “money laundering” involving ActBlue. The donor whose high frequency of contributions inspired Kirk’s post made numerous donations to Trump, according to campaign finance records.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Mercury is not naming the donor identified on social media because there is no indication yet that the person was a victim of identity theft or did not intend to make the donations Kirk and others deemed suspicious.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The attorney general’s office did not comment on why the inquiry was focused only on ActBlue and not WinRed.</span></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong / Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emergency room visits in Virginia by people who reported vaping more than doubled between 2020 and 2023, according to a data analysis released this week by the Virginia Hospital &amp; Healthcare Association.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020, there were 23,630 emergency room visits by patients who vaped, according to the organization. By 2023, that number had risen to 49,356 visits, a 108.9% increase.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ER visits by people who reported using traditional tobacco products like cigarettes and chewing tobacco dropped by about 25% during the same period, but traditional tobacco products “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">still account for the majority of [emergency department] visits with a tobacco or vaping-related diagnosis,” according to a VHHA news release.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The data doesn’t necessarily reflect the health risks or safety of various products. Julian Walker, a spokesman for the VHHA, said the data encompasses both people visiting the ER with a persistent cough that’s tobacco-related or patients who have other illnesses like the flu who disclose that they use tobacco.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Taken together, the trend data may suggest a shift away from traditional tobacco products in favor of e-cigarettes and vaping devices among some users of these products,” the VHHA said in a news release.</span></p>

(Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At a meeting of the Virginia Freedom of Information Act Advisory Council last month, the panel’s chairman held a brainstorming session on pressing FOIA issues.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two dramatically different viewpoints emerged in the responses, highlighting the challenges of changing Virginia’s spotty transparency laws to better balance the public’s right to know with governments’ ability to function.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several FOIA Council members in seats reserved for citizens floated ideas about increasing transparency and making it easier for Virginians to see what public officials are doing. But the ideas from council members who represent government interests mainly focused on ways to make FOIA less of a hassle for government bodies and potentially allow more secrecy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I just found it kind of sad that there seemed to be just such antipathy to people using this statutory right,” said Megan Rhyne, who attended the meeting as executive director of the Virginia Coalition for Open Government. “The number of things that they were asking to have reviewed was kind of indicative of how the FOIA Council has become much more government-leaning.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Marcus Simon, D-Fairfax, the FOIA council’s chairman, opened the discussion about FOIA priorities after noting that the council had leeway to set its own priorities this year because the General Assembly hasn’t given the advisory body a big workload of topics to study. The council didn’t take any major action at the July 17 meeting, but the conversation could tee up topics for future meetings and potential recommendations to the General Assembly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lola Rodriguez Perkins, the county attorney in Surry County who was recently appointed to fill the FOIA Council’s seat reserved for local government representation, relayed a concern that existing law doesn’t do enough to maintain the secrecy of closed sessions held by city councils and county boards. Transparency exemptions allowing closed meetings on sensitive topics, she said, should extend after the meeting to prevent the public from finding out what occurred behind closed doors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Individuals come out of closed session and then have conversations with members of the public or send emails to other members,” Perkins said, noting that emails recapping what happened in a closed session wouldn’t necessarily be exempt from FOIA.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simon indicated he had some reservations about such a “broad expansion” of closed session secrecy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think I understand the concern,” Simon said. “I’m not sure I share it necessarily.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perkins suggested other changes to the law to prevent people involved in lawsuits against government bodies from filing FOIA requests after the court-overseen document discovery process has concluded. She also floated the idea of giving school officials 45 days to respond to some education-related FOIA requests to align with longer timelines laid out in the federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). The federal law lays out rules for maintaining the privacy of student records while allowing parents access to information about their own child. Virginia already has a public records exemption that protects information about individual students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s FOIA law allows up to five business days for an initial response to a records request. Deadline extensions are allowed for particularly complex or time-consuming requests.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lindsay Fisher, a lawyer in Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s office who was appointed to fill a citizen seat on the council, raised concerns about “abuse of process” by people filing too many FOIA requests that seem to deal with the same topic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m thinking of one specific example that I’ve seen in a past life of someone who is making the same request multiple times but [it] is worded differently,” Fisher said, adding that prolific FOIA requesters can “gum up” government offices and make it harder to respond to other inquiries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other council members suggested ways FOIA could be improved to benefit the public.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maria Everett, the FOIA Council’s former executive director who recently took a seat on the board, suggested beefing up rules on meeting agendas to make it harder for public bodies to take action on big policy items without letting the public know it’s coming. She pointed to the city of Petersburg’s </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/04/24/petersburg-doubles-down-on-cordish-as-its-casino-operator/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">surprise selection</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of a casino developer earlier this year after a closed session, when the public had been led to believe the city was following a competitive bidding process and had no notice such a major decision was being made that day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chidi James, a personal injury lawyer whose firm was recently involved in wrongful death litigation against the University of Virginia over the mass shooting at the school in 2022, suggested revisiting the list of FOIA exemptions that “seems to grow and grow and grow.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I just think it’s a good idea just to regularly take a look at what they are and see if we might have too many,” James said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UVA officials have refused to release a report on the shooting prepared by an outside law firm. The Daily Progress newspaper in Charlottesville is </span><a href="https://dailyprogress.com/news/local/crime-courts/daily-progress-sues-uva-after-school-withholds-review-of-fatal-2022-shooting/article_b242aa90-08ea-11ef-9000-6fc0e23e5cbc.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">challenging that decision</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in court. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simon, the state legislator who leads the FOIA Council, offered his own recommendations for how transparency could be strengthened. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said he’d like to reexamine the widely invoked “working papers and correspondence” FOIA exemption that can be used to block the release of communications involving the governor’s office, General Assembly members, university presidents and local government leaders. Simon also said he’d like to look at how public bodies handle FOIA exemptions that are discretionary, meaning officials can choose to release the records or choose not to disclose them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The feedback I’ve gotten is that whenever there’s a discretionary disclosure issue the agency or public body tends to default to non-disclosure,” Simon said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asked for his takeaways on the FOIA Council’s discussion, Simon said this week that he’s convinced the state needs to “change the culture” of how FOIA is handled “at all levels of government.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I wish some of the constituencies represented were as concerned with how to make records accessible as they were with the question of how to deal with outliers or ‘frequent flier’ types who seem to be a thorn in their sides,” Simon said. “I think there are probably things that can be done that can solve both problems.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The case dealing with asset forfeiture laws centers on the legal hoops Virginians have to jump through in court to argue they should get their money back after law enforcement officials take it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State law allows authorities to seize money and other assets suspected of being connected to drug trafficking or other criminal activity, but gives people who had their assets taken a chance to argue those suspicions are unfounded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dispute over the ruling in Chesterfield was largely about a procedural technicality, but it highlights the hurdles people can face when trying to argue the government wrongfully took their money.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of a drug operation in 2020, Chesterfield authorities seized money from an auto shop owned by Roger McMillian. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A small amount of drugs was found on the second floor of the business where McMillian lived, court records show, and he was ultimately convicted of a drug possession offense. Another man arrested in connection to the case at a different location pleaded guilty to a drug distribution charge, according to court documents. But McMillian argued the cash police took from the business was legitimate and had no connection to drug dealing, money laundering or other crimes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though state law gave McMillian the right to fight the asset seizure in court, a Chesterfield judge ruled that his six legal filings were insufficient and dismissed his effort to reclaim the money without holding a trial. The court’s order in February of 2023 allowed local officials to keep the cash and said Chesterfield police could use it for “law enforcement purposes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his filing arguing the money should be returned, McMilllian said about $31,000 came from the sales of several vintage vehicles, two carports, a shed and an above-ground pool. The rest of it, he contended, came from customers of the auto body shop who paid in cash.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response, the Chesterfield commonwealth’s attorney’s office claimed all McMillian’s responses were faulty because they didn’t include concrete evidence of those transactions apart from McMillian’s sworn statements. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chesterfield Circuit Court Judge Edward A. Robbins Jr. agreed, ruling last year that McMillian had failed to make a legally proper claim to the money. The court issued a default judgment allowing the government to keep the cash, but McMillian appealed that decision.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The appellate court decided McMillian was right, ruling the Chesterfield judge had incorrectly sided with prosecutors who insisted state law didn’t allow McMillian to fight the asset seizure unless his initial court filing included harder evidence like a bank statement, bill of sale or check register.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The examples of evidence listed by the circuit court all constitute exhibits, but exhibits are only one type of evidence that a litigant may use to ultimately prove his case at trial,” Judge Randolph A. Beales wrote in the appellate opinion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McMillian’s sworn statement about the money’s origins, Beales wrote, should have been enough to prevent the lower court from ruling against him without a trial to examine the case further.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The appellate court sent the case back to the Chesterfield court “to hold a trial on the merits of the forfeiture of these assets if the Commonwealth wishes to so proceed to a trial.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The final outcome of the case is unclear. The lack of a trial also meant Chesterfield authorities didn’t have to put forward all evidence they might have disputing McMillian’s explanation of where the money came from.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McMillian’s attorney, John Mann, said his client was “pleased with the ruling.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It tells the circuit courts what is required of a person who’s contesting the order,” Mann said. “You don’t have to attach documents and things like that. You can make a good faith statement.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Chesterfield commonwealth’s attorney’s office, which pushed for the default judgment against McMillian, said it could not comment on the ruling Wednesday because the prosecutor who handled the case was tied up with other business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Juli M. Porto, an attorney with the Blankingship &amp; Keith law firm who follows appellate decisions, said the ruling could result in fewer asset forfeitures in cases where the accused has a “meritorious defense.” A clearer standard for what counts as a sufficient response to an asset forfeiture, she said, means more cases could be decided on the merits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A clear standard is good for all involved — defendants, the Commonwealth, and trial courts — because there is less room for confusion and disparate decisions on the same issue,” Porto said in an email. “Consistent rulings are in everyone’s best interests.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our delegation knows that Vice President Harris is the right choice and leader not only to unify our party, but our country,” Democratic Party of Virginia Chairwoman Susan Swecker said in a news release Tuesday morning. “The Virginia Democratic delegation is thrilled to cast our votes for her historic nomination and support an incredible former senator and prosecutor in defeating convict Donald Trump this November.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic leaders in Virginia circulated an online form seeking pledges of support for Harris, but the party has not yet held a formal vote nominating Harris. The Democratic convention will be held in Chicago from Aug. 19 to Aug. 22.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden stepping aside freed Virginia’s delegates to support a new candidate for president, but no serious contenders have emerged to challenge Harris.</span></p>

(Photo by Greg Nash-Pool/Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even before the presidential debate, according to U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, Democrats were concerned about a perceived lack of energy in their party.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But whatever uncertainty came with President Joe Biden’s decision Sunday to end his campaign and back Vice President Kamala Harris to lead the Democratic ticket, Kaine said the elevation of Harris has brought Democrats a new sense of excitement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I believe she has an upside that Biden probably did not have,” Kaine said on a call with reporters Monday morning, explaining that Biden and former President Donald Trump are so well known there was little they could do to change many voters’ minds. “Now that we can promote her as a pathbreaking prosecutor and attorney general and a history-making vice president who’s been part of a really solid Biden-Harris track record, I think she has an upside.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though it’s too early to measure what impact the Biden-Harris swap will have on the race, the move amounts to a reset in blue-leaning Virginia, where Democrats are expected to win in presidential years but recent polls pointed to a virtually tied race between Biden and Trump. Even though Democrats still had confidence Biden would win Virginia, a recent </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/15/upshot/kamala-harris-biden-poll.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York Times/Siena College poll</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> showed Harris faring slightly better against Trump in Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Multiple polls have shown Kaine, who is seeking to win a third term in the Senate by defeating Republican challenger Hung Cao, running much stronger than Biden this year in his own race. He said he had conversations with the Biden team about some of those polls prior to Biden’s exit, but did not ask them to do anything in response and trusted Biden to make the “patriotic decision.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several Virginia Democrats said they expected a smooth transition for the Democratic campaign apparatus in the state. The same Virginia campaign team will be kept in place, and the 17 Biden-Harris campaign offices in Virginia are expected to continue working on behalf of the ticket, despite Biden’s surprise withdrawal over the weekend.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many Virginia Democrats who publicly backed Biden after his disastrous debate performance last month quickly shifted their support to Harris after the news broke that the president would no longer seek another term in office. Polls have consistently shown many voters felt Biden was too old to effectively serve as president, and those fears seemed to be confirmed by Biden’s faltering answers in the first televised debate against Trump.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Monday, top members of the Virginia Legislative Black Caucus announced they would be fully behind Harris at the upcoming Democratic National Convention when the party will officially select a new nominee. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The eleven VLBC members who will serve as delegates to the convention include House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, and Senate Finance and Appropriations Chair Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, two of the most powerful members of the Virginia General Assembly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“During a time of chaos and uncertainty after the failed presidency of Donald Trump, President Biden and Vice President Harris put America on track and made our recovery from Covid the envy of the world,” the Black Caucus said in a news release. “We honor Joe Biden&#8217;s decency and servant leadership. We join him in our unwavering support for Vice President Harris.”</span></p>
<p>All 21 Democrats in the Virginia Senate also signed on to <a href="https://x.com/ssurovell/status/1815433343749521522/photo/1" target="_blank">a statement</a> endorsing Harris, calling her &#8220;the clear choice to succeed President Biden.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All six Democrats who represent Virginia in the U.S. House of Delegates have endorsed Harris, including Rep. Abigail Spanberger, the Democratic frontrunner in the state’s race for governor next year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Not only will she defeat former President Trump, but she will set an example for our children,” Spanberger said in a statement endorsing Harris. “She will demonstrate how to be a strong, principled leader who is focused on the needs of the American people — not herself.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Mark Warner — the only prominent Virginia Democrat to </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/05/mark-warner-joe-biden-exit-race-democratic-senators/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">publicly lend credence</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the idea of Biden stepping aside — also backed Harris, saying she has the “experience, energy and resolve to lead our nation.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite a few calls from Democrats around the country for an open, competitive process for picking a successor to Biden, there were no such statements from prominent political figures in Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richmond Mayor Levar Stoney, who is a delegate to vote at the upcoming Democratic National Convention next month, said that Harris has been “working the phones for the last 24 plus hours” churning up support from elected leaders from all levels of government including mayors, state legislators and governors, and members of Congress and the U.S. Senate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Vice President Harris said that she wanted to earn our support,” Stoney said of Harris ahead of the convention where she is expected to be formally  named the Democratic nominee. “She wanted to win the nomination, and she&#8217;s doing exactly that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also noted how the Biden-Harris campaign has opened several campaign offices around Virginia this summer, where staff and volunteers will be hard at work on behalf of Harris in the months ahead. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We don&#8217;t have a lot of time. That&#8217;s the one thing that we&#8217;re working against us, is the calendar. We&#8217;ve got to coalesce,” Stoney said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He believes that her experience in California state government, as Vice President, and her time as a U.S. senate — where she applied her prosecutor background to committee hearings — all lend to her appeal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Others have signaled they already see that appeal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Breaking with the tradition of official neutrality in unresolved nominating contests, Democratic Party of Virginia Chair Susan Swecker also signed a statement backing Harris released by an organization that represents all 50 state parties.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harris, who served as California’s attorney general prior to becoming a U.S. senator in 2017, sought the Democratic nomination for president in 2020, but didn’t last long enough to be among the 14 Democrats who appeared on Virginia’s primary ballot that year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Rep. Jennifer McClellan, D-Virginia, noted the role reproductive rights may play in Harris’ campaign and how “women are the best messengers” on the issue. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We can talk about [reproductive health] in a way that resonates with people beyond just the theoretical … because we live these experiences,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McClellan said Harris’ age is another factor that will likely work in her favor. She stands to become the first member of “Generation X” to become president if elected. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Being a new generation of leadership,  she can speak for a lot of voices that have not always had a seat at the table,” McClellan said. “They can relate to her in ways that they haven&#8217;t been able to with any other president.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Republicans reacted to the news by faulting Democrats for turning on the nominee that nearly swept their party’s primaries earlier this year and arguing Harris will still have to answer for the less-popular aspects of the Biden administration’s record.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Make no mistake, whether it’s border czar Kamala Harris or someone else, it’s the Biden/Harris Administration’s weak leadership and resulting chaos around the world and here at home that is on the ballot this November,” Gov. Glenn Youngkin said Sunday in a </span><a href="https://x.com/GlennYoungkin/status/1815117344542441565" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">post on X</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia House Minority Leader Todd Gilbert, R-Shenandoah, said “the &#8216;save democracy&#8217; crowd in the Democrat party finally ousted their democratically-chosen nominee.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No matter who emerges from this mess of their own making, Democrats will continue to make life harder, less prosperous, and more dangerous for all Americans,” Gilbert said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attorney General Jason Miyares, a potential Republican candidate for governor next year, </span><a href="https://x.com/JasonMiyaresVA/status/1815092604054241371" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">went a little further</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, saying Democrats had lied about Biden’s condition and “disenfranchised” millions of primary voters. He also called on Biden to step down from the presidency in addition to ending his campaign, saying “we can’t afford any more weak leadership.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine dismissed the GOP’s calls for Biden to resign as the work of “Republican mischief-makers,” saying he sees a clear difference between Biden being able to serve out the remainder of his term and being healthy enough to serve another four years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The challenge that Joe Biden faced was not about how he’s doing as president today,” Kaine said. “He has a record of achievement that anybody would be proud of. He reached the decision he reached because he couldn’t look the American public in the eye and say: ‘And I’ve got this for the next four-plus years.’”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the incumbent president now no longer in the running, Kaine also described the new race as a contrast between the past and the future. Though he said there’s “zero chance” of him being on the ticket as a vice presidential candidate again as he was in 2016, Kaine said Harris’ opportunity to elevate a new leader from Democrats’ “deep bench” will help make that contrast clearer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He’s yesterday’s chaos,” Kaine said of Trump. “Kamala Harris and her likely VP pick — I have no idea who that will be, but I know the kinds of folks who are being mentioned — they’re about today and tomorrow.”</span></p>

(Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia lawmakers banned skill games years ago after rejecting the argument that slot machine lookalikes don’t count as gambling because they involve more skill than luck. An industry push to convince the General Assembly to repeal that ban failed earlier this year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite that failure, a new type of machine is showing up in Virginia convenience stores based on the legal theory that some skill game variations involve no skill at all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A chief proponent of that theory is former Virginia delegate Steve Heretick, a Hampton Roads-area lawyer who has issued written opinions used by skill game companies and convenience store owners to claim some of the machines can be operated in Virginia because, skill game branding aside, there’s zero skill involved.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an interview, Heretick said his interpretation only applies to so-called “pre-reveal” games, which give players the option of looking ahead to see whether upcoming spins will produce a winning combo of symbols or not. Because players can study the machine to see what’s coming next and choose not to play, Heretick argues, there’s no element of chance that would make the games a form of gambling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With no way for the player to change an outcome that’s already fixed and knowable, Heretick said, the machines are a form of visual entertainment that involve even less skill than a traditional arcade game like pinball. Therefore, he contends, they’re not subject to the skill game ban and should be considered legal unless a court rules otherwise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you know what’s going to happen and you do it anyway, I can’t say that I would be awfully entertained by that,” Heretick said. “But at the same time, there seem to be an awful lot of people who are.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not clear how many skill games or pre-reveal machines remain active, but the brazenness of the effort by some businesses to continue making money from slots-like machines shows the continued weakness of Virginia’s gambling enforcement efforts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heretick, a Democrat who served in the House of Delegates from 2016 to 2021, acknowledged his theory hasn’t been fully tested. He said some of his clients have had criminal charges brought against them for operating pre-reveal games, but he’s trying to convince the courts those charges shouldn’t stick because the games aren’t illegal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As an attorney, I cannot ever advise a client to commit a crime,” Heretick said. “I can’t and I won’t.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tad Berman, a Richmond horse racing enthusiast who closely follows gambling issues in Virginia, feels that’s exactly what Heretick is doing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Mr. Heretick’s contempt for the law is disturbing enough, but through his actions it is also glaringly obvious that he is encouraging others to break the law,” Berman said in an email this month to the office of Attorney General Jason Miyares. “Mr. Heretick needs to explain himself and the businesses that have resumed operating under the pretense of his letter should be ordered to immediately stop operations or be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The attorney general’s office declined to comment when asked if Miyares has looked into the issue or offered guidance to local law enforcement authorities on whether pre-reveal games fall under the skill game ban. When the Supreme Court of Virginia reinstated the skill game ban last year, Miyares offered guidance to local prosecutors on how they should enforce a law that his office had successfully defended in court. The skill game industry had challenged the ban by arguing the machines technically aren’t a form of gambling, but the Supreme Court didn’t buy that claim.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heretick said his advice to clients would change if a court determines pre-reveal games are in fact banned in Virginia.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘No Skill’</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The text of Virginia’s skill game ban seems to at least attempt to cover pre-reveal games. Skill games, the law states, “are no less gambling devices if they indicate beforehand the definite result of one or more operations but not all the operations.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heretick zeroed in on that line in his legal memo, arguing that definition doesn’t apply to pre-reveal games because they do reveal “all the operations” of the machine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Political activist Josh Stanfield said he observed machines labeled “No Chance Game” up and running in the Yorktown area. A photo he took at a local store shows machines with signs saying “No Skill” and “View All Outcomes Before Playing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Paul Krizek, D-Fairfax, who specializes in gambling policy in the General Assembly, said the new emphasis on pre-reveal games shows some companies are “contributing to lawlessness in the commonwealth.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Everybody knows what gambling is,” he said. “You put money in and you have the chance of winning money. It doesn’t matter how it happens.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At least one company that makes a brand of machines still seen in Virginia contributed money to a PAC that has in turn made donations to General Assembly leaders. North Carolina-based Banilla Games, one of the companies whose games Heretick declared legal, gave $10,000 to the Virginia Skill Game PAC. A representative for Banilla said the company has not retained Heretick, does not directly operate any machines in Virginia and does not make money from any Banilla machines that may be operated by third parties. The company does not agree with Heretick that its games can be operated legally in Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That PAC, also funded by a variety of convenience store interests, gave more than $126,000 to General Assembly members across 2023 and 2024. That amount includes $20,000 to House of Delegates Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, $8,000 to Senate Minority Leader Ryan McDougle, R-Hanover, and $5,000 to Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another company whose games have been cleared by Heretick, Royal Skill Games, contributed $50,000 to the Virginia Asian American Store Owner Association, which has made more than $200,000 in contributions to Virginia politicians.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pace-O-Matic, the Georgia-based skill game company that’s one of the biggest players in efforts to legalize the machines in Virginia, hasn’t turned its machines and has not tried to argue pre-reveal games are legal. A spokeswoman for the company said the confusion is all the more reason for Virginia lawmakers to take action clarifying the issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inconsistencies in the interpretation of the law is one of the major reasons why lawmakers should return to Richmond as soon as possible to pass legislation on skill games,” said Pace-O-Matic spokeswoman Rachel Albritton.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heretick agrees that the state should “get its act together and deal with these things once and for all.” But he insisted he and his clients are following the letter of the law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If the General Assembly wants to outlaw all games, it certainly can,” he said. “But it didn’t.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though Gov. Glenn Youngkin and state lawmakers have agreed to continue discussing skill games despite the governor’s decision to </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/20/youngkin-vetoes-bills-on-contraception-access-skill-games-confederate-heritage-rollbacks/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">veto the skill game legalization bill in May</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it’s unclear whether those talks will continue this year or be put off until 2025. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There appears to be at least some overlap between convenience stores continuing to operate skill games in defiance of the law and the lobbying coalition that has been trying to convince policymakers to change the law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A convenience store in western Henrico County had a sign in its window touting skill games on Wednesday afternoon, and the Virginia Mercury observed machines being played inside.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Property and business records for that store point back to a Chesterfield County address that was listed in </span><a href="https://www.vpap.org/lobbying/client/487442-virginia-amusement-coalition/?disclosure_period=19" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lobbying disclosures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the Virginia Amusement Coalition, an advocacy group that hired lobbyists to push for skill game legalization at the General Assembly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Chesterfield location was also listed as the mailing address for the Virginia Skill Game PAC that gave money to General Assembly leaders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sunil Patel, the treasurer of the PAC, said in an interview that he owns the Henrico building where skill games were operational Wednesday, but had leased it to someone else who is in the process of closing the store, which also doubles as a smoke shop. He said the store’s imminent closure is an example of how small businesses have been hurt by the ban on skill games, but he acknowledged the machines should not have been on at his building.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Nobody should operate the skill games,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The anti-skill game group Virginians Against Neighborhood Slot Machines, which is funded by casino interests, said the continued existence of skill games despite the ban shows those pushing the “shady machines” shouldn’t be trusted to act in good faith.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s laughable that they say they want to prevent illegal games when they’re the ones operating illegal games,” said Nick Larson, a spokesman for the group.</span></p>
<p><em><strong>Editor&#8217;s note:</strong> </em><i data-stringify-type="italic">This story has been corrected to reflect the fact that Banilla Games has not retained Steve Heretick nor asked for his advice on the legality of its machines in Virginia. The company says it only manufactures the machines and is not responsible if a third party is operating them in Virginia.</i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, the last day for political parties to get a nominee on the ballot is Sept. 6, according to a </span><a href="https://www.elections.virginia.gov/media/castyourballot/deadlines-calendars/2023-2024-Deadlines-Calendar-FINAL.xlsx" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">list of deadlines</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> published by the Virginia Department of Elections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state’s newly expanded 45-day voting window begins Sept. 20, which means ballots need to be finalized and printed before that key date.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden — who has emphatically rejected calls from within his own party to step aside after his faltering debate performance against former President Donald Trump — easily won Virginia’s Democratic presidential primary on Super Tuesday. However, he won’t officially be the party’s nominee until later this summer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Democratic National Convention is scheduled to run Aug. 19-22. If Biden were to change his mind and step down as the party’s presidential candidate, Democrats would still have a short window after the convention before they’d have to finalize their presidential ticket in Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Sept. 6 deadline is tied to a </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title24.2/chapter5/section24.2-542.1/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">state law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> requiring political parties to certify their presidential nominees “no later than 5:00 p.m. on the sixtieth day before the presidential election.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the process pushes further into September, the need to finalize and print millions of paper ballots poses both logistical and legal challenges for any last-minute efforts to swap out a presidential nominee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia law gives political parties the option of choosing a backup candidate if a nominee withdraws or dies in some elections. But that’s only an option well in advance of Election Day, making Sept. 6 the clearest deadline for a candidate switch to happen. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second presidential debate is scheduled for Sept. 10, just as Virginia ballots are being printed for the start of early voting 10 days later.</span></p>

(Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Glenn Youngkin has called for more transparency as the state looks for new ways to handle the growing costs of a program that provides tuition-free college to spouses and children of military veterans killed or disabled as a result of their service.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Youngkin’s administration isn’t practicing full transparency itself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kayla Owen —  a military spouse who’s also a member of the governor’s task force studying the Virginia Military Survivors and Dependents Education Program — initially submitted a FOIA request to Youngkin&#8217;s office for a handful of officials’ internal communications involving the program. Her initial request didn’t give a timeframe, but she later narrowed it to records going back to June 2023. The administration said it wouldn’t release anything.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s office is withholding the documents, enough to fill two binders, under a sweeping Freedom of Information Act exemption for gubernatorial “working papers and correspondence.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those records would shed light on the Youngkin officials’ discussions about the program prior to VMSDEP being put on the chopping block. They could also offer clarity on what led the administration to draft a bill that included the same VMSDEP downsizing measures the governor now wants to undo. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Moving forward, we need all parties on all sides to commit to transparency or there will never be improvements and harm will continue to be done,” said Owen, who lives in the Fredericksburg area. As a leader of the advocacy group Friends of VMSDEP, Owen was appointed to a spot on Youngkin’s task force reviewing VMSDEP and its future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin has vowed to protect the program from recent cost-cutting reforms he and the Democratic-led General Assembly approved in May, positioning himself as veteran-friendly and eager to help military families that want to preserve the program. He has also called for more openness with affected families, who were angered that the VMSDEP changes were enacted through the state budget instead of being proposed as a standalone bill subject to more public scrutiny.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For weeks, advocates who have called for restoring VMSDEP to its prior state have been trying to figure out how and why the program’s rapid growth over the past five years became a major budgetary concern.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of that effort,  Owen filed a FOIA request with the governor’s office last month. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On June 13, she requested VMSDEP-related communications involving Youngkin Secretary of Education Aimee Guidera, former </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Commissioner of the Virginia Department of Veterans Services Daniel Gade, the State Council for Higher Education of Virginia (SCHEV) and several other officials who could potentially have been involved in policy discussions about VMSDEP.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a few weeks of back-and-forth over the timeline and parameters of the request, Youngkin FOIA officer Denise Burch gave Owen a final answer on July 1. The requested records, Burch wrote, were being “entirely withheld.” Burch did not say exactly how many documents were being withheld, only that the records would fill “two Redwell folders,” an apparent reference to a type of binder used to hold documents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia law says officials must identify the volume of records they’re withholding with “reasonable particularity.” Officials often give an exact number of pages instead of describing how many receptacles the documents fill.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The law also says FOIA exemptions should be applied narrowly in order to maximize government transparency.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like past Virginia governors, Youngkin routinely invokes the working papers and correspondence exemption to shield a wide range of activity involving the governor’s office and cabinet secretaries. The exemption is discretionary, meaning officials can choose to use it but are also free to release records that fall under it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asked why the governor’s office chose not to release the records, Youngkin spokesman Christian Martinez characterized the denial as routine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The records requested, like all similar requests of [the] governor’s working papers and correspondence, are exempt under the FOIA statute,” Martinez said. “However, the administration has been having open dialogue with the veteran and first responder communities, including Friends of VMSDEP and all members of the Preserving VMSDEP Task Force.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The changes to the VMSDEP program, meant to shrink the pool of eligible students and bring in more funding to public colleges and universities, would impose a stricter Virginia residency requirement, prevent the waivers from being used for advanced degrees or a second undergraduate degree and require participants to first pursue other forms of financial aid.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The program currently has around 6,400 participants, according to </span><a href="https://www.dvs.virginia.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/House-Approprations-Committee-Staff-Higher-Education-Update-2024-5-28.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">state data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, up nearly 357% from 2019.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That increase, and the program’s estimated financial cost rising to more than $65 million per year, set off alarms among state officials concerned about runaway growth and potentially unsustainable financial impact on colleges and universities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">General Assembly leaders </span><a href="https://www.vpm.org/news/2024-07-02/general-assembly-vmsdep-repeal-education-military-trauma" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reached a deal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this week to reverse the cost-cutting measures and provide $65 million in each of the next two budget years. Youngkin has signaled his support for the proposal, which is expected to be formally approved when the legislature reconvenes on July 18.</span></p>

(Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia officials on Tuesday certified the results of last month’s congressional primaries and defended the integrity of the state’s voting systems after a contentious election season.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think we can comfortably say we’ve had free and fair elections in this primary,” said former Republican delegate John O’Bannon, who now chairs the Virginia State Board of Elections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 5th District GOP primary fight between incumbent U.S. Rep Bob Good, R-Campbell and state Sen. John McGuire, R-Goochland, led to intense scrutiny of Virginia’s election system due to a close finish involving the two hard-right figures. Both McGuire and Good have previously stoked doubts about whether elections can be trusted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lawyer for McGuire’s campaign spoke to the elections board Tuesday, saying there were no irregularities in the election that would justify doubting the results or failing to certify McGuire’s apparent victory by a little less than 400 votes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are confident in the integrity of this election and the legitimacy of the result,” said Daniel Bruce, an attorney with the Holtzman Vogel law firm representing McGuire’s campaign.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good has signaled he’ll seek a recount in the primary he appears to have narrowly lost. No representative spoke on the congressman’s behalf Tuesday. There was no reason for Good to try to block certification of the primary, because the recount his campaign would have to pay for couldn’t begin until after Tuesday’s vote.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good, who was attacked by former President Donald Trump after Good endorsed Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis for president, now has 10 days to officially seek a recount.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the June 18 primary, Good pointed to several unusual events to cast doubt on the election’s legitimacy, including several fire alarms going off at polling places and officials in the city of Lynchburg mishandling a small number of ballots by failing to follow procedures for an absentee drop box. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Officials said there were normal explanations for the alarms. The drop box issue only involved seven ballots, according to officials.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elections Commissioner Susan Beals, a Republican appointee of Gov. Glenn Youngkin, also gave a speech Tuesday declaring that none of those issues should create doubt about the outcome. Given all the variables involved in the locally driven process of running an election, she said, minor issues are bound to happen sometimes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This local responsibility means that there will be occasional issues with administration, as there are 133 individual elections being held,” Beals said, referring to the number of cities and counties in Virginia. “Any time you have a process that is run by humans, issues may occur. But these are not systemic problems that call into question the results of the election.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other business Tuesday, the state elections board voted unanimously to begin the process of potentially removing a local Republican election official who was accused of failing to perform her duties and being unable to set her partisanship aside.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The board voted to seek the removal of Maria Anne Kinney, a GOP member of the Charles City County Electoral Board </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/28/virginia-board-considers-ousting-gop-election-official-accused-of-sharing-voting-machine-info/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">accused of repeatedly sparring with colleagues</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in her county and behaving in a manner that made other election officials uncomfortable. Kinney is due in court Wednesday on a misdemeanor assault charge related to a county election employee’s claim Kinney pushed her as election business was being conducted last month. State election officials noted they had not verified the veracity of that accusation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">O’Bannon said the board had heard “sufficient factual information” about Kinney’s case to justify asking a court to make the final decision on whether she should be removed from the local board.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re not adjudicating it,” he said. “That will be the court’s job.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking ahead from the primaries, the state elections board conducted a random drawing Tuesday to determine the order in which political party’s candidates will appear on the ballot for the general election. Prior to the drawing, officials announced that the crystal bowl traditionally used for the process had “shattered” after being dropped. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was replaced by a new, similar-looking crystal bowl. The bowl was filled with film canisters containing strips of paper with the name of a political party, and board members drew the canisters from the bowl to determine the ballot order.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats got the top slot, followed by Republicans and an assortment of third parties.</span></p>

(Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the second time this summer, the Virginia Senate returned to Richmond and failed to pass a bill most General Assembly members and many military families want to see advance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another five hours at the Capitol Monday produced no breakthroughs in the slow-burning controversy over the Virginia Military Survivors and Dependents Education Program (VMSDEP), which provides tuition-free college to spouses and children of military members killed or disabled as a result of their service. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For weeks, military families and advocates for veterans have been calling for the immediate reversal of cost-cutting measures aimed at VMSDEP that the legislature and Gov. Glenn Youngkin approved earlier this year. On Friday, the House of Delegates <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/28/virginia-house-votes-to-reverse-changes-to-tuition-program-serving-military-families/#:~:text=By%3A%20Graham%20Moomaw%20%2D%20June%2028%2C%202024%202%3A32%20pm&amp;text=The%20Virginia%20House%20of%20Delegates%20voted%2092%2D0%20Friday%20to,to%20college%20without%20paying%20tuition.">unanimously approved</a> the full repeal bill the families support.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After watching Monday’s Senate session devolve into multi-directional bickering that produced nothing, military families described Virginia’s halls of power as a place where rampant egos have gotten in the way of listening to regular people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are living a political nightmare,” said Kayla Owen, a Fredericksburg-area military spouse leading Friends of VMSDEP, the main advocacy group pushing for the program’s restoration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lack of action means the recently approved changes to the VMSDEP program won’t be rolled back under the deadline policymakers have been working toward for weeks. Monday was the official beginning of the state’s fiscal year, which meant the new budget containing the VMSDEP reforms went into effect.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new changes, which don’t apply to current VMSDEP recipients but will apply to anyone attempting to begin using the program in the future, impose a stricter Virginia residency requirement, prevent the waivers from being used for advanced degrees or a second undergraduate degree and require participants to first pursue other forms of financial aid.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Monday, the Senate’s Democratic leaders battled Youngkin’s administration, the Democratic-led House and Senate Republicans. At the end of the day, Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, portrayed his caucus as the only group in the mix making a serious effort to preserve VMSDEP while reining in its ballooning costs. He accused others of playing politics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Friends of VMSDEP group said that, as far as it’s concerned, the blame for the current situation lies squarely with Surovell and Senate Finance and Appropriations Chair Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lucas and Surovell haven’t gotten on board with proposals to fully repeal the VMSDEP changes. Instead, they’ve offered a series of alternate proposals, none of which have passed their own chamber.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="uaNFzS5Nq3"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/18/virginia-senate-returns-to-richmond-but-fails-to-pass-any-bills/">Virginia Senate returns to Richmond but fails to pass any bills</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Virginia Senate returns to Richmond but fails to pass any bills&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/18/virginia-senate-returns-to-richmond-but-fails-to-pass-any-bills/embed/#?secret=DkieljQXzh#?secret=uaNFzS5Nq3" data-secret="uaNFzS5Nq3" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest proposal Senate Democrats unveiled Monday would have provided $45 million in new funding to offset VMSDEP’s growing financial impact on the state’s public colleges and universities, which legislative analysts say have grown from about $19 million in 2019 to more than $65 million in 2023. Their offer came close to fully repealing the stricter eligibility rules imposed earlier this year, but preserved one modest reform that would’ve required VMSDEP participants to make “satisfactory academic progress” toward earning a degree. The academic progress rule wouldn’t take effect until 2025.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That proposal, Surovell said on the Senate floor, gave VMSDEP supporters “pretty much everything they asked for,” plus tens of millions in new funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Unfortunately we are unable to get some good work done that we had hoped to get done,” Surovell said after it became clear that Senate Republicans were not going to lend their votes to help the body fast-track the bill and allow it to pass on Monday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because the Senate is in a special summertime session, the body needed to take a two-thirds vote to waive a rule requiring the VMSDEP bill to be published for at least 48 hours prior to Monday’s vote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Republicans, who repeatedly asked their Democratic counterparts to pass a clean repeal bill as the House had done, noted that the General Assembly’s rules also required the House to agree to waive the 48-hour rule. Because of that, they said, the Senate technically couldn’t even execute the plan Democratic leaders had come up with for Monday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the Senate had passed a clean repeal bill, the Republicans argued, the VMSDEP controversy could have been over on Monday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want to get it done today. This is not politics,” said Senate Minority Leader Ryan McDougle, R-Hanover. “This is a disagreement about how we get it done.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At a meeting of the Senate Finance and Appropriations Committee Monday afternoon, Surovell said the House’s clean repeal bill was “constitutionally defective” because of a technical formatting issue that had nothing to do with the underlying policy. Therefore, he said, the Senate could not pass that bill and could instead only pass the slightly different repeal bill Lucas had introduced on Monday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Bryce Reeves, R-Spotsylvania, offered to draft a new bill addressing the technical issue Surovell flagged. Lucas said that, according to Senate customs, she is the only senator allowed to introduce budget-related legislation as the chair of the committee that handled the budget.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is my hope that the governor and the House will join me in announcing that we have an agreement,” Lucas said as she introduced her latest proposal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lucas and Surovell said they spent several hours meeting with Youngkin Monday morning attempting to come to an agreement on the VMSDEP issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It didn’t work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement Monday evening, Youngkin criticized the Senate for failing to pass a VMSDEP bill after a similarly fruitless outcome when the Senate <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/18/virginia-senate-returns-to-richmond-but-fails-to-pass-any-bills/">took up the issue on June 18</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Senate Democrat leadership is hurting our military heroes, first responders and their families every time they show up and do nothing, as well as wasting time and taxpayer money,” Youngkin said. “A full, clean repeal, which passed out of the House unanimously, and was supported by a bipartisan majority in the Senate, could have been signed today.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Mark Sickles, D-Fairfax, a high-ranking House member who works on budget issues, briefly appeared before his Senate counterparts during their committee hearing. Sickles too said that if the Senate could go just a little further toward agreeing with the position of the House and the governor, the issue would be “over today.” If the Senate insisted on trying to pass a bill that didn’t quite match, he said, the way forward would remain unclear.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Really, there’s not that much difference between the two bills now,” Sickles said in an interview.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the end of the day, the Senate left town without announcing any plans to return.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the legislature can’t pass a bill, Youngkin hinted he might force both chambers to return.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Senate and House need to agree to return next week, on the same day, so we can settle this issue once and for all, with the clean, and full, repeal bill,” the governor said. “If they can’t agree on coming back together to fix this, I will call them back to do exactly that.”</span></p>

(Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia House of Delegates voted 92-0 Friday to reverse recent cost-cutting measures aimed at a state program that helps the families of killed or wounded soldiers go to college without paying tuition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a quick and drama-free morning at the Capitol, the House easily passed a repeal bill nearly every Democratic and Republican member had co-sponsored, drawing sustained applause from military families who had filled the House gallery to support its passage. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The outrage many of those families have expressed over what they saw as an underhanded effort to strip benefits for military service is what drew delegates back to Richmond for a rare late June workday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s often been said if you find yourself in a hole you don’t want to be in, stop digging,” Del. Mike Cherry, R-Colonial Heights, said prior to the vote. “Today, I’m glad that we stopped digging.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislation, which now faces an unclear fate in the Virginia Senate, would fully restore the Virginia Military Survivors and Dependents Education program to its former state, before policymakers adopted narrower eligibility criteria for the program in May.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, said that as a veteran himself taking care of veterans is his “highest priority.” But he added he couldn’t predict how the Senate would react to the unanimous, bipartisan action by the House.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Far be it from little old Don to ever presume what the Senate might do,” Scott said, adding that he’ll leave it to Senate Finance and Appropriations Chair Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, to “work her magic.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, Lucas refused to docket a bill identical to what the House passed Friday. The Senate will reconvene Monday, and can either take up the bill the House approved or continue pursuing alternative proposals it has put forth that stop short of fully reversing the actions taken earlier this year.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a show of numbers in favor of repealing the changes, nearly all 100 delegates and 20 senators signed on as patrons for the bill the House approved Friday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The budget is set to take effect Monday with the start of a new fiscal year, but the Democratic-led General Assembly and Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin haven’t agreed on the best way to respond to an outcry from military families and veteran groups angered by policymakers doing little to seek public feedback on a significant policy decision impacting veterans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement Friday, Youngkin thanked the House for its vote and called for the Senate to support the bill fully reversing the VMSDEP changes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We must ensure that any potential changes to the program occur transparently in a regular legislative session with input from our valued veterans and their families,” the governor said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The recent changes to the VMSDEP program — inspired by growing concerns in the higher education world that colleges and universities were being asked to enroll a rising number of students for free — impose a stricter Virginia residency requirement, prevent the waivers from being used for advanced degrees or a second undergraduate degree and require participants to first pursue other forms of financial aid before using the program.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The changes weren’t made through regular legislation subject to committee hearings, public feedback and a recorded vote by lawmakers on the VMSDEP issue alone. Instead, the changes were tucked into a nearly 700-page budget, a process advocates for veterans have blasted as lacking both transparency and input from the families directly impacted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic leaders in the Senate have been less eager to fully reverse the VMSDEP changes, arguing the costs of the program have ballooned so rapidly they’ve become too large to ignore or push off to a later date. Data presented at legislative hearings showed the financial impact of the program on universities had swelled from about $12 million in 2019 to more than $65 million in 2023. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That growth came as more and more participants signed up for the benefit, partly due to the state ramping up efforts to market the VMSDEP program to military families who were eligible for it under the prior rules.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Senate convened last week to take up the VMSDEP issue, but produced nothing to show for it after failing to take up any legislation. Senate leaders released a new proposal Thursday evening that would not fully reverse the changes but would instead delay them for a year and provide $45 million in funding to cover the cost to higher education institutions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Senate also called for legislative researchers to study the program and provide more comprehensive data on how it’s used.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The House and Governor should accept this proposal, as it is the only solution that funds the cost of the program and provides an independent review of the data to help with additional program recommendations,” Lucas said in a news release.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking to reporters after Friday’s vote, Scott, the House speaker, indicated more conversations may need to happen between the House and the Senate. He also said it’s possible the House will have to return at a later date if the Senate chooses to only pass the proposal it unveiled Thursday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If they vote on it and it comes to the House, we’ll give it due consideration at that time,” Scott said.</span></p>

Minority Leader Tommy Norment, R-James City, in 2020. (Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few weeks ago, former Virginia Senate GOP leader Tommy Norment contacted a pair of Charles City County election officials with an unusual request.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an attorney, Norment is representing a Republican member of the Charles City Electoral Board, Maria Anne Kinney, whose feud with other election officials in the county has led to her facing a misdemeanor assault charge. That charge, set to be heard in court next month, arose from an alleged shoving incident at the county’s election office on June 11.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With tensions rising just before the June 18 primary, Norment said it might be best for the two election officials, Registrar DeNay Harris and her deputy Lisa Cosby, to steer clear of Kinney on election day in the small county east of Richmond.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though all three women had jobs to do overseeing primary voting, Norment specifically asked Harris and Cosby not to go to the polling place where Kinney would be.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you insist on stopping at her precinct in spite of my respectful request, please do NOT approach her or speak to her in any manner whatsoever,” Norment wrote in the June 14 email. “I have asked Mrs. Kinney to call my cell phone if you do come to her assigned precinct. If need be I will dispatch a sheriff’s deputy to the precinct to [ensure] there is not interaction initiated on your behalf. We do not need to escalate this situation.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If Harris and Cosby had any questions or concerns, Norment added, they should “contact an attorney of your choosing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harris, Charles City’s top election official, didn’t take it as a respectful request. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t believe you can tell me not to attend the polling place when it is my job,” Harris wrote, adding that she felt Norment had no business contacting Cosby at all because Cosby is the alleged victim in the pending assault case.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sharply worded email exchange between a local election official and an ex-senator whose final term in office expired at the end of 2023 was recently shared with the State Board of Elections. Before the assault accusation emerged, the board was already trying to decide whether Kinney’s conduct should lead to her being removed from her role overseeing elections in Charles City.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The emails were included in a </span><a href="https://townhall.virginia.gov/L/GetFile.cfm?File=Meeting%5C151%5C39263%5CAgenda_ELECT_39263_v1.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">trove of material</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about the conflict in Charles City published as part of the agenda for next Tuesday’s state elections board meeting. At that meeting, the board will certify the primary results and potentially make a decision on what to do about Kinney.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The controversy involves a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/28/virginia-board-considers-ousting-gop-election-official-accused-of-sharing-voting-machine-info/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">variety of allegations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> against Kinney, mostly centered on claims she’s refused to carry out the duties of an electoral board member and has been unable to act in a nonpartisan manner. Kinney, who joined the board in January, has disputed most of those accusations, saying her attempts to get situated as a new member have been stymied by open hostility from her colleagues.</span></p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Virginia board considers ousting GOP election official accused of sharing voting machine info&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/28/virginia-board-considers-ousting-gop-election-official-accused-of-sharing-voting-machine-info/embed/#?secret=Zz21rosplX#?secret=KLBMBh8N33" data-secret="KLBMBh8N33" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state board first heard details of the Charles City matter on May 28, but deferred a decision on whether Kinney should be removed so that it could gather more evidence. The state board can’t remove Kinney from the county board on its own, but can initiate legal proceedings to have a judge consider removing her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even with Charles City on notice that the state was watching, things didn’t cool down in the county’s election office. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The assault charge was leveled after a June 11 meeting at the election office focused on pre-processing of absentee ballots. Harris told state officials Kinney arrived with another Republican representative who wanted to observe the process. Amid a dispute over whether the process was or wasn’t open to the public, Kinney pushed past Cosby, according to multiple witness accounts sent to state election officials.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cosby reported the alleged push to law enforcement the next day. An incident report from the county sheriff’s office said Cosby related that Kinney “pushed into the left side of Cosby’s body forcing her way back into the room.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The feud spilling over into the court system appeared to be what got Norment involved and preceded his email to Harris and Cosby.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The records show Norment replied to Harris less than 10 minutes after she fired back at him. He said he respected her position and was “merely trying to avoid any further interactions that might exacerbate the situation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I will not contact you again as I think you have overreacted,” Norment wrote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harris didn’t let it go.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I appreciate your concern for me, but I am not the one who is overreacting,” she wrote. “I responded to an email from a very seasoned Attorney who contacted me and the victim, which is very intimidating when we are already scared and have issues with what happened. So I apologize if you believe my response to your demand was what seemed to be overreacting”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Norment then said he didn’t mean to “irritate” Harris, offered an apology if he offended her and predicted the primary would go smoothly if  “everyone is civil and just does their job.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In her final response, Harris said Norment had “bullied” her and Cosby and said she agreed “no communication is best at this point.” Norment said he had no intention of bullying, adding “if you felt that way, I apologize.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harris declined to comment further. Norment didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday morning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though personal beefs aren’t all that unusual in local government, the situation in Charles City has raised a novel problem: What happens if two people in charge of carrying out critical election business can’t coexist in the same room?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a subsequent email, Norment informed Harris that Kinney wouldn’t be attending the county’s post-primary canvass on June 20 because a judge had approved a preliminary protective order instructing Kinney to have no contact with Cosby. Norment said that meant the two parties can’t be within 100 feet of each other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I do not even want the opportunity for a technical violation,” he wrote.</span></p>

(2019 photo by Julia Rendleman)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the mid-April day when the Virginia General Assembly was voting on whether to give the city of Petersburg permission to pursue a casino, Sen. Lashrecse Aird sent a text message to a top city official saying she needed a document sooner rather than later.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">City Manager March Altman texted Aird on the morning of April 17 to tell her he’d send a signed letter of intent saying the city was picking Bally’s as its private-sector casino partner. A week later — after Petersburg got what it wanted from the legislature —  city officials declared the Bally’s letter meant nothing, canceled the competitive bidding process they had been following and picked a competing casino developer, Baltimore-based Cordish Companies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But on the day of the General Assembly vote, according to communications records The Virginia Mercury obtained via the Freedom of Information Act, the letter was treated as important for whatever the legislature was about to do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Altman told Aird he probably wouldn&#8217;t be able to get her the letter until “noon/early afternoon” due to a busy meeting schedule.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I understand but we gavel in at noon so I really need no later than,” Aird replied.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eight minutes before noon, Altman told Aird the letter was in her email inbox.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I understand from Jameson that you’re upset,” Aird replied, referring to her Chief of Staff Jameson Babb. “I apologize for cutting our time short.”</span></p>

Lashrecse Aird, D-Petersburg (light gray).</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bally’s letter transmitted from the city to its state senator that day has sparked dueling allegations of impropriety. Petersburg officials have said they were facing pressure to pick a casino partner in accordance with political demands coming from the General Assembly, which seemed to prefer certain groups over others. </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/04/30/petersburg-senator-denies-claim-she-interfered-in-citys-casino-process/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several state legislators</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have portrayed the letter as an act of deception by a city government that concealed its true intentions and repeatedly shrouded its casino ambitions in secrecy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the controversy over how Petersburg won permission to host a casino, the city is pressing ahead with its plan to put the issue on the ballot this fall for city residents to give the idea an up-or-down vote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The text messages, which appear to be an incomplete record due to the city’s scattershot approach to complying with FOIA, don’t definitively prove one story to be true. Instead, they arguably lend credence to both narratives.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘He is OK with the letter’</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A day before his exchange with Aird, Altman sent a text to Petersburg spokesman Joanne Williams saying he had “issues” with the letter but was “directed to sign it.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Altman didn’t respond to an email asking who exactly directed him to sign the document. However, the text exchanges strongly suggest the Petersburg City Council told him to sign it as part of a closed-door meeting that took place that same day.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_39086" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:278px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/issues.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-39086 size-medium" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/issues-278x300.jpg" alt="" width="278" height="300" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/issues-278x300.jpg 278w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/issues-950x1024.jpg 950w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/issues-768x828.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/issues-1425x1536.jpg 1425w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/issues.jpg 1468w" sizes="(max-width: 278px) 100vw, 278px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  A text exchange between Petersburg City Manager March Altman (dark gray) and city spokeswoman Joanne Williams (light gray).</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prior to the April 16 council meeting, Altman texted Williams to ask if Petersburg Mayor Sam Parham had a copy of the letter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes and he is sending to Council members and making phone calls to line up votes. He is OK with the letter,” Williams said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That cuts against the Petersburg City Council’s claims in an official resolution that the letter was “never formally authorized by City Council” and was only signed in response to a “demand” that the city sign it or risk losing the General Assembly vote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an interview this week, Aird said the letter was essentially the city’s idea.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They wanted to know how they could provide an indicator to the General Assembly about what their intentions were,” she said. “I still stand on the fact that, at the end of the day, the city came to me and said they wanted me to have something in hand in case questions came up prior to the vote.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the text records show Aird urging Altman to speed up the process of giving her the letter, they don’t show that she told him or anyone else to select Bally’s.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aird said she kept the Bally’s letter “in a folder” in case she needed it on the day of the vote, but she acknowledged that labor groups were also made aware of its existence. A PAC tied to a hospitality union with a strong interest in the Petersburg casino project spent </span><a href="https://www.vpap.org/committees/440840/donor/391036/?start_year=2023&amp;end_year=2023&amp;contrib_type=B" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more than $800,000</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last year helping Aird get elected to Petersburg’s Senate seat. That union, Unite Here, had a labor deal in place with Bally’s and several other companies that vied for Petersburg’s casino project, but not with Cordish.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unite Here had sent a letter to House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, and Senate Finance and Appropriations Chair Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, highlighting the fact that the union had labor deals in place with Bally’s and Rush Street Gaming, the company that operates the Rivers Casino in Portsmouth and was bidding for a second Virginia casino in Petersburg.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The union sent the letter to Scott and Lucas on April 14, a few days before Petersburg officials signed off on the idea of signaling to the General Assembly that they were picking one of the companies that had a deal with Unite Here.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘Won’t make a difference’</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The text messages indicate Petersburg officials saw Scott and Lucas as key decision-makers that could determine the casino’s fate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After Williams sent Altman a local news article on April 11 about prospective casino developers preparing to make public pitches at an upcoming town hall meeting, Altman texted back: “Won’t make a difference.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s correct,” Williams replied. “I still think Lucas will tell LA it must be Rush.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The “LA” appears to be a shorthand reference to Aird.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the Petersburg casino bill made its way through the legislature early this year, it hit a snag in the House of Delegates. A clause was added to the legislation requiring the bill to be reapproved a second time. That was widely seen at the Capitol as a way to give the legislature more leverage over the process by stalling the casino and requiring final go-ahead from the state later this year or next year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On April 17, the General Assembly was voting on a recommendation from Gov. Glenn Youngkin to remove that clause and free Petersburg to ask its voters to approve a casino this fall.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As voting got underway, Aird sent Altman a photo of the Senate voting board showing the Petersburg casino bill had passed the chamber 32-8.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Now Don’s world,” Altman replied as the two awaited the vote in the House, which approved the bill 80-19.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">No text messages from the mayor</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Mercury requested email and text communications related to the casino project or the legislation enabling it involving Altman, Williams and Parham. The timeframe of the request was April 11 through April 18.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to the FOIA request, city officials only provided text messages from Altman’s phone, some of which showed text exchanges between him and Williams.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asked why texts weren’t provided for all three officials identified in the FOIA request, city officials relayed that the mayor said he had no text messages related to the casino from that week. Documents show a city official texted the mayor to ask if he had any text messages responsive to the Mercury’s FOIA request, indicating he deals with at least some public business via text. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the city’s FOIA response to be accurate, the mayor would have neither sent nor received any text messages related to the casino during an 8-day period when the city held its casino town hall, had a closed council meeting on its casino plans and won the General Assembly’s permission to proceed with the biggest economic development project in the city’s history.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When asked by other city officials to provide emails responsive to the Mercury’s FOIA request, Parham sent back numerous documents that were outside the date range specified. For example, the mayor provided records related to a different FOIA request made by the Petersburg Progress-Index on May 14.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other city officials noticed that some of the records the mayor was sending didn’t align with the parameters he was given.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Please ensure that this is what was requested,” Tangi Hill, executive assistant to the city manager and clerk for the City Council, wrote to city FOIA officer Shaunta’ Beasley. “It appears to be outside of the dates requested.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Records show the city’s FOIA officer asked the city manager, city spokeswoman and mayor to send over emails and text messages they felt were relevant to the Mercury’s request. City officials didn’t answer questions about what steps they took to verify that the responses were accurate and complete.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many emails the city provided were completely redacted under a FOIA exemption for attorney-client privilege.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Williams, the city spokeswoman, initially said she had no casino text messages that weren’t already provided in the exchanges pulled from Altman’s phone. However, in those records Williams mentions a separate text she received from Babb, Aird’s chief of staff, which shows she had at least one casino-related text message that wasn’t provided.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After being asked several times to explain the discrepancy, on Wednesday evening city officials provided some additional text exchanges between Williams and Babb, nearly a month after the Mercury first sent the FOIA request. Those messages weren&#8217;t particularly revealing, showing brief remarks between the two when the casino bill passed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The text messages also show discussions about who should be identified as the source of the Bally’s letter, which came from Aird’s office, as it was being circulated among city officials.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Jameson asked that I take ownership of writing the letter,” Williams wrote to Altman on April 16. “That’s fine with me. I did proof and make suggestions.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the Mercury asked for a copy of the Bally’s letter two days later on April 18, Williams offered the city manager her thoughts on how it could be kept under wraps even though a top city official had signed it and sent it to a state senator before a key public vote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Not answering the VA Mercury inquiry,” she wrote to Altman. “We have no completely executed document. At the most, we would not have to produce any documents, if there was a completed document, for 5 days under FOIA.”</span></p>

Whether the state treats it as gambling or not depends on which app you use.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State lawmakers are expressing growing concern about the fuzzy line between sports betting and fantasy sports contests that have gotten closer and closer to mimicking full-blown gambling. Several states have already clamped down on fantasy apps for getting too close to sports betting, and Virginia could be next.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s a compliance nightmare,” said Del. Paul Krizek, D-Fairfax, who’s planning to introduce legislation for the 2025 General Assembly session clarifying the state’s approach to sports wagering.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fantasy sports games are tied to how well a group of individual athletes selected by the fantasy player perform. In 2016, Virginia became the </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/virginia-poised-to-become-first-state-with-legal-framework-for-daily-fantasy-sports/article_cd27faa2-0e4e-54c1-9707-c97bf9674c39.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">first state in the country</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to formally legalize fantasy contests with cash prizes at stake.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Full-blown sports betting, which Virginia legalized in 2020, lets gamblers put money on the outcome of a particular sporting event, taking their chances on whether a team will win or lose or on how many points both teams will score.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The blurriness between fantasy and betting comes from proposition bets, which involve wagering on specific metrics like how many passing yards an NFL quarterback will throw for, or how many rebounds an NBA player will grab. In prop betting, gamblers try to predict whether an athlete will go over or under a stat number set by oddsmakers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s an abundance of prop bets available on sports betting apps in Virginia, which are subject to gambling taxes and age limits preventing anyone under 21 from wagering. However,  a nearly identical form of prop betting is now offered on fantasy platforms that don’t generate gambling taxes and are available to anyone over 18.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This could lead to some cause for confusion,” John Mohrmann, a lobbyist for the sports betting company DraftKings, told Virginia General Assembly members at a recent meeting of a subcommittee focused on how the state could make its gambling laws more cohesive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Krizek, who helps lead that subcommittee, said that, at a minimum, the age limit should be 21 for both sports betting and for-cash fantasy games.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It needs to be reined in,” he said in an interview.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traditional fantasy sports contests, which predate the current sports betting boom, involve assembling a roster of players from different teams, then measuring that roster’s statistical performance against an opponent’s roster. The newer type of fantasy contest — offered on apps like PrizePicks and Underdog Fantasy — allows users to instead try to predict the stats of as few as two individual athletes, without competing against other fantasy players.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To demonstrate the discrepancy in the state’s newly relaxed gambling laws, Mohrmann explained different ways Virginians can try to make money off two of the best players in football.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On sports betting apps, wagerers could place a prop bet that San Francisco 49ers running back Christian McCaffrey would get more than 90 rushing yards coupled with a bet that Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes would throw for more than 260 passing yards. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That two-pronged parlay bet on big-name sports betting apps like FanDuel and DraftKings would pay out a little less than $25 in winnings on a $10 wager, Mohrmann said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An equivalent $10 “entry” fee on the fantasy sports platform PrizePicks, he said, would pay out $30 if a user correctly predicted both Mahomes and McCaffrey would exceed the same yardage numbers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though there may be virtually no difference between the two to the bettor, the regulatory system created by state policymakers has two different agencies enforcing two sets of rules for what is essentially the same activity: Trying to win money by foreseeing sports outcomes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think they’re kind of taking advantage of the lack of regulatory oversight,” Krizek said of the fantasy sports apps’ efforts to recreate player prop bets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement, a group called the Coalition for Fantasy Sports noted “Virginia was at the vanguard of protecting fantasy sports” and said the companies it represents are “committed to being fully compliant both federally and in the commonwealth of Virginia.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As licensed operators, we look forward to working with legislators now and in the future to ensure all fantasy contests are regulated appropriately and Virginians get to continue to play the games they love,” said JT Foley, the coalition’s executive director. The coalition is made up of PrizePicks, Underdog Fantasy, Betr and Dabble.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sports betting is regulated by the Virginia Lottery, which requires betting platforms to pay a $250,000 fee when first applying for a permit and a $200,000 yearly renewal fee. Fantasy sports are overseen by the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (VDACS), which assesses an $8,300 fee for initial permits and yearly renewals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regular sports betting apps also generate money devoted to gambling addiction resources. Fantasy apps do not.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Bryce Reeves, R-Spotsylvania, zeroed in on that point during last week’s meeting of the gambling commission study committee he leads along with Krizek.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We look forward to working with you to kind of clean some of this up and get it to fair and equal ground,” Reeves told the representative from DraftKings, which offers both regular sports betting and fantasy contests in Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attorney General Jason Miyares weighed in on the issue in a </span><a href="https://www.oag.state.va.us/files/Opinions/2023/23-058-Williams-issued.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">formal advisory opinion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> late last year. He concluded that the type of fantasy games in question should legally be considered sports betting because players aren’t competing against other players.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In light of that, Miyares wrote, any fantasy operator offering games based on over/under stat lines “must comply with the permitting requirement of the sports betting program established by the Virginia Lottery Board.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Miyares opinion doesn’t appear to have sparked any major enforcement against fantasy operators in Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In several other states, fantasy operators have agreed to pay steep fines or have ceased operations altogether as regulators have reined in pick’em style games. Several companies that have come under scrutiny elsewhere are listed among the </span><a href="https://www.vdacs.virginia.gov/pdf/registeredfcoperators.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">17 fantasy operators</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> licensed in Virginia by VDACS. The Lottery has issued 15 active </span><a href="https://www.valottery.com/aboutus/casinosandsportsbetting/sportsbetting" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sports betting permits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asked why regulators haven’t enforced the attorney general’s interpretation of the law, VDACS spokesman Michael Wallace said the agency “does not have jurisdiction over sports betting.” He also said the state doesn’t collect data on how much money Virginians are spending on fantasy sports.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Lottery collects that data for sports betting. In 2023, Virginians </span><a href="https://www.axios.com/local/richmond/2024/02/09/virginia-sport-betting-handles-2023" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bet roughly $5.6 billion on sports</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the most high-profile contest in Virginia — the intra-GOP brawl between incumbent Rep. Bob Good and state Sen. John McGuire — was too close to call as of 10 p.m Tuesday evening, three hours after the polls closed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Navy veteran Hung Cao won a lopsided victory in a Republican primary to take on Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine in November, several competitive House of Representatives districts saw hard-fought battles for both parties.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are the primary results so far:</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">10th District: Subramanyam prevails </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subramanyam, D-Loudoun, bested 11 other Democratic candidates to win the party’s nomination in the blue-leaning but competitive 10th District based in Northern Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subramanyam, a lawyer and former White House technology advisor in the Obama administration, has served in the Virginia General Assembly since 2020. He was endorsed for the 10th District seat by incumbent Rep. Jennifer Wexton, D-Loudoun, who is stepping down from public service after being diagnosed with a severe neurological disorder.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The runner-up in the Democratic contest was Del. Dan Helmer, D-Fairfax. Former Virginia Education Secretary Atif Qarni finished in third place, followed by former House Speaker Eileen Filler-Corn in fourth and Sen. Jennifer Boysko, D-Fairfax, in fifth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the Republican contest, attorney and technology executive Mike Clancy easily defeated three other GOP contenders. Clancy will likely face an uphill battle in a district Wexton won by 6 percentage points in 2022.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">7th District: Vindman’s victory</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eugene Vindman, a military officer who rose to national fame by helping his twin brother blow the whistle on former President Donald Trump’s conduct in office, won the Democratic nomination for the competitive 7th District seat being vacated by Rep. Abigail Spanberger, D-Prince William.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vindman’s anti-Trump profile helped him crush his Democratic rivals in fundraising and helped him win around 50% of the vote in a seven-person primary. Early results showed Del. Elizabeth Guzman, D-Prince William, finishing second.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former Green Beret turned lawyer Derrick Anderson won the GOP nomination in the district, defeating fellow military veteran Cameron Hamilton. Four other Republican candidates were in the running, but the results reflected what was essentially a two-person race between Anderson and Hamilton.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spanberger is running for governor in 2025 instead of seeking reelection to Congress.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Based largely in Prince William, Spotsylvania and Stafford counties, the district also covers rural bits of central Virginia and has been seen as in play for Republicans as they seek to hold their majority in the House. In 2022, Spanberger defended her seat by 4.6 percentage points against Prince William supervisor Yesli Vega. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">2nd District: Smasal wins, will take on Kiggans</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over in Virginia Beach, a Democratic primary set the stage for a general election that will likely draw national attention. Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee-backed Navy veteran Missy Cotter Smasal topped Democratic challenger attorney Jake Denton. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Denton trailed in fundraising, as Cotter Smasal had notched big endorsements from U.S. House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries — who stands likely to become Speaker of the House if Democrats regain that chamber — along with all six of Virginia’s Democratic representatives and former governors Ralph Northam and Terry McAuliffe. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Incumbent Rep. Jenn Kiggans’ seat is among vulnerable Republicans that Democratic national groups are targeting ahead of November for potential to flip. Kiggans is a Navy veteran and nurse who previously served in Virginia’s state senate. She defeated fellow Navy veteran Elaine Luria in 2022 by 3.4 percentage points. The Virginia Beach-anchored district has oscillated between Democratic and Republican control over the years and is expected to be very competitive for both women by November. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">1st District: Mehta succeeds</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attorney Leslie Mehta, who formerly worked for the American Civil Liberties Union of Virginia, handily beat former New Kent County treasurer Herb Jones in a two-way Democratic primary.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She’ll now take on Rep. Rob Wittman, R-Westmoreland, in a Republican-leaning district.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mehta received a high-profile endorsement from Spanberger in the primary.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">5th District: Good v. McGuire, too close to call </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The results of the 5th District congressional primary contest weren’t solidified hours after voting ended, with Good and McGuire each pulling nearly 50% of all counted ballots Tuesday night.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s largest congressional district attracted a national audience as GOP heavyweights campaigned with both men. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On election eve, once-and-possibly-future president Donald Trump had a virtual rally for McGuire, while Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga stumped for McGuire at multiple events and posted videos on social media in the weeks leading up to the election.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ibqwUuuoKW"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/05/marjorie-taylor-green-calls-bob-good-a-liar-and-john-mcguire-a-loyalist-at-rally/">Marjorie Taylor Greene calls Bob Good a ‘liar’ and John McGuire a ‘loyalist’ at rally</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Marjorie Taylor Greene calls Bob Good a ‘liar’ and John McGuire a ‘loyalist’ at rally&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/05/marjorie-taylor-green-calls-bob-good-a-liar-and-john-mcguire-a-loyalist-at-rally/embed/#?secret=G7dMLgfeqf#?secret=ibqwUuuoKW" data-secret="ibqwUuuoKW" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Good had reinforcements from Florida congressman Matt Gaetz and Texas congressman Chip Roy. Good was also joined by former Trump strategist Steve Bannon (weeks before he’s </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/steve-bannon-contempt-jan-6-committee-prison-2da50bcf2f8ff8f3e01ef4bf2b1b845e#" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">due in federal prison</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for denying a subpoena related to a congressional investigation into the U.S. Capitol insurrection of Jan. 6, 2021). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At a June 7 event in Powhatan, Bannon said “prison is not gonna be that bad” and compared his upcoming sentence to his Navy service. “It’s just serving my country in a different way.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also praised Good for his service as an elected official and chair of the House Freedom Caucus, congress’ most conservative group. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While he had a high profile former Trump strategist backing him, he lacked the support of Trump himself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though both candidates share conservative Republican policy stances and have expressed admiration for Trump, it’s Good’s brief endorsement of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis that has haunted him. Trump’s team also sent a cease and desist letter to Good’s campaign for using signs with his name that implied an endorsement he doesn’t have. </span></p>

But things didn’t go according to plan Tuesday as the Senate spent a whole day in Richmond without taking up a single bill.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Supporters of bills to legalize skill games and reverse recent cost-cutting measures imposed on a program that allows some military families to get tuition-free college filled a meeting room Tuesday morning to see the Senate act on the two hot-button issues that were expected to be on the agenda.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Senate committee that was supposed to get the day rolling Tuesday morning gaveled in an hour late as senators repeatedly ducked in and out of backroom huddles. And when the Senate Finance and Appropriations Committee meeting got underway, Chair Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, announced the committee wouldn’t be voting on either topic after all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When that committee meeting ended, Democrats leaders hinted they had a backup plan in the works as they headed to the Senate floor. When that plan also failed to gain traction, the Senate wrapped up its day without much of anything happening except speeches.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m livid. It’s ridiculous,” said Norfolk military wife Suzanne Wheatley. “I took a day out of my life, I took a day out of my child’s life, to be here.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lack of action left both issues in limbo as the Senate left town again with a vague agreement to reconvene by July 1.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wheatley and several other people who traveled to Richmond Tuesday expressed disgust over what they saw as a round of political sniping over veteran benefits that went nowhere and gave them no clarity on what the state intends to do about the Virginia Military Survivors and Dependents Education Program, or VMSDEP.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s a move-the-goalposts exercise,” said Stafford County military veteran and advocate Caitlin Goodale-Porter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VMSDEP waives public higher education for spouses and children of military members killed or severely disabled as a result of their service. Alarmed by a spike in the numbers of students using the benefit and the associated costs for state colleges, policymakers recently changed the rules of the program to make fewer families eligible for it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bipartisan budget deal approved last month imposed a stricter Virginia residency requirement, prevents the waivers from being used for advanced degrees or a second undergraduate degree and requires participants to first pursue other forms of financial aid and only use VMSDEP for remaining costs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though Democrats have pointed out many Republicans backed the VMSDEP changes before demanding that they be reversed, Democrats are split over whether they should go along with Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s call to immediately repeal the VMSDEP reforms. The inaction Tuesday gave Republicans an easier opening to argue dysfunction in the Democratic-controlled legislature was preventing a policy misstep from being fixed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lucas refused to docket a bill backed by the Senate Republicans and at least four Senate Democrats, numbers that could’ve given the legislation enough votes to pass in a chamber where Democrats hold a slim 21-19 majority.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I stand with our military heroes, first responders, and their families today who are stunned that Senate Democrat leadership failed to even consider a simple bill, supported by a bipartisan majority of Senators, to reverse the changes to VMSDEP by fully repealing the language, and addressing this in the full light of day,” Youngkin said in a statement late Tuesday afternoon. “These men and women deserve so much better.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two Democratic lawmakers — Sens. Jennifer Boysko, D-Fairfax and Suhas Subramanyam, D-Loudoun — were absent from the Capitol Tuesday as they both competed in a congressional primary election the same day. Given the lack of votes in the Senate, it’s unclear if their absence affected Democrats’ decision to not bring any bills to the floor. All 19 Republicans were present, giving the GOP equal voting strength to Democrats with Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears acting as the tie-breaker.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both parties in the House of Delegates have expressed support for passing a complete repeal bill like the one Lucas blocked when the House returns to the Capitol on June 28.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic leaders in the Senate said it was Republicans who were being intransigent by refusing to work with the majority party.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Republican caucus wouldn’t cooperate with us on any of the two solutions we proposed,” Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, told reporters after the Senate finished for the day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lucas had filed a bill partially rolling back the VMSDEP changes by ensuring that anyone using VMSDEP to enroll in classes this fall wouldn’t be impacted by the eligibility changes and exempting the families of veterans killed or wounded in combat with a 90% disability rating. Democrats have said that proposal would reduce the disruption to college plans military families say they’ve experienced since the budget was passed, while also moving the program closer to its original purpose of helping families impacted by war instead of being a more open-ended benefit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the committee meeting, Lucas faulted the governor as she explained the decision to not take up her own bill. On Monday, Youngkin’s office had said the governor would not act on a skill game bill until the General Assembly had fully repealed the VMSDEP changes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yesterday the governor seemed to indicate that he wouldn’t sign a skill game bill until after the VMSDEP changes are repealed,” Lucas said. “I’m not going to pit constituents against each other. We care about all of you. We need solutions on both issues. And we’ll have to continue working in both.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lucas announced that she was creating a legislative work group to study VMSDEP and directing the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission to take a deeper look at data showing how the program is or isn’t working as intended. Youngkin has already convened his own task force to study the program.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats proposed another VMSDEP fix: simply delaying the effective date of the changes until Oct. 1 while the work group conducted its research. That idea went nowhere, Surovell said, because Republicans wouldn’t agree to help Democrats with procedural votes to get it onto the floor Tuesday.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When questioned by reporters as she left the Capitol, Lucas didn’t give a clear answer on what she would do if the House sends the Senate a VMSDEP bill like the one she blocked Tuesday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ll make up my mind then,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In floor speeches, several Republicans senators blasted the process as fundamentally undemocratic, suggesting Lucas’s rule over her committee shouldn’t outweigh the majority opinion of the 40-person Senate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill to fully repeal the VMSDEP changes, said Sen. Glen Sturtevant, R-Chesterfield, has “majority support in the Senate.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And yet despite these folks getting up early today and driving here, they didn’t get to have that bill heard,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans could have attempted to bring the full repeal bill to the floor over Lucas’s objections, a little-used parliamentary move that effectively lets the full body override the wishes of a committee chair. Sen. Bryce Reeves, R-Spotsylvania, said the GOP chose not to use that “nuclear option” out of deference to Senate tradition. But he took exception to Lucas’ decision not to docket the repeal bill he co-sponsored and said he’s unsure what might happen when the House sends over its version.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m not confident of anything right now to be honest with you,” Reeves said. “Other than we wasted a bunch of taxpayers’ money coming down here with our thumbs up our butt getting nothing done.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Mamie Locke, D-Hampton, accused Republicans of politicizing the issue and taking a “my way or the highway” approach to the conversation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It has become more of a political discussion than a policy discussion,” Locke said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Surovell told reporters the criticism of how Lucas is wielding her power is overstated, because committee chairs frequently have to decide to docket some bills and not others in the compressed time frame of a special session.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t know why it should be any different now that there’s a Black woman chairing the committee,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Friends of VMSDEP, the main advocacy group opposing the recent eligibility changes, blasted Lucas for her actions Tuesday. In a statement, the group said Lucas and other skill game supporters had “hijacked” the day to “try to unleash an unprecedented expansion of gambling across the commonwealth” instead of addressing the needs of veterans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advocates for legalizing skill games were also left wondering what the Senate’s decisions Tuesday meant. In a statement, the pro-skill game Virginia Merchants and Amusements Coalition said it hopes lawmakers “will come together on a resolution when they reconvene.”</span></p>

<p>State Sen. Suhas Subramanyam and military officer Eugene Vindman were the victors in two closely watched Democratic primaries Tuesday in two competitive Northern Virginia districts.</p>
<p>But the most high-profile contest in Virginia — the intra-GOP brawl between incumbent Rep. Bob Good and state Sen. John McGuire — was too close to call as of 10 p.m Tuesday evening, three hours after the polls closed.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Original report:</em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Polling places across Virginia are open from 6 a.m. to 7 p.m. today as both Democrats and Republicans hold </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/17/what-to-watch-in-virginias-congressional-primaries-this-week/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">primaries</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to choose their nominees for congressional elections in November.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans across the state will pick a challenger to run against Democratic U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, and at least one party is holding a primary in six of Virginia’s 11 congressional districts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two of those districts are coming open this year due to the upcoming departures of U.S. Rep. Jennifer Wexton, D-Loudoun and Rep. Abigail Spanberger, D-Prince William. Wexton is leaving Congress for health reasons, and Spanberger is running for governor in 2025.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both parties have competitive primaries in those two districts, the 10th and 7th. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican voters in central and Southside Virginia’s 5th District will also settle a bitter primary between Rep. Bob Good, R-Campbell, and state Sen. John McGuire, R-Goochland, that’s drawn national attention largely due to former President Donald Trump’s decision to back McGuire over Good, a member of the hard-right House Freedom Caucus who endorsed Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis for president.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Would-be voters can find details on their status via the state’s </span><a href="https://vote.elections.virginia.gov/VoterInformation" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">online citizen portal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which lets users check their registration status and find their congressional district.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In districts with both a Republican and Democratic congressional primary, voters will be asked to choose a ballot for one party.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voters participating in Tuesday’s primaries will need to present an </span><a href="https://www.elections.virginia.gov/media/formswarehouse/voter-id/outreach-materials/documents/Voter-Identification-Chart---Revised-08.23.2023.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">acceptable form of identification</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but anyone lacking an ID will still be able to cast a provisional ballot that will only be counted if elections officials verify their eligibility later.</span></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Senate will reconvene in Richmond today with major uncertainty looming over both of the two main topics on its agenda: changes to a tuition benefit program for military families and a possible end to the ban on skill games.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Senate is scheduled to gavel in at 1 p.m. to take up the potential restoration of previous eligibility rules for a state program that provides free college to children and spouses of military members killed or disabled as a result of their service. To try to scale back costs, the General Assembly and Gov. Glenn Youngkin changed the program’s rules last month to limit who’s eligible for it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Senate is also expected to take another go at legalizing skill games, the slot machine lookalikes installed in convenience stores, restaurants and truck stops across the state. Those machines went dark late last year after the Supreme Court of Virginia reinstated an earlier law banning them. The legislature and Youngkin have disagreed on the specifics of proposals to tax and regulate skill games, leaving them in limbo when the regular General Assembly session ended earlier this year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As lawmakers take the unusual move of returning to Richmond in an offseason complicated by summer vacation plans and congressional primaries also taking place Tuesday, they’re stepping back into an environment made more unpredictable by the mix of two contentious issues, House vs. Senate tensions and the partisan posturing that comes with Virginia’s divided government.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/14/virginia-house-and-senate-will-take-up-military-tuition-benefit-on-different-days/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">stated reason</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the unusual June work session is the intense blowback legislators and Youngkin have received after adopting a budget last month that quietly imposed cost-cutting measures on the Virginia Military Survivors and Dependents Education Program. That program waives tuition at public colleges and universities for eligible families, and policymakers say a recent spike in VMSDEP participation has created a growing financial strain on public universities that have to absorb the costs.</span></p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Virginia House and Senate will take up military tuition benefit on different days&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/14/virginia-house-and-senate-will-take-up-military-tuition-benefit-on-different-days/embed/#?secret=sfX8Got0Rg#?secret=mBN5PZiQyb" data-secret="mBN5PZiQyb" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Military families have launched an advocacy campaign opposing the downsizing of VMSDEP and pressuring lawmakers to reverse changes that impose a stricter Virginia residency requirement, prevent the waivers from being used for advanced degrees or a second undergraduate degree and require participants to first pursue other forms of financial aid before relying on VMSDEP.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Multiple Senate bills have been filed to roll back the VMSDEP reforms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?242+sum+SB6006" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fully repeals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the changes. The </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?242+sum+SB6005" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">other</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, favored by Democratic leadership, only reverses some changes, giving families who expected to use VMSDEP benefits more time to solidify college plans without being impacted and specifying the program will only apply to combat-related disabilities or deaths going forward. The program’s current eligibility rules apply to all disabilities or deaths connected to military service, which covers training accidents, mental health struggles and other issues unrelated to combat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am committed to ensuring higher education is affordable for all students,” Senate Democratic Caucus Chair Mamie E. Locke, D-Hampton, said in a news release last week laying out the bill’s specifics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bipartisan group of senators has filed a </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?242+sum+SB6003" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">competing bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to completely reverse the VMSDEP changes, which would leave the program unchanged for now as lawmakers take a deeper look at what’s driving the growth and how it could be addressed without disrupting current and soon-to-be beneficiaries. At least three Senate Democrats have joined with Republicans to back the more sweeping repeal bill, adding to the confusion about what might happen in a body where Democrats hold a slim 21-19 majority.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because Sen. Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, chairs the Senate Finance and Appropriations Committee, she can decide whether to docket the partial VMSDEP restoration bill she’s sponsoring, the full restoration bill or both. As of Monday evening, the agenda for the committee meeting said “Senate Bills” without specifying any bills in particular.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kayla Owen, a military spouse and co-founder of the advocacy group Friends of VMSDEP, said she and her allies “support a full repeal and study only.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Senate also has multiple bills pending on skill game legalization. Lucas sponsored one;  Senate Republicans sponsored two others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Any bills the Senate passes Tuesday would still need approval from the House of Delegates, which isn’t scheduled to return to Richmond until June 28 and could differ with the Senate on both VMSDEP and skill games.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin — who has pushed for a full reversal of the changes made to VMSDEP as opposed to the partial reversal favored by Democratic Senate leadership — doesn’t appear to be on board with the Senate’s plan to tackle both issues at the same time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Governor Youngkin has been clear that he will not consider any other legislation until the General Assembly has done the right thing for our military heroes, first responders and their families by fully repealing and reversing the VMSDEP waiver changes,” Youngkin spokesman Christian Martinez said Monday. He added that the governor is willing to continue discussing skill games, “but only after the VMSDEP issue has been resolved.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, previously said the House will only take up the VMSDEP program and doesn’t expect to consider skill game legislation when it meets later this month, </span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2024/06/06/virginia-house-speaker-confirms-special-session-on-military-tuition-program/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to the Virginian-Pilot</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Democratic leaders in the House have also backed a full reversal on the VMSDEP cost-cutting measures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an interview Monday, Scott said the House will docket any bill the Senate passes but he reiterated his support for “full repeal” of the VMSDEP changes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This gamesmanship is not going to affect what the House does,” Scott said, referring to the Senate’s move to meet before the House and attempt to set the terms of any legislative action that occurs this month. “As a veteran, I don’t play games with veteran benefits.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The speaker said the House will also take up any skill game legislation that comes over from the Senate, but is unlikely to pursue its own bill on the topic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The skill game legalization bill sponsored by Lucas would impose a 25% tax rate on the machines and cap the number of machines allowed statewide at 35,000. In concessions to Youngkin’s tougher approach to skill games, the bill also imposes more stringent background checks on people involved in the skill game industry and allows bans on skill games at the city and county level if a particular community opposes them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because Lucas’s skill game legislation is styled as a budget bill, it’s written to take effect immediately and allow skill games to be turned back on within 30 days. The bill would allow skill game businesses to reactivate the machines after applying for a state license, but it doesn’t require the license to be issued first.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We remain hopeful in Governor Youngkin&#8217;s commitment to carving a path forward for skill games in the next two weeks alongside the bipartisan group of legislators who have championed this issue on behalf of small businesses in Virginia,” Rich Kelly, a restaurant owner who serves as president of the pro-skill game Virginia Merchants and Amusement Coalition, said in a news release.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some military advocates and the anti-skill game group Virginians Against Neighborhood Slot Machines have urged legislators to avoid linking the two issues or letting skill games get in the way of addressing VMSDEP.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The General Assembly should address important veterans issues and not let the special session get complicated by unpopular topics like skill games,” the anti-skill game group said Monday.</span></p>

The area saw a surge in Democratic voters after Trump's 2016 election. (Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia’s congressional primaries Tuesday, Republicans will be picking a nominee to run against U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, while Democrats will be picking would-be successors for two Northern Virginia congresswomen who aren’t running for reelection.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recent polls have pointed to a close presidential race in Virginia between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump. Those early polls indicate there could be several hard-fought congressional contests further down the ballot, particularly in three suburban districts — the 2nd, the 7th and the 10th — that Democrats and Republicans battled over in 2022.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week’s primaries will set the table for those races and settle a hard-right grudge match between warring MAGA factions in central Virginia’s Republican-leaning 5th District.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s what to watch on primary night:</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">A referendum on Rep. Bob Good</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Incumbent Rep. Bob Good, R-Va., is facing primary challenger Sen. John McGuire, R-Goochland, in a contest that’s been attracting national attention. In a safe Republican district, the winner of this week’s GOP primary will be a strong favorite to win the seat in the fall.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good is a two-term congressman first elected in 2020. He spent nearly 20 years working in finance before becoming an associate director in Liberty University’s athletics department. He also served as a member of Campbell County’s board of supervisors and led efforts to declare it a &#8220;Second Amendment Sanctuary&#8221; in 2019.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McGuire, who declared his candidacy against Good days after being elected to the state senate, has previously run for the 7th Congressional District and spent three terms in Virginia&#8217;s House of Delegates. He’s a former Navy SEAL and owns a physical training business. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_38869" class="wp-caption alignright" style="max-width:100%;width:1024px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MTGMcGuire02-scaled.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-38869" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MTGMcGuire02-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MTGMcGuire02-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MTGMcGuire02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MTGMcGuire02-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MTGMcGuire02-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MTGMcGuire02-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., joins Virginia Sen. John McGuire, R-Goochland, in Louisa County on June 5, 2024 to support his bid to represent Virginia&#8217;s 5th Congressional District. (Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both men have traveled around the 5th district — which sprawls from Albemarle County westward towards Richmond and down to Danville near the North Carolina border — connecting with voters. Sometimes they’ve been flanked by high-profile Republicans in the national spotlight.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Georgia congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/05/marjorie-taylor-green-calls-bob-good-a-liar-and-john-mcguire-a-loyalist-at-rally/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">joined McGuire at a few events</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the district and posted videos of her support for him on social media. Former President Donald Trump has also endorsed McGuire.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Steve Bannon, Trump’s former chief strategist, headlined an event for Good recently. Texas congressman Chip Roy and Florida congressman Matt Gaetz have also joined Good on the campaign trail.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While each candidate shares similar stances on several conservative Republican issues, it’s Trump’s backing that is a litmus test in the race. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though Good has been a longtime cheerleader of the once-and-possibly-future president, his brief endorsement of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis last summer before he dropped out of the race has haunted him. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump’s campaign has since endorsed McGuire and sent a cease and desist letter to Good’s campaign for signs that include Trump’s name that imply an endorsement he doesn’t have. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McGuire, meanwhile, attended January’s Iowa caucuses to support Trump — and missed some presentations and votes during this year’s General Assembly session to do so. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Good and his allies assert McGuire doesn’t have what it takes to serve on the House Freedom Caucus — Congress’ most conservative group that Good chairs — McGuire and his allies call Good a “liar” who is a “Republican In Name Only.” </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">A scramble to replace two departing Northern Virginia congresswomen</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After being diagnosed with a severe and incurable brain disorder, incumbent U.S. Rep Jennifer Wexton announced she wouldn’t run again for the 10th District seat she first won in 2018.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With her eyes on Virginia’s 2025 race for governor, U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger also isn’t running for another term in the neighboring 7th District.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That left two competitive Northern Virginia districts without incumbents and set off a surge of candidates hoping to succeed Wexton and Spanberger.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the 10th District — based mostly in Loudoun, Prince William and Fauquier counties — the biggest names in a field of a dozen Democratic primary contenders are Sen. Suhas Subramanyam, Del. Dan Helmer, Sen. Jennifer Boysko and former House of Delegates Speaker Eileen Filler-Corn. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wexton, who defeated a well-funded Republican challenger by more than six percentage points in 2022, has endorsed Subramanyam for the seat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also in the Democratic mix are Del. David Reid, Del. Michelle Maldonado and former Virginia Secretary of Education Atif Qarni, who served under former Gov. Ralph Northam.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The winner of the 10th District Democratic primary will face whomever emerges victorious from a four-person Republican primary happening Tuesday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The GOP field in the 10th includes attorney and technology executive Mike Clancy, Marine Corps veteran and former Youngkin administration official Aliscia Andrews, retired military officer Alex Isaac and defense contractor Manga Anantatmula.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the 7th District, seven Democrats and six Republicans are competing for the chance to replace Spanberger, who’s currently the only candidate from either party actively running a 2025 gubernatorial campaign.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The top Republican contenders in the 7th are Derrick Anderson, a former Green Beret turned lawyer who worked in the Office of National Drug Control Policy during the Trump administration, and Cameron Hamilton, a former Navy SEAL who more recently worked at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Despite their remarkably similar profiles, Anderson and Hamilton have </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/06/08/virginia-7th-district-anderson-hamilton-ads/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">traded blows</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over who gives the GOP the best chance to flip a seat that’s winnable for the party under the right conditions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats in the district are facing a choice between experience in state and local politics and national star power.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eugene Vindman — a career military officer who rose to fame during the Trump era when he and his twin brother, Alex Vindman, raised alarms about a phone call Trump made to Ukrainian officials — has raised more than $5 million to run in the district as a Democrat. His fundraising has dwarfed the other six Democratic candidates he’s competing against, many of whom have longer backgrounds in Virginia politics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Competing against Vindman are Dels. Elizabeth Guzman and Briana Sewell, as well as Prince William county supervisors Margaret Angela Franklin and Andrea Bailey.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 7th District, based largely in Prince William, Spotsylvania and Stafford counties, covers a big enough swath of rural central Virginia that it’s seen as more competitive for the GOP than the 10th. In 2022, Spanberger defeated Prince William supervisor Yesli Vega by 4.6 percentage points. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">GOP picks a statewide challenger for Kaine</h4>

(Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine has a long history in electoral politics, serving in local, state and federal office before being tapped as Hillary Clinton’s vice presidential running mate in 2016. Facing challengers is nothing new for Kaine, but running for office is new to some of his five would-be challengers competing in the Republican U.S. Senate primary.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While they overlap on various policy stances, it’s the resume and personal flair of the GOP candidates that make each stand out for different reasons. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After challenging Wexton in 2022 and coming up short, Navy veteran Hung Cao appears to be a top contender in the GOP’s crowded U.S. Senate primary after winning Trump’s endorsement. Cao’s political action committee, Unleash America, has come under scrutiny for </span><a href="https://www.newsleader.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/04/15/pac-built-to-help-va-candidates-across-the-finish-line-left-many-confused-where-the-money-went/73264487007/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">not supporting other Republican candidates as he’d initially announced the PAC was created to do.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis staffer Scott Parkinson also has a fundraising background as a senior official at the Club For Growth political action committee. Additionally, he’s worked for various representatives on Capitol Hill.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawyer and Navy veteran Chuck Smith has mounted unsuccessful campaigns to include Virginia Beach city council and a run for attorney general. He also spent time as the local chair of Virginia Beach’s Republican Party chapter. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawyer Jonathan Emord </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/13/nyregion/alex-jones-coronavirus-cure.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">represented Alex Jones when the conspiratorial radio host was ordered to stop selling products that claimed to cure COVID-19</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Previously, he worked for the Federal Communications Commission during President Ronald Reagan’s term. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eddie Garcia touts his background as the “son of a ranch hand” in Texas who went on to serve in the Army for over 20 years and be a congressional liaison for the Army. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The candidates share a desire to “retire” Kaine from office and overlap on many policy stances — such as being fiscally conservative and supporting tighter security at the U.S &#8211; Mexico border. They dislike abortion and some refer to themselves as “pro-life,” but several have </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/17/they-dont-like-abortion-but-kaines-gop-challengers-say-they-wont-seek-a-federal-ban/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said they won’t implement a national ban</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the procedure. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Cook Political Report </span><a href="https://www.cookpolitical.com/ratings/senate-race-ratings" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ranks </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine’s senate seat as a “Solid D” — meaning he would likely be able to fend off whoever emerges from the primary when they face him in November. But given the polls showing a close presidential race in Virginia, a stronger showing of Trump voters in November could translate to higher support for whomever Republicans pick to run against Kaine.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Democratic leaders look to lock in pick against Kiggans</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As she prepares to defend the Hampton Roads-based 2nd District for the first time, Rep. Jen Kiggans, R-Virginia Beach, is considered a top target for Democrats who want to flip back a seat they lost in 2022.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is backing Missy Cotter Smasal, a Navy veteran who now serves as the executive director of a veteran-focused nonprofit. The DCCC named  Smasal to its “Red to Blue” program, which focuses resources on districts where Democrats have the greatest chance to knock off a Republican incumbent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smasal is facing competition in a Democratic primary from Jake Denton, an attorney who focuses on civil rights and constitutional law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Denton trails in fundraising, and  Smasal has notched big endorsements from U.S. House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, all six of Virginia’s Democratic representatives in the U.S. House and former Govs. Ralph Northam and Terry McAuliffe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kiggans, a former state senator and Navy veteran herself, defeated former congresswoman Elaine Luria two years ago by 3.4 percentage points. The district has alternated between Democratic and Republican representatives over the years. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">A Democratic primary with a Unite the Right angle</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the 1st District, two Democrats competing in a primary have been sparring over</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/23/an-aclu-lawyer-defended-racists-free-speech-rights-now-shes-running-for-congress/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the violent Unite the Right rally</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that took place in Charlottesville during the summer of 2017.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attorney Leslie Mehta — seen as the frontrunner to win the Democratic nomination against GOP Rep. Rob Wittman — worked for the American Civil Liberties Union of Virginia when the organization lent legal representation to Unite the Right organizers as they battled Charlottesville officials over the terms of a rally permit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A federal judge sided with the ACLU, ruling that the city didn’t have a legal basis to move the rally to a more distant location and allowed the rally to proceed in a park in the heart of the city.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mehta, endorsed in the primary by Spanberger and other prominent elected Democrats, says she and the ACLU stood up for the principle that people should be free to peacefully express unpopular political beliefs without government interference. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her primary opponent, former New Kent County treasurer Herb Jones, has argued she and the ACLU should have been more clear-eyed about threats of violence that day and has warned Democrats against nominating someone with a connection to the infamous event.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The district represented by Wittman leans Republican and runs from the Richmond suburbs to the Northern Neck, Middle Peninsula and outskirts of Hampton Roads.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it became clear Thursday that the state Senate and House of Delegates haven’t agreed yet on a way out of the controversy surrounding the Virginia Military Survivors and Dependents Education Program. The program waives college tuition expenses for spouses and children of military members who were killed or severely disabled as a result of their service. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate leaders announced their chamber will return to Richmond on June 18, which is 10 days before the June 28 date the House had already selected. That schedule raises numerous logistical questions about what might happen if the two legislative chambers meet on different days to try to pass different bills on the same topic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Participation in the VMSDEP program has spiked over the past five years, sparking concern among higher ed leaders that they were being asked to educate a growing number of students for free. The General Assembly’s attempt to reduce those costs by putting limits on the program has drawn fiery opposition from veterans’ groups. And the public pushback has forced political leaders into a difficult choice over whether to retreat or stand firm on the need to quickly address VMSDEP’s growing financial impact.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The recent revisions to the program impose a stricter Virginia residency requirement, prevents the waivers from being used for advanced degrees or a second undergraduate degree and requires participants to first pursue other forms of financial aid and only use VMSDEP for remaining costs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a news release, Senate Democrats indicated they won’t push for a complete repeal of recent changes limiting eligibility for VMSDEP benefits. They’ll instead pursue a partial rollback, which conflicts with the full repeal stance taken by </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/03/youngkin-calls-for-repeal-of-new-limits-on-college-tuition-program-for-military-families/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Glenn Youngkin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/06/virginia-house-speaker-ok-with-special-session-to-restore-military-tuition-program/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House leaders</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If we were to put it back in place there’d be a huge rush to sign up for the program,” Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, said in an interview Thursday. “And then we’re probably looking at a program that costs well over $100M that’s even harder to make adjustments to.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the release, Senate Finance and Appropriations Chair Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, noted that the budget containing the disputed VMSDEP overhaul passed with bipartisan support.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are committed to taking this necessary step to rectify unintended consequences as we continue to work together to conduct an independent review to find a long-term solution for VMSDEP,” Lucas said in the Senate Democrats’ release. “After my personal experience with massive resistance, I have dedicated my entire legislative career to ensure that everyone can access educational opportunities and reach their full potential. Our budget reflects this belief and the proposed changes reinforce my support for all students.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lack of agreement by the two General Assembly chambers, both of which are controlled by Democrats, could add more fuel to the controversy that erupted after the swift passage of an overdue state budget last month.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The idea that Senator Lucas thinks it is acceptable to go rogue on this issue makes it clear she does not value veterans,” said Kayla Owen, a military spouse and co-founder of the Friends of VMSDEP advocacy group that’s been pressuring lawmakers to restore the program to the way it was before the budget passed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Democrats pointed to state data showing the program ballooning from 1,387 students in 2019 to 6,125 students in 2023, which has pushed the financial impact to an estimated $65.3 million per year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That growth has sparked bipartisan concern, but leaders have struggled with how to balance sympathy for veterans with worries that the state has created an overly generous program that makes college virtually free for some families and more expensive for everyone else.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="QDlsC1pVBa"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/06/virginia-house-speaker-ok-with-special-session-to-restore-military-tuition-program/">Virginia House speaker OK with special session to restore military tuition program</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Virginia House speaker OK with special session to restore military tuition program&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/06/virginia-house-speaker-ok-with-special-session-to-restore-military-tuition-program/embed/#?secret=bqsib5T6wG#?secret=QDlsC1pVBa" data-secret="QDlsC1pVBa" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advocates for military families have questioned that assertion and disputed the state’s cost estimates, arguing that adding up the amount of uncollected tuition isn’t necessarily an accurate metric for determining VMSDEP costs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic leaders in the Senate said the legislation they’ll introduce will ensure that anyone using VMSDEP to enroll in classes this fall won’t be impacted by the eligibility changes, exempt the families of veterans killed or wounded in combat with a 90% disability rating, require more guidance from the state on how to interpret the new rules and direct the Joint Legislative and Audit Review Commission to study VMSDEP prior to the 2025 General Assembly session.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That approach would keep some of the cost-cutting measures in place without erasing them all and starting over under a full repeal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pro-VMSDEP activists say that partial restoration of the program would exclude families impacted by post-traumatic stress disorder and service members who were killed or injured in training accidents or other non-combat scenarios.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s unclear how the House and Senate might resolve their differences, but the Senate going first could give the upper chamber more power to dictate the terms of what the VMSDEP fix will be. However, several Senate Democrats have expressed support for full repeal of the changes, casting uncertainty over whether caucus leadership would have the votes necessary to pass the bill described in Thursday’s release.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The House appears to be sticking with its plan for a full reversal of the VMSDEP changes. In a statement issued Thursday, House Appropriations Chairman Luke Torian, D-Prince William, said he’ll sponsor legislation “to restore the program to its previous form” as a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/10/at-task-force-meeting-military-families-rip-ugly-side-of-virginias-government/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">task force</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> convened by the governor works on longer-term policy recommendations. A </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?242+sum+HB6003" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">full repeal bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sponsored by Torian and a bipartisan group of delegates who have worked on the issue was pre-filed Thursday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Veterans have many choices when deciding where to call home, and this program is a major reason why some families choose Virginia after their service,” Del. Jackie Glass, D-Norfolk, said in the release from Torian’s office. “I&#8217;ve heard from countless families in my district and throughout the Commonwealth about how these changes have disrupted their children&#8217;s lives and spouses&#8217; efforts to further their education.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The governor also indicated he still wants to see the VMSDEP changes completely reversed. In a </span><a href="https://x.com/GovernorVA/status/1801293556524388863" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">social media post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Thursday afternoon, Youngkin said “it’s time to come together and for the General Assembly to send me a clean bill that solely and fully repeals and reverses the eligibility changes made to VMSDEP.”</span></p>

(Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Human resources officials in the city of Richmond recommended an “immediate departmental restructuring” of the city election office after an internal investigation concluded the city’s registrar and deputy registrar violated nepotism and ethics policies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The results of the HR investigation into the Richmond election office — which is separate from a more far-reaching probe underway by Richmond’s inspector general — were sent to state and local election officials on Tuesday. The Virginia Mercury obtained copies of the findings through a Freedom of Information Act request.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="IJEH6DK0LI"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/16/richmond-inspector-general-investigating-citys-elections-office/">Richmond inspector general investigating city’s elections office</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Richmond inspector general investigating city’s elections office&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/16/richmond-inspector-general-investigating-citys-elections-office/embed/#?secret=z8j9YH7puV#?secret=IJEH6DK0LI" data-secret="IJEH6DK0LI" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the investigation, Registrar Keith Balmer verified nepotism allegations lodged against his office from three ex-employees, the documents show. It was their complaints that initiated the HR review, which produced three similarly worded investigative reports on the complaints and a <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Notice-of-Investigative-Findings-Keith-G.-Balmer-Jerry-B.-Richardson-6.10.24-sjh-edits.pdf">summary of the findings</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The recommendation for a swift reshuffling of staff, including the proposed “transfer or removal” of all employees in a line of supervision that includes a family member, suggests a shakeup could be coming to the office that runs elections in Virginia’s capital city. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though none of the allegations deal directly with voting or ballots, registrars are typically expected to be sticklers for following protocol given the sensitive, high-security nature of their work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The management issues in Richmond are also bubbling up during a presidential year, when election officials around the country are at their busiest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Richmond controversy highlights the at-times confusing lines of supervision for registrars, who are hired and fired by unelected boards made up of appointees picked by local political parties and confirmed by judges. Though Balmer doesn’t report to City Hall or Richmond Mayor Levar Stoney, the city’s investigation says he’s still subject to city policies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an interview Wednesday evening, Richmond Electoral Board Chairman John Ambrose said he and the rest of the board that oversees Balmer’s office had received the findings and would consider them as part of Balmer’s annual evaluation in July.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Since we have an election next week on June 18 and the priority for the board is the correct and transparent conduct of the June 18 primary I don’t think it’s appropriate to take any emergency action at this time,” Ambrose said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The nepotism accusations were laid out in a document titled “Nepotism Tree,” which says Balmer hired his brother and one of his brother’s friends to jobs in the election office. The office also contracted with a company owned by Balmer’s wife to provide training on how to accommodate voters with disabilities. That contract, amounting to $2,300, didn’t go through the city’s procurement office, according to the records.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two grandchildren of Deputy General Registrar Jerry Richardson, the second-in-command, work in the office, as do several people connected to the grandchildren, according to the “Nepotism Tree” document both Balmer and Richardson confirmed as accurate to city officials.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richardson’s grandson, Christian Javins, works as the office’s elections services manager. Javins’s girlfriend, Kara Wilson, works as a policy analyst. A cousin of Wilson’s and a longtime friend of Richardson’s also work in the office, according to the records, which detail several other familial relationships among lower-level employees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">City HR officials found that people with ties to Balmer and Richardson “were hired or promoted without transparent and fair recruitment processes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Favoritism towards relatives of senior management undermined the principles of fairness, impartiality and equal opportunity for all employees,” city officials wrote in reports dated May 16. The reports were signed by Employee Relations Investigator Josh Underwood and HR Division Chief Timeko Hunte-Brown.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the HR investigation appeared to be completed last month, the city sent a “notice of investigative findings” this week to state and local election officials who work with Balmer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Balmer said Wednesday evening that he had not yet reviewed the HR findings. He noted that, apart from his brother, the other family connections in the office predate his time as registrar, which started in 2021.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I will ensure that no family member reports directly to a family member,” Balmer said in an email.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">City HR policies set broader limits than that, aiming to prevent employees from making decisions that could benefit a relative “regardless of the working relationship.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Any employee with supervisory responsibilities shall not have a family member under their scope of responsibility,” the policy says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both Balmer and Richardson acknowledged to HR officials that people in their office often got jobs after recommendations from existing staff, according to the records. Richardson also indicated the office didn’t have a formal interview process for open positions and said it was “common practice for just a conversation as an interview.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Their failure to maintain transparency in hiring practices and neglect to address employee concerns violated the trust and integrity expected from organizational leaders,” the HR reports say.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The three former employees who complained about the office’s management also alleged they suffered retaliatory firings after raising concerns about nepotism and other issues. City HR officials ruled those claims unfounded, while noting that registrars can hire and fire employees at will and faulting the office for being unable to provide clear documentation laying out why the workers were let go.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Balmer told officials the three employees were terminated because of issues with their performance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investigators ruled Balmer and Richardson violated two city administrative regulations. One is an anti-nepotism policy meant to prevent preferential treatment for relatives and ensure employees don’t supervise their relatives. The other is a more general ethics policy outlining rules against using public office for personal gain and conduct that inhibits “the confidence of the public in the integrity of government.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The investigation also revealed that Richardson had sold Kate Spade purses, wallets and money clips to employees during work hours to raise money for a nonprofit animal rescue organization she runs. The cost of the items ranged from $20 to more than $100.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Considering Richardson’s managerial role, selling items on city time to employees that are within her chain of command may give the perception of favoritism for those who purchase from Richardson or create an environment in which employees feel purchasing the items to be obligatory,” the report says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richmond HR officials recommended “an immediate departmental restructuring to correct any nepotism,” the implementation of more thorough hiring practices to ensure jobs are awarded on “merit and qualifications,” mandatory training on ethics and other city policies and potential discipline for those involved.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s unclear when Richmond’s Office of the Inspector General is expected to complete its investigation into the election office.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">City officials suspended government credit cards issued to the registrar’s office after concerns were raised about improper spending, much of which has been </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/government-politics/registrar-balmer-city-credit-card-investigation-elections-office/article_6be2d0e8-146b-11ef-971d-1f0b4090e555.html#:~:text=The%20Times%2DDispatch%20in%20March,in%202021%2C%20denied%20the%20claims." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported by the Richmond Times-Dispatch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The inspector general is believed to be looking at that issue and others that deal with finances and accusations of improper conduct that go beyond HR rules.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reports issued by HR officials point to some of those other allegations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the ex-employees who filed a complaint also alleged his former co-workers took unused copper wire from the building that houses the elections office and sold it for scrap.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A footnote in the HR report says an investigator in the inspector general’s office didn’t seem too concerned about that claim because “the copper wires were considered trash.”</span></p>

(Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kristen Fenty of Virginia Beach says her daughter Lauren only got one moment of physical proximity to the father she never got a chance to know. It happened when she was a baby, still small enough to be lifted onto her father’s casket.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a room full of government officials listened Monday, Fenty told the group that her daughter — who was 28 days old in 2006 when her dad, Lt. Col. Joe Fenty, was killed in a helicopter crash — is now 18, preparing to go to college and hoping to eventually go to medical school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But a tuition waiver program Fenty assumed would help pay for her daughter’s education, the Virginia Military Survivors and Dependents Education Program, has been thrown into limbo due to state leaders’ controversial efforts to cut the program’s growing costs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Societies that do not share the cost of war topple,” Fenty said, adding that she hopes the Virginia General Assembly will “right this wrong.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the first meeting of a bipartisan task force Gov. Glenn Youngkin convened to study the VMSDEP program and its growing financial impact on Virginia’s public higher education system, Youngkin administration officials and General Assembly members said they were committed to listening to military families and see their well-being as a top policy priority. Fenty was one of several military spouses and veterans selected to serve on the task force, which she called “both an honor and an agony.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the course of several hours Monday afternoon at the Virginia War Memorial building in Richmond, public officials mostly took a rhetorical beating from military veterans and Gold Star spouses who said they felt betrayed by an insular, out-of-touch political class.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These past two months have shown me the ugly side of Virginia’s government,” said task force member Donna Lewis, a mother of three whose husband was killed in combat in Iraq. “Countless senators and delegates we met with said they were told the impact on our families would be minimal.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lewis said she hoped the task force would be productive, but was skeptical after watching what she called “institutional betrayal in its highest form.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">General Assembly leaders have pointed to data showing the VMSDEP program, which provides tuition waivers to spouses and children of military members killed or permanently disabled as a result of their service, has grown exponentially over the last five years. With VMSDEP beneficiaries essentially given the opportunity to go to college for free, some Virginia universities have raised concerns that they can’t continue absorbing the costs of enrolling a growing number of VMSDEP beneficiaries that don’t pay tuition. Those added costs, some policymakers have argued, will ultimately be felt by taxpayers at large or by tuition-paying students who might have less ability to pay than families receiving military benefits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to data presented by state officials, VMSDEP participation has grown by nearly 350% over the last five years, jumping from 1,400 students in 2019 to 6,400 in 2023.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The revised program imposes a stricter Virginia residency requirement, prevents the waivers from being used for advanced degrees or a second undergraduate degree and requires participants to first pursue other forms of financial aid and only use VMSDEP for remaining costs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The attempted trimming of the program enraged military veterans and their families, who have bristled at the idea they’re becoming a burden on public universities that they say don’t seem particularly hard up for cash. Supporters of the VMSDEP program also contend it’s a benefit earned through the sacrifices of adults and children alike and shouldn’t be tied to a family’s ability to pay like other forms of financial aid. Policymakers’ attempts to shield current VMSDEP beneficiaries from the changes fell short, the critics argue, by being unclear and leaving many families uncertain about their status.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The General Assembly is already planning to reconvene later this month to undo the changes to the VMSDEP program and take a closer look at its eligibility rules and how they could be reformed. The task force, made up of General Assembly members, cabinet officials, higher education officials, veteran services officials and military families themselves, is supposed to be studying VMSDEP and issuing recommendations for the 2025 legislative session.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You have made numbers come alive,” Youngkin Secretary of Education Aimee Guidera told the crowd at the conclusion of Monday’s meeting. “And that’s what matters. And it’s emotional.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">House of Delegates leaders have specified their chamber will return on June 28 and intend to fully reverse the VMSDEP changes. Speaking with reporters after Monday’s meeting, House Appropriations Chairman Luke Torian, D-Prince William, said he and others who supported the VMSDEP changes had sincere concerns about the program’s growth and were trying to look out for the state’s best interests.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Obviously, from what we’re hearing, it went sideways,” Torian said. “We’re going to move forward. We’re going to address the concerns.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The plan for the state Senate is less clear, but Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, said the Senate expects to announce more detail later this week.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Finance and Appropriations Chair Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, attended Monday’s task force meeting virtually and gave only brief introductory remarks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There is no stronger supporter of our military families than I am,” said Lucas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The task force was part of Youngkin’s response to a furor that erupted when the VMSDEP changes were included in a bipartisan budget deal approved on May 13. Though changes to VMSDEP were on the table in the General Assembly’s regular session, the final budget deal was mostly crafted behind closed doors and approved quickly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the time, both parties were eager to get the overdue budget done and avert the prospect of a government shutdown come July 1. But Youngkin, who signed the budget, and the General Assembly, which passed it by a wide margin, are now under pressure to come back before July 1 to reverse the VMSDEP changes and restore the program to its former state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The task force’s first meeting mostly focused on introductions and taking public comment, almost all of which was infused with indignation at the officials listening from the other side of the table.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jason Redman, a former U.S. Navy Seal and Old Dominion University graduate who was badly wounded in Iraq, said people signing up for military service are given assurances that, if the worst happens, their loved ones will be taken care of.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You’re saying that it is too hard to sustain this program to families that have buried a loved one for your freedom,” Redman said. “To warriors who have endured loss of limb, eyesight, function, disfigurement and permanent disability. … This is appalling.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brian Smith, a military veteran who said he now works as an eighth grade civics teacher, said that during his service he could never make promises to his daughter that he would be there for any particular holiday or birthday. Expecting VMSDEP to cover college costs, he said, was a promise he thought could be kept.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What lesson am I taking back to my eighth graders about government?,” he said. “Can you help me out with that?”</span></p>

Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, addresses his colleagues in the House of Delegates after being elected speaker of the House at the Virginia State Capitol on Jan. 10. (Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia House of Delegates Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, said he’s not opposed to reconvening the General Assembly to address a public outcry over recent changes to a state program that covers higher education costs for some military families.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There is shared ownership over this issue that we can all work together on to correct,” Scott said in an interview Tuesday evening. “Nobody has to use politics to try to take advantage of veterans.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A U.S. Navy veteran himself, the speaker said it’s been unfortunate to see political “grandstanding” take hold in discussions of what the state should do about the </span><a href="https://www.dvs.virginia.gov/education-employment/virginia-military-survivors-and-dependents-education-program-2-2-2" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Military Survivors and Dependents Education Program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which provides higher education tuition waivers and stipends to spouses and children of military members who were killed or severely disabled as a result of their service.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To address concerns the program has grown so fast over the last five years that the financial impacts are becoming too steep for public institutions to bear, state officials recently approved new limits on the program meant to narrow who’s eligible for VMSDEP benefits. The revised program imposes a stricter Virginia residency requirement, prevents the waivers from being used for advanced degrees or a second undergraduate degree and requires participants to first pursue other forms of financial aid and only use VMSDEP for remaining costs.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="W1lPjxCrF8"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/03/youngkin-calls-for-repeal-of-new-limits-on-college-tuition-program-for-military-families/">Youngkin calls for repeal of new limits on college tuition program for military families</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Youngkin calls for repeal of new limits on college tuition program for military families&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/03/youngkin-calls-for-repeal-of-new-limits-on-college-tuition-program-for-military-families/embed/#?secret=OcIR8q3vqe#?secret=W1lPjxCrF8" data-secret="W1lPjxCrF8" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That winnowing of the program, enacted quietly through Virginia’s bipartisan budget deal last month, set off an uproar among military families who felt state leaders had abruptly yanked back a benefit integral to their college plans. Many of those families contend the benefit was earned through service and sacrifice, and isn’t something that should be tied to financial need or treated as a burden on universities that can’t collect tuition from VMSDEP students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the new budget was approved on May 13, activists opposed to the VMSDEP rollback have bombarded Youngkin and General Assembly members with complaints and have pressed policymakers to reverse course. That’s left General Assembly members in a difficult position; they’re trying to explain the program could be susceptible to exploitation by non-Virginians or families with the means to pay for college themselves, without sounding unsympathetic to the real struggles of military veterans and their loved ones.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ceding to the public pushback, Gov. Glenn Youngkin </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/03/youngkin-calls-for-repeal-of-new-limits-on-college-tuition-program-for-military-families/#:~:text=The%20program%2C%20which%20provides%20tuition,in%20action%20or%20taken%20captive."><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced last week</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that he wants the General Assembly to return this month to restore the program to its former status while a state task force studies ways to get VMSDEP costs under control. Some Democrats have seemed resistant to that plan, but Scott’s comments indicate General Assembly leaders and the governor could be moving closer to a consensus on the need to reconvene by the end of the month.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“At the end of the day, we all got here together. We can all get out of here together,” Scott said. “We’re going to do it in partnership with those families. We’re going to get a solution.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though Republicans may have been quicker to publicly side with the upset military families, Scott said the GOP also had a hand in putting VMSDEP cost-cutting on the General Assembly’s agenda this year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to Youngkin signing the budget that included the program overhaul, Sen. Bryce Reeves, R-Spotsylvania, filed a bill this year, with support from the Youngkin administration, that included many of the same changes to the program.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“People are now playing politics with this because they bit off a little bit more than they could chew,” Scott said. “They shot first and then aimed.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reeves watered down his </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB347" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">VMSDEP bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at its first Senate hearing in February, amending it to simply study the program and hold off on making changes to who would qualify. The study bill cleared the state Senate 40-0, but was blocked by the Democratic-led House Appropriations Committee in a voice vote at the end of February.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just before that vote, a House committee staffer suggested the study bill was unnecessary because the House was pressing ahead with changes to the program through its budget proposal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The program has increased sixfold over the last five years, and any delay in moving forward could cause the institutions an impact of about $40 million,” legislative fiscal analyst Tony Maggio said at the Feb. 28 committee meeting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The VMSDEP overhaul was included in the budget the General Assembly approved in March as the regular legislative session adjourned. The package of proposed budget amendments Youngkin put forward a few weeks later stripped out the VMSDEP changes and called for the type of VMSDEP study envisioned in the legislation the House blocked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The House rejected Youngkin’s amendments in April, and the VMSDEP program changes reappeared in the final budget both sides wanted to approve quickly in May. Passing that budget ended a lengthy partisan standoff and put to rest talk of a potential government shutdown.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the document was largely negotiated behind closed doors, and VMSDEP supporters were frustrated to see major policy changes carried out through a few lines of text on page 641 of a 674-page budget. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The final document was released to the public just 48 hours before the May 13 vote on the budget. The VMSDEP changes included a grandfather clause exempting anyone already participating in the program or committed to a higher education institution by May 15. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Activists said that sequence of events gave families very little time to parse what was happening and left many families scrambling to try to find out how the changes would impact them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scott acknowledged the issue could’ve been handled differently.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think there’s some validity to the complaint that we probably shouldn’t have done this through the budget without legislation,” he said.</span></p>
<p>In a statement Thursday afternoon, Friends of VMSDEP, the main advocacy group pushing back against changes to the program, thanked Scott for listening to calls for a special session.</p>
<p>&#8220;We hope this will put us on a path to preserving VMSDEP with a vote to repeal the language in HB/SB6001 and ensure a comprehensive study is completed prior to any future proposed legislative changes,&#8221; said Friends of VMSDEP co-founder Kayla Owen. &#8220;Ultimately our goal is to make sure this program is sustainable for many years to come.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After an unrelated event Wednesday, Youngkin told reporters he too thinks the program should remain unchanged for now and the General Assembly can revisit the issue in 2025 with “full committee hearings” that “allow Virginians and particularly our veterans to be engaged.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I have not had huge pushback” from the legislature, Youngkin said. “In fact, I’ve had real agreement from leadership in the House and the Senate, from Republicans and Democrats,” Youngkin said of his call for immediate action to reverse the VMSDEP changes. “I believe that we can do this. We need to come back before June 30.”</span></p>

Glenn Youngkin said Wednesday that the state will no longer follow car emissions standards set by California, despite his party’s failure to repeal or roll back a 2021 Democratic law that tied Virginia to those regulations.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The move tees up what could be another legal fight over Republican leaders’ efforts to undo climate change-related measures Democrats passed when they had full control of state government a few years ago. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The governor has already drawn a lawsuit over his decision to end Virginia’s participation in a regional program meant to curb carbon emissions from power plants, arguing the initiative was too burdensome for regular Virginians who had to absorb the cost through </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/05/regulators-approve-request-from-dominion-to-drop-rggi-fee-on-customer-bills/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">higher electricity bills</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin has taken a similar line of attack against California’s car emissions rules, which aim to slow climate change and reduce pollution by requiring the automotive industry to shift to selling more electric vehicles. The California standards require 100% of new cars sold to be electric vehicles starting in 2035, meaning the sale of new gas-powered vehicles would gradually be banned over the next decade.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Once again, Virginia is declaring independence – this time from a misguided electric vehicle mandate imposed by unelected leaders nearly 3,000 miles away from the Commonwealth,” Youngkin said in a news release Wednesday morning. “The idea that government should tell people what kind of car they can or can’t purchase is fundamentally wrong.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The governor said Virginia would stop following regulations set by the California Air Resources Board at the end of 2024. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The move drew swift condemnation from Democrats and environmental groups who said Youngkin and Attorney General Jason Miyares, whose office provided legal cover for Youngkin’s action, were overstepping their authority to try to undo a law they didn’t like.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, said “even Vladimir Putin does not claim to have this much power.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Governor Youngkin and Attorney General Miyares’ reckless, illegal and unconstitutional actions today are destructive of Virginia’s pro-business reputation,” Surovell said in a written statement. “Working with a legislature that has a different political orientation can be challenging, but we fought a war in 1776 to ensure that an executive would never have the powers to nullify laws by press conference.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia House of Delegates Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, dinged Youngkin again for the governor’s decision in late 2022 to scuttle talks about bringing a Ford electric vehicle battery plant to Southwest Virginia due to a Chinese company’s involvement in the project.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We know that electric vehicles are already taking off,” Scott said Wednesday in a news release. “The demand for them is just growing more each year. If Virginians can’t find electric cars in their local dealerships, they will go out of state to buy their cars.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin and Mirayes held a public event Wednesday afternoon at a Richmond-area Toyota dealership to explain the decision. The governor said it was not about bashing electric vehicles, but returning choices to consumers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am very supportive of Virginians buying electric vehicles,” Youngkin told reporters after the event. “But I want Virginians to make that decision for themselves.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asked whether he agrees the planet would be better off with more people buying electric vehicles, Youngkin said he believes there’s a “real question” on that front, given the complexities of making electric vehicle batteries and generating the energy to charge them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Let’s just be clear, the power comes out of the wall,” Youngkin said. “And the wall has a power source that is a mix of generating capacity. And that is something that I think people forget to talk about.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legal justification for Wednesday’s announcement, laid out in a 9-page advisory opinion by Miyares, is that the first version of California’s standards expire at the end of the year. Though they’re being replaced with a new set of rules, Miyares opined that Virginia law doesn’t strictly require Virginia’s State Air Pollution Control Board to go along with the updated California standards. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“EV mandates like California’s are unworkable and out of touch with reality, and thankfully the law does not bind us to their regulations,” said Miyares, who’s widely considered a possible GOP candidate for governor in 2025.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Federal Clean Air act requires states to either follow California’s admissions rules or regulations set by the federal government. Individual states don’t have the power to make their own rules, partly to avoid forcing the auto industry to make vehicles tailored to a complicated patchwork of laws that could vary from state to state. The most populous state in the nation, California was granted unique permission to craft its own regulations to address local air pollution issues.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin said the state will follow the less-strict federal emissions rules starting in 2025. Those rules still encourage the transition to electric vehicles, but on a less aggressive timeline than what California envisioned. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimates new federal rules issued this year could be met if 56% of new vehicles sold are electric by 2032, </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/epa-electric-vehicles-emissions-limits-climate-biden-e6d581324af51294048df24269b5d20a" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to the Associated Press</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The Youngkin administration said electric vehicles made up 9% of new auto sales in Virginia last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new legal interpretation by Miyares contradicts an earlier position by his office. In </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/08/26/californias-2035-ban-on-new-gas-powered-cars-set-to-apply-to-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a 2022 email</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an assistant attorney general wrote that Virginia was “bound” to the California standards. Severing Virginia from California’s rules, the assistant attorney wrote, would require “an amendment or repeal of the mandating legislation.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s been a while since I’ve seen that email,” Miyares said Wednesday, emphasizing that the rules in California have changed and his office reached its new conclusion after an “in-depth legal analysis.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legal dispute could center on the difference between the words “may” and “shall,” a minor semantic distinction that nevertheless can have major legal implications for whether a law requires something or simply allows it. Virginia’s 2021 law said the state’s air board “may” adopt regulations tied to the California standards, but included several other “shall” clauses indicating what those regulations should include.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though that might have been a “scribbler’s problem” in the drafting of the bill, Miyares said, courts look at the “plain language” of what the law says to interpret what it means.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican lawmakers have introduced legislation aiming to do just that, but those bills have been blocked by Democrats who have controlled at least one General Assembly chamber ever since Youngkin took office. The legislative rollback efforts failed </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/01/16/in-senate-va-democrats-kill-republican-attempts-to-roll-back-vehicle-emissions-law/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">again this year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> now that Democrats control both the state Senate and the House of Delegates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement, the Southern Environmental Law Center called Youngkin’s move “illegal, shortsighted and bad public policy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Clean Cars standards will help spur the transition to cleaner vehicles and bring significant health and environmental benefits to all Virginians. That is why the General Assembly adopted them,” said Trip Pollard, a senior attorney with the SELC.  “The governor tried to get the legislature to repeal the law and failed; he cannot just dictate a different outcome.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pollard said his group would “take every action” to keep the standards in place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Automobile Dealers Association, which supported Virginia’s adoption of the California standards, said it’s now supporting the move away from them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our support for the California Air Resources Board standards was done to drive demand for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">fully electric vehicles in Virginia and support dealer interests, as doing so put the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">commonwealth in a stronger position for manufacturers to send EVs to our dealers and c</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">onsumers,” Don Hall, the group’s president and CEO, said in a news release. “The reality, however, is that consumer demand for EVs in Virginia and nationally has not yet </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">materialized, compounded by costs, ‘range anxiety,’ and the lack of charging and electrical </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">infrastructure to support these new vehicles. We continue to believe EV goals are achievable, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">but on a longer timeline.”</span></p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After attempting to rein in the skyrocketing costs of a state program that covers college expenses for some military families, Virginia leaders are discussing whether the move is proving so politically unpopular that they should return to Richmond to undo it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advocates for military families have called for a special General Assembly session to repeal the changes to eligibility rules for the Virginia Military Survivors &amp; Dependents Education Program, which assists spouses and children of military members who were killed or severely disabled as a result of their service. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s an option under consideration by Gov. Glenn Youngkin and General Assembly leaders, but so far there doesn’t appear to be a consensus on whether the issue has caused a crisis worthy of immediate reversal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an exchange of letters Monday, Youngkin told Democratic legislators responsible for the state budget that they can either work with him on the particulars of a special session or he’ll call one himself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We can work together to repeal the adopted language within the current special session, or I will convene a concurrent special session,” <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/06.03.24_Letter_from_Governor_Youngkin-.pdf">Youngkin wrote</a> to House Appropriations Chairman Luke Torian, D-Prince William, and Senate Finance and Appropriations Chair Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth. “I look forward to continuing our productive conversations on this matter.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because the General Assembly is technically still in the special session convened earlier this year to finish the budget, legislative leaders can call the members back to the Capitol at any time. If Democratic leaders resist Youngkin’s push, the governor can call a new, overlapping special session.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Torian and Lucas had sent the governor <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/DOC__3_.pdf">their own letter</a> earlier in the day indicating they felt the issue could wait until the 2025 General Assembly session because current program participants are covered by a “grandfather clause.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The grandfather clause effectively allows for current and new students for the coming summer or fall 2024 to be exempt from the reform measures,” Torian and Lucas wrote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Mercury obtained copies of both letters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Democratic lawmakers also pointed out that Youngkin has already convened a task force to study the issue and make “meaningful recommendations for consideration” next year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Youngkin administration has prepared draft legislation to repeal the VMSDEP changes, and the governor’s office said Youngkin is hoping to work with General Assembly leaders to have them pass it by June 30.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Virginia military members, who have dedicated their lives to protecting our freedom, and their families will continue to be a top priority for the governor,” said Youngkin spokesman Christian Martinez. “He is committed to reversing the eligibility changes and allowing the task force, which includes Gold Star families, legislators, members of the military, veterans and institutions of higher education, to make a comprehensive recommendation on a sustainable path forward that can be considered in 2025.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The recently approved changes to VMSDEP were intended to address growing costs that lawmakers felt were becoming a financial burden for universities and other tuition payers. The program, which provides tuition waivers and stipends at public schools in Virginia, is also open to spouses and children of military members missing in action or taken captive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The push to tighten eligibility for the program — which didn’t require participants to live in Virginia and allowed the benefit to be used for advanced degrees in addition to undergraduate studies — infuriated military families who say their benefits shouldn’t be on the chopping block at a time when Virginia’s budget seems relatively healthy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few weeks ago, it seemed the passage of Virginia’s overdue budget marked the end of big legislative battles in Virginia for the year. But the controversy over VMSDEP shows a new one might be emerging, as Youngkin sides with military families upset about the program’s overhaul and Democratic leaders face a choice over how strongly they should defend the policy change.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Opponents have portrayed the move as a blemish on Virginia’s reputation as a veteran-friendly state and an example of state government pushing significant policy initiatives with little transparency and public input. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, Virginia’s Joint Leadership Council of Veteran Service Organizations, an official advisory body on veterans issues, voted unanimously to ask state leaders to hold a special session to repeal the changes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Much of the deliberation for these changes occurred without public input or </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">dialogue,” the council said in a </span><a href="https://www.dvs.virginia.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/JLC-Statement-on-VMSDEP-May-29-2024.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">written statement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “This issue is too important to decide behind closed doors.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The changes to VMSDEP were included in the </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/13/virginia-lawmakers-pass-bipartisan-budget-that-leaves-tax-policy-unchanged/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bipartisan budget deal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the Democratic-led General Assembly and Republican governor approved on May 13. The new budget takes effect July 1.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="1DBy64N2VR"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/13/virginia-lawmakers-pass-bipartisan-budget-that-leaves-tax-policy-unchanged/">Virginia lawmakers pass bipartisan budget that leaves tax policy unchanged</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Virginia lawmakers pass bipartisan budget that leaves tax policy unchanged&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/13/virginia-lawmakers-pass-bipartisan-budget-that-leaves-tax-policy-unchanged/embed/#?secret=O3OuPnMJPo#?secret=1DBy64N2VR" data-secret="1DBy64N2VR" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The deal was unveiled just a few days before the General Assembly’s May 13 budget vote. A standalone bill seeking to reform VMSDEP was introduced for the 2024 session, but it was scaled back to a study and, after clearing the state Senate, failed in the House. Policymakers pressed on with some of the changes the bill envisioned by incorporating them in the budget, a practice that frequently comes under fire as a way to push policy changes through with minimal public attention.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers in both parties spoke in opposition to the VMSDEP changes ahead of the budget vote last month, but by then it was too late to make changes to a deal that had been worked out in closed-door negotiations. Youngkin told advocates he would work to prevent “unintended consequences” for military families, but proceeded to sign the budget that was already overdue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Supporters of the changes have noted the tougher eligibility rules won’t affect current participants or anyone who had committed to a higher education institution by May 15. Advocates say those assurances ring hollow and don’t account for the complexity involved in making higher education plans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kayla Owen, a Stafford County mother of two and wife of a disabled Marine veteran, was hoping to use VMSDEP to enter a new field by getting a master’s degree in nursing. However, she first had to take prerequisite courses at a community college and is now worried the eligibility changes mean she’ll no longer be able to use VMSDEP for the nursing program since she hadn’t formally enrolled in it by May 15.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There is immediate and irreparable harm being done to the community right now,” said Owen, 42. “Being a protected class means what? You get cut first?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though it’s existed in some form for decades, the costs of the VMSDEP program have risen dramatically in the last five years due to a 341% increase in the number of students participating. The number of participants has grown from about 1,400 in 2019 to 6,400 by 2023, according to state officials.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The program’s costs over that five-year period have ballooned 444%, rising from $11.9 million in the 2018-2019 academic year to $64.8 million in 2022-2023.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an attempt to get that growth under control, the new budget imposed restrictions on the program that would require participants to live in Virginia, first seek other forms of financial aid and only allow the program to be used for undergraduate degrees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lack of limits raised concerns other families and taxpayers would end up footing a steep bill for a program that lets participants pursue advanced degrees, such as enrolling in law schools and medical schools, and has made Virginia a destination for out-of-state military families increasingly aware of the generous assistance. In 2023, roughly 20% of the tuition waivers were used by out-of-state students or covered graduate degrees, according to officials.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The data showing the program’s exponential growth was presented at a House Appropriations Committee meeting last week.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Please let us not lose those significant points,” Torian said at that meeting. “There has been greater participation. The cost has escalated. What we’re seeking is to have sustainability for this program.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new budget included $40 million to support higher education waivers and mitigate the growing costs of the VMSDEP program, according to officials.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Opponents of the new eligibility rules say that if the state was concerned about high costs officials could have first done a thorough study of the program and given military families more time to adjust. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Springing the changes on families that have already endured hardship, said Stafford military veteran and advocate Caitlin Goodale-Porter, has been “catastrophic.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have a stated objective to be veteran-friendly in Virginia,” Goodale-Porter said. “And we’re doing the exact opposite.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goodale-Porter was appointed to the state task force that will formally begin the process of studying VMSDEP at its first meeting June 10. That study could be helped, Goodale-Porter said, by political leaders undoing the changes they just made and starting the process anew.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“At this point they’ve gotten people so angry they’re talking about leaving the state,” she said. “And that hurts.”</span></p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia isn’t believed to be a battleground state in the 2024 presidential election, but a <a href="https://www.roanoke.edu/news/rc_poll_politics_may_2024" target="_blank">new poll</a> from Roanoke College suggests the matchup between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump could be closer than expected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Poll results from the Southwest Virginia school’s Institute for Policy and Opinion Research  released Wednesday showed Biden and Trump statistically tied in a head-to-head matchup, with both earning 42% of polled voters’ support. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The poll showed Biden leading Trump by two percentage points when potential independent and third-party candidates like Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Jill Stein and Cornel West were added to the mix.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These results suggest that Virginia could be ‘in play’ in November, but five months is an eternity in politics,”  Harry Wilson, a senior political analyst and Roanoke College professor said in a news release announcing the poll numbers. “This tie or two-point lead seems dramatic, but they are within the margin of error of the results of the February 2024 and November 2023 Roanoke College polls. Still, it seems that Trump is narrowing Biden’s lead, which has all but disappeared.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The poll, which involved 711 likely Virginia voters surveyed via phone and through a “propriety online panel,” had a 4.24% margin of error.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden is considered a solid favorite in Virginia, where he defeated Trump by double digits in 2020. Trump also lost in Virginia in 2016, and it’s been two decades since a Republican presidential contender won the state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia showed its purple side in 2021 when Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin won an unexpected victory. But the state GOP has had two disappointing election years in a row, flipping just one of three targeted congressional seats in 2022 and failing to win control of the General Assembly in 2023 when abortion rights were a major issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state also has a U.S. Senate race this year, but there’s been little indication national Republicans intend to invest major resources trying to defeat Sen. Tim Kaine, a Democrat seeking a third Senate term. In the GOP primary that will be decided in June, Trump endorsed Hung Cao, a military veteran from Northern Virginia who has recently come under fire from all sides for </span><a href="https://cardinalnews.org/2024/05/23/gop-u-s-senate-candidate-from-nova-doubles-down-on-podunk-comments-says-driving-to-abingdon-for-debate-is-just-ridonkulous/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">remarks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> critics said came across as dismissive of rural areas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest Roanoke College poll found just 2% of Virginia voters undecided, and 14% to 20% indicated they would vote for someone other than Biden or Trump.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This suggests that those voters who say they will vote for another candidate will possibly swing the election one way or the other,” Wilson said in his analysis. “Do they vote for a third-party candidate? Do they move to one of the major party candidates? Or do they decide to abstain from voting?”  </span></p>

In the part-time Virginia General Assembly, rules walling off legislative offices from campaign activity are less clear.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The congressional rule exists to prevent incumbents from using government resources, including staff time, to help win reelection or move up to a higher office. Congressional staffers can engage in political activity, but only on their own time, without pressure from their boss and without their official duties being altered to free them up for campaign-related work, according to </span><a href="https://ethics.house.gov/campaign/campaign-work-house-employees" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">guidance published by the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Ethics</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In one of Virginia’s congressional primary races, the campaign website for Sen. Suhas Subramanyam, D-Loudoun, previously listed the names of five people working as campaign staff. Four of those five — the finance director, field director, outreach director and finance assistant — were also identified as publicly funded legislative staffers for Subramanyam this year on the Virginia Senate website.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, no campaign-side pay for those four Senate staffers has been disclosed on Subramanyan’s federal campaign finance reports. That setup, as well as the broad overlap between Subramanyam’s government staff and political staff, has raised questions about how his campaign is handling compensation for staffers doing double duty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subramanyam’s campaign said two of the Senate staffers are being paid for their campaign work, and explained that campaign pay for those two employees didn’t appear as standalone costs because the money is being routed through the consulting firm of Subramanyam’s campaign manager, Ajay Mohan. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mohan’s company, Rocket Science Strategies LLC, was paid $7,200 by Subramanyam’s campaign on Feb. 12, according to federal records detailing Subramanyam’s campaign expenses from last November through March 31. Campaign pay for Subramanyam’s Senate staffers is coming out of that $7,200 sum, the campaign said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our campaign has complied with all laws and regulations, and no state funds or resources have been used to benefit the campaign in any way,” Mohan said in a statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subramanyam’s campaign suggested the important-sounding political titles for the four staffers don’t necessarily mean they’ve been spending a lot of time on paid or unpaid political work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re happy to give both volunteers and staff campaign titles in the hope that helps in their careers,” Mohan said.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.vpap.org/candidates/304898-suhas-subramanyam/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subramanyam</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is one of several General Assembly members seeking the Democratic nomination in Northern Virginia’s 10th District, where incumbent Rep. Jennifer Wexton, D-Loudoun, isn’t seeking reelection because of health issues. Wexton endorsed Subramanyam earlier this month, giving him a boost in the 12-person Democratic primary to succeed her in a district that leans blue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Staffers who have had legislative jobs are also doing campaign work for other General Assembly members running for Congress this year, and it’s not uncommon for legislative staffers to help their bosses keep their seats in General Assembly election years. But unlike Subramanyam’s campaign thus far, other candidates’ paperwork usually shows campaign payments to staffers doing campaign work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two people who have had legislative roles in the office of Del. Dan Helmer, D-Fairfax — who is competing with Subramanyam in the 10th District Democratic primary — have also done political work, according to Helmer’s campaign. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One former legislative staffer for Helmer left that job about halfway through the 2024 General Assembly session to take a role on Helmer’s political team, the campaign said. Helmer’s legislative chief of staff is also helping with the campaign and is being paid for that work from Helmer’s campaign account.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We take the compliance issue seriously and are ensuring that when any employee does work for a different entity or office, they are paid for their corresponding work by that entity,” said Helmer campaign manager Brendon Mills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia doesn’t appear to have any detailed laws or guidelines on how legislators should handle employees who work on both the official side and the campaign side. A </span><a href="https://www.ncsl.org/ethics/staff-and-political-activity-statutes" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Conference of State Legislatures summary</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of state laws on political activity by legislative employees lists Virginia as one of just three states with “no relevant statutes found” on the issue. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many other states have laws specifying that legislative employees can’t engage in political activity during official work hours or in government buildings, according to the NCSL.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://ethics.house.gov/campaign/campaign-work-house-employees" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ethics guidelines</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> laid out by the U.S. House of Representatives say congressional staffers who engage in campaign work should “keep careful records of the time they spend on official activities and, separately, on campaign activities, and demonstrate that campaign work was not done on official time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. House rules also say members can’t film political ads in government offices, because the space itself is considered an official resource that can’t be used for campaign purposes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That issue too has been implicated in Virginia lawmakers’ campaigns this year, after Sen. Jennifer Boysko, D-Loudoun, released a political ad featuring shots of her in the publicly funded General Assembly Building. The commercial shows Boysko, who is also running in the 10th District primary, walking inside the building and sitting at a desk in her government office.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s perfectly normal and proper to reference Jennifer&#8217;s work representing 200,000 Loudoun County voters in the State Senate when explaining why she will be the best congresswoman, whether that reference is in text or video,” said Boysko campaign manager Shaun Daniels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those shots of Boysko wouldn’t be allowed if the senator were to win her race and move up to a congressional office.</span></p>

(Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two members of the Charles City County Electoral Board have asked Virginia officials to begin the process of removing the third member of the board, who is accused of sharing sensitive election machine information with a local GOP leader.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/CharlesCity_Letter.pdf">May 14 letter</a> to the Virginia State Board of Elections, election officials in Charles City — a small community between Richmond and Williamsburg — formally requested the ouster of local Electoral Board Member Maria A. Kinney, a Republican who just joined the board in January. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cause listed in the request was “severe dereliction of duties,” including a claim Kinney allowed a former Charles City County GOP chair, Irene Churins, to view election equipment passwords during an accuracy test. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kinney’s two colleagues on the board — Republican Gerald Barnes and Democrat Kermit White — signed onto the letter seeking her removal, as did Registrar DeNay L. Harris, who serves in a nonpartisan role and reports to the three board members.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Documents shared with the state board accuse Kinney of disregarding election policies, battling colleagues over how to keep and publish meeting minutes and reportedly telling others she considers herself a “sovereign citizen.” That term usually refers to a staunchly anti-government movement whose members claim they’re exempt from laws they deem illegitimate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kinney appeared before the state elections board Tuesday to strongly deny most of the allegations while acknowledging she could be more careful about election security protocols </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I have never called myself a sovereign citizen and had to look up what it means,” Kinney said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She went on to dispute claims that she resisted taking the oath of office and was reluctant to give her personal information to the county’s human resources department. Kinney said she took the oath and filled out the HR paperwork after clearing up scheduling and technical issues. Suggestions to the contrary, she said, are “slanderous.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I do not believe that it is my actions that need to be curtailed,” Kinney said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under Virginia’s system of election administration, local party activists nominate people to serve on city and county electoral boards that oversee elections in their communities. Judges make the appointments from lists of nominees submitted by local parties, a process that occasionally leads to ultra-partisan figures wielding power over how local elections are run.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The situation in Charles City County is the latest example of personal animosity flaring up in offices that are meant to be even-keeled and nonpartisan, with local GOP figures conducting themselves in a manner that appears to have troubled even their fellow Republicans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia law gives the party that prevailed in the most recent gubernatorial election automatic control of all local electoral boards in the state. After Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin won in 2021, a new wave of GOP activists are being appointed to election oversight jobs, some of them steeped in far-right conspiracy theories about the 2020 presidential election being stolen from former President Donald Trump.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Barnes, who also appeared at Tuesday’s state board meeting, questioned how Kinney could continue to serve on the county board when higher ups in the Republican Party of Virginia have already stripped Churins of her powers and dissolved the Charles City County GOP Committee to start anew. The Republican Party of Virginia’s 4th Congressional District Republican Committee decided May 9 to remove Churins from her position and temporarily disband the local party she once led. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Barnes also noted Kinney has already resigned as the board’s secretary over the minute-keeping dispute but is insisting on staying on as a board member.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Who is she going to represent? Nobody,” Barnes said. “What is she going to do?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a 30-minute closed meeting, the state elections board chose to delay action on the matter to allow more time to gather emails and other supporting documents mentioned as the two sides gave their version of the truth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think it would be very helpful to have additional information,” said state Board Chairman John M. O’Bannon, a former Republican delegate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those involved in the dispute also gave differing accounts of separate incidents in which law enforcement has had to get involved in election office feuds, none of which have apparently led to charges being filed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because local electoral board members are appointed by judges, Virginia law requires the State Board of Elections to initiate the removal process by approving a petition asking the local circuit court to make the decision final.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The letter laying out the case for Kinney’s ouster says she and Churins disrupted the county’s efforts to check its voting equipment on Jan. 18, a mandatory process known as logic and accuracy testing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“During the completion of the L&amp;A, Secretary Kinney wanted to input the passwords for the equipment as we were zeroing the machines,” the letter says. “As we watched, Secretary Kinney allowed Mrs. Churins to write seal numbers, serial numbers, what polling places the equipment was assigned to, and the passwords she was viewing as we were wrapping up Logic and Accuracy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Barnes told Kinney she couldn’t share that information with party officials or the public, the letter alleges, Kinney “proceeded to tell him that he could not tell her what she could and could not do.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kinney told state officials Churins was standing behind her and she didn’t realize Churins might have been close enough to see the passwords she was entering on the machines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“She would not have been able to see through my chest wall to know the numbers I was entering,” Kinney said. “When informed that I had made this error, I agreed that I needed to pay closer attention in the future, and that I would do just that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The letter from Kinney’s colleagues said her “combative behavior compromises the integrity” of upcoming elections in Charles City.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have a problem here, which seems to grow exponentially with each election,” Barnes wrote in his own letter to Republican Party of Virginia Chairman Rich Anderson. “The problem is the conduct and behavior of the County Republican Chair, Mrs. Irene Churins. Her inability to treat the county election team with even a modicum of respect, her blatant refusal to abide by, much less acknowledge, current Virginia electoral laws and codes, as well as her continual ‘witch hunt’ for non-existent conspiracies, are not only egregiously unethical but a reflection upon our party which simply cannot stand.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Barnes also suggested racism might be a factor in why the registrar’s office is facing hostility from some local Republicans based on a comment about Harris and a deputy registrar he said he heard at a local GOP meeting in 2021.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I overheard another attendee say ‘They’re both black, and we must watch these women. They came from Richmond,’” Barnes wrote in his letter. “Mrs. Churins did not address this inappropriate remark, much less shutting down the conversation’s tenor.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Churins, who told state officials the documents shared with them were “full of lies,” strongly denied the racism charge when asked about it by The Virginia Mercury after Tuesday’s meeting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve got more Blacks than Whites,” Churins said. “And I’ve got friends from all races.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s total bunk and not who we are,” echoed Kinney.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No one cited a direct source for the sovereign citizen accusation. Clara Belle Wheeler, a conservative election activist who previously served on the state elections board, took exception to the publication of an email suggesting she might be a source of information on things Kinney has said. That email, written by 4th District Congressional District Republican Committee Chair Carey Allen,  was included in the official materials published online for the state board meeting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I categorically deny everything that is written in those allegations,” said Wheeler, who now serves on the Albemarle County Electoral Board and conducts training for other Republican board members around the state. “I never have used the term sovereign citizen.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Barnes defended the claim Kinney had described herself that way by saying he had heard about it “from more than two or three people.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asked in an interview if she believes claims the 2020 presidential election was stolen or fraudulent, Kinney said “not in Charles City.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Nationally, I don’t know,” she said. “I have not really paid attention to all of the… they showed one thing where somebody brought in a box or pulled a box from under a table or something… I’m a farmer. I’ve got other busy life stuff going.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s unclear when state officials plan to take up the dispute again for a final decision.</span></p>

(provided photo)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After growing up learning about the Civil Rights Movement and the importance of people being free to advocate for their beliefs, Leslie Mehta says providing legal help to the racist organizers of the 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville was one of the hardest things she’s done as an attorney.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mehta, who’s now running for Congress in Virginia as a Democrat, was serving as legal director for the American Civil Liberties Union of Virginia seven years ago when the chapter made a controversial decision to represent rally organizer Jason Kessler in litigation against Charlottesville officials. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ACLU and Kessler won that lawsuit, which dealt with the specifics of how he and his white supremacist allies would be permitted to protest in a strongly Democratic city vehemently opposed to the racist groups coming to town to rally against efforts to remove a Confederate statue. After clashes between rival groups broke out and police lost control of the situation, a white supremacist demonstrator drove into a crowd of counter-protestors, killing one person and injuring more than 30 others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an interview this month, Mehta said she and the ACLU took the case at Kessler’s request under the impression it would be a peaceful protest. The group would have acted differently, she said, if a “crystal ball” had foretold the violence that occurred that day. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Mehta defended a more old-school approach to free speech that’s fallen out of favor with many modern progressives, saying First Amendment principles mean little if they only protect speech that’s popular or agreeable to people in power.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m a Black woman who was raised in the South. I understand the implications of all this,” said Mehta, who lives in Chesterfield County and grew up in a small town in North Carolina. “And certainly it tests your belief in the principles aligned with the First Amendment when you&#8217;re representing people whom not only do you disagree with, but you find reprehensible. That is what leaders do. Leaders take on hard cases.”</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_1250" class="wp-caption alignright" style="max-width:100%;width:1024px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/charlottesville-daytime-5.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-1250" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/charlottesville-daytime-5-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/charlottesville-daytime-5-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/charlottesville-daytime-5-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/charlottesville-daytime-5-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/charlottesville-daytime-5-696x464.jpg 696w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/charlottesville-daytime-5-1068x712.jpg 1068w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/charlottesville-daytime-5-630x420.jpg 630w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/charlottesville-daytime-5.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  The memorial to Heather Heyer in Charlottesville on Aug. 11, 2018, in Charlottesville, the anniversary weekend of the deadly white supremacist rally that left one dead and dozens injured.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Herb Jones, who’s competing with Mehta in a Democratic primary in the 1st Congressional District, sees it differently. Mehta’s role in what happened in Charlottesville, he said, would be a “fatal wound” in a general-election campaign against U.S. Rep. Rob Wittman, R-Westmoreland. And he said it’s not something Democratic primary voters should overlook.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“To represent Nazis and then think you can represent the values of people in this district, that’s a stretch,” said Jones, who is also Black.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jones said his own family knows the effects of racist violence, because his grandfather was lynched in South Carolina by “a gang of murderous, low-life thugs just like those in Charlottesville.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This was not a First Amendment case, as some want people to believe,” Jones said in email. “The Nazis had a permit to protest in an area that was much safer than downtown Charlottesville. This was about safety.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jones ran against Wittman in 2022 in a Republican-leaning district that runs from the Richmond suburbs to the Northern Neck, Middle Peninsula and outskirts of Hampton Roads.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two years ago, Wittman defeated Jones — a military veteran and business owner who formerly served as the elected treasurer of New Kent County — by roughly 14 percentage points. Wittman would likely still be the favorite no matter which Democrat he faces. But the district could potentially be more competitive for Democrats in a presidential year when former President Donald Trump is trying to return to the White House.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mehta’s campaign portrayed Jones’s criticisms of her work in the Charlottesville case as deflecting focus away from the goal of beating Wittman.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I hate everything Unite the Right represents, but I believe defending our Constitution is an existential imperative,” Mehta said in a written statement responding to Jones. “It’s sad that Mr. Jones chooses to attack my work defending the Constitution when we have an election denier as a member of congress.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though Wittman condemned the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol in 2021, he was one of many Republicans who voted against certifying the election results from Pennsylvania. He also </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2020/12/11/three-va-republicans-join-texas-lawsuit-challenging-presidential-election-result/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">signed a legal brief </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">supporting Texas’ efforts to dispute presidential results from other states.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like Jan. 6, the Unite the Right rally is one of the most prominent examples in recent American history of violence erupting at a far-right protest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the August 2017 rally approached, Charlottesville officials tried to revoke a permit Kessler had obtained from the city in June to hold the event at the Robert E. Lee statue that once stood in Emancipation Park. Local officials attempted to modify the permit less than a week before the rally, resulting in last-minute legal wrangling over where it would be held. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_1267" class="wp-caption alignright" style="max-width:100%;width:1024px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/charlottesville-daytime-6-2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-1267" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/charlottesville-daytime-6-2-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/charlottesville-daytime-6-2-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/charlottesville-daytime-6-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/charlottesville-daytime-6-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/charlottesville-daytime-6-2-696x464.jpg 696w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/charlottesville-daytime-6-2-1068x712.jpg 1068w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/charlottesville-daytime-6-2-630x420.jpg 630w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/charlottesville-daytime-6-2.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  On the anniversary weekend last year of the deadly white supremacist rally in Charlottesville that left one dead and dozens injured, police stood outside the downtown park where white supremacists clashed with anti-racist groups.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The city said it wanted to move the rally to the bigger but less centrally located McIntire Park due to safety concerns. A federal judge sided with the ACLU and Kessler, ruling the city hadn’t presented enough concrete evidence of safety threats to justify revoking a permit the city had already granted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The wisdom of the city’s attempt to change the rally location was a point of contention in a post-event review commissioned by city officials. A </span><a href="https://www.policinginstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Charlottesville-Critical-Incident-Review-2017.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> prepared for the city by former federal prosecutor Tim Heaphy found that Charlottesville’s police chief at the time raised concerns that trying to move the rally would complicate matters by forcing law enforcement to rework public safety plans and prepare for the possibility of crowds gathering in two locations instead of one. Some officials also felt there was no guarantee moving the rally would work as intended, since Kessler could sue or refuse to comply with the city’s directives about where to go.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those concerns were raised with the Charlottesville City Council in a closed session, according to Heaphy’s report. But the council chose to press ahead with the ultimately unsuccessful effort to move the rally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The post-rally report also indicated some law enforcement officials felt the city’s case for moving the rally was weak and wanted the city to lose the lawsuit. The report says a police captain suggested the chief at the time didn’t want an affidavit containing information about potential violence to “look too good,” but the chief denied intentionally leaving intelligence out of the affidavit that was presented to the judge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those details weren’t immediately known in the aftermath of the rally, when former Gov. Terry McAuliffe and others accused the ACLU of contributing to the violence by helping Kessler defeat the plan to move the rally. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the time, former ACLU of Virginia executive director Claire Gastanaga fired back, saying her organization had simply stood up for constitutional principles and the violence was instead a result of poor planning and execution by law enforcement and government officials who were supposed to keep people safe no matter where the rally occurred.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mehta said the litigation she was involved in was limited to the specifics of the city’s attempt to change the permit and shouldn’t be construed as an endorsement of Unite the Right or excusing the violence that occurred after the city’s lawyers failed to convince the judge there was an imminent safety threat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If they thought that there were safety issues, that was their responsibility to make that point,” Mehta said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mehta’s work as a civil rights lawyer took a turn after her oldest daughter, Brooke, was diagnosed with Rett Syndrome, a debilitating genetic disorder. Mehta left the ACLU and devoted more of her time to caring for her child and advocating for better research into the disease. Brooke died in 2021 at the age of five. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mehta now works as chief of staff and legal counsel to the CEO for the Richmond Metropolitan Transportation Authority, but she’s taken a leave of absence from that role to run for office. She said her advocacy work on health care helped her connect with Rep. Abigail Spanberger, D-Prince William, who has supported efforts to get more federal research funding for Rett Syndrome.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spanberger, an emerging Democratic leader who is currently the only member of her party running for governor in 2025, gave Mehta’s campaign a boost last month by endorsing Mehta in the primary against Jones.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ve known Leslie ever since working together to increase funding to fight rare diseases,” Spanberger said in a statement announcing the endorsement. “I was inspired by her bravery, as she had just lost her young daughter to a disease. Virginians will be fortunate to have such an engaged representative working to improve their lives — because I know she will bring her tenacity, intelligence, and passion to the U.S. House every day.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mehta has also been endorsed by numerous members of the Virginia General Assembly, including Sens. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Chesterfield, Schuyler VanValkenburg, D-Henrico, Aaron Rouse, D-Virginia Beach and Mamie Locke, D-Hampton, who chairs the Senate Democratic Caucus.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jones, who was endorsed by former Gov. Ralph Northam, questioned why prominent Democrats are putting a “thumb on the scale” in the primary. He said Republican voters in the GOP-friendly district are unlikely to vote for an ACLU lawyer, and some Democratic voters would be turned off by her role in the Charlottesville case.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If she wins the primary, she is going to get clobbered in the general,” Jones said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mehta said she doesn’t see the Unite the Right litigation as a liability for her campaign, because people she’s spoken to seem to understand her point of view when she explains what the case was and wasn’t about. She also highlighted other civil rights cases the ACLU of Virginia was involved in during her time with the organization, such as transgender student Gavin Grimm’s battle against his local school board over bathroom policies and efforts to fight the Trump administration’s moves to ban travelers from predominantly Muslim countries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regardless of whether she or the ACLU approve or disapprove of a group seeking legal help, Mehta said, “laws have to be applied equally.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I believe in the First Amendment,” Mehta said. “But I also believe that it must be peaceful. And if it’s not peaceful, folks who are violent need to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”</span></p>

Glenn Youngkin speaking with reporters outside the Capitol Building on March 7, 2024. (Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, Gov. Glenn Youngkin vetoed 48 more bills passed by the Democratic-led General Assembly, blocking legislation aimed at preserving contraception access, ending state perks for Confederate heritage groups and legalizing slot machine lookalikes known as skill games.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Friday was the governor’s deadline to act on a final batch of bills the General Assembly had returned to him in April. Most of the vetoes dealt with legislation Youngkin tried to amend in ways the legislature opposed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin has now vetoed a total of 201 bills from the 2024 legislative session, a record-setting number for a modern governor that reflects Virginia’s divided government and the dueling priorities of the state’s Democratic legislature and Republican governor. Nearly 850 bills won final approval. Here are highlights of some of the bills that met their end at the tip of Youngkin’s veto pen. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Skill games</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As expected, Youngkin vetoed a high-profile bill that would tax and regulate skill games in Virginia, a setback for gambling interests and business owners that lobbied to have the machines turned back on in convenience stores, truck stops and restaurants across the state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Skill game supporters are hoping a new bill could emerge from the remains of the one Youngkin killed, but it’s unclear when and how that might happen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislation vetoed by the governor was one of the most intensive efforts to date to convince Virginia to officially sanction machines that have evaded gambling taxes and regulation for most of their existence in the state. A ban on the machines took effect in 2021, but was suspended for nearly two years as skill game backers fought the ban in court. The Supreme Court of Virginia reinstated the ban last fall, leading to an urgent push by the skill game lobby to change the law and get rid of the ban.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="NCkGCjHhlZ"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/08/as-special-session-approaches-are-skill-games-dead-or-alive/">As special session approaches, are skill games dead or alive?</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its failure could mean the machines remain banned for at least another year, unless General Assembly leaders agree to call lawmakers back to Richmond in a few weeks or months for what would be an unusual summertime session on a gambling issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The governor had proposed a higher tax rate, stricter regulations and sweeping geographic limitations on skill games meant to stop the machines from cannibalizing revenue from Virginia’s casinos and Rosie’s gambling facilities tied to horse racing.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Access to contraceptives, bias training in maternal health care</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin vetoed</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=HB609" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> right-to-contraception legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Richmond and Del. Cia Price, D-Newport News. The lawmakers say their proposal is relevant because of the</span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/youngkin-contraception-virginia-general-assembly-hashmi-price/article_c74b197a-fb59-11ee-92c1-1b2a173616ec.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> shifting national landscape</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> surrounding reproductive health care laws and how some states are targeting</span><a href="https://stateline.org/2022/05/19/some-states-already-are-targeting-birth-control/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> birth control access.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The veto came after Youngkin had previously sought amendments to the bill that Hashmi said “gutted” it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The version of the bill that passed the legislature says that health care providers have a right to prescribe contraceptives and that people have a right to obtain them. It also offers definitions of forms of contraception, and outlines legal actions that could be taken if rights were infringed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the Supreme Court of the United States overturned federal abortion protections in 2022, Justice Clarence Thomas offered an opinion that indicated other settled cases could be revisited in the future — such as Griswold v. Connecticut, which protects contraception access. Youngkin’s previously proposed substitute would have aligned Virginia with the federal rulings. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Hashmi and Price said their legislation would be useful should the Supreme Court reverse its previous rulings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin wrote that the bill would create “an overly broad cause of action against political subdivisions and parents, as well as medical professionals.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price said in a text message that she thinks the governor is “picking and choosing so called First Amendment issues” and that his “hypocritical stances are an impediment to protecting our rights.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She added that lawmakers will try again on the bill. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I will continue to fight for this,” she said. “It’s too important to not (do so).”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin also vetoed another reproductive health bill that he’d first tried to change. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 35 would require unconscious bias and cultural competency training when renewing medical licenses. It was among a suite of bills aimed at improving maternal health —</span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/government-politics/virginia-black-maternal-health-carroll-foy-youngkin/article_4608fd84-d1ae-11ee-8379-138efdfc34c7.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> particularly Black maternal health</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — that cleared the legislature this year, some of which Youngkin has signed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On this bill, he&#8217;d sought amendments that advocates for the measure worried would have made trainings just a “</span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/youngkin-doulas-black-maternal-health-general-assembly/article_34a9f222-f379-11ee-8dc9-e36a8194fce6.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">checked box.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His proposed substitute would have required completion of “two hours of continuing learning activities that address maternal health care for populations of women that data indicate experience significantly greater than average maternal mortality, including African American, indigenous, and Hispanic women and women in underserved rural communities.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In explaining his veto, Youngkin noted how the legislature did not accept his amendment but that he wants to keep working with lawmakers on maternal health issues. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I will continue working with the General Assembly on our shared goals of providing more support for mothers and mothers-to-be,” he wrote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Galina Varchena, a policy director with Birth In Color, previously told the </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/youngkin-doulas-black-maternal-health-general-assembly/article_34a9f222-f379-11ee-8dc9-e36a8194fce6.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richmond Times-Dispatch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the original version of the bill would be crucial to ensure training is evidence-based — something that was missing from Youngkin’s proposal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s so easy to put something in place and then pretend that it solved a problem,” Varchena said. “We need to make sure that when we’re talking about training — is it working?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A study shows that Black people are more likely to</span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7384760" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> experience negative maternal health outcomes, in part, due to providers’ racial bias</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hestat/maternal-mortality/2021/maternal-mortality-rates-2021.htm" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Black women are also more likely to die from pregnancy complications than white women</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill’s key patron, Sen. Mamie Locke, D-Hampton, stressed that the bill could play a role in better health outcomes. She accused Youngkin on social media of having a “lack of understanding” through his veto and that the very unconscious bias the bill hoped to help solve played a role in his action. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This bill was not about partisanship or ideology,” she wrote on X, the site formerly known as Twitter. “It was about ensuring better healthcare outcomes for patients, mothers and their babies. It is a shame unconscious bias drove this veto.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Clean energy bank</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Included in the round of vetoes was Youngkin’s rejection of a bill to create a </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB729" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clean Energy Innovation Bank</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a funding mechanism designed to tap into hundreds of millions of dollars coming from the federal government in the form of loans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, and Del. Alfonso Lopez, D-Arlington, carried the bill this session after hearing a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/12/11/feds-pitch-virginia-on-loan-opportunities-for-renewable-energy-transition/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">presentation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the U.S. Department of Energy&#8217;s Loan Program </span><a href="https://studiesvirginiageneralassembly.s3.amazonaws.com/meeting_docs/documents/000/001/884/original/U.S._Dept._Energy_Lon_Programs_Office.pdf?1701876345" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Office</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the state’s ability to get funding for about 80% of the costs of clean energy projects, including those that transition fossil fuel sites into renewable sources. The state would only have to put up about 3% of a project’s funding in order to receive the long-term, lower-interest financing option.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Utility providers and homeowners would have been eligible for the financing, and projects that reduce greenhouse gas emissions, with a 15% cap on funds disbursed for projects involving coal bed </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/12/20/new-report-says-virginia-could-incentivize-methane-capture-from-coal-mines/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">methane</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and new </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/04/10/governor-amends-vetoes-and-signs-energy-environment-bills/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">nuclear</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, such as a small modular reactor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin had previously tried to put a re-enactment clause on the bill, which would’ve required it to be passed again next session before becoming effective. The legislature rejected that amendment during the reconvened session. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While I agree with the underlying purpose behind the legislation, regrettably, the General Assembly did not adopt my recommendations which would have allowed the opportunity for conflicts between the entity created by this legislation and existing programs at the Virginia Department of Energy to be resolved,” Youngkin said in his </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/governor-of-virginia/pdf/Veto-Statements.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">veto</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> memo.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Surovell, the governor had said at one point that other state agencies could have acted as the State Energy Financing Institution and received the federal funding, such as the Department of Housing and Community Development taking in money for energy efficiency efforts. Another difference, Surovell said, was the governor wanted to have the bank overseen by the Virginia Department of Energy, which would answer more directly to the administration instead of the 12-member board with non-legislative citizens that the bill would’ve created to oversee financing of projects statewide. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I wanted to create one SEFI that could finance everything,” Surovell said. “He wants to control everything. It’s just not how the government works.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lee Francis, deputy director of the League of Conservation Voters, which backed the bill this session, said Youngkin’s failure to sign the bill “ is an incredible missed opportunity and would follow a pattern of this governor putting politics ahead of what’s best for Virginia&#8217;s economy and sending good paying clean energy jobs to other states.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Confederacy-related license plates and tax breaks</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the General Assembly rejected Youngkin’s amendment to a bill to </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB812" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">repeal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> state-issued special license plates honoring the Sons of Confederate Veterans and Gen. Robert E. Lee, the governor ultimately vetoed the legislation on Friday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin had proposed lawmakers return next year to vote on the legislation and to have the state analyze the effects on the commonwealth’s revenue should the plates be discontinued. </span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="1zaibmpYyu"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/04/15/youngkin-proposes-a-second-vote-to-remove-robert-e-lee-license-plate/">Youngkin proposes a second vote to remove Robert E. Lee license plate</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He&#8217;s just not brave enough to do the right thing, and I believe he knows that he&#8217;s wrong,” said Del. Candi Mundon King, D-Prince William, who carried the legislation. “He wants to continue to appeal to MAGA extremists who want to relive the Civil War.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Department Of Motor Vehicles, as of Feb. 27, 1,783 Robert E. Lee plates and 543 Sons of Confederate Veterans plates are currently in circulation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin also vetoed </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB568" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to eliminate tax exemptions for the national and Virginia division of the United Daughters of the Confederacy, the Confederate Memorial Literary Society and the Stonewall Jackson Memorial.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Alex Askew, D-Virginia Beach — who carried the legislation, along with Sen. Angelia Williams Graves, D-Norfolk — said the veto raises questions about fairness and fiscal responsibility. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is crucial that we align our tax code with our values and vision for the commonwealth without delay,” Askew stated. “The governor&#8217;s unexplained focus on preserving these tax breaks is perplexing.” Askew added that Virginians deserved to know “why the governor is providing tax relief to historically pro-slavery institutions instead of extending tax breaks to more deserving organizations that offer opportunities for all.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin signed seven bills on Friday, including ones to expand localities’ ability to lower roadway speed limits, to allow schools divisions to offer one-year, nonrenewable local eligibility licenses for teachers, and to task the Board of Education with creating guidelines for notifying parents about school-related drug overdoses. </span></p>

(Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Richmond Electoral Board met with the city’s inspector general in a closed session Wednesday following allegations of nepotism and financial improprieties in the election office led by Registrar Keith Balmer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inspector General James Osuna and members of the electoral board declined to comment when they emerged from the closed-door meeting, saying an investigation opened by the inspector general’s office is not yet complete.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A document The Virginia Mercury obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request earlier this year offers clues about what Osuna is looking into.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last fall, an investigator in Osuna’s office contacted the State Department of Elections seeking assistance looking into a variety of complaints received from one of Balmer’s former employees. Investigator Michael Chodorov told state officials he hadn’t verified the accuracy of the information, but he relayed allegations about management “hiring family and friends,” questionable expenditures and other issues in the Richmond election office.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">City authorities seemed to be under the impression the State Board of Elections should handle the matter due its role overseeing the work of registrars. In response, state officials said the complaint was a local concern because none of the claims had a direct tie to election policy or voting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s unclear if the information in the ex-employee’s complaint has been verified or disproven, but both state and local officials have been made aware of it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Serious allegations have been made,” Electoral Board Chairman John Ambrose said Wednesday when asked about his level of concern based on what he’s heard. “And they’ll be seriously investigated.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Balmer declined to comment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a sign the issues in Richmond are escalating, officials confirmed Wednesday that City Hall has taken steps to cut off purchasing cards issued to Balmer’s office. The office isn’t a city department under Mayor Levar Stoney’s control but still uses local funds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some claims of nepotism in the Richmond election office have already been made public. Earlier this year, the </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/government-politics/richmond-registrar-keith-balmer-nepotism-accusations-brother-wife-office-of-elections/article_e0eb9052-d738-11ee-9abd-7bef8c0bbd32.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richmond Times-Dispatch reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Balmer had given his brother a job and paid his wife’s company $2,300 for training on how election workers can accommodate voters with disabilities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a public back-and-forth among board members before Wednesday’s closed session, Electoral Board Member Starlet Stevens said the subject of the private discussion was “where the money is being spent.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s going to happen whether you like it or not, John, and you’re not going to shut me up on this,” Stevens said to Ambrose.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ambrose shot back: “You’re out of order by making these comments.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stevens, a Republican, was the board chair heading into Wednesday’s meeting. But Ambrose, a Republican, and Board Member Joyce Smith, a Democrat, held a vote to oust her from that position prior to the closed session and make Ambrose the board’s new leader. They didn’t elaborate on the exact reason for that decision, but shortly after that move Ambrose and Smith voted to reinstate an election officer who had been removed from the role after some sort of physical altercation with Stevens. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the meeting, Stevens and the reinstated election officer briefly argued over who instigated the confrontation. There was no clear resolution to the matter apart from Stevens being demoted from chair and the election officer being reinstated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s unclear where the signs of trouble in the Richmond election office might lead, but the inspector general’s unfinished investigation is occurring in a high-pressure presidential year, when election officials can least afford distraction and disruption.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, city and county election offices are overseen by three-person electoral boards that operate independently of other local leaders but have the power to hire and fire registrars. Those unelected board members are appointed by local political parties and confirmed by judges. The party that won the last gubernatorial election automatically gets majority control of every electoral board in the state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Balmer took over the Richmond election office from former registrar Kirk Showalter, who was </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/richmond-electoral-board-votes-to-remove-citys-top-election-official-after-tense-public-hearing/article_ff22c0fd-1ceb-5e40-8458-9db8430d9605.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">removed in 2021</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> partly at the urging of the Democratic Party of Virginia. The Richmond Electoral Board is now under Republican control due to Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s victory in 2021, but that power shift didn’t impact Balmer’s job.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Past dysfunction in local election offices has inspired calls for state leaders to reform the system to usher in more professionalism and stability and shield registrars from political power struggles and feuds involving partisan board members.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">City officials have also chastised Balmer several times for apparent violations of procurement policy in which his office signed contracts without proper authorization under the city government’s spending rules, according to documents obtained through a records request to the city.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest election-related contract to raise eyebrows at City Hall was an agreement signed with a security firm in January that envisions “personal protection services” for Balmer at an $85 hourly rate per guard. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The contract estimates 45 hours of work per week at a minimum, adding up to a weekly cost of at least $3,825. The 40-week agreement is set to run from early February to Nov. 5, the day of the presidential election, indicating the costs could exceed $150,000.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Election officials throughout the country have faced threats following former President Donald Trump’s false claims that the 2020 election was stolen, an atmosphere that’s led to heightened security measures. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new security contract for the Richmond election office, signed with local firm HPi Unified, also envisioned six security training sessions for staff at a cost of $26,400.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, The Virginia Mercury requested a copy of the successful casino offer submitted to the city by Maryland-based Cordish Companies. On Tuesday, the city’s Freedom of Information Act officer said the document wouldn’t be released because the city canceled its competitive bidding process and hasn’t awarded a contract to Cordish.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="1yJ9LMsfih"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/04/25/before-picking-cordish-casino-petersburg-drafted-letter-saying-it-preferred-ballys/">Before picking Cordish casino, Petersburg letter said city preferred Bally&#8217;s</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Before picking Cordish casino, Petersburg letter said city preferred Bally&#8217;s&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/04/25/before-picking-cordish-casino-petersburg-drafted-letter-saying-it-preferred-ballys/embed/#?secret=73W2FXQCib#?secret=1yJ9LMsfih" data-secret="1yJ9LMsfih" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Therefore, the file is closed and no records are available,” Petersburg FOIA Officer Shaunta&#8217; Beasley said in an email.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some details have been publicly revealed about the proposal from Cordish and the other four bidders that responded to Petersburg’s Feb. 12 request for proposals from companies interested in building a casino in the city. Cordish envisions a mixed-use gambling and entertainment development that could total $1.4 billion over 15 years. The first phase calls for a casino, a 200-room hotel and an event center. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the refusal to release the full proposal — which presumably contains more exhaustive information about the casino’s expected timeline, costs, financial projections and impact on the community — is the latest example of what some see as a troubling lack of transparency surrounding Petersburg’s attempts to become the latest Virginia city eligible to have a casino.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I would be hard pressed to come up with any policy reasons that would say you can get around both procurement and public records laws simply by saying ‘oh well we’ve canceled the process and made a decision outside of it,’” said Megan Rhyne, executive director of the Virginia Coalition for Open Government.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Petersburg is preparing to ask its voters to approve the Cordish project in a ballot referendum expected to take place in November. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">City residents were invited to a public town hall on the casino proposals held on April 14, with each company invited to give a high-level overview of their plan. But the Petersburg City Council selected Cordish three days later after a closed session and virtually no public discussion of the pros and cons of each bid.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Mercury requested Cordish’s response to Petersburg’s RFP on April 25, the day after the city announced Cordish as its partner. A city spokesperson forwarded the request to Petersburg’s FOIA office, which said the city would need more than the standard five business days to respond.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Petersburg first selected Maryland-based Cordish, which developed the Live! Casino &amp; Hotel in Maryland’s Anne Arundel County and the Power Plant Live! Entertainment district in Baltimore, as its prospective casino partner in 2022. That process  was also criticized as opaque, after the city </span><a href="https://richmond.com/article_8bb09d8d-72b6-5850-8137-3b3f19303aa8.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">told the Richmond Times-Dispatch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it had no public records to provide detailing how it had decided Cordish was the best fit to build a casino in Petersburg. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The city had indicated to casino bidders it would keep their responses to the RFP confidential “as requested by the responding firms,” according to city documents. The RFP said that confidentiality would end when the city had chosen a partner and officially signed a development agreement. Cordish representatives didn’t respond Tuesday when asked if the company had instructed Petersburg not to release its casino proposal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under Virginia law, government procurement records are supposed to be open to the public, with some exceptions meant to allow officials to review competing bids privately before announcing a winner and to protect “trade secrets or proprietary information” submitted by private companies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Petersburg didn’t point to a specific FOIA exemption to explain why transparency laws don’t apply to Cordish’s response to the RFP. Instead, Beasley cited </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-4342/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a section</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the Virginia Public Procurement Act laying out multiple FOIA exemptions related to competitive bidding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That code section says the trade secrets exemption can’t be used to shield an entire bid or proposal from public view. However, the law says proposal records only become public “after the award of the contract.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a closed-door meeting on April 24, the Petersburg City Council voted to cancel the casino RFP and select Cordish as the city’s casino developer, a move that surprised and confused several of the companies competing for the project. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The city, which didn’t answer follow-up questions about how it could keep the proposal under wraps, seems to be claiming it doesn’t have to release the winning bid because, technically, there was no winner. Though the city has hailed the selection of Cordish as a major step forward in the process, Beasley said “no award was made” under the RFP.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘A process that was forced upon the city’</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The decision to cancel the RFP was supported by Petersburg City Attorney Anthony Williams, according to an April 11 legal opinion obtained by the Mercury. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In that opinion, Williams wrote that, in his view, the entire competitive bidding process was “legally improper” because the General Assembly had pressured the city into issuing the RFP by threatening to block legislation allowing Petersburg to have a casino. Williams also opined that the city selecting a casino partner didn’t count as awarding a contract under state law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The RFP process that the city is currently engaging in is not authorized or required by law in any way, shape or form,” Williams wrote. “It was demanded of the city of Petersburg by individual members of the Virginia House and Senate, and wasn’t required of any other eligible host cities currently authorized under the Code of Virginia.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He went on to call the RFP “a process that was forced upon the city as an improper political condition of moving the casino bill forward” and said it “undermines and usurps the independence of the local governing body to make decisions for the benefit of its citizens.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the General Assembly passed a law in 2020 opening the door to casinos in Virginia, state lawmakers only authorized a few select cities to pursue casinos. Because cities like Bristol and Portsmouth that lobbied for the 2020 bill already had casino plans in the works, the state didn’t require local governments to choose casino companies via competitive bidding.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘He says this is what we must go with’</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The murky process has stoked major controversy in Petersburg. One week before unanimously picking Cordish, Petersburg City Manager John “March” Altman signed a letter of intent indicating the city was picking Bally’s Corporation, a casino company that competed with Cordish for the project. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The city claims that too was a result of improper political demands from the state legislature meant to steer Petersburg’s casino project in a particular direction. Sen. Lashrecse Aird, D-Petersburg, whose office was involved in creating the Bally’s letter, has disputed the city’s allegation of outside pressure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Communications records obtained through FOIA show Aird’s office helped prepare the Bally’s letter and received the signed copy from Altman just minutes before the General Assembly convened on April 17, when the legislature voted to officially give Petersburg permission for a casino.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Attached is the letter that we discussed,” Altman wrote in an email sent shortly before noon to Aird and her chief of staff Jameson Babb. “I will be contacting the company later today to discuss.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bally’s has said the city never contacted the company about the letter of intent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On April 16, the day before Altman signed the letter, Petersburg spokeswoman Joanne Williams sent Altman and Mayor Sam Parham an email suggesting the letter had come from Aird’s office.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">See attached with Jameson. He says this is what we must go with, and they sought advice on content from another attorney,” Williams wrote to the two other city officials. All three officials involved in the exchange used personal email addresses instead of official government accounts. Parham forwarded the email to Anthony Williams, the city attorney, a few minutes after he received it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a new statement Tuesday, Aird said the city’s letter of intent selecting Bally’s “arose from their attorney refusing to assist them — and that is what’s reflected.” Her office, she said, was serving as a “sincere resource and collaborative partner” for Petersburg’s leaders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These attempts to blame the General Assembly and portray themselves as coerced into anything by me or otherwise is merely political theater and a distraction from this council’s true intentions to move forward with no process, no public engagement and proceed in the least transparent way imaginable,” Aird said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite Petersburg’s refusal to release the full Cordish proposal, the city has released other documents related to the casino RFP in response to requests from the Mercury and others, most notably a preliminary recommendation from a financial consulting firm, Davenport and Company, that said Cordish appeared to be the strongest bidder. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two-page Davenport report mentions an attachment with “a summary of each proposal under more than a dozen different variables/key considerations.” The Mercury requested that attachment on April 29 but has not yet received a copy from the city.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A gambling industry consultant who reviewed the Davenport report said the two-page summary lacks the type of detail you’d expect in a thorough review of casino proposals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sebastian Sinclair, the president of Christiansen Capital Advisors, said he would expect to see side-by-side comparisons of numbers associated with each bid and analysis of how realistic each bidders’ revenue projections were. That information isn’t included in the overview document the city has released.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Davenport report doesn’t elucidate anything,” Sinclair said in an interview. “If this is all that Davenport did, this is not adequate due diligence to make an informed choice.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sinclair, whose company advises state governments on gambling issues, said he’s been “thoroughly unimpressed” with how things have gone in Petersburg.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s almost the golden rule of casino gambling authorization,” he said. “You’ve got to be transparent in the process.”</span></p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After finishing work on almost everything else taken up during the 2024 session, the Virginia General Assembly and Gov. Glenn Youngkin have decided to keep talking about <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/02/05/virginia-explained-the-never-ending-battle-over-skill-games/">skill games</a>.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="4Wa409JZS6"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/13/virginia-lawmakers-pass-bipartisan-budget-that-leaves-tax-policy-unchanged/">Virginia lawmakers pass bipartisan budget that leaves tax policy unchanged</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Virginia lawmakers pass bipartisan budget that leaves tax policy unchanged&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/13/virginia-lawmakers-pass-bipartisan-budget-that-leaves-tax-policy-unchanged/embed/#?secret=4JKNglJpv8#?secret=4Wa409JZS6" data-secret="4Wa409JZS6" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The governor and several lawmakers said Monday that they’ll continue seeking a way to get the slot machine lookalikes taxed and regulated in response to a major lobbying push by business owners and the companies that make and distribute the games. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What we decided was that we would pick that up at another day,” Youngkin said Monday as he signed a bipartisan budget deal that didn’t address the legality of skill games. “That’s a commitment that we’ve made.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were few answers Monday on what the new skill game legislation might look like and when lawmakers could potentially return to Richmond to act on it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s more work to do,” said Sen. Aaron Rouse, D-Virginia Beach, a key sponsor of the skill game legalization bill. “We’ll make sure that we do put in that work so that by the time we come back we can be in a good place to have agreement on the bill.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The decision to keep working on skill games even though the clock has run out on the regular 2024 session is the latest sign of pro-skill game lawmakers and industry lobbyists doing whatever it takes to allow the machines to start making money again for the businesses that host them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Convenience store owners have traveled to the Capitol in droves this year to convey that skill games have become a critical source of revenue that helped them get through the COVID-19 pandemic and keep workers employed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Terry Kilgore, R-Scott, said he hopes the machines can still become legal on July 1, the date skill game supporters have been aiming for despite uncertainty over whether the state could have the manpower and technological systems in place to properly regulate them under that timeline.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lobbying effort is being led largely by Pace-O-Matic, a Georgia-based skill game company that’s become a major campaign donor to both parties in Virginia and has made contributions to both Youngkin and Democratic General Assembly leaders. The company has also </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/02/29/virginia-senator-who-does-legal-work-for-skill-game-industry-will-help-write-skill-game-bill/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hired</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Sen. Bill Stanley, R-Franklin, to perform legal work on its behalf and has </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/04/01/a-skill-game-company-gave-a-va-senator-a-1-9k-trip-no-one-will-explain-it/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hosted other senators at a rodeo event</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it sponsors every summer in Wyoming.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers were back at the Capitol this week for a one-day special session to finish work on the budget. Because that special session didn’t completely adjourn Monday, lawmakers left open the possibility of returning later to take up skill games and any other legislation that might impact state tax revenues.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Summertime special sessions are rare, and they’re often called to address a crisis or emergency. It was unclear Monday how many rank and file members of the General Assembly are on board with the prospect of coming back to the Capitol to resolve a dispute over how to legalize another form of gambling. Some weren’t too hot on the idea.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I would rather us just be done with the issue,” said Del. Mark Earley Jr., R-Chesterfield, a skill game opponent who said he’s not convinced the public is clamoring for lawmakers to approve more gambling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginians Against Neighborhood Slot Machines, an anti-skill game advocacy group funded by casinos that see the machines as undermining their more heavily regulated facilities, said it’s a waste of time and money to extend the special session to accommodate skill games.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The amount of oxygen being wasted on convenience store slot legislation is truly embarrassing for our commonwealth,” the group said in a written statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, who voted for the skill game bill, said the talk of lawmakers returning to take up new legislation is more of a possibility than a sure thing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If they come up with a proposal we’ll have to see what it is,” Surovell said. “To pass a bill like that in an efficient fashion in less than five days, it takes 80% votes. And I’m not sure whether or not people who don’t like skill games are willing to expedite the process.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The skill game talks expected to occur over the next few weeks will mostly center on how to square Youngkin’s proposal, which skill game supporters see as far too strict, with a General Assembly bill critics say is overly friendly to the industry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/04/09/in-rewrite-of-skill-game-bill-youngkin-proposes-tougher-rules-on-industry/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">proposed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a higher tax rate on the machines than what the General Assembly envisioned, tougher regulations aimed at blocking minors and gambling addicts from accessing the machines and strict geographic limitations that would ban skill games in much of the state by barring them within 35 miles of any state-licensed casino or gambling facility affiliated with horse racing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The geographic limits were particularly upsetting to skill game supporters because they would effectively ban the machines in nearly all of the state’s population centers due to the casinos and Rosie’s facilities, which feature slot machine lookalikes based on horse racing, that have already opened across the state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Local control has also been a sticking point. Before casinos and horse racing facilities could open their doors, the state required them to first win approval from voters in the communities they were interested in. The skill game bill that passed the General Assembly didn’t require voter referendums and gave city and county governments no ability to ban the machines at the local level. Youngkin had suggested giving local governments the ability to opt out of skill games without requiring the type of opt-in referendums necessary for casinos and horse racing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state Senate rejected all of Youngkin’s suggestions and sent the original bill back to the governor’s desk, where it’s still awaiting action. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The governor is facing a Friday deadline to decide what to do, but he’s widely expected to veto the bill and start fresh with a new attempt to legalize the machines.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both chambers of the General Assembly approved the new two-year budget plan by wide margins. In the House of Delegates, the vote was 94-6. The state Senate approved it 39-1. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This has been a protracted process,” House of Delegates Appropriations Committee Chairman Luke Torian, D-Prince William, said on the House floor prior to the vote. “But working together with the Senate and the governor we have developed a product that all parties believe will meet the needs of the commonwealth.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The handful of votes against the budget were cast by Republicans, but Gov. Glenn Youngkin officially signed the document Monday afternoon, resolving the budget standoff and officially ending the remote possibility of a state government shutdown on July 1.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We in fact listened to one another,” Youngkin said. “And understood each other’s priorities and perspectives. And that came together in the budget that we are going to sign today.”</span></p>

<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">No tax increases, no tax cuts</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new budget agreement reflects the narrowly divided political dynamic in Richmond after Youngkin failed to win GOP majorities in last year’s legislative elections. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislation doesn’t include any of the tax cuts Youngkin called for in his original budget proposal last year. It also temporarily drops the idea of expanding the state’s sales tax to digital purchases like streaming services, downloads and software licenses, a tax expansion Democrats had included in their budget plan to help raise more money for public schools. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The end result is a budget with no tax cuts and no tax increases, but Democrats have signaled they plan to keep studying the digital sales tax proposal as part of a broader look at the state’s code ahead of the 2025 legislative session.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats characterized the agreement as a win and emphasized that it reflected virtually all of the spending priorities they laid out during the regular session that ended in March.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is essentially the same budget that the governor called ‘backwards’ and now he will be signing it into law,” House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, said in a statement. “We have historic funding for education, healthcare, coastal resiliency, and gun violence prevention. We are being consistent with our values and putting our money where our mouth is.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Education funding</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to the elimination of the digital sales tax, the state will lose $169 million in education direct aid spending. However, the budget includes more than $370 million for the At-Risk Add-On, which supports economically disadvantaged students, and a more than $70 million increase in support for English learner students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two-year budget includes state money to pay for 3% salary increases in both years for teachers and other school staffers as well as state employees. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The compromises on how public education will be funded in the new two-year spending plan “raise concerns about long-term fiscal stability of our state budget to fund critical K-12 priorities in the future,” the education advocacy group Fund Our Schools Coalition said in a statement after Monday’s special session wrapped. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The plan also has significant new spending to improve the state’s behavioral health system, adding more resources to help Virginians suffering from mental health crises.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">RGGI reentry language nixed</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to backing off the digital sales tax proposal, the budget deal dropped a Democratic provision aiming to force the Youngkin administration to have Virginia rejoin the carbon market known as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Finance and Appropriations Committee Chair Sen. Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, suggested those steps were necessary as part of the back-and-forth with a Republican governor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I know these actions are not popular &#8230; and many feel that we are essentially kicking the can down the road, but progress can take time and sometimes compromise,” Lucas said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The market requires electricity producers to purchase allowances to emit carbon as a way to incentivize decreasing the release of planet-warming carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.The revenues are returned to the participating states, where in Virginia about $730 million had been directed toward flood resiliency and energy efficiency programs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Youngkin had called the monthly fee tacked onto customer&#8217;s monthly bills to recoup the allowance purchases — which amounted to about </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/07/26/dominion-gets-approval-to-charge-customers-again-for-carbon-market-participation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$2.39</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Dominion territory — a “hidden tax,” prompting him to withdraw Virginia from the market through an executive order and regulatory change, despite advocates saying a legislative change is needed. The matter is being </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/10/27/fairfax-county-judge-weighing-fate-of-suit-over-youngkins-carbon-market-withdrawal/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">challenged</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Floyd County Circuit Court.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Rip Sullivan, D-Fairfax, said in a floor speech that Youngkin insisted the RGGI language come out  “under threat of veto.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If RGGI is a tax then so are the additional fees Virginians will soon see on our electric bills,” Sullivan added, referencing legislation carried by </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=Hb1491" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Israel O&#8217;Quinn, R-Washington</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=Sb454" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Dave Marsden, D-Fairfax</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, that Youngkin signed, allowing utilities to recover early development costs for a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/04/10/governor-amends-vetoes-and-signs-energy-environment-bills/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">small modular reactor. </span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for his insistence on removing the RGGI reentry language, Youngkin said in a press conference Monday afternoon, “We had a robust discussion around all aspects of the budget. … If we know that everyone is not happy then we probably landed in a good spot.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some environmental groups, except for the Chesapeake Bay Foundation and the Virginia Energy Efficiency Council, who support the RGGI funding coming into Virginia, released a </span><a href="https://appvoices.org/2024/05/13/rggi-budget-compromise/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">statement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> earlier in the day that said removing the language was a “capitulation by the General Assembly.” The Bay Foundation and Environmental Defense Fund said in their own statements not including the RGGI language was a disappointment, but separate measures included in the newly approved budget — including funding for pollution reduction measures and a new Chief Resilience Officer — are to be lauded.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Veteran families’ tuition waiver changes</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even as legislators in both parties hailed the deal’s passage as an example of putting partisan differences aside, some lawmakers pointed to a new problem that arose during budget talks that happened largely in private and was apparently only spotted once the deal became public.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several legislators in the House and Senate voiced concerns about a provision included in the budget they passed that will impact the </span><a href="https://www.dvs.virginia.gov/education-employment/virginia-military-survivors-and-dependents-education-program-2-2-2" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Military Survivors and Dependents Education Program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (VMSDEP), which provides college tuition waivers to the spouses or children of permanently disabled military veterans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Language in the budget will now require family members of disabled veterans seeking to further their education at a college or university to first complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), a change from the previous standards that required applicants: be the spouse or child (age 16 to 29) of a living or deceased veteran of the United States Armed Forces, United States Armed Forces Reserves, or the Virginia National Guard Virginia residents; have a physical presence in Virginia; and attend a Virginia public college or university. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The program is administered through the Virginia Department of Veterans Services (VDVS) in collaboration with the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia (SCHEV).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several senators said on the floor that the budget language adds an unnecessary roadblock for veterans&#8217; families trying to obtain an education.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is an issue I&#8217;ve heard from numerous families who really feel blindsided by what has happened,&#8221; said Sen. Tara Durant, R-Fredericksburg. &#8220;We expect this type of legislation to go through the proper process, through committee, when those who are impacted by it can come before committee and speak on it. &#8230; Instead [we are] legislating this through the budget. Many of us today are surprised to see how this is going to impact those families.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Bill DeSteph, R-Virginia Beach, characterized it as an unintentional error.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There&#8217;s nobody here that wants to cause any harm to those who sacrificed their lives, and what we recognize as a benefit or helping hand for their children. &#8230; I know that in our hearts of hearts, we don&#8217;t want to cause any harm to this program. I&#8217;m asking for Gov. Youngkin to call [for] a study on&#8221; the program&#8217;s requirements, DeSteph said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Jeremy McPike, D-Prince William, the patron of the 2019 legislation that expanded the program, agreed that its requirements needed further study and said his original intent was for the fund to provide veterans&#8217; spouses and children &#8220;opportunities for undergraduate&#8221; education, not &#8220;medical school and other things&#8221; he said the program is currently being used to pay for.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin proposed an amendment that would have preserved military families&#8217; access to the program without the new FAFSA requirement but lawmakers rejected that suggestion, and all of his amendments, when they reconvened in the April 17 veto session.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Partisan drama was kept to a minimum Monday, and General Assembly leaders appeared to be trying to complete the budget as quickly and efficiently as possible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t want to keep y’all here any longer than I have to,” Scott quipped at one point while presiding over the House. “As much as I love you all.”</span></p>
<p><em>Mercury editor Samantha Willis contributed to this story.</em></p>
<p><em>Editor&#8217;s note:</em> This story has been corrected to reflect that McPike&#8217;s legislation expanded the <span style="font-weight: 400;">VMSDEP program, but did not create it. </span></p>

(Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It took a little while, but Virginia’s Democratic-led General Assembly and Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin have come up with a budget deal both sides can apparently live with.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?242+lst+ALL" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legislative documents</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> outlining the agreement were released Saturday morning to allow the budget to be voted on today when lawmakers return to Richmond for a special session focused on finishing the budget. The special session is happening because Youngkin and Democratic leaders spent months publicly sparring over budget priorities and didn’t come to an agreement last month under the state’s usual timeline to pass a budget.</span></p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Virginia legislature will consider reworked state budget in May 13 special session&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/04/17/virginia-legislature-will-consider-reworked-state-budget-in-may-13-special-session/embed/#?secret=eOBTZUWP5s#?secret=5up64QvDMw" data-secret="5up64QvDMw" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without a new spending plan in place, the state was facing the possibility of a government shutdown on July 1, when the current budget expires and the next two-year spending plan begins.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The specifics of the bipartisan budget deal will be explained in more detail as lawmakers take up the bill, but here are five key takeaways.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The digital sales tax increase is out</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin has repeatedly said he won’t sign a budget that raises taxes, and now he won’t have to.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A contested proposal to expand the state’s sales tax to cover digital purchases like streaming subscriptions, music downloads and software was struck from the pending budget after Democratic negotiators concluded they could achieve what they wanted to do without the extra money.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A presentation prepared for the House of Delegates Appropriations Committee notes that the digital sales tax was only on the table because Youngkin had proposed it to offset other tax cuts he wanted, but “was not driven by a systematic look at Virginia’s tax structure.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For now, lawmakers are foregoing the roughly $1 billion in new revenue the digital sales tax was projected to generate over two years. Policymakers have indicated that the decision was made possible by stronger-than-expected tax revenues already coming in, but the idea could come back around in future years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new budget deal envisions a wider look at Virginia’s tax policy by a joint legislative subcommittee that will study the digital sales tax and other issues for potential action in the 2025 General Assembly session.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Democratic spending priorities are still in</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats have stressed that the spending in the budget deal closely resembles what they passed earlier this year, meaning they didn’t have to abandon big-ticket items by dropping the digital sales tax proposal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The House budget presentation says the deal “retains all spending items from the conference report,” including funding increases for K-12 schools and higher education. Democrats had proposed major increases in what’s known as at-risk add-on funding, extra money the state gives to school divisions with high numbers of economically disadvantaged students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats clearly didn’t get everything they wanted out of the 2024 session, as Youngkin vetoed more than 150 bills. Several of them were high-profile Democratic priorities like legalizing retail sales of marijuana for recreational use and raising the state’s minimum wage to $15 per hour by 2026.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, some of those vetoes freed up money in the budget tied to bills that won’t become law. Because raising the minimum wage would have come with extra costs to the state, Youngkin’s veto of that bill saved $80 million that could be used to balance the overall budget.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Teachers are still getting raises</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new budget deal includes state funding to pay for 3% raises for teachers and school support personnel in both years of the budget.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin had proposed more modest pay increases for teachers in his original budget proposal last year, but came around to supporting 3% increases in both years in the revised budget plan he offered in April.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats have </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/01/17/legislation-to-bring-va-teacher-pay-to-national-average-gets-bipartisan-support/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">prioritized</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> raising teacher pay to the national average or better, and Youngkin’s administration has stressed that educator pay has already gone up during his administration.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The budget won’t be linked to RGGI</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Early in his term, the governor angered many Democratic lawmakers by issuing an executive order aiming to end Virginia’s participation in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a multi-state program meant to reduce planet-warming carbon emissions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats questioned whether Youngkin had the authority to remove the state from a program the legislature voted to enter, and they insisted on their stance by including language in their budget proposal in March, meant to force the state to rejoin RGGI despite Youngkin’s objections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The program requires electricity producers to purchase allowances for the carbon they emit, and some money raised from those purchases is returned to Virginia and used for flood resiliency and energy efficiency efforts. Youngkin has criticized RGGI as a backdoor tax on Virginians because it allows companies to recoup the costs through customers’ energy bills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Litigation over Youngkin’s move is currently pending in the Floyd County Circuit Court, and the issue now appears more likely to be settled there, or through Virginia’s 2025 election.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">No budget do-over for skill games</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Convenience store, truck stop and restaurant owners across the state have been closely watching whether the state will repeal its ban on slot machine lookalikes known as skill games.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If that’s going to happen, it’s not happening through the budget. Instead, the budget scraps nearly $94 million in skill game revenue anticipated for fiscal year 2025, an indication the machines are unlikely to be reactivated by July 1 as the business owners wanted. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That money was expected because the General Assembly passed a bill earlier this year to tax and regulate skill games. However, Youngkin gave the bill a sweeping rewrite that upset the skill game industry by including tougher regulations and strict rules prohibiting the machines within a certain distance of casinos and gambling facilities tied to horse racing, places of worship, schools and day care centers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state Senate flatly rejected all of Youngkin’s suggestions last month, but at the time both the governor and lawmakers were talking about continued negotiations and finding a way forward.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With no action on skill games in the budget, Youngkin can either sign or veto the original bill he tried to overhaul. If the legislation is vetoed, skill game proponents could only continue their fight via new legislation that could be taken up later this year or in the 2025 session.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new budget retains several provisions anticipating regulatory costs for legalized skill games, a sign there’s still a chance for the machines to be legalized later.</span></p>

(Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At a meeting of Virginia’s advisory council on gambling addiction late last month, Del. Paul Krizek, D-Fairfax, made a bold prediction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The battle over whether the state should legalize the </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/02/05/virginia-explained-the-never-ending-battle-over-skill-games/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">slots-like gambling machines known as skill games</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reached a standstill in April due to policy disagreements between the General Assembly and Gov. Glenn Youngkin. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There have been signals the skill game legalization effort could potentially be revived by being folded into the unfinished state budget lawmakers are supposed to finish next week. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Krizek said he doesn’t see that happening and thinks the skill game legalization effort is probably dead for the year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I would be very surprised if the skill game [bill] somehow gets resurrected in the budget process,” Krizek, a skill game critic who chairs a House of Delegates subcommittee that handles gambling issues, told the problem gambling panel at its April 24 meeting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the special session fast approaching, it’s looking increasingly unlikely the House, state Senate and governor’s office are going to reach a deal on skill games. But it’s not being entirely ruled out yet, which means it’s unclear if skill games will or won’t be on the General Assembly’s agenda when it reconvenes Monday for a special session.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Wednesday evening, Sen. Creigh Deeds, D-Charlottesville, said he and other House and Senate members negotiating the budget haven’t come to a consensus path forward on skill games.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But we still have left open the possibility that some things can be resolved by tomorrow,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin and leaders of the Democratic-controlled General Assembly are trying to work out a compromise between two dueling budget plans they crafted earlier this year. Neither of the proposals serving as the basis for those negotiations include language lifting Virginia’s newly enacted ban on the thousands of gambling machines installed in convenience stores, truck stops and restaurants throughout the state. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If there are any plans in the works to add skill game legalization language to the budget, nobody’s going public with details.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s office would not comment for this story. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Appropriations Chairman Luke Torian, D-Prince William, Senate Finance and Appropriations Chairwoman Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, and several other lawmakers didn’t respond to requests for comment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s unclear if that silence is a sign policymakers are close to giving up on the idea of a skill game deal for this year or trying to keep last-minute talks under wraps. Either way, they’re running out of time to figure it out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the special session timeline state leaders have laid out, the newly negotiated budget would be unveiled Monday at the latest, which means there are only a few days left to make final decisions about whether the skill game standoff will or won’t be resolved through the budget.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to pleas from business owners who say their livelihood depends on the extra money from the now-deactivated gambling machines, the General Assembly passed a bill that would tax and regulate the machines instead of leaving them illegal. Opponents of the bill contend Virginia has already allowed too much gambling and shouldn’t sanction slot machine lookalikes that are trickier to regulate because they’re spread throughout hundreds of smaller storefronts instead of being confined to a few big casinos and horse facing facilities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/04/09/in-rewrite-of-skill-game-bill-youngkin-proposes-tougher-rules-on-industry/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">proposed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a higher tax rate on the machines than what the General Assembly envisioned, tougher regulations aimed at blocking minors and gambling addicts from accessing the machines and strict geographic limitations that would ban skill games in much of the state by barring them within 35 miles of any state-licensed casino or gambling facility affiliated with horse racing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If no deal is reached, skill games will remain illegal in Virginia under a ban former Gov. Ralph Northam first approved in 2020. There are still multiple ways the machines could become legal this year, but the lack of forward movement has convinced many Capitol observers the outlook for skill games is turning grim.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That one had a long and interesting life,” Krizek said of the skill game bill at last month’s meeting of Virginia’s Problem Gambling Treatment and Support Advisory Committee. “It’s now on life support.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If skill game legalization isn’t included in the budget deal, the General Assembly would have to broaden the focus of the special session in order to take it up as standalone legislation. That step could complicate efforts to have a swift special session in which lawmakers pass a consensus budget, announce they’ve prevented a government shutdown and go home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pro-skill game coalition that’s been lobbying for the bill has gone mostly silent since April 17, when the state Senate </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/04/17/future-of-skill-games-in-virginia-still-unclear-as-senate-rejects-youngkins-proposal/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">soundly rejected</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Youngkin’s much tougher rewrite of the skill game legalization bill and sent him back the original, more industry-friendly version the legislature preferred. A spokeswoman for the Virginia Merchants and Amusement Coalition, one of the main groups leading the charge for skill game legalization, didn’t respond to requests for comment on where things stand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin could still theoretically allow the original bill to become law, but that too seems unlikely because the governor has said he sees numerous problems with the looser regulatory structure lawmakers insisted on keeping. The governor has not yet acted on bills sent back to him last month, but the pending skill game bill could be among the next batch of vetoes he’s expected to announce late next week after the special session is over.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proponents of the skill game legalization bill have said it includes safeguards meant to mitigate gambling addiction and prevent anyone under 21 from playing the games, but critics have argued the measures in the bill would be ineffective because they fall short of similar rules applied to other types of newly legalized gambling like casinos and sports betting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At last month’s meeting of the problem gambling advisory council, Carolyn Hawley, a Virginia Commonwealth University professor who’s one of the state’s foremost experts on gambling addiction, said the skill game bill the General Assembly passed has set back gambling mitigation efforts by lowering the bar of what’s expected when new types of gambling are legalized.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When we look at all the other industries with everything that’s being accomplished in the state as far as responsible gaming and consumer protection, it eradicated all of that,” Hawley said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPGTWtzktaI&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recent episode of his podcast</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Sen. Bill Stanley, R-Franklin, who has pushed to keep skill games legal both in the General Assembly and by helping the industry fight the ban in court, indicated he too is unsure of what the final outcome will be now that skill games are “in the weeds with the budget.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s all up in the air,” Stanley said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an </span><a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/clinicians/reporting-adverse-events-in-children-following-exposure-to-thc-and-cbd-containing-products/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">April 24 letter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to clinicians, State Health Commissioner Karen Shelton said her agency had received enough reports of minors getting sick from products containing CBD and THC, chemical compounds found in cannabis, that the state was establishing a “special surveillance system” to keep tabs on the issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Reported symptoms for these adverse events have included vomiting, hallucinations, low blood pressure, low blood sugar, altered mental status and anxiety,” Shelton wrote, adding that “some hospitalizations have occurred” as a result of minors consuming cannabis products.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The letter specifically asks that local health departments be made aware of any cannabis-related hospitalizations in patients under 18 years old and any “clusters of adverse events” affecting multiple minors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“After a hospitalization or cluster is reported, VDH staff will collect information about the illness(es), possible exposures, and laboratory results,” the letter says.</span></p>

(Source: Virginia Department of Health)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Health Department provided data showing an increase in emergency room visits involving minors being exposed to cannabis, and said the new surveillance system will help bolster those tracking efforts. In 2019, there were 52 ER visits. By 2023, the number had grown to 377.</span></p>
<p>That data only covers emergency room visits and doesn&#8217;t reflect every incident reported to health officials.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a result of these data, the special surveillance system was established in order for VDH to receive these reports directly and better assess the impact of adverse events related to consumption of products containing THC or CBD among children in the Commonwealth,&#8221; said Health Department spokesperson Cheryle Rodriguez.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The letter also points to an </span><a href="https://redcap.vdh.virginia.gov/redcap/surveys/?s=7R4T3M7KFL" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">online portal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> allowing anyone who had an adverse experience with cannabis products to submit a report to the Health Department with information about what happened, where the product was obtained and how it was labeled. The agency also noted that lab testing is available to “support patient and product testing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The tracking system set up by health officials is the latest government effort to mitigate the downsides of cannabis, as policymakers continue to debate what to do about adult use of marijuana and products close enough to weed to produce a similar high. Earlier this year, Gov. Glenn Youngkin pointed to health risks to children as one of his reasons for vetoing legislation that would have legalized retail sales of marijuana for purely recreational use.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The most concerning consequence of cannabis commercialization is its impact on adolescents and our children,” Youngkin said in his veto statement, which also cited data showing increases in calls to poison control centers for children who consumed cannabis edibles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There have been numerous news stories in the past few years of THC-related overdoses at Virginia schools, some of them being serious enough to require hospitalization. Last year, a high school in the city of Richmond took the unusual step of banning all candy after four students suffered “medical distress” after eating edibles believed to contain a form of THC, the intoxicating element found in marijuana, </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/education/hemp-richmond-public-schools-edibles-virginia-cannabis-control-authority/article_fac073be-84d4-11ee-93ab-eb2e982913a0.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to the Richmond Times-Dispatch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As lawmakers have relaxed Virginia’s laws on adult possession of small amounts of marijuana, they’ve taken steps to crack down on legally murky products like delta-8 THC, which produces a high similar to marijuana but has gone largely unregulated because it’s typically derived from hemp plants.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michelle Peace, a forensic science professor at Virginia Commonwealth University who specializes in vaping and cannabis research, said data collection and better testing will help health officials “get their arms around” the issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s important to know how pervasive the problem is,” Peace said in an interview.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Peace has been doing her own research into the vaping habits of Virginia K-12 students by testing the contents of vape equipment confiscated by school officials. Out of 369 submissions, 82% contained nicotine and 18% had some form of THC. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Much of that THC was “very highly concentrated,” Peace said, making it more likely that the user would experience negative effects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“At the end of the day, there needs to be proper attribution as to what the child actually consumed,” Peace said.</span></p>

(Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s 45-day early voting window began Friday for the June 18 primaries that will set the stage for the state’s U.S. Senate race as well as a handful of competitive races for seats in the U.S. House of Representatives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans are choosing a nominee to challenge U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va. in a statewide contest this fall, and at least one party is holding a primary in six of Virginia’s 11 congressional districts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In-person early voting is underway at all local voter registrar offices, and many localities also offer satellite early voting sites. Would-be voters can find details on their local election office on the </span><a href="https://vote.elections.virginia.gov/VoterInformation/PublicContactLookup" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Department of Elections website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which also offers an </span><a href="https://vote.elections.virginia.gov/VoterInformation" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">online citizen portal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> allowing voters to check their registration status, register to vote, find out which congressional district they’re in and apply for an absentee ballot to be sent through the mail. The deadline to request a mail absentee ballot is June 7.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voters casting ballots in person will need to present an </span><a href="https://www.elections.virginia.gov/media/formswarehouse/voter-id/outreach-materials/documents/Voter-Identification-Chart---Revised-08.23.2023.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">acceptable form of identification</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but anyone lacking an ID will still be able to cast a provisional ballot that will only be counted if elections officials verify their eligibility later.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In districts with both a Republican and Democratic congressional primary, voters will be asked to choose a ballot for one party.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine is considered a strong frontrunner in the Senate race. Virginia has voted Democratic in every presidential election year since 2008, and the five Republicans vying to compete against him in November aren’t particularly well-known. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The GOP Senate field includes former congressional candidate and U.S. Navy veteran Hung Cao, U.S. Army veteran Eddie Garcie, attorneys Jonathan Emord and Chuck Smith and Scott Parkinson, who works for the conservative economic group Club for Growth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More competition is anticipated in the U.S. House races, particularly in the Hampton Roads-based 2nd District and two Northern Virginia seats coming open in the 7th and 10th House Districts. A closely watched Republican primary is also playing out in the 5th District, which leans Republican and stretches through the central part of the state.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">7th District</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger — a Democrat who currently represents the 7th District anchored in Prince William County and the Fredericksburg area — isn’t running for election this year because she’s running for governor in 2025.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seven Democrats and six Republicans are competing in their respective primaries for the 7th District seat. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The top fundraisers in the Democratic race are retired Army colonel Eugene Vindman, Del. Brianna Sewell, former Del. Elizabeth Guzman and Prince William Supervisors Margaret Angela and Andrea Bailey. Vindman — the brother of whistleblower Alex Vindman who </span><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2021/08/trump-ukraine-call-impeachment-vindman/619617/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">called attention</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to a controversial 2019 phone call former President Donald Trump made urging Ukrainian officials to investigate President Joe Biden — has raised more than $3.7 million for his campaign, giving him a substantial money advantage over rivals that have more experience in Virginia politics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most well-funded Republican candidates are Army veteran Derrick Anderson, who previously ran for the seat in 2022, and former Navy SEAL Cameron Hamilton.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">10th District</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A dozen Democratic candidates are competing for the opportunity to replace U.S. Rep. Jennifer Wexton, D-Loudoun, who announced she won’t run for reelection after being diagnosed with a severe form of Parkinson’s Disease.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several big names in Democratic politics are in the running for the Democratic-leaning Northern Virginia seat, including former House of Delegates Speaker Eileen Filler-Corn, Sen. Jennifer Boysko, Del. Dan Helmer, Sen. Suhas Subramanyam, Del. David Reid and former Virginia education secretary Atif Qarni.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Running on the Republican side are attorney and technology executive Mike Clancy, Marine Corps veteran and former Youngkin administration official Aliscia Andrews, retired military officer Alex Isaac and defense contractor Manga Anantatmula.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">2nd District</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Rep. Jen Kiggans, R-Virginia Beach, is a top target for Democrats after narrowly flipping the 2nd District in 2022 by defeating former congresswoman Elaine Luria.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrat Missy Cotter Smasal, a Navy veteran and business owner, is being backed by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee to take on Kiggans, but she’s facing primary competition from civil rights and constitutional law attorney Jake Denton.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">5th District</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Rep Bob Good, R-Campbell, who chairs the hard-right House Freedom Caucus, is being challenged from the right by state Sen. John McGuire, R-Goochland, in a hard-fought GOP primary where both candidates are angling for support from the Trump wing of the party.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good has drawn criticism from McGuire over his decision to endorse Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis for president instead of Trump, but Good’s campaign has returned fire by calling McGuire a political opportunist who’s constantly seeking higher office.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The winner of the GOP primary would be the frontrunner in a Republican-leaning district that runs from the Charlottesville area to the outskirts of Richmond and includes the cities of Lynchburg and Danville.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Three Democrats — Gloria Tinsley Witt, Paul Riley and Gary Terry — are also competing in a 5th District primary.</span></p>

But an attorney for the father involved blasted the statement the board issued this week and suggested the case may not be over yet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The board announced Wednesday that its </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/04/22/virginia-school-board-files-600k-lawsuit-against-father-of-special-needs-student/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">earlier request</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for at least $600,000 in damages has been reduced to just $1 after the parent, David Rife, agreed to new ground rules on how he and school personnel would communicate.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="s20zYCErFe"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/04/22/virginia-school-board-files-600k-lawsuit-against-father-of-special-needs-student/">Virginia school board files $600K lawsuit against father of special needs student</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Virginia school board files $600K lawsuit against father of special needs student&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/04/22/virginia-school-board-files-600k-lawsuit-against-father-of-special-needs-student/embed/#?secret=RdOVglrpQD#?secret=s20zYCErFe" data-secret="s20zYCErFe" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A court hearing in the case had been scheduled for Wednesday. That hearing was called off after the two sides indicated they were trying to resolve the dispute less formally. Court records show the case hasn’t been fully dropped.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a news release Wednesday afternoon, Bedford County Public Schools said the lawsuit was “never about collecting money from the parent.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While our lawsuit remains active, as a measure of good faith, we have instructed our attorney to reduce the monetary component of the lawsuit to $1,” the school division said. “If the Communication Plan is adhered to, we intend to dismiss the lawsuit.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The school division’s statement said its leaders remain “strongly committed to parents’ rights.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We strongly encourage parents to actively participate and oversee the public education of their children,” the statement said. “However, we also strongly support our many excellent educators and staff. No parent has the right to inappropriately threaten or profanely abuse educators.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the school division’s statement suggested things were being worked out, Rife’s attorney, David Whitehurst, issued his own statement Thursday accusing school officials of backtracking and continuing to malign his client.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These are unsubstantiated allegations made in their lawsuit, which we have refuted, and on which no judge has yet ruled,” Whitehurst said. “To repeat them in a public statement is a continued effort to smear and tarnish Mr. Rife and his reputation.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whitehurst also questioned the schools’ claim the suit wasn’t about money, saying the high damages sought from Rife caused “great stress and anxiety to both the parent and his son.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Their claim for damages included $350,000 in punitive damages, the maximum amount allowed under state law,” Whitehurst said. “This does not comport with a suit never being about money.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The school board, which serves a mostly rural county located between Lynchburg and Roanoke, filed the civil lawsuit against Rife in late March, alleging the frequency and tone of his calls, emails and in-person conversations with school employees amounted to unlawful intimidation and harassment. The school system’s court filings listed several examples of Rife using profanity and threatening to call the police on staffers whom he felt weren’t taking his concerns seriously and weren’t adequately educating his son.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response, Rife and his attorney acknowledged Rife had used “impolite” language but portrayed the school board’s lawsuit as an effort to punish a parent for “passionately advocating” for their child. Rife’s concerns about how the school was handling his son’s learning disability were partially vindicated after he filed a complaint with the Virginia Department of Education early this year. The state agency ruled Bedford school officials weren’t in compliance with several elements of the individualized education program (IEP) designed to help Rife’s son improve his reading skills. Rife filed his own legal claims against the school division asking the court to require compliance with the IEP.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The case sparked blowback locally. After news stories about the litigation were published, a Facebook page dedicated to discussion of Bedford County school issues lit up with questions about why the division felt it had to go as far as suing a parent for more than half a million dollars. Multiple school board members claimed the board wasn’t aware of the suit, according to reporting by </span><a href="https://cardinalnews.org/2024/04/29/2-bedford-county-school-board-members-say-board-wasnt-aware-of-lawsuit-against-parent/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">regional news outlet Cardinal News</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. However, the school board itself was listed as the plaintiff bringing the case with assistance from attorneys in the Richmond office of the Sands Anderson law firm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whitehurst said the new rules on how Rife and school staff would interact was a joint agreement by both parties. Despite the board’s statement calling it a “communication plan,” Whitehurst said the two sides had previously agreed not to use that term.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rife’s lawyer also pointed out school officials don’t have the final say on whether the legal fight proceeds or not because Rife has filed competing claims about their failure to comply with the IEP.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Two days ago, we felt hopeful that things were moving forward in a positive way in this case,” Whitehurst said. “The statement issued by the board has greatly dimmed that hope.”</span></p>

(Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Petersburg Mayor Sam Parham said Wednesday that he stands by the allegation that his city faced political pressure from the General Assembly to choose a particular casino developer or risk losing the opportunity to have a casino altogether.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Lashrecse Aird, D-Petersburg, whom the Petersburg City Council has alleged had a hand in that pressure, has </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/04/30/petersburg-senator-denies-claim-she-interfered-in-citys-casino-process/#:~:text=Sen.%20Lashrecse%20Aird%2C%20D%2D,manager%20was%20coerced%20into%20signing."><span style="font-weight: 400;">disputed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the city’s characterization of events as “revisionist history.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking with reporters late Wednesday afternoon following a closed council meeting on the casino project, Parham didn’t back down.</span></p>
<p><b>“</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have a council of seven that is unified on the fact that we told the truth,” Parham said, referring to </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2-RESOLUTION-2.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the resolution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> he and his City Council colleagues passed on April 24 that suggested Petersburg’s city manager was coerced into signing a letter saying the city would partner with Bally’s Corporation to build and operate its casino.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The council resolution claims City Manager John “March” Altman Jr. only signed the April 17 letter to avoid having the General Assembly kill legislation allowing Petersburg to have a casino.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We don’t do this to appease any groups or take any type of favors or any type of slanted deals out of Richmond,” Parham said. “We do this for the people of Petersburg.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One week after the April 17 Bally’s letter, the Petersburg City Council </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/04/24/petersburg-doubles-down-on-cordish-as-its-casino-operator/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">voted unanimously</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to select The Cordish Companies as its casino partner, re-upping with the Maryland-based developer the city seemed to prefer all along. Petersburg had already selected Cordish in 2022 for an earlier, failed attempt at a casino, and the City Council claims the city was told it had to “reconsider” its decision to go with Cordish as a condition of its casino bill moving forward.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t know if there were some problems in Richmond with Cordish,” Parham said. “I don’t see how because they have a solid, family-run operation. They take care of their employees.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aird didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday evening on Parham’s remarks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The mayor also pushed back on the notion that Cordish isn’t friendly to labor unions while Bally’s and other bidders were, emphasizing that Cordish has agreements in place with the Maryland-based Seafarers Entertainment &amp; Allied Trades Union.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Cordish does have union jobs,” Parham said. “I’m not here to pick between which union is better. I want the best product for the citizens of Petersburg.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The city could have a legal fight coming with a hospitality workers’ union that had a deal in place with Bally’s. Unite Here, a union whose PAC that contributed heavily to Aird’s 2023 Senate campaign, has </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/04/30/labor-union-says-its-filing-foia-suit-over-secretive-petersburg-casino-process/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">threatened to file a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> against Petersburg officials alleging that their closed-door decisions on the casino have violated Virginia transparency laws.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The City Council held another lengthy closed-door meeting Wednesday, spending an hour and a half holding private discussions on legal matters related to the casino. When the council returned to open session, the body approved a change to its earlier resolution to correct a factual error. That error misstated the date of the April 14 town hall meeting Aird hosted in Petersburg to allow residents to hear directly from the five bidders vying for the casino project.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asked if he knew why Bally’s was named in the letter the city manager signed three days later, Parham indicated he couldn’t say.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That is the amazing caper here,” the mayor said. “The why.”</span></p>

(2019 photo by Julia Rendleman)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A hospitality workers’ union trying to ensure Petersburg picks a labor-friendly developer for its planned casino says it will sue the city over alleged transparency violations after the City Council appeared to make major decisions on the casino project behind closed doors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unite Here, a union that represents casino workers across the country, announced Tuesday that it will file a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit against the Petersburg City Council over its surprise decision to cancel a competitive bidding process and give the casino project to The Cordish Companies, a development company based in Baltimore.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That vote occurred in a matter of minutes at an <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/04/24/petersburg-doubles-down-on-cordish-as-its-casino-operator/">April 24 meeting</a> after the City Council spent more than an hour and a half in closed session. The stated purpose of the closed meeting was for the council to receive legal advice related to the casino process, but Unite Here alleges the meeting was illegal because the public was given no notice of the significant decision that was made that day almost entirely outside of public view.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In its brief open session on April 24, the Petersburg City Council canceled a request for proposals it had issued on Feb. 12 and voted to select Cordish as the city’s casino operator, without reading or providing copies of the resolution the body was passing. Council members then left the meeting without explaining what they had just done to the few reporters that attended the meeting in a mostly empty auditorium.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The City of Petersburg’s actions show a shocking disregard for the law and democratic norms,” Sam Epps, political director of Unite Here Local 25, said in a news release. “Petersburg had begun a competitive RFP process that should have proceeded with transparency and fairness. Instead, City Council apparently abused a closed session to discuss the selection of the casino operator.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The union said its lawsuit will allege that the council used the closed session to discuss the recommendations of a consulting firm the city hired to vet proposals, a discussion that the suit will claim didn’t align with the legally required motion stating the purpose of the closed meeting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A billion-dollar development project cannot be decided in secrecy,” said Paul Schwalb, executive secretary-treasurer of Unite Here Local 25.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the union’s lawsuit succeeds, it could have ramifications beyond technical violations of open government laws.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2024-04-29-Letter-from-P-More-to-Petersburg-CC.pdf">six-page letter</a> the union sent to Petersburg officials asking them to preserve all documents relevant to the upcoming litigation, a lawyer for Unite Here said any decisions made at the April 24 meeting are “clearly void.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because of that, the letter states, the city should not move forward with its casino plans by signing a contract with Cordish or beginning the process of scheduling a voter referendum in November that will determine whether the project will or won’t happen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The union’s letter also takes issue with the council’s decision to “rescind” a previous letter naming Bally’s Corporation as Petersburg’s preferred casino operator. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bally’s letter has stoked controversy at the General Assembly after the Petersburg City Council alleged it was only issued after Sen. Lashrecse Aird, D-Petersburg, told the city it had to sign a document naming Bally’s in order for the legislature to pass a bill giving Petersburg permission to have a casino. Aird has <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/04/30/petersburg-senator-denies-claim-she-interfered-in-citys-casino-process/#:~:text=Sen.%20Laschrece%20Aird%2C%20D%2D,manager%20was%20coerced%20into%20signing.">disputed that characterization</a> but has not laid out her own explanation for why the letter was drafted and her alleged role in it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unite Here had a labor agreement in place with Bally’s, and the union’s efforts to file a legal challenge over the way the project was awarded to Cordish underscores the alliance between the union and Bally’s.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cordish has work agreements with a rival labor group, the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seafarers Entertainment &amp; Allied Trades Union.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unite Here’s letter to Petersburg officials specifically alleges that the public notice for the April 24 meeting was inadequate because it didn’t convey enough information about what business the council was actually conducting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A person reading the notice would have no idea that the closed session meeting would discuss the selection of Cordish, or what ‘particular case, controversy, or issue’ was to be the meeting’s subject,” Paul More, an attorney representing Unite Here, wrote in the April 29 letter instructing Petersburg officials to preserve “all documents, emails, text messages and other communications” related to the casino process. The attorney specifically said Petersburg officials should retain all records of communications with Cordish.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Petersburg spokeswoman Joanne Williams said the city had no comment on Unite Here’s lawsuit announcement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The City Council is planning to hold another closed session tomorrow, with a similarly vague agenda indicating the topic will be related to the casino.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Petersburg City Attorney Anthony Williams said last week that the council would need to approve a correction to the resolution it approved on April 24, but it’s unclear if that’s the purpose for Wednesday’s meeting. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The original resolution misstated the date of a public meeting Aird hosted on April 14 about the five casino proposals Petersburg had received as part of the since-canceled competitive process. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The council’s resolution indicated the meeting took place on March 22 and implied the city’s financial consultant, Davenport &amp; Company, recommended Cordish that same day. The proposed change to the resolution states that Davenport communicated its initial findings to Petersburg City Manager John “March” Altman Jr. after the April 14 public meeting with Aird.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Davenport made an initial recommendation that the Cordish project was best for Petersburg. Cordish developed the Live! Casino &amp; Hotel in Maryland’s Anne Arundel County and the Power Plant Live! Entertainment district in Baltimore, as well as two Hard Rock casinos in Florida.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Davenport told Petersburg officials it wanted to ask follow-up questions of Cordish, Bally’s and another bidder, Rush Street Gaming, before making a final recommendation. The city scrapped the bidding process before those questions were answered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The secrecy surrounding Petersburg’s decision-making has also frustrated some local residents like Barb Rudolph, who runs a government watchdog Facebook page called Clean Sweep Petersburg. A longtime city resident, Rudolph said the city still could have picked Cordish without torpedoing the process and holding mysterious meetings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s very disillusioning for citizens to find out we’re all being played,” Rudolph said in an interview. “Secrets can’t be kept. That’s the stupid part.”</span></p>

Lashrecse Aird (D-Petersburg), shown here at an election night party in 2023, disputes pressuring Petersburg city officials. Photo by Parker Michels-Boyce</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Lashrecse Aird, D-Petersburg, says it’s “revisionist history” for city officials to accuse her of inappropriately meddling in the city-run process of picking a casino developer, but she hasn’t offered her own explanation for a casino letter Petersburg <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2-RESOLUTION-2.pdf">council members say</a> the city manager was coerced into signing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Petersburg had been seeking General Assembly permission to pursue a casino project that would only move forward if city voters approve it in a ballot referendum. As the state legislature was about to take an April 17 vote on whether Petersburg should get that permission immediately, city officials claim they received a “demand” from Aird to sign <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Petersburg-Ballys-Letter.pdf">a letter</a> saying Petersburg intended to award the project to Bally’s Corporation, a national gambling company based in Rhode Island. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The city didn’t appear to truly intend to select Bally’s, because the Petersburg City City Council <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/04/24/petersburg-doubles-down-on-cordish-as-its-casino-operator/">voted unanimously</a> a week later to select The Cordish Companies, the same Baltimore-based developer it had already chosen in 2022 as its preferred casino partner. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement released Friday night, Aird disputed the characterization that she pressured Petersburg into issuing the Bally’s letter by telling city officials the General Assembly would vote the project down if they didn’t comply.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“To have what was an honest collaboration characterized as ‘demands’ and that actions taken by the council were made under ‘duress’ is a blatant and transparent revisionist history aimed at distracting from council’s original intent – as demonstrated in previous years – to christen an operator that met their personal priorities while deprioritizing positive outcomes for the city,” Aird’s statement said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two dueling narratives are emerging about the Petersburg casino controversy, but many questions remain unanswered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the city’s telling, Petersburg did what it had to do to comply with improper political demands from the General Assembly in order to lock in its status as a casino-eligible city. After that goal was achieved when the legislature approved a Petersburg casino bill earlier this month, the city is suggesting it took action to defend its local authority to choose what type of casino project works best for Petersburg. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aird and other General Assembly members feel they were tricked into believing a city with a reputation for dysfunction was conducting a fair competitive bidding process, only to see Petersburg abruptly change course once it got what it needed from the legislature and revert back to its original plan to partner with Cordish.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Petersburg council has indicated the Bally’s letter was not legally binding because the council never voted at an open meeting to authorize the city manager to sign it. The council has not outlined what discussions it may have had on the letter in closed meetings about the casino.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Petersburg will officially become eligible to host a casino when the bill takes effect July 1. The city will then let Petersburg residents take an up or down vote on the project in a November ballot referendum. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The controversy over how the casino developer was selected could cast a cloud over that process, raising questions about possible legal challenges from companies that lost out on the project. There also could potentially be a change of heart at the General Assembly, which could still try to scuttle the Petersburg casino when lawmakers return to Richmond next month for a special session on the unfinished state budget.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">No comments, no records</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement Monday, House of Delegates Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, said Aird “took the lead on this project.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">After relying on all the representations made during committee hearings, my colleagues on both sides of the aisle supported her,” Scott said. “She trusted that the Petersburg City Council was operating in good faith, but unfortunately, she now alleges that they misled her. As this project moves forward, I trust my colleagues in the General Assembly to do their due diligence to ensure the best outcome for Petersburg and the Commonwealth of Virginia.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a response to an April 24 Freedom of Information Act request seeking records in Scott’s office related to the Petersburg casino project, the speaker’s office said it had no records of written communications with Aird from April 1 through April 18.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For much of that period, the General Assembly was weighing a recommendation from Gov. Glenn Youngkin to remove language from the Petersburg casino bill that would’ve required the state to reapprove the project later in order for the city to win full permission to proceed. That language was added to the bill in the House, without an explanation for why the legislature was looking to slow down the process or preserve the ability to block the Petersburg casino. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s office hasn’t responded to requests for comment on the latest developments in Petersburg.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though Aird sponsored the Petersburg casino bill, Scott and Sen. Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, are widely seen as key legislators involved in the issue at the state level. Lucas didn’t respond to a request for comment Monday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aird’s statement didn’t fully address the origins and purpose of the Bally’s letter, which Petersburg officials appeared to give to Aird after City Manager John “March” Altman Jr. signed it. Though Petersburg hasn&#8217;t directly identified Aird as being behind the letter, the city council said the letter was returned to its &#8220;original sender.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to an April 18 FOIA request, Aird’s office said it had a document matching the description of the Bally’s letter, but said the senator wouldn&#8217;t release it due to an exemption in the state’s transparency laws allowing General Assembly members to shield their “working papers and correspondence.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Mercury obtained a copy of the letter from another source, and city officials released a version of the letter after the Mercury inquired about it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aird hasn’t granted the Mercury’s requests for an interview, and her office didn’t respond to emailed questions Monday about her interactions with city officials and how the Bally’s letter was used once she received it.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Unite Here&#8217;s role</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the Petersburg City Council voted last Wednesday to pick Cordish, the body passed a lengthy resolution going public with the potentially explosive allegations against Aird and the General Assembly, accusing state politicians of essentially holding Petersburg’s casino effort hostage in order to assert control over a process that was supposed to be run locally. In the city council’s explanation, Altman only signed the letter to keep Petersburg’s casino hopes alive in the state legislature. Though the letter was addressed to Bally’s, Petersburg never sent it to the company</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bally’s had a labor deal in place with Unite Here, a hospitality workers’ union whose PAC spent more than $800,000 in 2023 to help Aird defeat former Sen. Joe Morrissey in a Democratic primary and go on to represent Petersburg in the Virginia Senate. The union was Aird’s largest campaign contributor by far, more than doubling the $317,000 she received from the Clean Virginia Fund, the deep-pocketed advocacy group that’s become a major source of money for Democratic candidates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though Petersburg had previously indicated it wanted to partner with Cordish on its casino project, Unite Here has criticized Cordish as being not particularly friendly to unions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to a FOIA request, Scott’s office gave the Mercury a copy of an April 14 letter Unite Here Local 25 had sent to Petersburg officials, Aird, Lucas and the speaker that said it had labor peace agreements with Bally’s and Rush Street Gaming, a casino company that operates the Rivers Casino Portsmouth in the hometown of both Scott and Lucas. The union also said it was “close” to inking an agreement with the Warrenton Group, another developer vying for the Petersburg casino.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These agreements provide workers with a fair process to decide on unionization should the casino ultimately open, and protect employers, customers and the city from the disruptions that can arise during labor disputes,” wrote Samuel Epps, political director of Unite Here Local 25.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The union’s letter, which didn’t recommend a particular casino operator, said nothing about Cordish.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aird’s statement criticized the Petersburg City Council’s decision to select Cordish, saying the events that have unfolded in Petersburg “demonstrate the ongoing struggle within the city’s governance in the pursuit of what the citizens of Petersburg truly deserve.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Choosing to move forward with a developer without receiving a public commitment to good jobs is deeply concerning,” Aird said. “Any economic development project of this scale proposed in the City of Petersburg, or our Commonwealth, should bring wealth and good jobs to the workers in our community. No labor group or organization has forced my thoughts on this position, this is a core value that I have held my entire life.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aird’s suggestion the city she represents made the wrong choice by picking Cordish is at odds with an initial recommendation from a consultant Petersburg used to vet casino development concepts it received under a request for proposals (RFP) the city issued Feb. 12. Davenport, a consulting firm that serves as Petersburg’s financial adviser, told the city it needed to do more analysis to make a final recommendation. But the consultant indicated it saw Cordish as the best option based on its early review of the proposals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While privately held, The Cordish Companies, which are based in Baltimore, Maryland are well known in the gaming industry for operating first class casinos and entertainment venues,” Davenport wrote in its initial recommendation. “Davenport, in particular, has direct experience over time with senior leadership at The Cordish Companies and is most impressed with their financial strength, stability and operational follow-through.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report raised concerns about the finances of Bally’s due to recent credit rating downgrades involving the company. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cordish, which has partnered with Virginia native and NFL Hall of Famer Bruce Smith on its plan for Petersburg, envisions a $1.4 billion mixed-use development centered on gambling and entertainment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smith, now a real estate developer after a storied football career that started at Virginia Tech, seemed to be under the impression it was the House speaker who was standing in the way of the Petersburg casino. In an interview with Virginia Business, Smith said “now’s not the time to play politics with the people of Petersburg” and made it clear he was directing those comments to Scott, </span><a href="https://www.virginiabusiness.com/article/bruce-smith-teams-with-cordish-on-petersburg-casino-plan/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to an article that ran on April 12</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Competitive process for future casinos?</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Jeremy McPike, D-Prince William, who chairs the state Senate’s subcommittee on gambling, said it was “extraordinarily disappointing” to see Petersburg officials cancel a competitive process he and other General Assembly members were led to believe was sincere.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s just absolutely crazy that they would turn this whole thing on its head and cancel an RFP process,” McPike said in an interview.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McPike said he felt it was “reasonable” for Aird to ask the city to follow a fair and open process for awarding a valuable casino project, but said he didn’t have enough context or understanding of the Bally’s letter to comment on that element. However, he made it clear he feels Petersburg has botched the process and “failed to follow through on their representations to the Senate committee.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The commonwealth deserves answers and the residents of Petersburg deserve answers,” McPike said. “I think this thing has been absolutely fraught with peril in how they’ve approached it and how they’ve executed it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other lawmakers have said the power struggle over the Petersburg casino highlights a major flaw in legislation the General Assembly passed in 2020. That bill opened the door to casinos in select cities but didn’t require a full competitive bidding process governing who would get to build and operate those casinos. That process also allows the General Assembly to decide which cities and counties will and won’t be allowed to have casinos.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Paul Krizek, D-Fairfax, who chairs a House subcommittee dealing with gambling and alcohol, said he intends to draft a bill requiring a competitive process for any future casino projects in Virginia so that the selection is based on “neutral, objective criteria” and doesn’t lead to the types of allegations emerging in Petersburg.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Any casino process needs to be conducted in as public a manner as possible with competition from the industry so that the public gets the best product,” Krizek said. “That takes care of these problems.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Petersburg City Council has scheduled a meeting for Wednesday with casino-related matters on the docket again. The agenda for that meeting indicates the discussion will take place behind closed doors.</span></p>

    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Unsealed warrants shed light on Southwest Virginia cannabis sweep</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last fall, officials announced a large-scale drug operation in nine Southwest Virginia counties targeting businesses involved in the cannabis industry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of those search warrants were sealed for 180 days, </span><a href="https://cardinalnews.org/2024/04/22/search-warrants-detail-undercover-buys-and-seizure-of-cash-and-atms-from-cannabis-related-shops/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to Cardinal News</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and some recently unsealed documents “detail weeks of undercover buys and catalog the seizure of ATMs, thousands of dollars in cash and containers of plant materials bearing labels like ‘Grease Monkey’ and ‘Stomp Purple.’”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other documents related to the operation remain sealed however, and officials gave Cardinal News conflicting information about whether any charges have been filed. A spokeswoman for the Virginia State Police said there were no charges, but an investigator with the Scott County Sheriff’s Office said charges had been filed in that county but refused to provide names.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several officials didn’t respond to inquiries from Cardinal News seeking more information about the results of the law enforcement searches described as part of an “extensive, ongoing criminal investigation into allegations of money laundering and illegal narcotic distribution network by retail establishments.” </span></p>

    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Martinsburg reverses course on compensation for former city attorney</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After documents released under FOIA showed that Martinsville’s former City Council majority approved a plan to boost the compensation of the departing city attorney in 2022, the current City Council voted to settle the matter by paying him $110,000, </span><a href="https://martinsvillebulletin.com/news/local/government-politics/martinsville-settles-compensation-dispute-with-former-city-attorney/article_1555f114-01e3-11ef-a102-c7b929405c6c.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to the Martinsville Bulletin.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The former attorney, Eric Monday, had “initially demanded that the city pay him $3,025 every month for the rest of his life,” the paper reported.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Modifications to Monday’s employment contract in late 2022 gave him full time credit for years he had spent working part time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While this dispute was unfortunate and could have been avoided, we made a decision that was in the best interest of the residents of the city of Martinsville,” Councilman Lawrence Mitchell said as he read from a prepared statement. “As we move forward to solidify and strengthen the city with fiscal and policy best practices, it is our belief that this settlement of $110,000 is in the best interest of our community.”</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">RVA Dirt digs into differing FOIA responses</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The activist watchdogs at </span><a href="http://www.rvadirt.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">RVA Dirt</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a site that covers local government in the Richmond area, filed FOIA requests throughout the region to gauge the responsiveness of various agencies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="http://www.rvadirt.com/blog/2024/4/22/foia-or-flop" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">blog post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reporting the findings notes that the results were “highly variable,” with some agencies responding within hours and the city of Richmond blowing the full five-business day window for legally acceptable response times.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The exercise also revealed major differences in how local governments process FOIA requests and what kind of fees they charge for their time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though FOIA seems like something only journalists and activists care about, RVA Dirt opined, it affects citizens too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s tempting, then, to dismiss this as someone else’s problem,” the post reads. “But FOIA hits local media’s headlines the way your car hits potholes: both are easy to ignore, both reveal a level of government failure. It’s only after you hit too many that you know you’ve got a real problem on your hands.” </span></p>

(Image courtesy of Bally's)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A week before the Petersburg City Council voted unanimously to pick Cordish Companies to potentially build a casino, City Manager John Altman Jr. signed a letter saying the city council intended to pick a competing company, according to a <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Petersburg-Ballys-Letter.pdf">copy of the document</a> obtained by The Virginia Mercury.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The April 17 letter of intent addressed to Bally’s, a national casino company that was one of five finalists for the Petersburg project, said the pending deal would still depend on outside factors. However, the letter clearly indicated Bally’s was the city’s initial choice, saying the city intended to “move forward in the process of naming an operator with Bally’s.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The city claims the letter was signed under duress as the General Assembly pressured local officials to pick a certain casino company or risk losing the project entirely. On April 17, lawmakers were in Richmond preparing to vote on a bill giving Petersburg permission to host a casino. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An unfavorable vote on that bill could have killed the project, and Petersburg officials claim they were told the legislation could be blocked if the Bally&#8217;s letter wasn&#8217;t signed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The letter was addressed to Bally’s Senior Vice President Christopher Jewett. But it was never sent to him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The document raises major new questions about the process Petersburg followed in picking a developer to partner with for a project the city has described as “the largest economic development and tourism project in the city’s history.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Virginia authorized casinos in 2020, lawmakers chose not to require a strict competitive bidding process and instead allowed a few select cities to hand pick companies they wanted to partner with to build casinos. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Petersburg, the process has sowed severe confusion about the city’s intentions and whether outside forces were pushing local officials to partner with a particular casino developer. The city put out a request for proposals and held a public town hall featuring presentations from the five finalists, but the City Council voted unanimously Wednesday to “cancel” the competitive process and select Cordish as the winner. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When asked for an explanation of the letter, Petersburg spokeswoman Joanne Williams sent the Mercury what she said was the <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2-RESOLUTION-2.pdf">full text of a resolution</a> the City Council approved unanimously Wednesday night.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That document claims the city was given the letter on April 16 with a demand that it be signed or else the General Assembly would block legislation allowing Petersburg to pursue a casino. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The letter was not signed “freely and voluntarily,” the resolution says, and was only “returned to the sender.” Altman only signed the letter, the resolution says, “to enable the bill to continue in the General Assembly.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“[A] letter of intent was received by the City Manager’s Office to proceed with Bally’s as the City’s preferred casino gaming operator with a demand that the City sign the letter of intent or face the bill being voted down or indefinitely tabled,” the council resolution says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The resolution goes on to say that Petersburg’s legal counsel always “questioned the propriety” of using an RFP process to select a casino operator.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The resolution doesn’t identify who asked the city to sign the letter. Sen. Lashrecse Aird, D-Petersburg, was the sponsor of the bill authorizing the Petersburg casino and has served as a conduit between the city and the legislature. Aird didn’t respond to requests for comment Thursday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jewett, the Bally’s executive, told the Mercury he never received the document, which appears to be written on official letterhead from the city manager’s office.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These reports are the first we are hearing of this,” Jewett said. “We were recently contacted by the city and their advisors with questions about our project which we are in the process of responding to until we hear differently.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A signature line for Jewett on the letter was blank. An adjacent line for Altman includes the city manager’s signature dated April 17.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The General Assembly vote last week went in Petersburg&#8217;s favor as lawmakers removed a provision in a bill authorizing the casino that would have required the state to reapprove the plan next year or at a special session later this year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s unclear whether the Bally’s letter was shown to decision-makers in Richmond to influence that vote and cement Petersburg’s status as an eligible casino city, but rumors of the letter’s existence have been swirling at the state Capitol over the past week.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There appeared to be some angst in the General Assembly over whether Petersburg truly intended to entertain multiple bids for the project or if the city was planning to select Cordish again after picking Cordish for an earlier, failed attempt at a casino in 2022. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unite Here — a hospitality workers’ union that has advocated for the Petersburg casino project and endorsed Aird last year in her primary bid to unseat former Sen. Joe Morrissey — isn’t on good terms with Cordish. In 2023, the union said Morrissey “sold workers down the river when he gave away Petersburg’s casino to Cordish Companies without any public commitment to good jobs,” </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/churchill-downs-readies-for-richmond-casino-run/article_f0b3376e-06ec-11ee-96ef-eb70d1fb532a.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to the Richmond Times-Dispatch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Lashrecse Aird, in contrast, wants to bring good development to Petersburg that benefits workers and residents alike,” the union’s 2023 statement continued.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unite Here, which says it represents 100,000 casino workers in the United States and Canada, has a better working relationship with Bally’s. The company listed Unite Here’s logo in its public presentation of its plans for Petersburg to underscore its relationships with organized labor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an April 14 letter to the Petersburg City Council, the city manager, Aird, House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth and Sen. Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, the union said it had a “labor peace agreement” with Bally’s. The union also had deals with several other bidders, but not Cordish.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Petersburg’s letter three days later indicating Bally’s would be the pick says the decision would depend on continued negotiations between the two parties and the Virginia Lottery, which vets the finances and backgrounds of would-be casino operators, signing off on the deal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whatever the reason was for Petersburg indicating it was going with Bally’s a week ago, the city appears fully committed to Cordish.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement released Thursday evening by Cordish and Bruce Smith Enterprise, the development company owned by the NFL Hall of Famer, Petersburg Mayor Sam Parham said the city was “thrilled” to have picked a partner “after a thorough RFP process and extensive review by outside consultants.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Bruce Smith and Cordish’s experience, comprehensive project master plan and visionary approach, ideal site location, robust financial strength and commitment to swift market entry make them the clear and unanimous choice of both our consultants and City Council,” Parham said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The letter indicating Bally’s was the top pick also pointed to “financial assessments” of the casino bids conducted for Petersburg by the Davenport consulting firm. On Wednesday, Petersburg Council Member W. Harold Myers said Davenport’s conclusions were the basis for the council’s decision to select Cordish.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/4-davenport.pdf">The report</a> Davenport issued to Petersburg ranked the Cordish proposal first based on &#8220;financial stability and likelihood of funding,&#8221; &#8220;overall development and investment in the city&#8221; and &#8220;guaranteed payments up front and over time.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report, dated Wednesday, also suggested the city should ask follow-up questions to Cordish, Bally&#8217;s and Rush Street Gaming before Davenport could provide &#8220;a firm and final recommendation to the city.&#8221;</span></p>

(Image courtesy of Cordish Companies)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PETERSBURG – After a closed meeting that lasted more than an hour and a half, the Petersburg City Council abruptly voted Wednesday to pick Baltimore-based Cordish Companies as the developer that will have a chance to build a casino in the economically struggling city.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was nothing on the council’s meeting agenda indicating such a monumental decision could be happening on Wednesday afternoon, and council members quickly left the mostly empty auditorium without explaining the move to the handful of reporters in attendance. Several members said “no comment” when approached.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cordish has made several previous efforts to land a casino in Virginia and is the same company Petersburg selected during its first attempt at a casino in 2022. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of five finalists considered by Petersburg this year, the company has </span><a href="http://www.petersburg-va.org/DocumentCenter/View/7177/20221213_The-Cordish-Companies_Presentation-to-City-of-PetersburgVA_Final?bidId=" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">unveiled plans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for a mixed-use gambling and entertainment development that could total $1.4 billion over 15 years. The first phase calls for a casino, a 200-room hotel and an event center. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The project, being planned in conjunction with NFL Hall of Famer turned Virginia Beach developer Bruce Smith, would be built in southern Petersburg at the intersection of Interstate 95 and Wagner Road if voters approve it in a ballot referendum expected to take place in November. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cordish developed the Live! Casino &amp; Hotel in Maryland’s Anne Arundel County and the Power Plant Live! Entertainment district in Baltimore, as well as two Hard Rock casinos in Florida.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other companies being considered by Petersburg were Bally’s, Rush Street Gaming, the Warrenton Group and Penn Entertainment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because Virginia doesn’t require competitive bidding for casino projects, there was an unusual amount of political drama surrounding the Petersburg plan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Glenn Youngkin has made revitalizing the majority-Black city south of Richmond one of his key initiatives, a focus that has </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/10/03/virginia-youngkin-partnership-petersburg-elections/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">caused friction</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> between some Petersburg officials and Democratic leaders in the General Assembly. Democratic lawmakers have also prioritized a role for organized labor in new economic development projects and have seemed particularly interested in whether Petersburg would or wouldn’t pick a developer on good terms with unions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As legislation authorizing a Petersburg casino referendum made its way through the General Assembly earlier this year, lawmakers attached a provision requiring the project to be approved a second time. That gave the General Assembly flexibility to say no if state leaders didn’t like the way the Petersburg process was going, but Youngkin and the legislature agreed to drop the reapproval rule last week.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That move seemed to be the catalyst for Petersburg’s action Wednesday, according to Sen. Lashrecse Aird, D-Petersburg, who said the bill advancing with hurdles cleared away “allows Petersburg to be an eligible host city and move toward a referendum for a casino.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As a result, the city had the responsibility for the next steps which included the selection of an operator, which they have formally now done,” Aird said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aird hosted a community meeting in Petersburg on April 14 at which the five casino finalists presented their plans to the public and pitched the community on why their company would be the best fit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unite Here, a hospitality and casino workers’ union that has clashed with Cordish in the past, endorsed Aird’s bid for the Virginia Senate last year. Workers Vote, a PAC affiliated with Unite Here, </span><a href="https://www.vpap.org/donors/391036/recipient/440840/?start_year=2023&amp;end_year=2023&amp;recip_type=all" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">contributed more than $800,000</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to Aird’s campaign in 2023. That money, almost all of which was listed as in-kind contributions, covered campaign gear, literature, canvasser housing, salaries and benefits, travel expenses, car rentals and other “general expenses,” according to campaign finance records.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The union celebrated Aird’s primary win over former Sen. Joe Morrissey, saying in a </span><a href="https://unitehere.org/press-releases/hospitality-workers-celebrate-lashresce-airds-win-after-knocking-65000-doors/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">news release</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last June that its members and their supporters had knocked on more than 65,000 doors for Aird.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unite Here had previously opposed the Petersburg project when the city selected Cordish as its casino developer due to the company’s agreement with a different union, Seafarers Entertainment &amp; Allied Trades Union, </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/churchill-downs-readies-for-richmond-casino-run/article_f0b3376e-06ec-11ee-96ef-eb70d1fb532a.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to the Richmond Times-Dispatch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Both Bally’s and Rush Street Gaming emphasized their relationships with Unite Here during their presentations in Petersburg.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Petersburg City Council gave no advance warning it was selecting a casino operator Wednesday. The agenda only listed a closed session for the purposes of discussing legal matters, including the casino approval process and public procurement law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the council returned to open session, the body voted unanimously to add a resolution to the agenda canceling the request for casino proposals the city had put out and selected Cordish as the chosen operator. That process took only a few minutes, with council members only reading the technical language of the motion and offering no explanation for why Cordish beat out its competitors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though some cities pursuing casinos have chosen to entertain bids from multiple companies, Virginia’s casino law doesn’t require a full competitive bidding process with neutral criteria for determining which project would be best for a particular community. The state has only authorized five casino licenses in cities chosen by the General Assembly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Petersburg’s hopes for a casino got new life after Richmond voters twice rejected proposals to bring a casino to the capital city. While authorizing a potential casino in Petersburg this year, legislators also removed Richmond from the list of cities eligible for a casino. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an email Wednesday evening, Petersburg Council Member W. Howard Myers indicated the council’s decision was based on a financial report that pointed to Cordish as the top pick.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am ecstatic about the potential transformative opportunities the Cordish Companies are to unleash,” Myers said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After serving as Richmond’s mayor since 2017, Stoney seemed to acknowledge Spanberger’s solid frontrunner status in a statement announcing his decision, saying he only had a “narrow path” to victory.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I believe this is a time when Democrats must stand united and avoid an ugly primary for governor,” Stoney said, adding that he and his wife also welcomed the birth of a daughter in March.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stoney said that running for lieutenant governor — a largely ceremonial position that’s nevertheless seen as a launchpad for aspiring governors — is “the right move for me and my family, the right move for the Democratic Party, the right move for the future of the Commonwealth of Virginia.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A former executive director of the Democratic Party of Virginia who served as Virginia’s secretary of the commonwealth under former Gov. Terry McAuliffe, Stoney was long expected to make a move for higher office. His second term as mayor of Virginia’s capital city expires at the end of the year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite running for a less prestigious position, Stoney will still face primary competition for the lieutenant governor job.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shortly after Stoney’s announcement Tuesday morning, Sen. Aaron Rouse, D-Virginia Beach, formally announced he too is running for lieutenant governor. A former professional football player, Rouse flipped a Hampton Roads-area seat in the Virginia Senate in early 2023, a Democratic win that ensured Gov. Glenn Youngkin and his Republican allies wouldn’t be able to pass a bill rolling back abortion access that year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ve built my career on winning in tough spots when it matters – whether it be under the glare of NFL lights or flipping the State Senate seat needed to ensure we blocked Republicans’ assaults on reproductive freedom and voting rights,” Rouse said in a statement. “Virginia is ready for a new generation of leaders to step up.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Babur Lateef, an ophthalmologist who serves as chairman of the Prince William County School Board, announced last month that he’s running a Democratic campaign for lieutenant governor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several other Virginia Democrats are thought to be considering runs for lieutenant governor, and the field could continue to grow as 2025 approaches.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If no other Democrat files to run for governor against Spanberger, she is expected to face either Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears or Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares in the 2025 general election. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No Republicans have officially announced bids for the seat yet, but Earle-Sears and Miyares are considered top contenders to try to succeed current Gov. Glenn Youngkin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Any primaries for Virginia’s Executive Branch offices would take place in June of 2025.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In court filings, Bedford resident David Rife insists he’s the one being intimidated, noting that the county school board sued him shortly after he filed a complaint with the Virginia Department of Education saying local school officials weren’t following the individualized education program, or IEP, designed to accommodate his son’s learning disability and improve his reading skills. When he filed the complaint, Rife told state officials he feared he would face retaliation locally, according to court documents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The school board filed its lawsuit against Rife on March 26, roughly two months after Rife sent his complaint to state education officials.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a March 29 letter responding to Rife’s complaint, state education officials ruled Bedford school officials were out of compliance in several policy areas and ordered the division to take corrective action in regards to Rife’s son by April 29.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his answer to the lawsuit, Rife suggested the timeline “suggests the possibility” the suit may have been retaliation and argues it’s school officials who are in the wrong.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The court case highlights ongoing disputes over parents’ rights in K-12 schools, <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/03/20/feds-identify-significant-ongoing-concerns-with-virginia-special-education/">spotty compliance with special education rules</a> and how public officials should handle unpleasant or hostile speech from critics.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="vSiKIUEfZk"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/03/29/virginia-adopts-regulatory-changes-for-special-education-amid-federal-review/">Virginia adopts regulatory changes for special education amid federal review</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Virginia adopts regulatory changes for special education amid federal review&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/03/29/virginia-adopts-regulatory-changes-for-special-education-amid-federal-review/embed/#?secret=Bs4jpPvQkG#?secret=vSiKIUEfZk" data-secret="vSiKIUEfZk" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The case was brought on behalf of the Bedford School Board by attorneys in the Richmond office of Sands Anderson, a law firm that handles a variety of local government issues. A Sands Anderson attorney didn’t respond to a request for comment on Rife’s claims about the motivations for the suit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bedford School Board Chairman Marcus Hill didn’t respond to requests for comment Monday. The school board itself is the plaintiff suing Rife.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In court filings responding to the suit, Rife and his attorney contend he had good reason to be frustrated with Bedford schools over the lack of consideration for state and federal special education laws. Rife’s defense contends he only used “impolite” language while “passionately advocating” for his son, who suffers from anxiety and was reading at a fifth grade level as a sophomore in high school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is highly ironic that BCPS, whose School Board members have emphasized repeatedly and strongly the importance of protecting parental rights, have now sued a parent for a total of $600,000.00 because the school personnel did not like how he has advocated for his son,” said the response filed on Rife’s behalf by Bedford attorney David Whitehurst.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The civil suit claims Rife used “obscene, vulgar, profane, lewd, lascivious and/or indecent language” when interacting with school staff in person, over the phone and via email. The lawsuit lists several examples of Rife threatening to call the police, have people arrested, file lawsuits or initiate investigations over what he believed to be mistreatment of his son.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The filing recounts conversations in which Rife allegedly said the school principal should “get her head out of her ass” and said her “bullshit” was putting his son at risk. Documents filed in court also suggest Rife used the terms “asshole,” “jerk” and “jerkoff” to refer to school staff members.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bedford school officials tried to put Rife on a communications plan in early 2023 that limited his contact with staff.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Bedford County Public Schools expects parents to be respectful and civil when interacting with school staff members,” Deputy Superintendent Karen Woodford wrote to Rife last July in a letter filed with the lawsuit. “We will no longer tolerate your profanity to staff, threats, dishonest communication about people losing their jobs, yelling and speaking badly about staff members. If you cannot abide by this plan, I will limit your interaction with staff even more than it is at this time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the $600,000 the school board is seeking from Rife for “personal injury, lost profits, increased operating expenses and legal fees,” the board is asking the Bedford Circuit Court to order Rife to stop using vulgar language and follow the communications plan the school division laid out for him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Putting an end to the abuse of government resources is plainly in the public interest,” the school board’s lawyers wrote in a motion seeking an emergency injunction against Rife.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rife’s attorney has argued that nothing he said rises to the level of criminal conduct under the laws the school board pointed to dealing with using a computer or phone for harassment and “abusive language to another.” The communication plan the school division is asking the court to enforce states that Rife can only use email to contact the school principal and the division’s director of special education and says they “will not communicate through phone unless there is an emergency.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a competing motion asking the court to order Bedford County Public Schools to comply with the IEP plan, Rife’s side argued the injunction school officials were seeking would infringe on free speech.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It would serve as a ‘lesson’ to other parents that advocating for their children could </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">result in being sued,” Rife’s motion says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The communications the school divisions objected to, Rife’s attorney argued in legal filings, should be understood in the context of a parent trying to help their child but getting little assistance from school officials. Many of the interactions school officials spotlighted involved Rife complaining about bullying by other students or behavior by teachers that he felt was adding to his son’s difficulties at school, according to court records.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One example is that Mr. Rife has been restricted from speaking directly with his son’s case manager or the reading specialist for over three years outside of IEP meetings,” Rife’s court filings say. “As would most parents in such a situation, this has caused him to become frustrated and upset, and that frustration has at times been expressed to school employees, but never with malice or threat.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The specific language school staff found offensive would “generally be considered fairly mild in today’s culture,” Rife’s court filings argue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State officials ruled Bedford officials were not in compliance with several sections of the student’s IEP calling for him to receive specialized instruction and assistance. For example, the plan called for the student to receive at least 45 minutes of reading services five times per week in a special education setting, but state officials determined he wasn’t always getting that level of instruction. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state ordered Bedford school officials to reexamine the student’s IEP, discuss whether he needed extended school year services and review what “compensatory” assistance was necessary to address the impact on the student’s “access to a free appropriate public education.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attorneys for the school board portrayed the lawsuit as a necessary step to safeguard the school division after less formal efforts to improve relations with Rife failed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The courts requiring Rife to communicate with school officials in a particular manner, the school board’s lawyers wrote, won’t impede his ability to have “reasonable, good faith communications with BCPS about his child’s education.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A hearing has not yet been scheduled in the case.</span></p>

(Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fate of slots-like skill games in Virginia convenience stores and truck stops remained in limbo Wednesday as the state Senate voted to reject Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/04/09/in-rewrite-of-skill-game-bill-youngkin-proposes-tougher-rules-on-industry/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sweeping changes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to a proposal to legalize and tax the gambling machines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Senate voted 34-6 to reject the governor’s tougher amendments to the bill, sending the legislation back to Youngkin in its original form.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="JSHxCJYyDO"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/04/17/virginia-lawmakers-return-to-richmond-as-budget-battle-fuels-shutdown-talk/">Virginia lawmakers return to Richmond as budget battle fuels shutdown talk</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Virginia lawmakers return to Richmond as budget battle fuels shutdown talk&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/04/17/virginia-lawmakers-return-to-richmond-as-budget-battle-fuels-shutdown-talk/embed/#?secret=qpVTWcsdNp#?secret=JSHxCJYyDO" data-secret="JSHxCJYyDO" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bipartisan move raises the risk Youngkin could veto the legislation, an outcome that would leave skill games prohibited throughout Virginia by a ban enacted under former Gov. Ralph Northam. But lawmakers also announced Wednesday that they’re planning a special session later this spring to reach a deal on the state budget, creating an opening to reconsider the skill game issue over the next few weeks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I recognize that this bill faces an uncertain future if it goes back to the governor’s desk,” said Sen. Aaron Rouse, D-Virginia Beach, the bill’s lead sponsor in the Senate. “But… I stand with small businesses in every corner of our commonwealth urging the governor to do right by small businesses and sign this bill.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s skill game ban — which was passed in 2020 but didn’t take effect until 2021 after lawmakers gave the industry a one-year grace period due to COVID-19 — was suspended for nearly two years as the skill game industry fought it in court. The Supreme Court of Virginia reinstated it late last year, rendering the machines illegal and prompting the industry to launch a new lobbying push to change the law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Things appeared to be going well for skill game supporters until the bill got to Youngkin, who had signaled in February that he had “serious concerns” with the proposal. Last week, the governor unveiled amendments that would impose a higher tax rate on the machines, more regulatory safeguards and strict geographic limits that would effectively ban the machines in most of the state’s metro areas. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The governor wanted a 35% tax rate on the machines, while the General Assembly approved a 25% tax rate. Skill game supporters claim Youngkin’s amendments would create a tax rate of up to 45%, but the administration has said that’s a misread of the bill and the suggested rate is indeed 35%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement Wednesday evening, Youngkin&#8217;s office reiterated its qualms about the legislation while indicating the governor is open to revisiting the geographic limits skill game backers took issue with.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The governor&#8217;s concerns with the bill remain and his amendments addressed those concerns,&#8221; said Youngkin spokesman Christian Martinez. &#8220;He is open to continuing discussion to alleviate issues with both perimeter provisions.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proponents of legalizing skill games have portrayed it as a matter of fairness, arguing that since Virginia has legalized numerous other types of gambling there’s no reason the machines that generate revenue for small business owners should be treated more harshly. Opponents of the bill say the state shouldn’t allow a gambling free-for-all or reward businesses that exploited a legal loophole to profit from gambling machines that have been unregulated and untaxed for most of their existence in Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Senate appeared to consider a second vote on the skill game bill to preemptively override a potential veto. But the body didn’t follow through on that effort, which would have required two-thirds votes in both legislative chambers. The House of Delegates, which had approved the skill game bill by a narrow 51-45 margin, didn’t take up the skill game bill Wednesday. Because the bill originated in the Senate, the Senate’s decision to reject Youngkin’s amendments sent the bill straight back to the governor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The policy specifics of what the governor recommended drew little discussion in the Senate, which completed its action on the skill game bill Wednesday in about five minutes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rouse, the only senator who spoke on the bill, said the “most egregious” elements in Youngkin’s proposal were the geographic limitations that would outlaw the machines in the state’s most populous regions. Youngkin’s version of the bill would have prohibited skill games within 35 miles of licensed casinos and Rosie’s facilities affiliated with the Colonial Downs horse racing track. The governor also suggested banning skill games within 2,500 feet of schools, day cares and places of worship.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a seemingly less controversial amendment, Youngkin proposed giving cities and counties the ability to ban skill games locally. The bill sent to him had no provisions for local control, legalizing the machines statewide with no ability for communities to opt out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The governor had also suggested tougher regulations requiring the industry to verify the identity of players before they put money into the machines, a system that could help prevent minors and people seeking help for gambling addiction from playing skill games. The bill the legislature passed also bars people under 21 from playing and has provisions for gambling addiction, but was less clear on how those rules would be enforced since skill games aren’t as closely supervised as slot machines on a casino floor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Paul Krizek, D-Fairfax, a skill game critic who has pushed for tougher regulations on the industry, said the legislature could have avoided a veto by rejecting the 35-mile rule while leaving the rest of Youngkin’s suggestions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m a big believer that half a loaf is better than no loaf,” Krizek said. “I’m sure there’s things that the governor could meet them halfway on.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A large group of convenience store owners gathered at the Capitol Wednesday morning to applaud lawmakers seen as skill game allies and criticize Youngkin for amendments they felt were overly harsh and not in tune with reality.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Munir Rassiwala, who owns several convenience stores around Virginia, said he voted for Youngkin but was disappointed the governor seemed to think protecting the investments casinos have made is more important than helping smaller entrepreneurs like him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There should be a compromise,” he said. “There are lives at stake.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Bill Stanley, R-Franklin, a skill game supporter, encouraged the crowd to keep up the fight.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hopefully cooler heads prevail both in the governor’s office and here in the legislature,’ said Stanley, a lawyer who has done work for Pace-O-Matic, a major skill game company lobbying for the legalization bill. “I think ultimately a solution for the budget and for skill games is in the works.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginians Against Neighborhood Slot Machines, an anti-skill game advocacy group funded by casinos, urged Youngkin to veto the bill.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That is the only course of action to ensure public safety, protect vulnerable communities and to prevent every neighborhood in Virginia from becoming a mini-Las Vegas,” the group said in a statement. “It should tell Virginians everything they need to know that ‘skill games’ proponents threw a tantrum at the mere prospect of modest regulatory protections.”</span></p>

But the budget battle playing out between Gov. Glenn Youngkin and the Democratic-led General Assembly is anything but routine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One day before state lawmakers were set to return to Richmond to take up Youngkin’s amendments and vetoes, House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, posted a </span><a href="https://x.com/DonScott757/status/1780204895577993548" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">campaign-style video</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> accusing Youngkin of standing in the way of a bipartisan budget that boosted funding for K-12 education.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Don’t let Pretending Glenn shut down the government,” the video concludes, invoking the prospect of what could happen if Virginia’s politically divided government doesn’t pass a new budget before the current one expires on July 1.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the General Assembly reconvenes Wednesday, the budget and the 233 amendments Youngkin proposed to it will be the top item on the agenda. But after weeks of fiery rhetoric, it’s unclear how the budget fight might deescalate toward a more amicable conclusion.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="bvTo8Yhnwg"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/04/08/avoiding-full-veto-youngkin-sends-lawmakers-233-budget-amendments/">Avoiding full veto, Youngkin sends lawmakers 233 budget amendments</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Avoiding full veto, Youngkin sends lawmakers 233 budget amendments&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/04/08/avoiding-full-veto-youngkin-sends-lawmakers-233-budget-amendments/embed/#?secret=hc0R2O0jgJ#?secret=bvTo8Yhnwg" data-secret="bvTo8Yhnwg" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tuesday evening, the Youngkin administration released new financial data showing March revenues were up 5% compared to a year ago, results the governor has used to argue the state can fund policy priorities with money already coming in without needing to raise taxes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“March’s solid results provide stable ground for us to work together to land a budget that meets our collective goals,” Youngkin said in a news release.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the legislature rejects most or all of Youngkin’s amendments, the governor could still veto the budget, a move that could require lawmakers to hold a special session to try again for some sort of compromise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Few lawmakers appear to be in a compromising type of mood.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of Youngkin’s top critics in the legislature — Sen. Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth — posted a social media meme showing herself in boxing gloves, seemingly on the verge of socking the governor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Buckle Up Glenn- I am coming back to Richmond on Wednesday to deal with your nonsense,” Lucas said in her </span><a href="https://x.com/SenLouiseLucas/status/1778911514545492316" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">post on X</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the platform formerly known as Twitter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest anti-Youngkin broadsides from Democratic leaders come after the governor vetoed a record 153 bills approved during the 2024 session and held several media appearances blasting the legislature’s budget proposal as “backward” for including a tax increase. The Democrats’ approach, Youngkin told a crowd at a Richmond-area diner last month, is about trying to tax Virginians “as much as you can take, before you move away.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin has softened his tone more recently as he unveiled a new spending plan he called the “common ground budget,” which abandons his push for tax cuts and funds some policy priorities sought by Democratic legislators — just without the digital sales tax that was envisioned as paying for them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia political analyst Bob Holsworth said the budget dispute began last year, when Youngkin introduced a proposal with broad tax cuts even though Virginians had just elected Democratic majorities in both legislative chambers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Younking presented a budget as if he had won the election,” Holsworth said. “It had no possibility of being taken seriously and he didn’t seem to recognize that the dynamic had completely changed.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The governor himself proposed expanding the state’s sales tax to apply to digital downloads and streaming services, a change both sides have characterized as a way to modernize a tax code still built around physical goods instead of the increasingly online economy. However, he proposed a digital sales tax as a way to offset other tax cuts, a proposal he dropped from his latest offer that envisions leaving Virginia’s tax policies unchanged.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The General Assembly’s budget anticipates roughly $1 billion in new revenue from the digital sales tax, money Democratic leaders want to use to boost funding for K-12 schools. Youngkin has insisted the state’s finances are strong enough to spend more without raising taxes, but skeptical Democrats contend the governor’s plans rely on gimmicks like shuffling money around and changing when particular initiatives get funded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s proposal envisions a roughly $64 billion general fund, compared to a $65.5 billion general fund in the General Assembly’s budget. The general fund is the main pot of discretionary money policymakers can spend on new initiatives. Nongeneral fund money is earmarked for a particular purpose, such as gas taxes dedicated specifically to fund highways and roads.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The governor and the legislature are also at odds over language in the budget that would require Virginia to participate in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a multi-state initiative aimed at reducing planet-warming carbon emissions. Youngkin pulled Virginia out of the program after becoming governor, portraying it as a backdoor tax regular Virginians were paying on their power bills. Democrats argue Youngkin didn’t have the power to make that move and are challenging his decision to remove Virginia from a program that provides funding for flood resilience and energy efficiency programs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the budget, the General Assembly will also take up Youngkin’s overhaul of a controversial bill to legalize and regulate skill games, the slots-like gambling machines that have spread widely in Virginia convenience stores, truck stops and sports bars. The governor has proposed a much tougher regulatory approach to the machines than what the General Assembly approved.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislature is also expected to take up Youngkin’s veto of a bipartisan bill that would have allowed local governments to raise sales taxes to build new schools. The measure passed with enough Republican support that the General Assembly could potentially override the governor on the issue.</span></p>

Glenn Youngkin's tough approach to skill games. (Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Krunal Patel’s convenience store outside Richmond, a row of Queen of Virginia skill games has been powered off and turned around against a wall. On Monday, in response to what he sees as unfair treatment in a state that’s embraced legalized gambling, Patel also turned off the Virginia Lottery machines in his store.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He posted signs on his front doors and above the checkout counter explaining the one-day shutdown of lottery sales was a protest against </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/04/09/in-rewrite-of-skill-game-bill-youngkin-proposes-tougher-rules-on-industry/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s proposed changes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to a pending Virginia bill that would legalize, tax and regulate skill games instead of leaving them banned as a type of illegal gambling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an interview, Patel, 38, said the slots-like skill games once made up about 30% to 40% of his revenue. But because the governor proposed prohibiting skill games within 35 miles of existing casinos and horse racing facilities, the store he co-owns in eastern Henrico County might be banned from having them due to its proximity to the Colonial Downs race track in neighboring New Kent County.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If a lot of stores close down, it’s going to close down Lottery too,” Patel said, when asked what message the temporary stop of lottery sales was supposed to send.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The protest aimed at lottery tickets was the latest escalation in the long-running gambling turf war playing out in Virginia as various interests try to bend state policy in their favor. A coalition supporting skill games said nearly 500 businesses were participating in the lottery shutdown, as well as a plan to close stores entirely on Tuesday from 3:50 p.m. to 4:50 p.m.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This statewide convenience store shutdown will show customers, communities and localities the harmful impact that Governor Youngkin’s skill game amendments will have,” the pro-skill game Virginia Merchants and Amusement Coalition said in a news release.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After years of grappling with the question of whether the machines should be legal or illegal, Virginia lawmakers will take up the issue again Wednesday when the General Assembly reconvenes to address Youngkin’s amendments and vetoes. Supporters say Youngkin’s sweeping amendments to the skill game bill impose the type of public safeguards the General Assembly left out. Critics have called his suggestions so strict they’d effectively ban skill games in most of the state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the 35-mile rule, Youngkin’s amendments would raise the proposed tax rate on the machines from 25% to 35%, allow local governments or local voters to ban the machines at the city and county level and impose stricter rules to prohibit underage play and mitigate gambling addiction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Concern that skill games might eat into Lottery revenues was one of many reasons the Virginia General Assembly voted to ban the machines in 2020, as was frustration over skill game companies sending unregulated and untaxed machines into the state and insisting gambling laws didn’t apply to their games because, despite the strong resemblance, they technically aren’t slot machines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When asked for a comment Monday, Youngkin’s office didn’t directly address the protest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The governor supports small business owners having access to skill games and his proposed legislative amendments, stemming from discussions with a bipartisan group of members and dozens of outside stakeholders, would establish an important regulatory framework, enhance consumer and public safety protections, and grant localities and Virginians a voice,” said Youngkin spokesman Christian Martinez.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the machines do become legal in Virginia, both the General Assembly and Youngkin have identified the Virginia Lottery as the state agency that should regulate them on a permanent basis. The General Assembly’s skill game bill calls for the Virginia Alcoholic Beverage and Control Authority to oversee the machines on a temporary basis while the Lottery prepares a fuller regulatory structure. Youngkin’s proposal sets the Lottery as the regulator from the beginning, even though it would likely delay reactivation of the machines until well into 2025 to allow the agency to create a central monitoring system for keeping tabs on skill games.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That means the target of Monday’s protest could very well end up writing some of the rules for how skill games can and can’t operate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Lottery didn’t appear to see Monday’s protest as a major concern, saying the agency has contractual agreements with all retailers who agree to sell tickets that raise funds for Virginia’s K-12 schools.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Lottery works with each individual retailer as to what works best for them, and we make it a practice not to tell retailers how to run their business,” said Virginia Lottery spokesman John Hagerty. “The Lottery has nothing to do with skill machines.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Lottery gave no indication it was planning to take any action against licensees that stopped selling its products as a form of political protest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Patel said he wasn’t sure if he would face any repercussions from the Lottery for stopping sales for a day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m willing to take that risk,” he said. “At the end of the day, it’s my business.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s casino and horse racing industries have argued they should get some protection from the more scattered competition from skill games because their forms of gambling required significant capital investment. The state’s casinos, for example, had to pay $15 million for a license and pledge to invest at least $300 million in facilities that could only be built in specific cities where voters had approved a casino.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only a few states have affirmatively legalized and regulated skill games. The machines are fully legal in Wyoming and the District of Columbia, and could be legalized soon in Pennsylvania. Skill games are also legal in Georgia, as long as they don’t offer cash payouts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Patel said he hopes state legislators and Youngkin will agree to drop the 35-mile exclusion rule and lower the tax rate back to the 25% envisioned in the bill the General Assembly approved. Some of the rules, he said, seem designed to maximize profits for bigger, out-of-state gambling interests that own Virginia’s casinos and horse racing facilities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re more local than they are,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Patel said most of his customers didn’t have a problem with not being able to buy lottery tickets Monday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Some of them are happy,” he said. “It actually saved them money.”</span></p>

(Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After years of partisan debate over the state of Virginia’s election system, Gov. Glenn Youngkin blocked Democratic bills meant to continue the adoption of ranked choice voting, expand legal protections for voting rights and modify data practices to avoid canceling the registrations of eligible voters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The governor also vetoed a measure that would have expanded the state’s existing ban on guns at polling places and nixed a bill that would have added photo identification cards issued by nursing homes and other state-licensed medical facilities to Virginia’s list of acceptable IDs for voting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin characterized several of the proposals as unnecessary complications, while several Democratic lawmakers said the governor was letting politics get in the way of good governance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It really lets us know who’s on what side of protecting our democracy,” said Del. Cia Price, D-Newport News, who chairs the House Privileges and Elections Committee.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Voting lawsuits</h4>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin vetoed </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB623" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sponsored by Price that would have strengthened a state-level voting rights law </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2021/03/12/virginia-is-set-to-become-the-first-southern-state-with-its-own-voting-rights-act-heres-what-it-does/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">she championed in 2021</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> meant to prevent discrimination against minority groups.</span></p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Virginia is set to become the first southern state with its own voting rights act.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under that law, the attorney general’s office and impacted voters can file lawsuits in response to perceived voting rights violations. Price’s 2024 bill would have also allowed advocacy groups focused on voting access to sue over planned changes to voting locations or reductions in hours.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an interview, Price said the goal was to create more ways to prevent voter disenfranchisement instead of leaving it solely in the hands of the attorney general’s office and voters themselves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In actual practice, we’re seeing that people have lives, people have jobs, people may not know how to navigate court systems,” Price said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The vetoed bill also would have added new rules requiring localities to come up with more detailed plans for satellite voting locations and preventing last-minute changes. Last year, the Richmond Electoral Board </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/07/27/gop-electoral-boards-move-to-cut-richmond-early-voting-sites-may-have-been-illegal/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">caused an uproar</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by announcing the city would not open two satellite voting sites for early voting as it had in previous years, a decision reversed after activists said it would disproportionately impact minorities and Richmonders who rely on public transportation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s veto statement primarily took issue with the bill’s expansion of who can file voting rights lawsuits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Current law allows voters to sue for violations under the Virginia Voter Rights Act,” Youngkin’s veto said. “The proposal will lead to administrative burdens and legal complexities that could hinder the fair and efficient administration of elections in our commonwealth.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Ranked choice voting</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though Youngkin won the Republican nomination for governor in 2021 through a form of ranked choice voting the Virginia GOP used at a convention, he vetoed a bill that would have clarified the process of how the voting method can be used in government-run elections for some local offices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Current Virginia law allows local governments to adopt ranked choice voting, which allows voters to rank candidates based on who they like best and tabulates results over several rounds in which votes for the lowest-performing candidates are redistributed to others still in the running, for city council and county board races only. Arlington County is </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/07/18/after-being-first-in-virginia-to-use-it-arlington-hits-brakes-on-ranked-choice-voting/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">already using ranked choice voting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in local primaries, and democracy reform advocates are trying to get more local governments to embrace it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2024 </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB428" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ranked choice voting bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> initially would have allowed the method to be used in any local election, including school boards and constitutional offices. However, it was scaled back to focus mainly on “cleanup” language clarifying how the process should work and creating state standards for tabulation software and voting equipment, according to Sen. Schuyler VanValkenburg, D-Henrico, the bill’s sponsor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s recognizing that ranked choice voting is here … and that a lot of localities have the choice of using ranked choice voting,” VanValkenburg said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some advocates for ranked-choice voting </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/how-ranked-choice-voting-saved-the-virginia-gop-from-itself/2021/11/05/6d1aa738-3dc2-11ec-8ee9-4f14a26749d1_story.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">point to</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Youngkin’s 2021 victory as evidence of how the process can encourage consensus picks and disfavor the most extreme or polarizing candidates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of Youngkin’s opponents that year was former GOP state Sen. Amanda Chase, a hard-right figure with diehard support among some conservative activists but limited general-election appeal. The Virginia GOP’s choices to hold a convention with ranked choice voting minimized the chances of a Chase victory and allowed Republicans who preferred a more mainstream candidate to consolidate support behind Youngkin even if he wasn’t their first choice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The governor’s veto called ranked choice voting new to both Virginia and the nation and said “legitimate questions” about it need to be resolved before going further.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Concerns have been raised about its use in general elections where some voters have found it confusing,” Youngkin said in his veto. “A heightened risk of mistakenly erroneous ballot submissions raises concerns about disenfranchisement and an increased lack of voter confidence in election results.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VanValkenburg said he feels politics, particularly the general hostility and suspicion toward ranked choice voting from many Republicans, is the real explanation for Youngkin’s veto, even though the legislation wasn’t a simple question of whether ranked choice voting should or shouldn’t exist in Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think there are Democrats in the General Assembly who don’t like ranked choice voting,” he said. “But that’s not what this bill was.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Voter roll maintenance</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price filed </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB904" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">another bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in response to </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/11/01/voting-rights-advocates-blast-youngkin-admin-over-error-affecting-3400/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">widely publicized data issues</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last year that led Virginia election officials to wrongfully cancel the voter registrations of roughly 3,400 people who were eligible to vote despite past felony convictions.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="8lkpkxxQFe"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/11/01/voting-rights-advocates-blast-youngkin-admin-over-error-affecting-3400/">Voting rights advocates blast Youngkin admin over error affecting 3,400</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Voting rights advocates blast Youngkin admin over error affecting 3,400&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/11/01/voting-rights-advocates-blast-youngkin-admin-over-error-affecting-3400/embed/#?secret=fDCtV3V0Vt#?secret=8lkpkxxQFe" data-secret="8lkpkxxQFe" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her proposal would have established new data integrity criteria requiring election officials to reach a certain level of confidence before canceling the registration of a voter who may have moved, gone inactive or become ineligible after committing a crime. It also would have created a new process for giving voters a chance to dispute information suggesting they had a new felony conviction, and force election officials to keep public records showing who was removed from voter rolls and why.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin suggested delaying the measure for a year so officials can conduct a multi-agency study on how data is collected and shared for the purposes of maintaining accurate voter rolls. He recommended that study be completed by Nov. 30 and asked that the General Assembly be required to reapprove the bill next year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price said she’s going to ask her colleagues to reject Youngkin’s amendment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Y’all already did an investigation,” Price said, referring to a review the Office of the State Inspector General completed last December that concluded the erroneous cancellations in 2023 were accidental. “We don’t need to study it. We know what happened. And this bill is an answer to it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin also vetoed Democratic bills that would have restored Virginia’s participation in ERIC, a multi-state voter data sharing program that has been abandoned by many red states after coming under fire from conservative activists.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his veto statement on the ERIC bill, Youngkin said there were valid concerns about how the organization was being run.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have been explicitly clear about my affirmation of the legitimacy of our elections,” the governor’s veto said. “My focus is safeguarding Virginians&#8217; private information and continuously improving an efficient, cost-effective voter registration system.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Expanding list of acceptable IDs</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A relatively minor </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB26" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would have required election officials to accept identification cards issued by state-licensed private medical facilities such as nursing homes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia no longer requires a photo ID to vote, and the list of acceptable forms of identification is already extensive. It includes driver’s licenses whether current or expired, student IDs from Virginia colleges, nursing home IDs from government facilities and a variety of other official documents showing the voter’s name and address.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s veto noted that Virginians can also get a free ID card specifically for voting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Expanding this list presents additional complexities for poll workers in discerning which forms of identification are acceptable,” Youngkin’s veto said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Any voter without ID is asked to sign a sworn statement verifying their identity and officials do additional research to determine if their ballot should be counted.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Wider gun bans near election sites</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State law already prohibits firearms within 40 feet of polling places. </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB939" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> approved by the General Assembly would have grown that buffer to 100 feet and applied the restriction to satellite voting sites and any buildings where recounts are being performed or where an electoral board meeting is taking place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s veto suggested the bill would create a minefield of no-gun zones firearm owners would have to avoid that would shift according to the election calendar. Brandishing a firearm to intimidate would-be voters, Youngkin noted, is already a crime.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“T</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">his legislation proposes intricate time-and-place restrictions on carrying firearms, potentially turning law-abiding citizens into unintentional criminals if they are unaware of the presence of a ballot drop-off box or an electoral board meeting,” the governor’s veto said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SB212.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">amended bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the governor sent down Monday night would give local citizens the power to ban the machines in their communities, cap the number of machines allowed statewide at 20,000 and prohibit the operation of skill games within a certain distance of casinos, horse racing facilities, schools, daycares and places of worship like churches, mosques and synagogues.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin spokesman Christian Martinez said the governor “appreciates the extensive work done by the General Assembly on this issue this session.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“His proposed amendments represent necessary changes and the added protections to the legislation address his serious concern with the regulatory structure, tax rates, the number of machines, impact on the Virginia Lottery and broader public safety implications of the proposal,” Martinez said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s proposal drew swift condemnation from Sen. Aaron Rouse, D-Virginia Beach, a skill game supporter who called the governor’s actions “a slap in the face to thousands of Virginia small businesses.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My co-sponsors, our bipartisan coalition, and I will work together to make sure the harmful provisions put into place by Governor Youngkin do not advance, and we will do everything possible to make the interests of small businesses – not casinos or massive out-of-state  corporations – a priority,” Rouse said in a news release.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A sizable group of convenience store owners, many of them South Asian immigrants, has advocated for the skill game legalization bill, telling lawmakers the extra money they made from hosting the machines was essential to their survival during the COVID-19 pandemic. Though the machines have an aesthetic resemblance to slots, Virginia policymakers have struggled with the question of how to classify them.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="kxeNLEvfHr"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/03/26/skill-game-backers-ask-youngkin-to-deliver-on-vow-to-support-their-industry/">Skill game backers ask Youngkin to deliver on vow to support their industry</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Skill game backers ask Youngkin to deliver on vow to support their industry&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/03/26/skill-game-backers-ask-youngkin-to-deliver-on-vow-to-support-their-industry/embed/#?secret=dTaMQEDeT7#?secret=kxeNLEvfHr" data-secret="kxeNLEvfHr" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because they require players to interact with the machine more than traditional slots, skill game backers have argued they technically shouldn’t be considered a form of gambling. Virginia experts on gambling addiction have disputed that claim, saying call data to the state’s problem gambling hotline shows people can get hooked on the machines just like traditional slots.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pace-O-Matic, a Georgia-based skill game company that has made well over $1 million in campaign donations to Virginia politicians since 2018, has also lobbied for the legalization bill in Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The General Assembly will take up Youngkin’s amended bill on April 17, when lawmakers return to Richmond to act on the governor’s vetoes and recommendations for bills passed in the legislative session that concluded March 9. If the General Assembly votes down some or all of the skill game amendments, Youngkin could then sign or veto the bill returned to him. If no bill passes, skill games would be outlawed in Virginia under a ban lawmakers first passed in 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s version also slows down the regulatory process for allowing the machines to be turned back on, after a Supreme Court of Virginia decision forced them to be deactivated late last year. Instead of having the Virginia Alcoholic Beverage Control Authority oversee the machines on a temporary basis starting July 1, Youngkin’s amendments give regulatory power to the Virginia Lottery.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Lottery would begin accepting applications on Jan. 1 of 2025, but skill game licenses wouldn’t take effect until the Lottery has put in place a “real time central accounting system” giving state officials more direct insight into how the machines work and how much money they’re making. The Lottery would also be tasked with setting up mechanisms for verifying “age and identity” before a player can use the machines, a system that would presumably block anyone under 21 from playing and exclude people with gambling problems who want to ban themselves from spending money on skill games.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin also suggested bumping the tax rate on the machines to 35%, up from 25% in the bill approved by the legislature. In the governor’s plan, truck stops could have no more than seven machines instead of the 10 envisioned by the legislature. Convenience stores and gas stations would be limited to three, down from four in the bill sent to the governor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s proposal states that host locations for skill games must be licensed to sell lottery tickets, a departure from the original bill that authorized restaurants and sports bars to host machines if they had a retail ABC license.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In perhaps the most significant change, Youngkin’s amendments give city and county governments the ability to ban skill games in their jurisdictions. If a city council or county board chooses not to act, local voters would have the ability to initiate a ballot referendum by collecting 5,000 petition signatures or support from at least 2.5% of their locality’s registered voters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s unclear how many Virginia localities might adopt anti-skill game positions. The bill approved by the General Assembly would have authorized the machines statewide, with no ability for local decision-making.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The location-based restrictions could also be a headache for the skill game industry, which has repeatedly accused the casino industry of trying to stymie competition from skill games &#8220;to protect casino profits. Representatives for Virginia casinos and the Rosie’s horse racing franchise operated by Churchill Downs opposed the skill game bill, arguing their bigger gambling facilities came with more capital investment and job creation that could be threatened if every neighborhood convenience store is allowed to have slot machine lookalikes. A casino-funded group called Virginians Against Neighborhood Slot Machines has run an intensive advocacy campaign against the skill game bill.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s amended bill would prohibit skill games within 35 miles of a licensed casino or Rosie’s horse racing facility, which mostly feature electronic machines that also resemble slots but are powered by an archive of past horse races.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After Virginia legalized casinos in certain areas in 2020, casinos are now up and running in Bristol, Danville and Portsmouth with two more being planned in Norfolk and Petersburg.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the Colonial Downs horse track in New Kent County, there are Rosie’s locations in the cities of Richmond, Hampton and Emporia as well as the town of Vinton in Roanoke County and the town of Dumfries in Prince William County.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 35-mile radius around all those facilities would put a significant portion of Virginia’s map off limits for skill games, notwithstanding any other local efforts to ban the machines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Merchants and Amusements Coalition, a group of business owners advocating for the skill game bill alongside Pace-O-Matic, called the governor’s amendments “devastating.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In another effort to protect out-of-state gambling interests, he effectively banned skill games by banning skill games within a 35-mile radius of all gaming establishments,” said the group’s President Rich Kelly, the owner of Hard Times Cafe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s amendments require skill games to have a payout percentage of at least 80% in cumulative “monthly pays,” a rule meant to give players a minimally fair shake at winning money. Traditional casino slot machines in Virginia are supposed to have a payout percentage above 84%. Though the skill game industry insists talented players can win every time they play because the machines involve skills like spotting patterns and memorizing sequences, a </span><a href="https://jlarc.virginia.gov/pdfs/reports/Rpt565-1.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2022 state study </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">concluded skill games have a lower payout percentage (77%) than other types of electronic gambling based on chance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The amended bill from Youngkin also instructs the Lottery to come up with rules meant to promote security and deter crime at businesses that host skill games.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Paul Krizek, D-Fairfax, who tried to add stricter regulations to the skill game bill on its way through the General Assembly with mixed results, said he’s still reviewing Youngkin’s amendments but sees them as “favorable.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is a major policy change for the commonwealth and it implements it in a reasonable way under the right regulatory body, while still allowing for these small businesses to generate revenue from up to three games in their establishments,” Krizek said.</span></p>

Glenn Youngkin speaking to a crowd in Richmond on April 8, 2024. (Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Glenn Youngkin is attempting a major overhaul of Virginia’s pending two-year budget instead of vetoing the full spending plan the Democratic-controlled General Assembly sent to him last month.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Youngkin administration announced a package of 233 budget amendments Monday, saying the governor has removed all tax increases and dropped the tax cuts he suggested in his original budget proposal late last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At a data-heavy news conference that also included presentations from several cabinet officials, Youngkin pitched his new plan as an effort to accommodate Democratic spending priorities without raising taxes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That is what finding common ground is all about,” Youngkin said, striking a newly conciliatory tone weeks after he blasted Democratic lawmakers over a spending plan the governor dubbed “the backward budget.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The governor’s new proposal also includes 3% raises for teachers and state employees in both budget years, reflecting the policy Democratic leaders laid out in the budget they approved in March.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The full details of Youngkin’s proposal weren’t immediately clear Monday because the actual text of what the General Assembly will be asked to vote on wasn’t made available.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After listening to Youngkin’s remarks Monday, Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, said the presentations left his side with “a lot of questions.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have serious questions about whether or not this budget can be structurally balanced,” Surovell said. Youngkin holding a news conference to stress his desire to work together, Surovell added, was “a distraction from the record number of vetoes this governor has issued.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Youngkin administration said its suggested budget changes translate to a general fund of roughly $64 billion, nearly $1 billion higher than what the governor laid out in his December proposal and approximately $1.5 billion less than what the General Assembly approved. Even without the proposed expansion of the state sales tax to cover digital purchases like music downloads, streaming services and software, Youngkin said his plan allows Virginia to allocate more funding for “collective priorities” like K-12 schools, higher education, public safety and mental health.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The administration said it was able to come up with a balanced plan largely by shuffling how and when some projects are funded and reducing the amount of money allocated to K-12 and higher education in comparison to the General Assembly’s budget. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It wasn’t that we eliminated, we just grew things slightly slower in a few areas,” Youngkin said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin also suggested eliminating spending tied to legislative proposals he’s vetoed, such as a $15 minimum wage and retail marijuana marketplace.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The governor’s rollout of his budget amendments avoids the more drastic scenario of a budget veto, which would have escalated the heated partisan sniping between Youngkin and Democratic legislative leaders who won majority control in last year’s General Assembly elections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next step in the process is for the legislature to take up Youngkin’s proposed budget overhaul on April 17, when lawmakers return to Richmond to act on the governor’s vetoes and amendments to the budget and other bills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are the highlights of the budget changes Youngkin is asking the General Assembly to consider:</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Tax policy</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After making tax cuts a major theme of his 2021 campaign and his first two years in office, Youngkin said he has “stepped back from that” and is now asking for Virginia’s tax policy to be left as is.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In return, Youngkin said he’s asking Democrats to “please come in and have no tax increases.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s our most important common ground spot,” the governor said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Surovell noted that Youngkin is now insisting on no tax increases after the governor himself suggested expanding the sales tax to digital purchases.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The modest tax modernization that we had in our last proposal was necessary in order to get the revenues to support that level of service,” Surovell said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin had proposed the digital sales tax as part of a broader policy package that also included a reduction to Virginia’s income tax rate. However, he has stressed he would not support a plan that ends up raising taxes overall and has portrayed the digital sales tax as a way to partially offset the cuts he proposed.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="PVRuQhQey7"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/12/20/youngkin-budget-calls-for-income-tax-cuts-sales-tax-increases/">Youngkin budget calls for income tax cuts, sales tax increases</a></p></blockquote>

<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">RGGI</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The governor’s budget proposes changing the language in the legislature&#8217;s budget to block the state from re-entering the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a carbon market aimed at incentivising reducing carbon emissions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The market requires electricity producers to purchase allowances for the carbon they emit. Those revenues are returned to the state, where, in Virginia, they are funneled for flood resiliency and energy efficiency efforts. In the commonwealth, utilities are allowed to recover those purchase costs from their customers.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="TF3ZylBTF5"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/07/31/virginia-enviro-groups-file-notice-they-will-challenge-youngkins-rggi-withdrawal/">Virginia enviro groups file notice they will challenge Youngkin&#8217;s RGGI withdrawal</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Virginia enviro groups file notice they will challenge Youngkin&#8217;s RGGI withdrawal&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/07/31/virginia-enviro-groups-file-notice-they-will-challenge-youngkins-rggi-withdrawal/embed/#?secret=5tPPxj9buT#?secret=TF3ZylBTF5" data-secret="TF3ZylBTF5" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin had the state exit the market through a regulatory action at the end of last year because of the “hidden tax” he said it imposes on ratepayers. Democratic lawmakers and environmental groups have contended that the move needs a legislative change, and participation in the regional carbon market has led to unprecedented amounts of funding for the state. The matter is being litigated in Floyd County Circuit Court.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Waterway improvements</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In light of the state leaving RGGI at Youngkin’s request, the governor maintains in his latest budget request $100 million for the Community Flood Preparedness Fund, which was funded by RGGI’s revenues and helped pay for flood resiliency projects. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other water-related amendments include fully funding the state’s cost-share program for farmers to install agricultural best management practices, like fencing cattle outside of streambanks, with about $201 million. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Differences exist around Youngkin’s amendment slating $5 million for a pilot program to pay farmers for achieving actual pollution reduction outcomes, as well as $100 million for wastewater treatment plant projects.The legislature planned to fund the pilot pay-for-outcomes program at $20 million and wastewater treatment plant upgrades at $400 million.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Richmond CSO</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The governor’s revised budget includes $50 million for the city of Richmond’s combined sewer overflow system upgrades, a legislatively mandated project that must be completed by 2035. The system treats wastewater and stormwater through the same pipes, which currently discharge waste into the James River during heaving periods of rainfall.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year’s budget amendments included $100 million for the upgrades, but it was cut from the final spending plan. Youngkin included $50 million in his December  biennium budget proposal, but the legislature cut it again from their final proposal last month.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">K-12</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To reduce teacher salary gaps, the governor plans to support investing $21.2 billion in K-12 education, giving teachers a 3% salary increase for each of the next two years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The governor’s administration said the average teacher pay in Virginia is around $68,300 compared to the national average of $68,500 in fiscal 2023, according to the </span><a href="https://www.nea.org/resource-library/educator-pay-and-student-spending-how-does-your-state-rank" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Education Association</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the Virginia Education Association disputed the data provided by the administration. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a </span><a href="https://www.veanea.org/vea-statement-on-governors-amendments-to-slash-k-12-funding-in-state-budget/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">statement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, VEA said the problem is that both sources have different ways of calculating teacher salaries. The association said VDOE includes more types of teachers and their pay, such as counselors and librarians, compared to NEA that includes only classroom teachers and substitutes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, the General Assembly sent the governor a budget that provided a similar measure for teachers and support positions. Lawmakers included language that would require school divisions to provide a local match.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The governor’s amendments included an additional </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">$150 million from the literary fund for the teacher retirement fund and money to reform the Standards of Quality funding formula to determine how much schools are funded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An additional $320 million in adjustments to K-12 policy initiatives proposed by lawmakers is pending.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Early childhood</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Youngkin administration, which </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/12/07/youngkin-announces-plan-for-millions-in-early-childhood-and-child-care-spending/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> plans to address the anticipated shortfall of federal funds for child care, said the budget provides $805 million from the general fund to support Virginia&#8217;s Early Childhood programs, a $420 million increase over the biennium in general fund resources.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ZMaMjaQQMu"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/01/29/with-child-care-increasingly-unaffordable-virginia-legislation-seeks-to-make-long-term-changes/">With child care increasingly unaffordable, Virginia lawmakers propose long-term fixes </a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;With child care increasingly unaffordable, Virginia lawmakers propose long-term fixes &#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/01/29/with-child-care-increasingly-unaffordable-virginia-legislation-seeks-to-make-long-term-changes/embed/#?secret=8bxL8D7oeu#?secret=ZMaMjaQQMu" data-secret="ZMaMjaQQMu" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, the General Assembly budget increased the governor’s proposal by $74 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers also put in $25 million toward creating a child care center for state employees in Richmond, using space on the campus of Reynolds Community College. Legislators included language to determine how other community college campuses could be retrofitted to provide child care for community college students and the broader public.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Higher education</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The governor is supporting an increase of $1 billion for higher education, which includes $33 million in undergraduate and graduate financial aid, and $24 million to help veterans and their families by paying education fees and living expenses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The investment also includes $154 million to prevent students from paying more in tuition — which is conditional upon colleges and tuitions not raising tuition beyond 3% — $75 million for Pell Grant recipients, and increases to the tuition assistance grant program.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, lawmakers proposed an additional $205.4 million over the biennium to help students to earn a degree. Lawmakers said the investment would prevent increased costs for in-state students and includes $40 million in support for historically Black colleges and universities.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Transportation</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The governor committed to investing $133.7 million in additional funding over the biennium to the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, which operates Metro.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s proposal is less than the $149.5 million proposed by lawmakers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regarding toll relief, the governor wants to commit </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">$67 million in one-time funding to expand and extend toll relief for residents of Portsmouth and Norfolk earning less than $50,000 per year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers proposed more, with an additional $101 million over the next two years. Under the General Assembly’s budget, which would combine with the state’s existing </span><a href="https://www.vdottollrelief.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Toll Relief program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, eligible drivers could get a 100% toll rebate for up to 14 trips per week through the Elizabeth River Tunnels until 2036. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin also proposed additional funding for Interstate 81.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Skill games</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin seems poised to amend a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/03/01/in-quick-friday-vote-virginia-general-assembly-oks-bill-legalizing-skill-games/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">high-profile bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to legalize slots-like skill machines in Virginia convenience stores, restaurants and truck stops, but he didn’t give specifics when discussing the potential budget ramifications.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The governor indicated his changes to the skill games bill would likely mean less revenue to the state that would come later than what the General Assembly envisioned, a sign he intends to take a less accommodating approach to skill games than the legislature.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin said he’s working with a bipartisan group of legislators on skill games and understands it’s a “very important objective” to many lawmakers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I have major problems with the bill that came over,” the governor said. “So we’ve been working to see if we can address those. We’ll see.”</span></p>

Tim Kaine, D-Va., defeated Republican Hung Cao on Nov. 5, winning a third term. (Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As he launched his 2024 reelection campaign in Richmond this week, U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., said being back in the city’s Jackson Ward neighborhood felt like “time has collapsed.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Three decades ago, that was where he got his political start knocking doors in his first run for the Richmond City Council. After serving as Virginia’s lieutenant governor and governor and extensively traveling the state, Kaine told supporters Tuesday at Richmond’s Hippodrome Theater, he’s confident Virginians will again reject former President Donald Trump and Republicans like him who “want to tear us down and tear us apart.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In good times or bad times, Virginians are not mean-spirited, pessimistic, name-calling complainers,” Kaine said. “We are upbeat, can-do, roll-up-your-sleeves, get-the-job-done people. We stand up for democracy and equality. We stand up for economic opportunity. We stand up for reproductive rights and voting rights. And most importantly, we stand up for each other.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not yet clear who Kaine’s Republican challenger will be, but the senator’s initial burst of campaign stops this week are a preview of the general-election message Virginia Democrats plan to deploy this year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taking aim at former Trump, who lost Virginia in both 2016 and 2020 but </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/03/05/trump-biden-win-super-tuesday-primaries-in-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">easily won the state’s GOP primary</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last month, Kaine said his would-be GOP challengers are “marching in lockstep behind this man so intent on tearing us down.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Tearing down his opponents, Republicans and Democrats. Tearing down our institutions, professional civil servants, a free press, an independent judiciary,” Kaine said. “Tearing down precious rights, like reproductive freedom, that people have been able to count on for decades. Tearing down alliances like NATO that strengthen democracy here and around the globe. Tearing down personal virtues: honesty, fidelity, patriotism, kindness, respect for others. Even tearing down our democracy.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Longtime Virginia political analyst Bob Holsworth said he’s doubtful Republicans will be able to make the state a presidential battleground in 2024, after Trump lost to Biden by more than 10 percentage points in 2020. But with Biden’s approval numbers “in the tank” in Virginia, Holsworth said, Kaine and other Democrats probably shouldn’t assume another double-digit victory is coming in 2024.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My sense is the most worrisome problem the Democrats could have is complacency,” Holsworth said. “I don’t think Kaine can start by thinking it’s a 10-point state. In that sense he should run very hard. “</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Holsworth said there could be a “reverse coattails” dynamic in Virginia, with Kaine’s popularity giving a boost to the less popular Democratic president at the top of the ticket. With Republicans seeming to lack a candidate with serious mainstream appeal, he said, Virginia’s U.S. Senate race should be “mildly competitive” at best.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eight Republicans are currently in the running for their party’s U.S. Senate primary on June 18. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The biggest fundraisers so far have been former GOP congressional candidate Hung Cao, a U.S. Navy veteran who in 2022, lost to Democratic U.S. Rep. Jennifer Wexton in Northern Virginia’s 10th District, and Scott Parkinson, who works for the conservative economic group Club for Growth and previously served as a congressional aide to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis when DeSantis was in the U.S. House of Representatives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other Republicans in the field, according to the Virginia Public Access Project: U.S. Army veteran Eddie Garcia; former Border Patrol agent and Trump-era immigration official Ron Vitiello; and attorneys Gwen Hickman, Jonathan Emord and Chuck Smith.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Republicans hoping to run against Kaine have also sought to tie the incumbent to the not-particularly-popular leader of the Democratic Party, portraying Kaine as a reliable ally to Biden and a supporter of Democratic economic and immigration policies that have contributed to Biden’s low approval ratings. Several candidates recently attacked Kaine for saying he felt it was irresponsible and inflammatory to use the word “invasion” to describe illegal crossings at the Southern border.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What we are witnessing at our Southern Border is an invasion despite what</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Tim Kaine</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and his Democrat colleagues want to call it, and they caused it to get to this point,” Cao said in a recent Facebook post. “If he wants to point fingers at anyone, it should be at himself and his colleagues. They want it this way. Period.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a recent </span><a href="https://twitter.com/ScottTParkinson?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">social media post on X</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Parkinson called the border crossings an invasion and said the situation was caused by “radical liberals like Kaine.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine has described what’s happening at the border as a “crisis” and has emphasized his efforts to strike a bipartisan deal on immigration policy. During his appearance in Richmond, he called for immigration reform to be done in “a way that honors our immigrant roots, ensures a vibrant workforce and creates a border that can be controlled.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine also offered a defense of the state of the economy under Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Joe and Kamala have ensured that America has rebounded out of COVID-19 better than any nation on the planet,” Kaine said. “Jobs are up. Wages are up. Retirement savings are up. The percentage of folks without health insurance is lower than it’s ever been in the history of the United States.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a sign of the discontent some on the left feel toward Democratic leaders, several demonstrators interrupted Kaine’s event at the Hippodrome with shouted commentary about Gaza.  One protester asked Kaine when he was going to “stand up” against the bombing campaign Israel is carrying out in response to the Oct. 7 attack on Israel by Hamas militants.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine said he understood the emotion and “heartbreak” people are feeling about Gaza.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We need to find a hostage deal,” he said. “We need to find a ceasefire.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking with reporters after the event, Kaine said he’s not taking his 2024 race for granted, but noted that his potential Republican challengers don’t appear to be doing themselves any favors by clamoring for credibility with their party’s Trump-loving base.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When they go on radio shows to try to get press, they’re kind of leapfrogging over each other to get more and more aligned with the MAGA wing of the Republican Party,” Kaine said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because neither party may be inclined to devote major resources to Virginia in the presidential race, Kaine said he intends to help set up a Democratic campaign structure that can also assist Democratic candidates in competitive congressional races in the Hampton Roads-based 2nd District and the open races for the 10th and 7th districts in Northern Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m going to very much run my race to focus on those three districts,” Kaine said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine was joined onstage at the Richmond event by U.S. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., who praised Kaine’s persistent sense of optimism at a rough time for national politics. To reinforce that point, Warner recalled the time Kaine spent 27 hours </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/01/04/tim-kaine-i95-stranded-snow/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">stuck on a snow-blocked highway</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> between Richmond and D.C.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If I had been caught in that snowstorm on 95, as chairman of the intelligence committee I would have brought in a CIA swat team to get me out,” Warner joked. “As opposed to Tim, peacefully sitting there with his water and orange.”</span></p>

(Scott Elmquist/ Style Weekly)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia General Assembly has a standard way of tentatively saying yes to something while reserving the right to say no later.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s called a reenactment clause, a paragraph tacked onto a bill that requires the General Assembly to approve it a second time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s the approach the legislature is taking to the plan to bring a casino to Petersburg, giving the city enough of a greenlight to move forward with its casino plans while explicitly leaving open the possibility the legislature could change its mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, the General Assembly approved </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=SB628" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> adding Petersburg to the list of Virginia cities eligible to host a casino. But the approved version, which would give Petersburg the ability to ask its voters to approve a casino in a ballot referendum, includes a reenactment clause that says the measure won’t take effect unless the legislature approves it again at either a regular or special session.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="n22Q1SDLAv"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/01/24/virginia-senate-panel-approves-first-batch-of-casino-bills/">Virginia Senate panel approves first batch of casino bills</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Virginia Senate panel approves first batch of casino bills&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/01/24/virginia-senate-panel-approves-first-batch-of-casino-bills/embed/#?secret=8GSI3DS8yb#?secret=n22Q1SDLAv" data-secret="n22Q1SDLAv" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because Petersburg is currently in the process of reviewing proposals from five would-be casino developers, the reenactment clause could potentially give the General Assembly an opening to rescind approval for a Petersburg casino if lawmakers decide they don’t like the way the city process is going.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reenactment clause was added to the bill and taken off multiple times as the legislation worked its way through the legislative process, but legislators haven’t laid out a clear explanation for why it was included in the version sent to Gov. Glenn Youngkin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Like all bills going through the legislative process, various members have policy perspectives that get incorporated as part of the bill along the way,” said Sen. Lashrecse Aird, D-Petersburg, who is sponsoring the bill along with Sen. Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth. “I remain in active conversation regarding whether the clause will remain on the final version of the bill.”</span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s possible Youngkin will send down an amendment removing the reenactment clause from the bill. If he does, that amendment will be considered when lawmakers return to Richmond April 17.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Petersburg Mayor Sam Parham didn’t respond to requests for comment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On March 22, Aird announced the five finalists hoping to partner with Petersburg on a casino project. The city is considering proposals from Bally’s, the Cordish Companies, Rivers Casino/Rush Street Gaming, the Warrenton Group and Penn Entertainment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bally’s and Penn are established national casino companies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cordish, a Baltimore-based development group, was </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/cordish-unveils-1-4-billion-plan-for-casino-resort-in-petersburg/article_75788be2-efba-5601-ad03-320d6791860e.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">chosen</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as Petersburg’s initial casino partner in 2022, but that project didn’t move forward. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Warrenton Group is a D.C.-based real estate firm looking to move into the casino industry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rush Street Gaming already operates the Rivers Casino in Portsmouth and is looking to add a second Virginia casino in Petersburg.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rush Street Gaming has made more than $112,000 in campaign donations to General Assembly members and the Virginia Legislative Black Caucus, </span><a href="https://www.vpap.org/donors/277534-rush-street-gaming-llc/?start_year=all&amp;end_year=all" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to the Virginia Public Access Project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other finalists have not been big donors to Virginia politicians, apart from a $20,000 contribution Cordish made to Republican Ed Gillespie’s 2017 campaign for governor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aird is hosting a town hall in Petersburg on April 14 that will include presentations from the five casino finalists. Her announcement of the event stressed that it’s up to Petersburg to pick which company is right for the city, despite the concurrent involvement of state officials.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The selection process is managed by the City of Petersburg solely,” Aird’s news release said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin, who has until April 8 to act on the casino bill, said he too was unclear on why the General Assembly had added a reenactment cause to what he said started as “a pretty clean bill.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It seems to have a purpose,” Youngkin told the Mercury last week. “And I need to understand that. It’s rare for that to happen on a bill like that, and so I’m trying to understand exactly what concerns the legislators had with regards to the process of citizens in Petersburg having a chance to opine on that casino.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The companies interested in building the casino have also seemed confused about the logistics of Petersburg soliciting casino proposals without having clear approval to host one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If the General Assembly passes </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=SB628" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SB 628</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the Governor signs it into law, only then will the city move forward with the selection process and filing for a referendum,” city officials wrote in an addendum to Petersburg’s </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/RFP_58853_Destination_Resort__Real_Estate_Development__Retail__Event_Venue__Casino_Development_and_Operations.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">request for casino proposals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> responding to questions from companies eying the opportunity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That answer came in response to a question about whether the city has a “specific date” in mind on when it might be able to pick a casino operator. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Petersburg’s casino <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/RFP_58853_Destination_Resort__Real_Estate_Development__Retail__Event_Venue__Casino_Development_and_Operations.pdf">RFP</a> says the city will insist on its casino partner entering into a “labor peace agreement” for the project involving “each labor organization that is actively engaged in representing gaming, hotel, food and beverage employees in Virginia.”</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="C3n2J1EXSm"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/02/06/virginia-senate-postpones-northern-virginia-casino-plan-until-2025/">Virginia Senate postpones Northern Virginia casino plan until 2025</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Virginia Senate postpones Northern Virginia casino plan until 2025&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/02/06/virginia-senate-postpones-northern-virginia-casino-plan-until-2025/embed/#?secret=YjfPH9H9QJ#?secret=C3n2J1EXSm" data-secret="C3n2J1EXSm" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week, Youngkin signed a pair of casino bills that would remove Richmond as an eligible host city and limit cities to one casino referendum every three years, a measure that would prevent a repeat of Richmond’s two failed casino referendums in 2021 and 2023. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many Richmond voters felt that after they said no to a casino in 2021 they shouldn’t have been asked a second time just a short while later.</span></p>

Bryce Reeves, R-Spotsylvania, </span><a href="https://www.vpap.org/candidates/109473/donor/324698/?start_year=all&amp;end_year=all&amp;contrib_type=all" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">disclosed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on a campaign finance report that skill game company Pace-O-Matic had paid for a trip he took worth $1,900.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On July 23, the date Reeves listed for the travel, Pace-O-Matic was hosting hundreds of guests in Wyoming at Cheyenne Frontier Days, a multi-day festival of bull riding, horse roping, food and music billed as “the world’s largest outdoor rodeo and western celebration.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A photo gallery on Pace-O-Matic’s Facebook page appears to show Reeves at the event, posing for a picture with company executives and others decked out in cowboy hats, boots and western attire.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the campaign finance paperwork gave no indication where Reeves went on the dime of a company that has </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/01/08/new-battle-over-skill-games-looms-in-virginia-as-industry-pushes-to-reverse-ban/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">extensively lobbied </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">the General Assembly for permission to put slot machine lookalikes in convenience stores and truck stops around Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the disclosure of the $1,900 expense, neither Reeves nor Pace-O-Matic will confirm the money was, in fact, connected to the Wyoming rodeo. Reeves, who chairs a General Assembly subcommittee on gambling regulation, has refused to answer specific questions, saying only that he followed all Virginia laws.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I have fully complied with all of Virginia&#8217;s financial disclosure laws, both as it pertains to my service in the General Assembly and required campaign finance disclosures,” Reeves said in an email. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The senator also claimed the Virginia Mercury had been “harassing” his staff by calling and emailing his legislative office seeking information for this story.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the wake of former Gov. Bob McDonnell’s gifts scandal a decade ago, Virginia policymakers set caps on how much travel, entertainment, meals and hospitality public officials can accept from lobbyists and companies hoping to influence them. McDonnell and his family accepted more than $177,000 in gifts, loans and trips from a businessman looking to promote his company’s dietary supplement, but the former governor was ultimately cleared of criminal charges. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the current rule, General Assembly members can’t accept more than $108 in gifts from any single lobbying interest per calendar year, but there are several exceptions to that limit. Legislators can accept lobbyist-funded travel above the cap, but only if they receive a waiver from the Virginia Conflict of Interest and Ethics Advisory Council, show there’s a “reasonable relationship” to their official duties and disclose the trip to the public.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Pace-O-Matic travel mystery highlights the continued looseness of Virginia’s ethics and campaign finance laws. Reeves reported the travel as an in-kind donation to his campaign, putting it in the realm of Virginia’s uncapped campaign finance system instead of treating it as a lobbying gift that could be subject to the $108 limit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company also would not explain what the $1,900 travel contribution to Reeves was for.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With regards to any elected official attending Cheyenne Frontier Days, Pace-O-Matic complied with all applicable laws and reporting requirements,” said Pace-O-Matic spokesman Michael Barley.</span></p>
<p><b>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘The Daddy of ‘em all’</h4>

	</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pace-O-Matic, which operates skill games in Wyoming under its Cowboy Skill brand, is a major sponsor for the rodeo event, nicknamed &#8220;the Daddy of em’ all.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Company leaders have described the annual trips to Cheyenne as a showcase for their business as well as the </span><a href="https://cowboystatedaily.com/2023/10/29/cheyenne-frontier-days-ropes-one-of-a-kind-sponsor-in-pace-o-matics/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">state of Wyoming</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Pace-O-Matic provides guests with hotel stays, dining, shopping trips and concert tickets, according to </span><a href="https://cowboyskillgames.com/pace-o-matics-heartwarming-connection-with-cheyenne-frontier-days/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a write-up on the company’s Cowboy Skill website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as well as “exclusive discounts at select Cheyenne merchants, particularly those in support of our skill games.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reeves, who chairs a General Assembly subcommittee on gambling regulation, recently voted for a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/03/01/in-quick-friday-vote-virginia-general-assembly-oks-bill-legalizing-skill-games/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">major bill to repeal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Virginia’s ban on skill games, legislation that would allow Pace-O-Matic to continue operating in the state and reverse the legislature’s previous decision to declare the machines a form of illegal gambling. Reeves also voted in favor of an </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/01/15/virginia-senators-refuse-to-send-skill-game-bill-to-committee-that-oversees-gambling/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">unusual procedural move</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to bypass Virginia Senate rules and prevent the skill game legalization bill from being vetted by the committee that handles gambling issues.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pace-O-Matic and its supporters say skill games have been a lifeline for small business owners in Virginia who get a cut of the machines’ profits, and many lawmakers say they’ve been swayed by the stories of immigrant convenience store owners who feel they’re being denied a fair shot at participating in the state’s growing gambling industry. Despite the emphasis on small business, some skill game industry critics contend the General Assembly is giving overly friendly treatment to a well-connected gambling interest that makes its money at the expense of regular Virginians who play the machines.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The skill game legalization bill passed the General Assembly in early March and is now under review by Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who is facing dueling public advocacy campaigns to sign or veto the proposal by his April 8 deadline to act. The governor can also suggest amendments to the bill, which would be considered by the legislature when it returns to Richmond April 17.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Pace-O-Matic was pushing for the bill during the General Assembly session, Reeves unexpectedly showed up to a Feb. 29 meeting the company had scheduled with the governor’s staff, according to a Youngkin administration official. Pace-O-Matic wouldn’t comment when asked if the company invited Reeves to the meeting, but his attendance indicates the company sees him as a key legislative ally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though Pace-O-Matic has become a major donor to Virginia politicians on both sides of the aisle, the $1,900 in question is the only time a General Assembly member has reported receiving donated travel from the company, according to campaign finance data from the </span><a href="https://www.vpap.org/donors/324698-pace-o-matic/?page=1&amp;start_year=all&amp;end_year=all" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Public Access Project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Campaign donations “properly received and reported” are excluded from the state’s gift definition, according to Virginia law. Neither Reeves nor Pace-O-Matic offered any information on how the travel was related to the senator’s campaign.</span></p>
<p><b>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Pennsylvania lawmakers disclosed Pace-O-Matic gifts and travel</h4>

	</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outside Virginia, Pace-O-Matic’s 2022 Wyoming trip was reported under ethics and lobbying laws, not as a campaign donation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several Pennsylvania lawmakers attended the event at Pace-O-Matic’s invitation in 2022, </span><a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2022/09/pa-gambling-skill-games-casinos-lawmakers-rodeo-trip/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to reporting by Spotlight PA</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and the company later disclosed spending thousands of dollars on travel and hospitality for Pennsylvania officials that year. Unlike Virginia, Pennsylvania prohibits corporations from contributing to political candidates, whether directly or through in-kind donations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former Pennsylvania Rep. Susan Helm reported receiving roughly $2,252 in transportation, lodging and hospitality from Pace-O-Matic, according to a </span><a href="https://www.ethicsrulings.pa.gov/WebLink/PDF10/f1118abb-8b47-48c6-928b-4f7efd30225a/514744" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">financial statement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> filed with her state’s ethics commission. Current Pennsylvania Rep. Jeff Wheeland reported $4,926 in travel, lodging and hospitality from Pace-O-Matic in 2022.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The gift disclosures for Pennsylvania legislators show they received passes to Cheyenne Frontier Days events valued at $367 per person. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Pennsylvania, Pace-O-Matic reported spending more than $8,000 on gifts, hospitality, lodging and travel for state officials and their families from July through September of 2022.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, Pace-O-Matic lobbyists reported spending $0 on gifts to public officials in all of 2022.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pace-O-Matic representatives would not explain why company-funded travel for lawmakers seemed to be treated differently in Virginia and Pennsylvania.</span></p>
<p><b>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Unanswered questions about 2023</h4>

	</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pace-O-Matic’s Virginia lobbyists have not yet filed disclosure forms for 2023, and company representatives have refused to answer questions about whether any Virginia lawmakers went to Wyoming in 2023 in addition to 2022.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the Mercury inquired about two photos that appear to show Reeves and Senate Minority Leader Ryan McDougle, R-Hanover, sitting together among the 2023 guests, those photos disappeared from Pace-O-Matic’s Facebook page.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reeves, who didn&#8217;t report any gifts or travel from Pace-O-Matic for 2023, did not comment on whether he went to Wyoming in 2023. In a statement, McDougle confirmed he was in Wyoming but said he paid for the trip himself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I was in Wyoming for less than 24 hours in the summer of 2023,&#8221; McDougle said. &#8220;I incurred the expenses related to that trip.&#8221;</span></p>

Bryce Reeves, R-Spotsylvania and Senate Minority Leader Ryan McDougle, R-Hanover stand on floor of the Virginia Senate. (Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former Virginia public safety secretary Brian Moran, now a lobbyist for Pace-O-Matic who confirmed he was in Wyoming for part of the 2023 event, wouldn’t give a yes or no answer when asked whether Reeves and McDougle attended.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I will not speak to whether or not members of the General Assembly were there,” Moran said when approached by a reporter at a recent skill game rally on Capitol Square.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The disclosure rules for lobbying-related travel don’t apply if lawmakers cover their own expenses and refuse free goods and services. Reeves reporting the 2022 travel as an in-kind donation suggests neither he nor his campaign paid for it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reeves didn’t report any donated travel from Pace-O-Matic in 2023. In July of 2023, he paid himself $8,320 from his campaign account as reimbursement for “travel expenses/flight,” but there’s no other indication of what that money was for.</span></p>
<p><b>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">A blurry line between gifts and in-kind donations</h4>

	</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reeves might have considered the Pace-O-Matic travel part of his campaign because it could help him with fundraising, but he didn’t appear to receive any donations directly connected to the trip. Pace-O-Matic has given Reeves $31,900 in state campaign contributions, </span><a href="https://www.vpap.org/donors/324698/recipient/193540/?start_year=all&amp;end_year=all&amp;recip_type=all" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to VPAP</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but the $1,900 travel expense was the only contribution the senator reported from the company in 2022. Apart from the travel donation, Reeves reported just one other contribution of more than $100 in July of 2022. It came from a Virginia businessman who worked in the wine industry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On July 23 of 2022, the same date as the travel disclosure, Reeves gave $500 from his campaign account to a Cheyenne Republican’s campaign for the Wyoming statehouse, according to his campaign finance report.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s unclear if Reeves giving money to a Wyoming politician is the reason his travel was categorized as campaign related, or if simply spending time with a major donor can be considered campaign activity due to the potential for future donations. Reeves, one of the biggest beneficiaries of Pace-O-Matic money in the legislature, received $10,000 in campaign donations from the company in January of 2023.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia law defines campaign contributions, including in-kind donations, as anything of value given to a candidate or a campaign “for the purpose of expressly advocating the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate.” Reeves didn’t have a state Senate race in 2022, and he had just lost a GOP congressional primary in June to Prince William County Supervisor Yesli Vega.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state puts no limits on campaign donations from lobbyists, including direct money contributions. Such contributions do not count as gifts subject to the ethics cap.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The line between in-kind donations and gifts is blurrier. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because Virginia doesn’t require campaign funds to be spent on campaign purposes, the state has few mechanisms for ensuring campaign finance reports are accurate. There are no clear guidelines for what should and shouldn’t be considered a campaign expense. Candidates also aren’t required to file documentation detailing exactly how money was spent, enabling a $1,900 expense to be summed up with the single word “travel.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deliberately false statements on disclosure forms filed by both lobbyists and legislators can be punished as a felony offense, but the law allows forms to be amended to correct minor omissions or errors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given the murkiness of Virginia&#8217;s laws and lack of detailed disclosure requirements, it can be difficult to determine whether a deliberate omission occurred or whether an official made a judgment call on how to interpret rules that are unclear.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ethics council and the General Assembly itself are responsible for reviewing legislators’ gift disclosures and instructing members to rectify any “deficiencies.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Staff for the ethics council, which typically doesn’t weigh in on lawmakers’ activity and treats much of its work as confidential, declined to comment.</span></p>

Glenn Youngkin speaking with reporters outside the Capitol Building on March 7, 2024. (Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Glenn Youngkin vetoed legislation Thursday that would have established a retail marijuana market in Virginia and raised the state’s minimum wage to $15 per hour, torpedoing two top Democratic priorities from the 2024 General Assembly session.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="PbW1Ztb5m0"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/03/07/bill-to-allow-marijuana-sales-in-peril-after-breakdown-on-virginia-arena-deal/">Bill to allow marijuana sales in peril after breakdown on Virginia arena deal</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Bill to allow marijuana sales in peril after breakdown on Virginia arena deal&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/03/07/bill-to-allow-marijuana-sales-in-peril-after-breakdown-on-virginia-arena-deal/embed/#?secret=KX3hJAmKL4#?secret=PbW1Ztb5m0" data-secret="PbW1Ztb5m0" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The moves came one day after Youngkin’s top priority — the proposal to bring a professional sports arena to Alexandria — imploded under the weight of community opposition, questions about its public financing scheme and partisan combat in Richmond. Ted Leonsis, the owner of the Washington Wizards and Washington Capitals, announced he’d reached a deal to keep the teams in D.C.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blocking bills at what could be a  record-setting pace, Youngkin has now vetoed 86 pieces of legislation the General Assembly passed earlier this year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fiery partisanship that has taken hold of Virginia politics the last few weeks raised questions about whether any high-profile legislation could win bipartisan approval, and Youngkin’s new round of vetoes indicate the chances are slim.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an unusually lengthy veto statement, Youngkin said he sees cannabis as too harmful to society to consider legalizing marijuana sales for recreational use. He said he’s concerned about impacts on children, higher crime and the potential for upticks in “psychosis” if marijuana becomes more easily available in Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Attempting to rectify the error of decriminalizing marijuana by establishing a safe and regulated marketplace is an unachievable goal,” Youngkin said. “The more prudent approach would be to revisit the issue of discrepancies in enforcement, not compounding the risks and endangering Virginians’ health and safety with greater market availability.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic lawmakers who sponsored the marijuana bill called Youngkin’s veto “reckless and negligent.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Governor Youngkin’s dismissive stance towards addressing Virginia’s cannabis sales dilemma is unacceptable,” Sen. Aaron Rouse, D-Virginia Beach, said in a statement. “Public servants areobligated to tackle pressing issues, regardless of their origin or culpability. They cannot </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">cherry-pick which problems to address.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The General Assembly decriminalized possession of small amounts of pot in 2021 under former Gov. Ralph Northam, but the Democratic-led legislature could not agree on a deal to establish a retail marketplace before Youngkin took office in 2022. That left Virginia’s marijuana laws in a jumbled state, with Virginians now free to possess cannabis, grow marijuana at home and buy medical marijuana but blocked from legally buying cannabis for recreational use.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The governor also raised doubts about whether legalizing retail marijuana sales is as effective as advocates say it is in reducing or eliminating the underground market for the drug.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Moreover, the expectation that cannabis legalization will result in a meaningful net increase in </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">state tax revenues has not materialized in states with legal markets,” Youngkin said. “States with legal retail cannabis have been challenged in transitioning their existing, robust black-markets into legal, regulated, and taxed markets.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Paul Krizek, D-Fairfax, said Youngkin’s action will only give further fuel to Virginia’s illegal marijuana industry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This veto squandered a vital opportunity to safeguard Virginians and will only exacerbate the proliferation of illicit products, posing greater risks to our schools and public safety,” Krizek said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The marijuana veto has little to no chance of being overridden by the General Assembly when lawmakers return to Richmond on April 17. Democrats who supported the bill hold slim majorities in both legislative chambers and lack the two-thirds majorities needed to overcome Youngkin’s opposition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The strong opposition to marijuana expressed in Youngkin’s statement suggests advocates may have to wait until the next governor takes office to have a realistic shot at getting a retail bill passed. Youngkin will still be in office for the 2025 General Assembly session, but if Democrats send him another marijuana bill it would likely face the same fate.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/03/07/bill-to-allow-marijuana-sales-in-peril-after-breakdown-on-virginia-arena-deal/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> he vetoed, which set up a system for licensing and regulating dispensaries and the cannabis products they would sell, would have allowed retail marijuana sales to begin In May 2025.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his other major veto announced Thursday, Youngkin blocked a bill that would have gradually raised Virginia’s minimum wage to $13.50 per hour next year and $15 per hour by 2026. That too was a major focus for Democratic leaders, who saw it as a modest step toward making Virginia a more worker-friendly state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The governor saw it differently.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The free market for salaries and wages works. It operates dynamically, responding to the nuances of varying economic conditions and regional differences,” Youngkin’s veto statement said. “This wage mandate imperils market freedom and economic competitiveness.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin pointed to sizable cost-of-living differences between places like Northern Virginia and rural places like Southwest and Southside Virginia, saying a “one-size-fits-all mandate” is unworkable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats blasted the governor’s minimum wage as a blow to the working class.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This veto makes Virginia a worse place for workers and struggling families,” Sen. Saddam Azlan Salim, D-Fairfax, </span><a href="https://x.com/SalimVASenate/status/1773460355290743072?s=20" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said on X</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the social media site formerly known as Twitter. “If we want to help Virginians, we need to lift up the working class, not push for tax cuts for the wealthy.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a radio appearance </span><a href="https://youtu.be/bAE0olTWkxs?si=b394PnuFpZ5QnOsZ&amp;t=1969" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">posted to Youngkin’s campaign YouTube page</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in August of 2021, the then-candidate called himself a “big supporter of the skill games.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m supportive of the skill games. I just think all businesses should be allowed to do business,” Youngkin said on Hampton Roads area station WNIS. “Skill games actually do enable so many small businesses to not only grow their business but also simply to survive.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s stance two years ago was closely aligned with sentiments on display Tuesday as skill game supporters held a rally on Capitol Square urging the governor to sign legislation to repeal a ban on the machines that’s been in effect since late last year.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legalization bill </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/03/01/in-quick-friday-vote-virginia-general-assembly-oks-bill-legalizing-skill-games/#:~:text=After%20a%20rapid%20turnaround%20on,on%20slots%2Dlike%20skill%20games."><span style="font-weight: 400;">passed the General Assembly</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with bipartisan support earlier this month, but the skill game industry is scrutinizing whether the governor will sign it, veto it or recommend changes. Without the legislation, skill games will remain fully illegal in Virginia. If the governor signs a bill, the regulatory details could determine how profitable the machines will be for the companies that make skill games as well as the small businesses that agree to host the games in exchange for a cut of the profits. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Skill game skeptics, who have pushed to give local government or local voters a say in whether the machines should or shouldn’t be allowed in their communities, are hoping the governor sends down a significantly tougher plan than the one that passed the legislature. The bill approved by lawmakers doesn’t allow localities to opt out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As they have for much of the 2024 session, gas station and restaurant owners showed up in numbers to argue revenue from skill games was critical to their businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic and still badly needed today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As the debate around the regulation of skill games unfolds, I hope that Gov. Youngkin stands by what he said on the campaign,” said Bhavin Patel with the Virginia Amusement Coalition, who said he has owned “a few mom and pop convenience store businesses.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some skill game proponents insist the machines aren’t a form of gambling because the outcome is dependent on the player’s skill, not pure chance. However, current Virginia law treats them as a form of illegal gambling, a classification the Supreme Court of Virginia indicated it would uphold despite the skill game industry’s efforts to challenge it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislation sent to Youngkin would allow up to four skill games in convenience stores, restaurants and other retail businesses licensed by the Virginia Alcoholic Beverage and Control Authority. Truck stops could have up to 10 machines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A 25% tax would apply to the machines’ revenues. The bill also includes provisions meant to prevent anyone under 21 from playing the games and mitigate gambling addiction, but critics say those measures fall well short of similar rules applied to other forms of gambling like casinos and sports betting apps.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Tuesday, Youngkin’s office was more circumspect about where the governor stands on the specific bill before him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The governor is closely reviewing the legislation and budget language sent to his desk, but still has numerous issues to work through including the regulatory structure, tax rates, the number of machines, impact on the Virginia Lottery and broader public safety implications,” Youngkin spokesman Christian Martinez said in a statement. “In 2021, when asked about this industry broadly, candidate Youngkin intimated interest in what expansion to these activities in convenience stores could potentially look like in Virginia, but now he has to look at the legislation presented to him.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginians Against Neighborhood Slot Machines, a casino-funded group advocating against the skill game bill, said the governor should veto the bill, regardless of what he said in 2021.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No one in 2021 could have conceived of a bill that was so lacking in public safety protections as what is on the governor’s desk,” said Nick Larson, a spokesman for the group.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Tuesday’s rally in support of the skill game bill, Kunal Kumar, an advocate with the Virginia Asian American Store Owners Association, said the legislation was “thoroughly vetted” by the General Assembly and worthy of Youngkin’s support.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is a lifeline for businesses all over Virginia,” he said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The usually buttoned-up, backroom budget process is spilling over into dueling press conferences this year as Youngkin blasts Democrats for approving more taxes and Democrats fire back at the governor for belittling a budget that drew bipartisan support and includes significant new funding for education.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The governor has held several <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/03/21/after-suggesting-digital-sales-tax-youngkin-blasts-democratic-version/">public appearances</a> to brand the Democratic-crafted plan “the backward budget.” This week, Democrats are doing a media tour of their own emphasizing that their budget puts “families first.”</span></p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;After suggesting digital sales tax, Youngkin blasts Democratic version&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/03/21/after-suggesting-digital-sales-tax-youngkin-blasts-democratic-version/embed/#?secret=4ycRmnLLRU#?secret=WWx2hh9if1" data-secret="WWx2hh9if1" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Tuesday’s stop in Richmond, House Appropriations Chairman Luke Torian, D-Prince William, asked what exactly is backwards about 3% pay raises for teachers and other school personnel in each of the next two years and $2.5 billion in new funding for K-12 education.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What is backwards about supporting the citizens of the commonwealth of Virginia?” Torian said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/12/20/youngkin-budget-calls-for-income-tax-cuts-sales-tax-increases/">Youngkin’s proposal</a> had called for a 1% bonus for teachers in fiscal year 2025 and a 2% raise in fiscal 2026.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though a little more than a dozen Republican lawmakers voted for the spending plan crafted primarily by the legislature’s Democratic majorities, Youngkin and others have harshly criticized its expansion of the state’s sales tax to include downloads of digital products and software and subscriptions to streaming services. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you go out and talk to the guy working 50 hours a week, the young mom with a few kids at home, go ask them if they think this is the time for tax hike,” said Del. Mark Earley Jr., R-Chesterfield, who spoke to reporters at the Capitol after Tuesday’s Democratic event.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The broadening of the 5.3% sales tax to cover what policymakers have dubbed “the new economy” would bring in an estimated $1 billion to the state’s general fund over the upcoming two-year budget.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats have pointed out that the digital sales tax began as Youngkin’s idea last December, when he pitched it as a way to modernize Virginia’s tax code as part of a broader tax reform package that included income tax cuts. Democrats have rejected the cuts, while keeping the expansion of the sales tax.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He was the one who started the whole tax scheme, we just embellished on it a bit so that we could help pay for our priorities,” Sen. Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, the chairwoman of the Senate Finance and Appropriations Committee, told reporters Tuesday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic General Assembly leaders have stressed that they passed a balanced budget on time with bipartisan support before they adjourned the regular 2024 session on March 9. Youngkin has said he won’t sign a budget that translates to an overall tax increase and has indicated he wants to avoid the rare step of vetoing the entire budget.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With both sides seeming to dig in to their respective positions, it’s unclear how and when the impasse will be resolved. Lawmakers will return to Richmond on April 17 to take up Youngkin’s vetoes and amendments to the budget and other bills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looming over the dispute is Youngkin’s unsuccessful push to bring a professional sports arena to Alexandria that could serve as the future home for both the Washington Wizards basketball team and the Washington Capitals hockey team. Lucas has led a blockade of the project, preventing a bill that authorizes public financing of the arena from being heard in the Senate and opposing any consideration of the proposed arena in the budget.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the two sides can’t come to an agreement on unfinished business at the April 17 reconvened session, the General Assembly may have to hold a special session under deadline pressure to pass a new budget by June 30, when the current one expires.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The governor needs to sign our budget and stop threatening an unprecedented budget veto,” Locke said Tuesday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lucas said she feels “no obligation” to send the governor a budget tailored to his priorities after Democrats won majority control of the legislature last November.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Because he’s going to be here for 18 months,” Lucas said, referring to the remaining time in Youngkin’s four-year term before he has to leave office. “I’ve got the rest of this session and then whatever years to go.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At an unrelated event Monday, Youngkin said he hopes to be able to talk with Democratic negotiators on the budget but didn’t lay out any specific plan for doing so.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ve reached out to leadership on the other side to invite a collaborative effort to come up with a compromise budget,” Youngkin said. “We’re just not going to have tax increases. And yet I still believe we can meet many of their priorities.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asked for his thoughts on the Democratic tour this week in response to his own tour, Youngkin said he hopes the other side is “being transparent with everyone about the tax increases.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unwinding the tax policies in the legislature’s budget could require a significant amount of money shuffling to end up with a plan that balances revenues and spending.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lucas said she’s not interested in negotiating with Youngkin if it means helping him find parts of her budget plan that can be dropped.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am not going to own his cuts to my budget,” she said. “Plain and simple.”</span></p>

Glenn Youngkin handed out cake pops at the Executive Mansion after signing a bill relaxing state rules on how homemade food can be sold. (Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The front yard of Virginia’s Executive Mansion was turned into a miniature farmers market Monday as Gov. Glenn Youngkin signed a bill meant to make life a little easier for a home baker he called “the kingpin of cake pops.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was referring to Kelly Phillips, a 41-year-old cake pop maker from the Richmond area who </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/01/03/virginia-cake-pop-maker-battles-state-regulators-for-right-to-post-pics-on-instagram/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">was told she could face a criminal charge last year </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">for selling her treats to the public without being in strict compliance with Virginia’s food safety regulations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I never thought in my wildest dreams that my story would catch the attention of the governor and he would want to talk about cake pops,” Phillips said as she spoke next to a table filled with cake pops depicting the Virginia flag and the “74” logo for the state’s 74th governor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin — who swung by a variety of tables set up at the mansion offering homemade nuts, brownies, jams and pickles — called the cake pop issue an example of how government rules can at times seem to stifle entrepreneurial energy, joking that Phillips got in trouble for having “the audacity to use Instagram to promote her product.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In a world where we can track my pizza delivery in real time and I can see it arrive to the back door, it seems a little outdated that Phillips couldn’t use social media to advertise cake pops,” Youngkin said. “And that’s when we realized our regulations need to be modernized… Sometimes the most important thing we can do with regulations is get rid of them.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The law Youngkin signed at Monday’s ceremony, which passed the General Assembly with broad bipartisan support and takes effect July 1, clarifies how food safety rules do and don’t apply to the smallest of small businesses.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s laws on inspections for food preparation areas include an exception for goods made in home kitchens, as long as those operations remain small and confined largely to face-to-face interactions with customers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The recently approved legislation will allow people who sell low-risk homemade food to promote their products online and give them greater leeway to sell at a variety of local fairs and events instead of limiting sales only to traditional farmers markets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was those two issues that got Phillips and her KP’s Kake Pops business in trouble last year with the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, which chided her for selling cake pops at a local holiday market that didn’t count as a farmers market and told her she wasn’t allowed to advertise on social media even if she wasn’t conducting actual sales online. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State law prohibits uninspected food from being offered for sale on the internet, and officials originally interpreted that rule to apply to advertising as well. Phillips protested that the rule was out of step with the 21st century economy, in which many small businesses use social media to drum up in-person sales and let customers know when and where their products will be available.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Phillips enlisted the help of the Institute for Justice, a libertarian-leaning law firm that fights against what it sees as overly restrictive laws on homemade food. After media outlets reported her story, Del. Nick Freitas, R-Culpeper, amended a bill he had filed dealing with homemade pickles to also address the cake pop controversy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t think most people understood that we had this burgeoning underground, black market cake pop industry,” Freitas said Monday. “Thankfully the governor and others came together to really recognize that sometimes the best work that we do around here is taking certain things off the books or reforming or adjusting it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Phillips thanked the officials in attendance at Monday’s ceremony for responding to her predicament with what she described as surprising speed, given the government’s usual reputation for sluggishness.</span></p>

Glenn Youngkin speaks about the pending Virginia budget at Eggs Up Grill in Chesterfield County. (Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In December, Gov. Glenn Youngkin said Virginia should modernize its tax code by closing what he called “the Big Tech tax loophole.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia collects sales taxes when people buy a CD or a vinyl record, Youngkin’s administration explained while presenting his </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/12/20/youngkin-budget-calls-for-income-tax-cuts-sales-tax-increases/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThe%20data%20is%20clear%3A%20Since,services%20that%20tax%20applies%20to."><span style="font-weight: 400;">two-year budget proposal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but state policy hasn’t been updated to reflect the music industry’s shift to digital downloads and streaming services. Expanding the sales tax to cover all digital goods and services would bring the state an extra $714 million in revenue to the state’s general fund over the next two fiscal years, the administration said.</span></p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Youngkin budget calls for income tax cuts, sales tax increases&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/12/20/youngkin-budget-calls-for-income-tax-cuts-sales-tax-increases/embed/#?secret=0SVHAbGFDZ#?secret=5byBYxKq9o" data-secret="5byBYxKq9o" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Virginia has always taxed goods,” Youngkin said in his December speech to lawmakers. “And over the last decade the definition of goods has evolved into new economy goods, like software packages, digital downloads, streaming music and videos, cloud storage and other electronic media.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The governor proposed applying the sales tax to the digital realm and raising the sales tax rate as part of a broader package of policy changes that included a 12% reduction in the state’s personal income tax rate and a bigger earned-income tax credit that would benefit lower-income workers. The sales tax increases, Youngkin said, would help offset the income tax cuts while still translating to an overall reduction to Virginans’ tax bills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, in multiple campaign-style appearances at local restaurants, Youngkin is pointedly attacking Democrats for taking his idea and running with it in a direction he didn’t intend. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They want to put their hand in your pocket and take your money that you deserve to keep,” Youngkin said last week at Eggs Up Grill in the Richmond-area suburb of Chesterfield County.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Democratic-crafted budget that passed the General Assembly this month with some GOP support included the new digital tax, but not the tax cuts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The governor went on to tell the Chesterfield crowd Democrats want to tax Virginians “as much as you can take, before you move away.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The General Assembly wrapped up the 2024 legislative session and left Richmond on March 9, but the tax battle is one of the major unresolved issues Youngkin and state lawmakers still need to figure out. Some of that work will happen over the next few weeks, before legislators return on April 17 to take up Youngkin’s amendments to the budget and his actions on more than 1,000 bills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin has vowed to remove all tax increases from the General Assembly’s approved budget, a move that could also involve undoing some of Democrats’ increased spending on K-12 schools and raises for teachers and state employees. The governor has said he’s hoping to avoid having to veto the entire budget, which allocates $65 billion in general fund spending over two years. But budget talks this week have produced few signs of progress toward a deal, </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/03/20/virginia-youngkin-arena-lucas-wizards-capitals-budget/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to the Washington Post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While explaining the digital sales tax provision that’s become a major sticking point, Democrats echoed Youngkin’s own rationale for it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Why should someone buying a CD, DVD or book pay sales tax while that purchase goes untaxed if it is streamed or digitally downloaded?” Senate Finance and Appropriations Chairwoman Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, asked earlier this month while presenting the legislature’s budget deal on the Senate floor. Unlike Youngkin’s proposal, Lucas added, the General Assembly’s budget doesn’t increase the sales tax rate, it only applies it more broadly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After dropping in on the governor’s Chesterfield event last week, Del. Mike Jones, D-Richmond, disputed Youngkin’s portrayal of the budget as a reflection of Democrats’ tax-and-spend impulses. In the House, he said, roughly a dozen Republicans voted for the plan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We think we’ve put together a reasonable budget that’s going to impact Virginians on the things that are important to them,” Jones said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Youngkin administration wanted the digital sales tax to only apply to consumer purchases, but the version approved by the legislature also applies to business-to-business software transactions. In a </span><a href="https://vachamber.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Action-Alert_Tax-on-Digital-Services.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recent letter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the Virginia Chamber of Commerce urged the state’s business community to oppose the tax, saying it could cost them up to $360 million per year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The high cost of doing business in the Commonwealth is already a recurring theme in reviews of Virginia’s business climate, and these tax provisions will further raise that cost across all industries,” Virginia Chamber President and CEO Barry Duval said in the March 15 letter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeming to anticipate business opposition in her Senate speech, Lucas said the approved budget narrowed the digital tax to apply only to business software purchases instead of the broader categories applied to consumers like web hosting, data storage and streaming.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Software used by a business represents the end user just like an individual using Microsoft 365,” Lucas said, referring to Microsoft’s popular productivity software like Word, Excel and Powerpoint. “Businesses should help support the costs to cover programs that benefit them and their employees, like child care, education and transportation.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Education Association, which advocates for more public school funding and better pay for teachers, praised the </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/03/09/after-2024-legislative-sessions-end-legislature-releases-two-year-state-budget/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">General Assembly’s budget</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as prioritizing education.</span></p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;After 2024 legislative session&#8217;s end, legislature releases two-year state budget&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/03/09/after-2024-legislative-sessions-end-legislature-releases-two-year-state-budget/embed/#?secret=vyd0KHhCul#?secret=loYDRnjWTM" data-secret="loYDRnjWTM" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“By prioritizing the modernization of our revenue code, rather than tax giveaways to the wealthy, as the governor proposed, leaders were able to make the type of investments that will improve services and support for students in every classroom throughout the commonwealth,” VEA President James Fedderman said in a March 11 news release. “We now look to the governor to sign this pro-education budget and choose kids over corporations and his wealthy friends.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In its budget presentation late last year, the Youngkin administration specified it wasn’t attempting to impose new digital taxes on business transactions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the time, Youngkin Finance Secretary Stephen Cummings explained the proposal as similar to how the state responded to the rise of Amazon, which unlike brick-and-mortar stores initially wasn’t required to collect and submit sales taxes for purchases made in Virginia. Under pressure from traditional retailers concerned about fairness, the state changed that policy in 2013 and Amazon began collecting sales taxes in Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We think it is a fair and appropriate way to treat these types of services,” Cummings said of the new digital tax proposal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While bashing what he’s dubbed the “backward budget,” Youngkin has said the General Assembly’s spending plan includes $2.6 billion in tax increases. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The digital sales tax provision would bring in about $1 billion over two years to the general fund, the state’s main pot of money to spend on discretionary initiatives. Youngkin aides </span><a href="https://x.com/mmoran0226/status/1766468237678510108?s=20" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have argued</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> its true impact is closer to $2 billion if you add in non-general fund money dedicated to transportation and schools. The $714 million figure the administration presented in December only accounted for general fund revenues.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin has also blasted Democrats for insisting on </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/01/22/democrats-propose-budget-language-to-return-virginia-to-carbon-market/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">budget language</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that would require Virginia to reenter the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a multi-state initiative to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by electricity producers. The program requires power companies to purchase carbon allowances, incentivizing them to emit less. Funds raised from those purchases are then used to fund flood resilience and energy efficiency programs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reentering RGGI, Youngkin told the crowd in Chesterfield, means Dominion Energy and Appalachian Power will “just charge you for their costs,” which he estimated at $600 million to $800 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They pass it through,” Youngkin said. “You have no choice. You have nothing to say about it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After pushing through $5 billion in tax relief in the first half of his term, Youngkin said he won’t support a budget that goes in the other direction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We just can’t let this happen,” Youngkin said. “And so, we’re not.”</span></p>

Parker Michels-Boyce for The Virginia Mercury</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A federal judge gave a greenlight Monday to a novel legal argument challenging Virginia’s longstanding felon disenfranchisement policy based on limits imposed on the state when the Civil War ended.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lawsuit is focused on the 1870 Virginia Readmission Act, a federal law that allowed the former Confederate state to rejoin the U.S. Congress. As a condition for regaining elected representatives in the federal government, the law states that the Virginia Constitution cannot be used to deprive anyone of voting rights “except as a punishment for such crimes that are now felonies at common law.” At the time, common law felonies included “murder, manslaughter, arson, burglary, robbery, rape, sodomy, mayhem and larceny,” according to filings in the case.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By now stripping voting rights for all felonies instead of a particular set of crimes, the lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union of Virginia and other groups alleges, the state has fallen out of compliance with the Reconstruction-era law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voting rights and social justice groups have fought for years to scale back the scope of Virginia’s felon voting policy, which many advocates say disproportionately affects Black communities because of broader disparities in the criminal justice system. Under the state’s current </span><a href="https://www.restore.virginia.gov/restoration-of-rights-process/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">system</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, people with felony convictions can ask to have their voting rights restored by the governor, but governors have broad leeway to be as lenient or as strict as they wish in granting or denying those requests.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his initial opinion on the case, U.S. Eastern District Court Judge John A. Gibney Jr. indicated that argument had enough legal merit to survive the state’s attempts to have the case thrown out. Rejecting the state’s assertion that federal courts shouldn’t intervene in what’s effectively a Virginia political matter, Gibney ruled that the case “plausibly presents” the possibility that Virginia officials are violating federal law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the judge dismissed some aspects of the case, the ACLU of Virginia hailed the ruling as a victory for their side.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Virginia may no longer be a Confederate state, but the provision of our constitution that was specifically put in place to suppress the voting rights of newly enfranchised Black citizens after the Civil War is still oppressing Virginians today,” Vishal Agraharkar, a lawyer with the ACLU of Virginia, said in a news release. “Virginia is still living in the past, but by allowing our case to proceed today, the court demonstrated that it’s never too late to work for justice.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ACLU is working on the case with the WilmerHale law firm and a voting rights group called Protect Democracy. The plaintiffs are Virginians with felony convictions who have tried to have their voting rights restored by Gov. Glenn Yougkin without success.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gibney removed a nonprofit group called Bridging the Gap from the case after ruling a general interest in helping former prisoners reenter society wasn’t enough to give the organization legal standing to sue. The judge also dismissed several other legal theories in the case, finding that the Virginia Readmission Act didn’t create affirmative rights for Virginia voters and concluding felon disenfranchisement isn’t a “punishment” as defined in the Eighth Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The judge declined to dismiss Youngkin and Secretary of the Commonwealth Kelly Gee, who oversees felon rights restorations for the Youngkin administration, as defendants in the suit. The state had argued the governor and his team don’t have a strong enough connection to the challenged policy to be included in the litigation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But under Virginia’s voting rights restoration scheme,” Gibney wrote, “these defendants may enforce the permanent disenfranchisement of certain individuals.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An unknown perpetrator fatally shot a man at the “Government Center” bus stop between Richmond City Hall and Capitol Square, causing a brief lockdown on the second-to-last day of the session.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before the day was over, Gov. Glenn Youngkin had vetoed one gun bill and signaled strong skepticism of another, his first actions on the more than 30 gun-related bills Democratic lawmakers sent him this year. Most of the bills passed along party lines with opposition from Republicans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of those bills involve duplicate House and Senate versions, but the higher-than-normal volume of approved gun legislation shows Democrats intend to keep pressing the issue, after passing a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/northam-signs-landmark-gun-control-bills-recommends-tweaks-to-two-others/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">half-dozen major gun-control bills</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2020 under former Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gun violence breaking out near the doorstep of state government didn’t go unnoticed, as advocates invoked the bus stop shooting while blasting Youngkin’s lack of support for gun legislation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This comes on the same day as a shooting in downtown Richmond killed one person, just steps from the statehouse,” the pro-gun control group Everytown for Gun Safety </span><a href="https://x.com/Everytown/status/1766289237576421438?s=20" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said on X</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter. “Virginia voters elected a gun sense majority to take action to prevent gun violence and they listened—passing dozens of gun safety bills.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Multiple Republican lawmakers pointedly noted that the shooting took place between two government buildings where Democratic officials have banned guns, on a bus line that also has weapon restrictions. Those rules, GOP lawmakers said, did little to stop the person who pulled the trigger and got away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the Senate floor, Sen. Mark Peake, R-Lynchburg, called the incident tragic and jokingly suggested the legislature consider putting up “bigger or meaner-looking” signs saying no guns allowed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Believe it not, this criminal with evil in his heart ignored those signs,” Peake said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reaction to the bus stop shooting highlights the deep political divide on gun violence, with Democrats saying there are simply too many guns in too many places and Republicans insisting the problem can be addressed by getting tougher on crime and lawlessness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though gun-control advocates are pressuring the governor to sign at least some of the bills on his desk, Youngkin has made it fairly clear he doesn’t agree that the state’s firearm laws are too weak.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I strongly urge the General Assembly to shift its focus towards proven strategies aimed at combating violent crime, mandatory minimums for armed criminals and the presumption against bail,” Youngkin said in a </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/governor-of-virginia/pdf/Vetoes-(1).pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">statement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> vetoing a bill that would have tightened rules requiring people credibly accused of domestic abuse to give up their firearms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin has until April 8 to act on the dozens of gun bills awaiting his signature, veto or amendments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bills passed this year deal with:</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Restricting assault weapons</h4>

	</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most high-profile piece of gun legislation would reduce the availability of assault-style weapons in Virginia by making it a misdemeanor crime to import, sell, manufacture, purchase or transfer “assault firearms” and high-capacity magazines made after July 1. The proposal wouldn’t outlaw assault weapons that exist today, but creates a new rule banning anyone under 21 from buying or possessing assault weapons, regardless of the manufacture date.—</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=HB2" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 2</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">/</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB2" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 2</span></a></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia law already allows some cities and counties to ban the public carrying of loaded assault weapons. A bill sent to Youngkin would expand that authority to every local government, a proposal supporters say would reduce the possibility of long guns causing panic in public places.—</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=HB175" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 175</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">/</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB99" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 99</span></a></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers passed a bill giving Virginia authorities more power to go after auto sears, small plastic or metal devices that can cause semiautomatic guns to empty an entire clip with one trigger pull. Federal law treats auto sears the same as automatic machine guns, meaning they’re illegal without registration and paperwork. Virginia law enforcement officials told the legislature the lack of a state ban has limited their ability to get the devices off the streets. The auto sear proposal passed with bipartisan support, putting it higher on the list of gun legislation Youngkin could potentially approve.—</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=HB22" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB22</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">/</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB210" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SB210</span></a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Banning untraceable guns</h4>

	</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Law enforcement would get new powers to crack down on 3D-printed “ghost guns” and do-it-yourself gun kits under legislation that bans plastic firearms and other guns  security scanners can’t detect. The legislation would also create new restrictions against shipping unfinished firearm parts and guns without serial numbers. —</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=HB173" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 173</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">/</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB100" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 100</span></a></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s already illegal to try to render a gun untraceable by filing off a serial number, but lawmakers passed a bill that would give law enforcement the ability to charge people for “knowingly” possessing or selling those guns without needing to prove who scratched off the serial number.—</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=SB363" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 363</span></a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Strengthening the red flag law</h4>

	</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia has had a so-called red flag law on the books since 2020, but there has been little comprehensive data available on how authorities are using it to temporarily seize firearms from people deemed a threat to themselves or others. To address that, the General Assembly passed a bill requiring Virginia State Police to create a tracking and reporting system that would give policymakers quarterly updates on how many red flag orders are being issued and which localities are using them.—</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=HB916" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 916</span></a></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another bill would create a training and awareness program meant to educate law enforcement, school personnel, mental health professionals and the public on how the red flag law works. —</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=HB637" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 637</span></a></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Judges and magistrates would get clearer guidance on what factors to consider when reviewing requests for red flag orders under legislation that specifies acts of violence, threats, self-harm, reckless use of guns and hurting animals should all be relevant when weighing whether someone should lose access to firearms.—</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=SB258" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 258</span></a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Waiting periods</h4>

	</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both chambers approved a bill that would impose a five-day waiting period for gun purchases, starting when a prospective buyer signs a form agreeing to a background check.— </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=HB1195" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 1195</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">/</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB273" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 273</span></a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Banning guns in more places</h4>

	</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Largely in response to the shooting that took place at the University of Virginia in 2022, lawmakers passed a bill banning guns on college campuses and buildings owned by public institutions of higher education. Many colleges and universities already have administrative rules against firearms, but UVA Police Chief Tim Longo has argued establishing that prohibition, as a state law would make it easier for agencies like his to respond to reports of guns on campus. —</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB454" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 454</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">/</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB383" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 383</span></a></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers passed a bill to ban guns, knives and other weapons in hospitals and emergency medical centers that provide mental health treatment, with exceptions for security guards and law enforcement. —</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=HB861" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 861</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">/</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB515" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 515</span></a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Tougher rules for the gun industry</h4>

	</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state attorney general’s office and local government lawyers would gain greater power to sue the gun industry under a bill that creates a civil cause of action for firearm-related injuries. The legislation created “standards of responsible conduct” for those who make, sell or advertise guns and opens the door to lawsuits if their activity creates a “public nuisance” or “harm to the public.”—</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB318" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 318</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">/</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=SB491" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 491</span></a></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Federal law imposes limits on how close gun shops can be to schools. Legislation pending in Virginia would apply similar rules to home-based gun dealers, preventing them from operating within one and a half miles from elementary and middle schools. —</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=HB585" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 585</span></a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Safe storage</h4>

	</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats passed a bill that would require guns to be stored in a locked, inaccessible container if kept in a home with minors present or if someone in the home is banned from possessing guns. State law would continue to allow minors under 12 to use a gun with adult supervision.—</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=HB183" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 183</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">/</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB368" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 368</span></a></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another storage-related bill would create a new felony charge for parents or guardians who allow a child under 18 to access firearms despite knowing the child has a history of violent or threatening behavior. Adults could avoid charges if they allowed a minor to access a gun for defensive use when there was an “imminent danger of bodily injury.”—</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB36" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 36</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">/</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB44" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 44</span></a></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leaving a handgun visible in an unattended vehicle could lead to fines of up to $500 under a proposed law meant to prevent firearm thefts from cars parked on public roads. If authorities see guns left out, the bill would give them the ability to tow the vehicle. —</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=HB1462" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 1462</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">/</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB447" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 447</span></a></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The governor already amended a bill that would have required local school boards to send material to parents about the safety risks of guns in the home. Youngkin proposed a much broader type of parental notification dealing with numerous rights and responsibilities beyond guns, and would require the legislation to pass again next year.—</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=HB498" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 498</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">/</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB225" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 225</span></a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Getting guns away from abusers</h4>

	</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">State law prohibits anyone convicted of misdemeanor domestic abuse against a “family or household member” from having guns. A bill passed this year extends that rule to abuse against an “intimate partner,” defined as someone who was in a romantic, dating or sexual relationship with the abuser within the past year.—</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=HB362" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 362</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">/</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB642" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 642</span></a></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another abuse-focused bill would tighten rules requiring people credibly accused of abuse to surrender firearms. The legislation, which Youngkin already vetoed, would prevent those guns being handed over to someone under 21 or someone in the same household. —</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=HB46" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 46</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">/</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB47" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 47</span></a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Gun violence study</h4>

	</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers are attempting to have the General Assembly’s Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission conduct a comprehensive study of the “social, physical, emotional, and economic effects of gun violence” on Virginia communities. With the help of other state agencies, the commission would perform that study in 2024 and 2025 and report back to the legislature. —</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=SB338" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 338</span></a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Gun safety tax credits</h4>

	</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the rare firearm bills that passed with solid bipartisan support would expand an existing tax credit meant to make it cheaper for Virginians to buy gun safes. Under the proposal, the $300 tax credit could also be applied to trigger locks and similar safety devices applied directly to a gun. —</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=HB35" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 35</span></a></li>

(Parker Michels-Boyce/ For the Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia routinely performs mathematical audits of elections to ensure there were no major malfunctions with ballots or the machines that scan and count them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An audit of the state’s 2020 presidential contest </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2021/03/31/audit-overwhelmingly-confirms-virginias-election-results/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">confirmed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> President Joe Biden’s lopsided victory in Virginia over former President Donald Trump with near-total statistical certainty. But under new language included in the budget passed by the Democratic General Assembly, there would be no such audit of the 2024 presidential contest.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="7I9pxQw5dX"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2021/03/31/audit-overwhelmingly-confirms-virginias-election-results/">Audit overwhelmingly confirms Virginia&#8217;s election results</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the term “audit” is often invoked by conservative activists to mean an intensive investigation into results they find suspicious, state law requires “risk-limiting audits” to be performed for some elections to verify the accuracy of voting equipment. The process involves hand counting only enough ballots to obtain “strong statistical evidence that the reported outcome is correct,” according to </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title24.2/chapter6/section24.2-671.2/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Mark Sickles, D-Fairfax, said the budget language both clarifies the intent of a 2022 bill that tweaked the process and ensures an audit won’t inhibit Virginia’s ability to certify its presidential outcome in accordance with the federal Electoral College timeline.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“People are worried about any excuse someone might make for not certifying the election,” Sickles said in an interview. “After what happened last time, people are kind of sensitive about what things people might use to try tying things up in litigation.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The approved amendment in the budget specifies that “a risk-limiting audit of a presidential election or an election for the nomination of candidates for the office of president shall not be conducted.”</span></p>
<p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2023-RLA-Manual_FINAL.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Previous guidance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the Virginia Department of Elections had indicated that in 2024, a statewide audit would be performed for either the presidential contest or Virginia’s U.S. Senate race. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the budget language stands, election officials would most likely perform an audit of the race between U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., and his to-be-determined GOP challenger, as well as a randomly selected U.S. House of Representatives election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State law doesn’t require risk-limiting audits for presidential elections, instead leaving it to the discretion of state election officials to choose which contests to audit. Applying the process to statewide races can help officials comply with a rule requiring every local election office to participate in an audit “at least once every five years.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The audit of Virginia’s 2020 presidential results happened after the results were certified, meaning it didn’t affect Virginia’s ability to officially report Biden’s victory. In a major difference, the 2022 law requires audits to be completed before certification of the outcome.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tram Nguyen, a voting rights advocate with left-leaning New Virginia Majority, said the budget item ensures the audit process doesn’t “end up messing up the presidential timeline.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think risk-limiting audits are great,” Nguyen said. “They are a best practice across the country.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The budget item dealing with audits also extends the post-election timeline for local electoral boards to certify results. It gives officials 10 days, three more than existing law, to check the validity of outstanding ballots and verify local results to the state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two GOP lawmakers who signed off on the budget — Senate Minority Leader Ryan McDougle, R-Hanover and Sen. Todd Pillion, R-Abingdon — wrote on the document that they objected to the amendment dealing with elections. Efforts to reach McDougle and the Senate GOP were unsuccessful.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The budget is currently under review by Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who made audits a key piece of his “election integrity” focus while campaigning in 2021. Former Gov. Terry Mcauliffe </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2021/10/08/youngkin-mcauliffe-spar-over-election-audits/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">attacked</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Youngkin over that position, saying the emphasis on audits was a nod to conspiracy theories about the 2020 election being stolen from Trump. Youngkin insisted he was only professing support for the standard, risk-limiting audits Virginia has </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?171+sum+SB1254" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">required since 2018</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement Wednesday, Youngkin’s office said it’s looking over the budget but emphasized that Youngkin “has been committed to restoring Virginians’ faith in our elections and improving the voting processes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That means using all the tools at our disposal to ensure the integrity of our elections,” said Youngkin spokesman Christian Martinez.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite persistent Republican criticism that Virginia’s election system isn’t secure enough, there have been no examples of widespread voter fraud in recent years.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the 2020 election did produce a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/2020-election-error-in-prince-william-county-benefited-trump-officials-reveal/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">significant counting error</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Prince William County, which caused Trump to get 2,327 more votes than he should have and subtracted 1,648 votes from Biden’s total. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That wasn’t enough to swing the outcome of any contests, officials said, but some saw it as an alarming example of an election error going undetected until long after the incorrect vote totals had been certified. It wasn’t until this year that Prince William officials revealed the full scope of the problem, a delay largely caused by the criminal prosecution of a former county election official that ended with all </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/12/02/prince-william-election-felony-charges-dropped/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">charges being dropped</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia has different procedures for recounts of close races when ballot irregularities could potentially have a greater impact on election results. Court-supervised recounts can only be called if an election is decided by a margin of less than 1% of total votes cast for the winner and runner-up. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The recount process mostly involves hand-counting ballots that couldn’t be read by scanning machines and having a court resolve disputes about whether a ballot can or can’t be counted for a particular candidate.</span></p>

(Photo courtesy of Virginia State Police)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin took to social media Monday morning to denounce a pro-Palestine protest that blocked highway traffic in the Richmond region.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is unacceptable to block interstates, endanger the lives of Virginians and cause mayhem on our roads,” Youngkin said on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, while reposting a photo of a heavy Virginia State Police response to the protest that took place on Interstate 95 near the exit for Arthur Ashe Boulevard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nine people were arrested in the incident, according to the Virginia State Police, which clogged southbound traffic for several hours and led to traffic backups extending more than 3 miles. No protesters or law enforcement personnel were hurt, according to officials.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mostly young people from the Richmond area, those arrested were charged with stopping another person’s vehicle, obstructing the free passage of others, unlawful assembly and being a pedestrian on the interstate. The first three charges are misdemeanors, and the latter is considered a traffic offense.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An anonymous news release sent to the media shortly after the protest began said the demonstration was carried out “in solidarity with the Palestinian Liberation Movement” and meant to cause “major gridlock.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Demonstrators say that they are putting their bodies on the line to disrupt the flow of ‘business as usual’ in the heart of the Commonwealth, demanding that the U.S. empire cease all funding for the genocidal, Israeli occupation of Palestine at once,” the release said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State Police said they first started receiving calls from blocked drivers around 6:54 a.m.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After arriving at the scene, State Police said they found “nine individuals lying in the southbound lanes” who had “linked themselves together using two ladders, a large metal chain and ‘sleeping dragon’ devices.” After police declared an unlawful assembly, three protesters “voluntarily gave up almost immediately,” according to police.</span></p>

(Photo courtesy of Virginia State Police)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Specially-trained troopers arrived on scene to safely extricate the remaining six protesters from the sleeping dragon devices, which turned out to be large PVC piping wrapped in chicken wire and connected via a large metal chain,” said State Police Sgt. Jessica Shehan. “The six were then taken into custody without further incident and transported off the interstate.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The scene wasn’t fully cleared until 10:30 a.m.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican lawmakers in Virginia have occasionally introduced legislation to create tougher criminal penalties for disruptive protests, but those efforts have largely failed in the General Assembly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some proposals have been aimed squarely at creating steep consequences for blocking roads and highways. In debate over one such bill in 2022, Democratic lawmakers stressed that it’s already a class 1 misdemeanor, an offense punishable by up to a year in jail and up to $2,500 in fines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If convicted on a charge of stopping the vehicle of another, violators can also have their driver’s license suspended for up to one year.</span></p>

Glenn Youngkin speaks to reporters outside the Capitol near the end of the 2024 General Assembly session. (Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the first signals of how he’ll act on legislation approved by Virginia’s Democratic General Assembly, Gov. Glenn Youngkin signed a largely symbolic bill protecting same-sex marriage but took a more adversarial stance to bills dealing with gun control, reproductive rights and marijuana.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin had until Friday night to take action on 84 bills the legislature sent to him on a shorter-than-usual timeline. He vetoed eight, recommended changes to 12 and signed the rest.</span></p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Va. Democrats fast-track marriage equality, gun bills headed to Youngkin&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/03/04/va-democrats-fast-track-marriage-equality-gun-bills-headed-to-youngkin/embed/#?secret=Tccox3Vu6T#?secret=4uEPFe1zPY" data-secret="4uEPFe1zPY" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The General Assembly finished its work Saturday without taking up any of the governor’s initial amendments and vetoes, which means they will be dealt with during the regular reconvened session on April 17. Any overrides of his vetoes are unlikely, because Democrats are well short of the two-thirds votes necessary to enact laws despite the governor’s opposition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislation the governor signed included a high-profile bill to ban legacy admissions at Virginia’s colleges and universities, a fairness measure that has drawn broad support after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down race-based affirmative action policies last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In one of his more surprising moves, Youngkin signed a Democratic-sponsored bill meant to ensure that same-sex marriage remains legal in Virginia regardless of any future court decisions. Youngkin’s office largely emphasized the faith-based exemptions in the bill allowing clergy and religious organizations to decline to perform same-sex weddings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The bill adds First Amendment protections to the code of Virginia,” said Youngkin spokesman Christian Martinez. “Religious organizations and members of the clergy acting in their religious capacity now have the authority to decline to officiate marriage ceremonies that violate their conscience. The remainder of the bill deals with the ministerial duties of issuing licenses, which is already guided by federal preemption.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The law enacted by Youngkin states that in Virginia, marriage licenses must be issued to any two people seeking a “lawful marriage” regardless of gender, race or sex. That is already the practice in Virginia due to a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide, but the new law would take on greater weight if the high court reverses itself, since it is currently superseded by Virginia’s 2006 constitutional ban on same-sex marriage. Democrats are also working to repeal that legally moot ban within the next few years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Equality Virginia, a LGBTQ rights advocacy group, applauded Youngkin’s decision Friday night.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Two years into his term, Governor Youngkin has shown leadership and inclusivity, and has finally listened to his constituents with his signing of HB174,” said Narissa Rahaman, Equality Virginia’s executive director.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin didn’t look so favorably on two bills dealing with gun safety. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He vetoed legislation that would have tightened rules requiring people credibly accused or convicted of domestic abuse to give up any firearms. The proposal would have barred those gun owners from giving the weapons to someone else in the same household or anyone under 21. In his veto statement, Youngkin said he took issue with the “arbitrary age prohibition” and the potential for “disarming individuals not subject to a court order.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Make no mistake, Virginia should ensure that domestic abusers are dealt with appropriately, and those who resort to illegal firearm use, especially, should face severe and harsh punishments,” Youngkin said in his veto. “The legislation fails to achieve its intended purpose and is unnecessary.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the bill’s sponsors, Sen. Barbara Favola, D-Arlington, said the governor’s veto was a setback for women.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am deeply disappointed that given the opportunity to better protect innocent lives, uphold our laws against domestic abusers, and lift up families, this governor has instead turned his back,” Favola said in a news release Saturday. “Women deserve better.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The governor also recommended major changes to a bill that would have required school boards to notify parents about gun risks and safe storage laws. Youngkin’s recommended </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+amd+HB498AG" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">amendments</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would broaden the notification to include a wide variety of parental “rights” and “responsibilities,” including the ability to shield children from sexually explicit material in schools and the duty to keep kids safe from drugs. His amendments also require the bill to be reapproved in 2025 before it can go into effect.</span></p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Democrats propose tweaks to parental notification law, citing censorship concerns&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/02/22/democrats-propose-tweaks-to-parental-notification-law-to-discourage-school-library-censorship/embed/#?secret=gK4uRAHuLF#?secret=qXWPDwsVBm" data-secret="qXWPDwsVBm" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The governor vetoed </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/02/22/democrats-propose-tweaks-to-parental-notification-law-to-discourage-school-library-censorship/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a bill meant to inhibit book banning by local school officials</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, saying its proposed anti-censorship language could “cause confusion among school administrators, divisions, parents, and students.” In 2022, the General Assembly passed a law requiring schools to notify parents of sexually explicit reading assignments. The law didn’t deal specifically with libraries, and Democrats have denounced local school boards that have used the notification rule as a pretext to scour library shelves and remove dozens of books at once.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s moves on gun bills are a preview of what could be many more vetoes to come on dozens of gun control measures Democrats sent to him this year, including legislation restricting access to assault-style weapons.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On reproductive rights, Youngkin proposed a religious exemption to </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/contraception-coverage-bills-head-to-youngkins-desk/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a bill that would require health insurers to cover contraception</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The governor’s office said the exemption would “ensure that non-governmental plan sponsors with sincerely held religious or moral beliefs are not required to provide insurance coverage for contraception in accordance with existing federal and state law.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The House of Delegates Democratic Caucus blasted Youngkin’s action on the contraception bill, saying it “only serves the purpose of adding additional barriers to access for women across Virginia who are more than capable of deciding when and how they want to start a family.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin also vetoed a bill that </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/02/01/va-house-passes-bill-lifting-prohibition-on-for-profit-surrogacy-brokers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">would have repealed a longstanding prohibition on for-profit surrogacy brokers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who connect would-be parents with women willing to carry a pregnancy on their behalf. Proponents of the measure said the restriction has had no real-world effect and only creates a chilling effect around surrogacy by threatening criminal penalties. Youngkin said he was concerned that letting a stronger profit motive into the process could lead to “coercion and abuse of surrogates.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The free market is a powerful and significant force for raising individuals out of poverty, but we</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">must recognize that not all areas are suitable for commodification,” Youngkin said in the veto. “Surrogacy involves a profound bond between a mother and her child, a relationship that transcends monetary transactions.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On election policy, Youngkin vetoed a bill meant to force his administration to reenter the multi-state Electronic Registration Information Center (ERIC), a previously uncontroversial voter roll maintenance program that has come under fire from conservative “election integrity” activists. Youngkin insisted </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/virginia-joins-republican-states-pulling-out-of-multi-state-voter-list-program/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the decision to withdraw Virginia from the program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was based on legitimate concerns about its management and decisions to share voter data with outside groups.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I have been explicitly clear about my affirmation of the legitimacy of our elections,” Youngkin said. “My focus is safeguarding Virginians&#8217; private information and continuously improving an efficient, cost-effective voter registration system.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In its statement released Saturday morning, the House Democratic Caucus said Youngkin’s initial actions show the “true colors of Virginia Republicans” and the “dangerous MAGA agenda” Democrats were elected to stop.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The governor’s choice to veto and offer overzealous amendments to these critical pieces of legislation will do nothing more than ensure that guns are left in the hands of domestic abusers, restrict access to reproductive healthcare and threaten our democracy and our voting rights,” the caucus said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s moves Friday night offered little hope for marijuana legalization proponents hoping the governor might get on board with a proposal to allow retail weed sales in the state. He instead vetoed a more minor bill that would have clarified in the law that marijuana use and possession isn’t necessarily evidence of child abuse or neglect. The governor suggested the bill went too far and minimized the dangers of keeping and using drugs around kids.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The proposal undermines the tangible link between substance use and harm to children,” Youngkin said.</span></p>

(Scott Elmquist/Style Weekly)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hopes that Gov. Glenn Youngkin might sign a bill legalizing retail sales of marijuana in Virginia faded fast this week as Democrats blocked one of the governor’s top priorities: the plan to bring a professional sports arena to Northern Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As recently as Wednesday, according to multiple Capitol sources, the cannabis bill was being raised in closed-door budget talks with the governor as one of several Democratic priorities that could conceivably have been part of a package deal with the arena.</span></p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Youngkin: legislature flouting ‘broad bipartisan support’ in excluding arena from state budget&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/03/07/youngkin-legislature-flouting-broad-bipartisan-support-in-excluding-arena-from-state-budget/embed/#?secret=eYZ9nP8W82#?secret=u14N2kGcdV" data-secret="u14N2kGcdV" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the prospects of a grand policy bargain appeared to collapse Thursday as Democrats revealed a budget proposal without Youngkin’s arena plan, prompting the governor to say he was less inclined to look favorably on Democratic priorities. In a news conference on the Capitol steps, Youngkin said the arena deal Senate Democrats rejected involved up to 30,000 jobs and $12 billion in economic impact.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And, bluntly, you want to talk about putting a cannabis shop on every corner?” Youngkin said. “I don’t quite get it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The governor said several other topics had been part of an “overall discussion” with Democrats. However, he suggested the rejection of an economic development project that could’ve drawn bipartisan support isn’t going to make him more likely to approve bills that passed mostly along party lines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think this really sets us meaningfully back,” Youngkin said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Paul Krizek, D-Alexandria, a key sponsor of the marijuana proposal, said hopes for the bill were not high.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As those great philosophers Tommy Chong and Cheech Marin would say, ‘It’s up in smoke,’” Krizek said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, pointed to Youngkin’s comments on cannabis as evidence that it’s the governor who’s refusing to budge on issues that have popular support.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He just basically flat out said one of our biggest priorities he’s not willing to consider,” Surovell said. “This governor wants to set the terms of every single negotiation as if he’s the sole arbiter of what’s reasonable in a bipartisan environment. That’s just not how it works. … If he wants something, he’s got to give us something.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin can’t veto the marijuana bill immediately, because it technically hasn’t been sent to him yet. After this week’s developments, it may only be a matter of time. Youngkin said again Thursday that he doesn’t have “any interest” in greenlighting a retail marijuana market during his four-year term.</span></p>

Glenn Youngkin speaking with reporters outside the Capitol Building on March 7, 2024. (Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He has just under two years remaining, and if Democrats retake the Executive Mansion in 2025, the bill sent to Youngkin this year could potentially be the starting point for future legislative efforts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proponents of the bill say it’s the most serious effort yet to build a fair retail market that gives big cannabis companies, small entrepreneurs, farmers and communities most impacted by the war on drugs a chance at new business opportunities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though many Virginia conservatives still balk at anything that could be construed as promoting drug use, the bill going to the governor mostly builds on policy decisions that have already been made to allow medical marijuana, decriminalize possession of small amounts of pot and let weed enthusiasts grow up to four plants at home. All those developments have already added up to a much less punitive approach to cannabis, but the state still has no way for people to legally purchase marijuana without a medical reason.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think this bill on its merits can stand and can get very broad support once people fully understand what’s in it,” said Greg Habeeb, a former Republican delegate who now lobbies for the Virginia Cannabis Association. “It’s about licensing sellers. It’s about testing products. It’s about taxing sales.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposal sets May 1, 2025, as the start date for recreational marijuana sales, but the state would start accepting dispensary applications this September.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new retail market would be overseen by the Cannabis Control Authority, a relatively new agency that currently regulates Virginia’s medical marijuana program and runs a variety of public awareness campaigns on marijuana and its effects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When dealing with cannabis legalization in the past, Democrats and progressive activists have wrestled with how to create a new industry while making amends to Black communities that were disproportionately impacted by criminalization and the war on drugs. The approved bill scrubs mentions of diversity, equity and inclusion, language Youngkin has tried to eliminate elsewhere in state government. It instead focuses on race-neutral “micro business” provisions designed to help “historically economically disadvantaged communities” see financial benefits from marijuana legalization.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chelsea Higgs Wise, executive director of the nonprofit group Marijuana Justice, said the pending bill is “the best proposal that we’ve had since the legalization conversation started in 2021.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are pretty excited about the final product, said Higgs Wise, whose group has worked to ensure marijuana legalization includes provisions aimed at rectifying past harms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To that end, the General Assembly passed separate legislation that would give nearly 800 people incarcerated for marijuana-related felonies an opportunity to have their sentences reduced in light of the state’s move toward legalization. More than 1,200 people on probation or parole for marijuana offenses would also have a chance to reduce the length of their post-release supervision, according to state officials’ analysis of the bill’s impact.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keeping those bills separate could theoretically make it easier for Youngkin to approve the retail sales bill without having to compromise on his tough-on-crime message that calls for stiffer criminal penalties for dealers of harder drugs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another bill sent to Youngkin would specify that simply possessing or consuming legal marijuana products no longer counts as abuse or neglect for the purposes of child custody and visitation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Senate version of that bill is sponsored by Sen. Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, Youngkin’s chief antagonist on the arena proposal. The House version was sent to the governor on a seven-day timeline, meaning he has until midnight Friday to act on it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump handily defeated former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, his last rival still standing in what was once a sizable GOP field. Several other Republican candidates qualified to appear on Virginia’s ballot but had already dropped out before Tuesday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden also faced light competition, beating Minnesota Rep. Dean Phillips and activist Marianne Williamson in a contest the Associated Press called just nine minutes after the polls closed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Virginia Democrats sent a loud and clear message: we are unequivocally behind President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. Virginia Republicans did the same as it pertains to Donald Trump,” Democratic Party of Virginia Chairwoman Susan Swecker said in a statement Tuesday evening, adding that the Virginia GOP had showed its fealty to a “destitute bigot.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s well-educated suburbs and potential for crossover votes under the state’s open primary system appeared to give Haley a slim chance of competing with Trump. But the early results showed she wasn’t doing well enough in those areas to counter the GOP frontrunner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Time for Nikki Haley to drop out so we can focus on getting rid of Joe Biden!” Trump-supporting state Sen. John McGuire, R-Goochland, said on social media shortly after the race was called.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though Virginia showed its swingy side in 2021 with the election of Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin, the state has leaned solidly Democratic in higher-turnout presidential years. In 2020, Biden beat Trump in Virginia by more than 10 percentage points. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite some unfounded fraud claims from Trump supporters, a recently dropped criminal case involving the 2020 election revealed that the size of Biden’s victory was slightly understated due to </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/2020-election-error-in-prince-william-county-benefited-trump-officials-reveal/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">counting errors in Prince William County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> affecting a few thousand ballots.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state hasn’t voted for a Republican presidential candidate since 2004, when former President George W. Bush defeated John Kerry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several polls have shown Biden well ahead of Trump in Virginia, but not by the double-digit margins of 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia’s other statewide contest this year, U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., is seeking a third term in office. </span><a href="https://www.vpap.org/elections/us-senate/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eight Republicans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are expected to compete in a June primary for the chance to run against Kaine, but the GOP doesn’t appear to be treating the Virginia seat as a major pickup opportunity. Kaine comfortably defeated former Gov. George Allen in 2012 and won a blowout victory over hard-right Republican Corey Stewart in 2018.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020, when Virginia also had a U.S. Senate race alongside Trump on the ballot, U.S. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., beat Republican Daniel Gade by 12 percentage points.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are considered heavy favorites to win their respective contests and the Virginia delegates at stake.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump is still facing active competition from former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, but the other four GOP candidates who qualified to be on the primary ballot in Virginia — Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, businessman Vivek Ramaswamy, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Texas pastor Ryan Binkley — have already dropped out of the race. Trump has defeated Haley in almost every state, but she has promised to stay in the running until at least Super Tuesday, when voters in more than a dozen states and American Samoa are casting ballots.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Virginia’s Democratic ballot, Biden’s name will appear alongside Minnesota Rep. Dean Phillips and activist Marianne Williamson, neither of whom appear to be seriously threatening the incumbent’s bid for a second term.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because Virginia doesn’t register voters by party, primary participants can choose to receive a Republican or Democratic ballot. Voters cannot cast ballots in both primaries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All voters are asked to present identification to vote; find a list of acceptable forms of I.D.</span><a href="https://www.elections.virginia.gov/media/formswarehouse/voter-id/outreach-materials/documents/Voter-Identification-Chart---Revised-10.2022.pdf" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If you don’t have an acceptable form of I.D., you can still vote by either signing an affirmation of identity form and then using a regular ballot or completing a provisional ballot;</span><a href="https://www.elections.virginia.gov/casting-a-ballot/in-person-voting/#provisional-ballot" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">here’s how that process works</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia now has a same-day registration process allowing those who didn’t register in advance to cast a provisional ballot on the day of an election. However, those ballots aren’t counted immediately. They are only counted if officials can confirm the voter’s eligibility in a verification process that occurs shortly after Election Day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voters under 18 are allowed to participate in the presidential primaries as long as they turn 18 before the Nov. 5 general election.</span></p>

Glenn Youngkin recognizing guests at the 2024 State of the Commonwealth Address at the State Capitol in Richmond. (Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Glenn Youngkin has until the end of this week to act on dozens of bills the Democratic-controlled General Assembly sent to him on a faster-than-normal timeline.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The governor has until 11:59 p.m. Friday to take action on a batch of more than 80 bills that includes measures to preserve same-sex marriage, restore Virginia’s participation in the multi-state ERIC voter roll maintenance program, ban legacy admissions preferences at public colleges and universities and require local school boards to inform parents about the importance of safe gun storage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At a news conference Monday morning, Democratic leaders said sending the bills to the governor under a shorter timeline will force Youngkin to reveal where he stands on issues he’s been able to avoid for his first two years in office.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For the last two years he’s had a Republican-controlled House basically killing everything that we send over from the Senate,” said Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax. “I think in the next seven days, with the seven-day bills that we just sent him, Virginians are going to finally find out where he stands. … I think the next seven days are going to say a lot about the next two years.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Governors typically have 30 days to review legislation passed by the General Assembly, but the exact timing depends on when bills are formally sent from the legislative branch to the executive branch. If the General Assembly sends bills to the governor before the final week of the session, the shorter, seven-day deadline applies. The legislature is scheduled to adjourn on Saturday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The package of legislation sent to the governor last week also includes measures to require health insurance companies to cover contraception and clarify an existing law on sexually explicit school books with the goal of limiting local school boards’ ability to engage in large-scale “censorship” of books.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another bill dealing with gun policy tightens the rules for requiring potential domestic abusers to relinquish any firearms they have after being subjected to a protective order or convicted of assaulting a family or household member. The proposal would prohibit such gun owners from handing over firearms to someone in the same household or to someone who is under 21 and add new rules for informing law enforcement about how guns were surrendered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not all of the bills deal with hot-button topics. Many were sponsored by Republicans or passed with broad bipartisan support.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement Monday, Youngkin’s office indicated the governor’s response to bills Democrats send him will depend partly on how Democrats act on his priorities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The governor is reviewing the legislation that has been delivered to his desk, as he continues to watch how the General Assembly chooses to act on other important priorities,” said Youngkin spokesman Christian Martinez.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin is trying to shore up support for a pending deal to bring a professional sports arena to Northern Virginia that would be home to both the Washington Wizards and Washington Capitals, a potentially legacy-defining project that has run into strong local and legislative opposition. Democrats also stripped Youngkin’s proposal for more tax cuts out of their budget plans, but negotiations on the arena project and the budget are ongoing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Monday’s news conference, Democratic leaders offered little in the way of updates on where the budget talks between the House, Senate and governor stand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s a process,” said House Majority Leader Charniele Herring, D-Alexandria. “There’s no magic plan.”</span></p>
<p><em>This story has been updated to clarify the legislation dealing with relinquishment of firearms by people issued a protective order or convicted of asssaulting a family or household member.</em></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The votes were a major victory for a large coalition of gas station and restaurant owners, who said the ban had deprived them of badly needed gambling revenue that they believe helped many small businesses survive the COVID-19 pandemic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Explaining the final bill on the Senate floor, Sen. Aaron Rouse, D-Virginia Beach, described it as a compromise that leaves no one fully happy but still achieves the goal to “help small businesses and optimize revenue for the commonwealth.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposal passed the Senate 31-9 and cleared the House of Delegates by a narrower vote of 49-43.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislation now heads to Gov. Glenn Youngkin, whose office previously said he had </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/02/26/youngkin-has-serious-concerns-about-both-skill-game-bills/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“serious concerns” </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">about the pending skill game legislation but has not yet weighed in on the final version approved Friday.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="EVxzrnFbWF"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/02/26/youngkin-has-serious-concerns-about-both-skill-game-bills/">Youngkin has ‘serious concerns’ about both skill game bills</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Youngkin has ‘serious concerns’ about both skill game bills&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/02/26/youngkin-has-serious-concerns-about-both-skill-game-bills/embed/#?secret=s9AVJiQbbo#?secret=EVxzrnFbWF" data-secret="EVxzrnFbWF" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This skill game bill will allow Virginia’s small business owners, many of whom are first-generation Americans, to keep their doors open, their employees working, and continue contributing to the community,” restaurant owner Rich Kelly, president of the pro-skill game Virginia Merchants and Amusements Coalition, said in a news release applauding Friday’s votes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislation includes a 25% tax rate on the machines’ gross receipts, and would allow up to four gambling machines in business licensed by the Virginia Alcoholic Beverage and Control Authority and up to 10 machines in truck stops.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Skill games could be reactivated on July 1, according to the terms of the bill, under a temporary licensing system overseen by ABC that would then transition to a fuller regulatory structure under the Virginia Lottery in 2027.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The measure does not require voters to approve skill games in their communities through ballot referendums, a rule that was imposed on casinos and Rosie’s gambling facilities tied to horse racing. Local governments also would not have the ability to ban skill games if they so choose.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the proposal passed the House, Del. Terry Kilgore, R-Scott, noted that local referendums weren’t required for sports betting, which mostly takes place on digital apps.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We only did that where there was infrastructure that would need to be addressed in local communities such as roads and highways and things of that nature,” Kilgore said, suggesting referendums were more about land use than gambling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Lottery, which didn’t present infrastructure concerns, was approved via a statewide voter referendum in 1987.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill’s passage is also a win for Pace-O-Matic, a prominent skill game company based in Georgia that mounted a vigorous lobbying effort to keep its machines legal and made substantial political donations to General Assembly leaders in both parties.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a letter to Youngkin urging him to veto the bill, a group of Virginia pastors organized by a group called Faith Wins America said supporters of the bill were glossing over the reality that any extra money going to small business owners is coming right out of the pockets of other Virginians.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s the wealthy out-of-state corporations behind these machines who stand to benefit, preying on vulnerable communities and perpetuating cycles of poverty and despair,” the faith group wrote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Senate and House had passed dramatically different versions of the legislation earlier in the session. In an unusually short turnaround, the small group of lawmakers appointed Wednesday evening to work out the differences in those bills finished that job in a little more than a day. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That group </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/02/29/virginia-senator-who-does-legal-work-for-skill-game-industry-will-help-write-skill-game-bill/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">included Sen. Bill Stanley</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, R-Franklin, a lawyer who has worked closely with Pace-O-Matic but was assured by the state’s ethics council that his ties to the company didn’t create an impermissible conflict of interest. Stanley also has legal and business ties to Hermie Sadler, a Southside Virginia truck stop owner who hosts skill games and sued the state over the ban that took effect in 2021. The skill game bill that originally passed the Senate only allowed seven games at truck stops, but that number was bumped to 10 in the final version.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That change drew the notice of Del. Barry Knight, R-Virginia Beach, who said the bill “wasn’t ready for prime time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“On the House version you were allowed five of these machines at a truck stop. In the Senate version, seven,” Knight said. “This compromise now brings us to ten. That looks like it’s outside of the scope of a compromise.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knight also questioned how lawmakers could explain to their constituents that they left no ability for local decision-making.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Can you envision yourself going back and someone asking you: ‘You voted for this, why didn’t you allow me to have input?’’” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pro-skill game lawmakers said the bill struck a balance between allowing financialopportunities for business owners with the need to effectively regulate the machines, prevent underage play and mitigate the harms of gambling addiction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Sam Rasoul, D-Roanoke, said he didn’t like the final bill but was voting for it because he saw an “equity issue” with small businesses being shut out of the state’s emerging gambling market. He said the tax revenue shouldn’t be the state’s top concern given the broader impact gambling can have, particularly on young people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Vice taxes are not the way to pay for the most important things in our society,” Rasoul said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The final bill doesn’t include the player card system envisioned by the House that would’ve required players to verify their identity before accessing skill machines. However, it includes criminal penalties for any business that “knowingly” allows those under 21 to play and some provisions meant to mitigate gambling addiction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill calls for a “voluntary exclusion program” allowing people with gambling problems to ban themselves from playing skill games. It’s unclear how it would apply to the machines without any mechanism for verifying players’ identities and checking them against the list of people who asked to be excluded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The speed with which the newly written bill was being put to a vote Friday drew opposition from at least one lawmaker in the Senate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. David Suetterlein, R-Roanoke, said the body should be given at least some time to read what it was about to vote on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t know why we’re doing conference reports on Friday when we have a full docket of bills and we also have judicial interviews,” Suetterlein said. “I think it makes sense that we allow these conference reports to be out here and us [to] be able to look at them instead of running so quickly.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Senate agreed to a temporary delay but moved forward with the Friday vote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In another sign speed was a priority for the bill’s backers, Del. Cliff Hayes, D-Chesapeake, the lead sponsor of the legislation in the House, was absent from the Capitol Friday and unable to vote on a major piece of legislation he’s been working on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kilgore said Hayes had asked him to present the bill instead.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“‘I know he’s disappointed because he’s worked so hard on this issue,” Kilgore said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The governor will now sign the bill, veto it or suggest amendments prior to the General Assembly’s April 17 reconvened session.</span></p>

Bill Stanley, R-Franklin, sparred with casino lobbyists during an initial hearing on a bill to legalize skill games in Virginia. (Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury).</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A state senator whose law firm has helped the skill game industry fight Virginia’s ban on the <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/02/05/virginia-explained-the-never-ending-battle-over-skill-games/">slots-like gambling machines</a> is among the handful of senators picked to write legislation behind closed doors that could determine whether the industry remains profitable or ceases to exist in the state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many members of the Virginia General Assembly are lawyers, and it’s not uncommon for them to vote on legislation that could conceivably impact a client.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Glancing associations aren’t usually enough to trigger Virginia’s conflict of interest laws, which are meant to prevent elected officials from taking public actions that benefit their private interests. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the professional connection Sen. Bill Stanley, R-Franklin, has to Georgia-based skill game company Pace-O-Matic is unusually direct, touching on his work as a private attorney, his interest in car racing and the political punditry he offers in podcast form. Pace-O-Matic has lobbied heavily for the bill Stanley will now help finalize in the last week of the session.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an interview Thursday, Stanley said the Virginia Conflict of Interest and Ethics Advisory Council determined his ties to Pace-O-Matic don’t amount to a legal conflict.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;They found that there was no conflict because I don&#8217;t own Pace-O-Matic,” Stanley said. “I don&#8217;t own one of these skill games. And I don&#8217;t own a convenience store that has a skill game in it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stanley and his firm worked with Pace-O-Matic on a lawsuit seeking to overturn the previous ban passed by his General Assembly colleagues, a legal challenge that bought skill game companies nearly two years of revenue with no taxation and regulation before the ban was reinstated last year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pace-O-Matic also </span><a href="https://www.paceomatic.com/news/sadler-stanley-pivot-into-racing-team-endeavor" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sponsors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a racing team partnership between Stanley and former NASCAR driver Hermie Sadler, who has hosted skill games at his Southside Virginia truck stop and served as a plaintiff in the lawsuit trying to keep them legal. The company also sponsors the “Leaning Right and Turning Left” podcast Stanley hosts with Sadler. Fliers promoting that podcast are laid out on the reception desk outside Stanley’s General Assembly Building office and include the phrase “Powered by Pace-O-Matic.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asked if he remains retained by Pace-O-Matic and Sadler today, Stanley said, “Of course.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I represent them. I give them advice,” Stanley said. “That’s what lawyers do.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those associations haven’t led Stanley to abstain from voting on skill games and didn’t stop Senate leaders from picking him as one of three senators who will work out the fine print of a proposal to tax and regulate skill games instead of banning them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting the bill passed is critical to Pace-O-Matic’s continued business in Virginia. Its failure would mean the company would have to pack up thousands of skill machines that are currently deactivated due to their illegal status. Its passage would allow the machines to be turned back on and start making money again, but the bill’s specifics could determine exactly how profitable they could be.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Supporters of the bill have called the machines a critical revenue opportunity for the state and the small businesses that host them. Opponents say allowing gambling to spread deeper into Virginia neighborhoods could backfire by exacerbating crime and gambling addiction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Much work remains to be done on the bill as the Senate and the House of Delegates attempt to reconcile two dramatically different pieces of legislation. The House bill has a higher tax rate, stiffer state oversight and more detailed regulations for addressing gambling addiction and preventing those under 21 from playing the machines. The Senate bill has lighter regulations but would enable small businesses that host skill games to start getting revenue from them again with fewer obstacles and delays.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The differences between the two bills are going to be worked out in what’s known as a conference committee, which involves a small group of senators and delegates who usually meet privately to try to get legislation over the finish line.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an interview Thursday, Stanley insisted he didn’t ask to be put on the conference committee and said the Ethics Council had cleared him to work on skill game legislation the same as any other legislator. He said his interest in skill games arose from a sincere belief that small business owners should have a shot at taking in gambling revenue instead of allowing it all to flow to big casino or horse-racing companies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m representing the public interest,” Stanley said, adding that his experience as a lawyer “helps me make a determination about what’s best for the commonwealth of Virginia.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The senator allowed the Mercury to view the guidance he received from the Ethics Council on the condition that it not be published because much of the advisory body’s work is considered confidential.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When asked for a copy of the document, G. Stewart Petoe, the executive director of the Ethics Council, said all requests for ethics guidance are “strictly confidential.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We will not even confirm or deny that anyone has approached the Council for guidance,” Petoe said in an email.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Ethics Council wasn’t envisioned as an independent check on the legislature empowered to police the behavior of General Assembly members. By law, any ethics guidance it gives is exempt from transparency rules. The council’s guidance can prevent General Assembly members from being prosecuted or disciplined as long as they make a “good faith” effort to follow it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title30/chapter13/section30-101/#:~:text=%22Advisory%20agency%22%20means%20any%20board,consulting%20with%20a%20governmental%20agency." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ethics laws</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> prohibit members of the General Assembly from taking part in any official action in which they have a “personal interest.” The definition of personal interest includes compensation from a business that exceeds $5,000. Though lawmakers have to disclose sources of income, General Assembly members with law firms aren’t required to disclose how much they were paid by specific clients.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The law also says a conflict doesn’t exist if a legislator’s interest in a matter considered by the General Assembly isn’t “substantially different” from that of “the general public” or a broader “class or group” of businesses that could potentially be impacted. In other words, if Stanley only works with one of several skill game companies operating in Virginia, that could be enough to clear him under the “substantially different” rule.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the skill game legalization bill affects multiple companies and the public, roughly half the skill machines in Virginia are believed to be Pace-O-Matic machines, according to the limited state data available.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stanley said he had previously abstained from gambling votes and opposes gambling generally, but was “surprised” to learn that the Ethics Council found he could act freely on skill game legislation because there was no conflict.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I was trying to actually confirm that what I was trying to do was right, by abstaining and staying out,” Stanley said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pace-O-Matic wasn’t a plaintiff in the lawsuit Stanley was involved in. But a different law firm that represents the company, Womble Bond Dickinson, was working in tandem with Stanley on the legal effort. </span><a href="https://www.paceomatic.com/news/press-release-from-stanley-law-group" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Press releases</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> issued by Stanley’s law firm about the case were reposted on Pace-O-Matic’s company website. Stanley said he provides “legal counseling services” to Pace-O-Matic on a variety of fronts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A representative for Pace-O-Matic declined to comment on Stanley’s selection for the conference committee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conference committees often work out minor differences of opinion, but that’s not the case with the skill game legislation. Lawmakers still have to work out what kind of taxes and fees Pace-O-Matic and other companies will have to pay to operate skill games in Virginia. They have to decide whether local voters and local governments should have to approve skill games before they can operate in any particular city or county. They also have to figure out how the basic financial oversight should work, including the question of whether skill game companies should be allowed to self-report how much money they make or if regulators should get real-time access to machine data to ensure those numbers can’t be fudged.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an interview, Sen. Creigh Deeds, D-Charlottesville, said he appointed Stanley as a conferee because he “knew more about” skill games than others. Deeds said he didn’t consider Stanley’s work with Pace-O-Matic to be a conflict of interest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I know Stanley,” Deeds said. “I trust him.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other senators picked as conferees on the skill game bill are Sens. Aaron Rouse, D-Virginia Beach, and Mamie Locke, D-Hampton. On the House side, the conferees are Dels. Cliff Hayes, D-Chesapeake, Terry Kilgore, R-Scott, and Paul Krizek, D-Fairfax.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rouse, Hayes and Kilgore are all sponsors of the skill game legalization bill supported by Pace-O-Matic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Krizek, a skill game critic, dramatically rewrote the House version of the bill to include tougher regulations than what the industry proposed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stanley said he intends to bring his “legal knowledge” to help the group create a bill that can win wide support in the General Assembly and the signature of Gov. Glenn Youngkin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I would vote for a bill that would stop gambling in Virginia tomorrow. But the door&#8217;s open,” Stanley said. “So what I wanted to make sure was that the local small business owner in Virginia could participate in it. That&#8217;s fairness. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m doing anything untoward or unethical.&#8221;</span></p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without taking a recorded vote, a Virginia House of Delegates committee on Wednesday again blocked legislation that would bring the state in line with the rest of the country by banning the personal use of campaign funds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By a voice vote, the House Appropriations Committee chose to continue the bill until the 2025 General Assembly session.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It is our hope that during the course of the 2025 session that both Senator Boysko and Delegate Simon will be able to come back to us and bring us a piece of legislation that not only do I want to see passed out but the speaker would like to see passed out as well,” said House Appropriations Chairman Luke Torian, D-Prince William.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was referring to Sen. Jennifer Boysko, D-Fairfax, and Del. Marcus Simon, D-Fairfax, who were spearheading efforts to craft a law that would clarify campaign funds have to be used for legitimate political activity and cannot be used on personal expenses such as mortgage payments, school tuition, vacations, clothing and cars. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Torian’s committee did not docket Simon’s bill earlier in the session. Boysko’s bill had passed the state Senate 35-4, and Wednesday’s hearing was a do-or-die moment for her version as lawmakers prepare to wrap up the session next week.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Mark Sickles, D-Fairfax, said he would “reluctantly” second the motion to punt the bill to 2025.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposed ban, which has been blocked for years, is pitched as a basic good government measure that would prevent politicians from funding their personal lives with money given to them by corporations and wealthy donors. </span></p>
<p>Previous promises to work on the issue at a later date haven&#8217;t been borne out.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2021, the General Assembly created a special subcommittee to study campaign finance reform, and the personal use ban was considered one of its top priorities. That subcommittee </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2021/07/29/slow-start-for-virginias-campaign-finance-study-could-delay-final-report/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">barely met</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2021. The legislature re-upped it for another year, but the panel </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/12/21/virginia-subcommittee-on-campaign-finance-reform-still-failing-to-complete-only-job/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">never held a meeting in 2022</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The subcommittee — which never produced a final report — is now </span><a href="https://studies.virginiageneralassembly.gov/studies/556" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">listed as inactive.</span></a></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By law, the governor’s party controls three of the board’s five seats. Requiring four votes for decisions on future elections commissioners, the bill’s proponents argued, would encourage the board to hire an apolitical administrator instead of leaving it to the governor to appoint someone with a more partisan background.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The current system, said Del. Israel O’Quinn, R-Washington, leaves elections commissioners susceptible to political pressure from the governor who hired them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There&#8217;s no perfect way to get at this,” O’Quinn said Tuesday. “It&#8217;s been tried in many different ways, in many different times. I think this is a full faith effort to get there.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Schuyler VanValkenburg, D-Henrico, reiterated his belief that the supermajority rule was a recipe for partisan gridlock that could incentivize the minority party to block the majority from making a decision. VanValkenburg said he respects O’Quinn’s efforts on the bill and agreed to work with those interested in the issue to come up with “a better way” for the 2025 session.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But I can’t support this,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Danica Roem, D-Manassas, the lawmaker who gave O’Quinn extra time to try to salvage his bill, said she hopes that effort bears fruit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Let’s see if we can get something on this,” Roem said. “I think the idea is good.&#8221;</span></p>

(Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the Virginia General Assembly delays making decisions about how skill games should be regulated, Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s office says it has “serious concerns” about both versions of the legislation lawmakers have put forward to legalize and tax the slots-like gambling devices found in gas stations and restaurants.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The administration has serious concerns with both the House and Senate versions of the bill,” Youngkin spokesman Rob Damschen said Friday. “There are numerous issues to work through including the regulatory structure, tax rates, the number of machines, impact on the Virginia Lottery and broader public safety implications.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though Youngkin doesn’t appear to be flatly against the idea of allowing the machines to operate legally, the administration’s stance is the latest sign of how far policymakers still have to go before they arrive at a final bill. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both the House of Delegates and state Senate have passed legislation that would lift the existing ban on skill games. The House is sticking with a tougher regulatory structure and a 30% tax rate, while the Senate prefers a lighter touch and a 22% tax rate. The House bill allows up to two skill machines per convenience store and up to five per truck stop. The Senate bill allows up to three machines at convenience stores and seven at truck stops. The two bills also take dramatically different approaches to how the state would track the industry’s profits, with the House plan requiring direct access to financial data and the Senate plan allowing skill game companies to report their own numbers.</span></p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Virginia Explained: The never-ending battle over skill games&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/02/05/virginia-explained-the-never-ending-battle-over-skill-games/embed/#?secret=WvZ2waTmpo#?secret=g2AMkhNcfQ" data-secret="g2AMkhNcfQ" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pace-O-Matic, a top skill game company operating in Virginia, and a large coalition of gas station and restaurant owners have made it clear they prefer the Senate bill. But the industry’s lobbyists haven’t been specific about pieces of the House bill they oppose.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two chambers have done little — at least not publicly — to resolve the major differences between their dueling approaches. That means the two versions are likely to be combined into one bill late in the session through a conference committee, a select group of lawmakers who hold private negotiations to try to come up with consensus legislation both chambers could support.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On skill games, the conference committee wouldn’t just be resolving minor sticking points. It would be deciding fundamental aspects of what the bill does.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After nearly seven weeks of work on the proposal, it remains unclear what the tax rate on the machines would be, how many machines would be allowed in each business, what state agency would regulate them, how that regulation would work, how strict the safeguards would be to prevent gambling addiction and underage play and whether local communities would or wouldn&#8217;t have the ability to say no to skill games.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two law enforcement groups — the Virginia Police Benevolent Association and the Virginia Fraternal Order of Police — recently sent letters urging state lawmakers to oppose the legalization of skill games, arguing the machines have created confusion for police officers and invite loitering and crime.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Allowing these companies in now, after they have avoided the law and acted in bad faith, rewards bad actors and sets a terrible precedent for the rule of law in Virginia,” the Fraternal Order of Police said in a letter dated Monday.</span></p>
<p>The Virginia Law Enforcement Sheriffs, which represents mostly rural sheriffs that have primary law enforcement duties in their jurisdictions, took an opposing view, telling lawmakers it supports the legislation because it would give law enforcement clarity on which games are legal and which are illegal.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s position is a sign talks on the bill could stretch beyond the General Assembly’s March 9 adjournment date. If the governor doesn’t like the product sent to him, he could suggest changes the legislature would then take up at the April 17 reconvened session.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The skill game debate cuts across traditional party lines. Democrats and Republicans alike have characterized the effort to legalize them as a pro-business move that will help smaller establishments stay viable instead of letting all gambling revenue go to big casino companies. Many lawmakers have also said the machines could generate up to $200 million per year in new tax revenue that could pay for schools and other priorities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But both conservatives and progressives have spoken out against the societal harm they say will inevitably result from pushing gambling deeper and deeper into communities that already don’t have much money to lose.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead of committee hearings being used for robust discussion of how to balance those competing priorities, the meetings so far have mostly been perfunctory stops on the bill’s journey to the more private conference committee process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are several major issues lawmakers have yet to resolve.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Local control</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The House bill would require localities to expressly approve skill games through a ballot referendum or passage of a local government ordinance, a requirement similar to what Virginia requires before casinos and Rosie’s gambling facilities tied to horse racing can be built. The Senate bill doesn’t have that rule.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an interview after a committee hearing last week, Pace-O-Matic lobbyist Brian Moran would not give a direct answer when asked whether the industry coalition he’s a part of does or doesn’t support local approval for skill games.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“During the conference committee we would hope that we’d be able to achieve a result that’ll enable our small businesses to continue to operate, fair taxation, strenuous enforcement and appropriate regulation,” said Moran, who served as Virginia’s public safety secretary under former Govs. Terry McAuliffe and Ralph Northam.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other skill game supporters have been more open about their belief that it’s unworkable to let local governments and voters decide where the machines will and won’t be legal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Bill Stanley, R-Franklin, indicated local referendums shouldn’t be a part of the process because it would create an uneven playing field, with some business owners denied a revenue source available to their counterparts just across a city or county line.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you’re going to let small businesses have an opportunity, you’ve got to let all small businesses have that opportunity,” Stanley said.</span></p>

        </div>
        </a>
        
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Cliff Hayes Jr., D-Chesapeake, a supporter of legalizing skill games, said there’s been some talk of giving localities permission to opt out of the industry. But he too indicated he sees no need for local referendums because casinos are large-scale projects that involve far more complicated zoning and land use questions than allowing a few gambling machines in businesses that already exist.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These places already have customers coming to them,” Hayes said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Jeremy McPike, D-Prince William, said last week that he hopes the final bill will include “some sort of option” for local input, raising the possibility that localities with casinos may have a particular interest in wanting to block skill games. McPike, who voted for the bill, also said he wants to see fixes to “pretty loose” rules dealing with gambling addiction and underage play.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The House plan envisions a player card system that would require the industry to verify would-be players’ identity before allowing them to access the machines, a safeguard pitched as a way to block gambling addicts and people under 21. The Senate bill has no upfront ID check and looser provisions for preventing underage play and problem gambling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moran, the skill game lobbyist, also didn’t answer directly when asked where his coalition stands on player cards, saying only that the industry supports the goal of preventing minors from playing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How that is achieved, we&#8217;ll have to work through those methods,” Moran said</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Tracking the money</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under Virginia’s regulations for casinos, all traditional slot machines are required to be hooked up to a central monitoring system giving the Lottery access to real-time data on how much money is flowing through each machine and how much tax revenue state and local governments should be getting as a result. That also enables the state to ensure slot machines are giving players a fair chance and complying with rules specifying at least 84% of money wagered should go back to players.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers appear divided on whether skill games should also be hooked up to a similar central monitoring system. The House bill requires it, while the Senate bill does not, allowing the industry to report its own numbers. A </span><a href="https://jlarc.virginia.gov/pdfs/reports/Rpt565-1.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2022 review</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the General Assembly’s research arm concluded that skill games appear to have a payout percentage of roughly 77%, lower than many traditional forms of regulated gambling. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When asked whether the skill game industry opposes a central monitoring system, Moran, the Pace-O-Matic lobbyist, said rules for casino slot machines don’t always translate to skill games.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want a reporting system that achieves the same goal,” Moran said. “We want to make sure that every dime is accounted for that goes in and out of the machines.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Mysterious amendments</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an example of how legislation is often written behind closed doors, a document that appears to show suggested edits to the House version of the skill game bill has been circulating at the Capitol. But it has no markings indicating who’s pushing for the changes, and the Mercury was unable to verify its origin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The document suggests allowing skill games to operate closer to day cares and K-12 schools than what’s envisioned in the House bill, lowering the allowable distance from 2,500 feet to 1,000.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Other jurisdictions set this distance significantly lower than 2,500 feet,” the document says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Senate’s skill game bill sets no limits on how close the machines can be to schools.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another proposed change scraps the idea of an age verification device altogether, saying it would “pose a huge financial burden.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The House legislation sets a cap on businesses’ ability to reorient themselves around gambling, stating host locations can derive no more than 20% of their gross receipts from skill games. Though skill game proponents have described the machine as offering “supplemental income,” the suggested amendments would raise that cap to 50%, allowing host businesses to make half their money from the machines. The Senate bill has no such cap.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The suggested amendments also include allowing skill games in every location that possesses a charitable gaming permit. That change would presumably address concerns that skill games would harm charities that get some of their revenue from bingo, poker and other electronic machines, but it could create even more regulatory confusion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The House bill would make the Virginia Lottery the state’s skill game regulator, while the Senate would have the machines start under oversight from the Virginia Alcoholic Beverage Control Authority and eventually transition to the Lottery. Charitable gaming is currently overseen by the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, raising the possibility that a third state agency could be added to the skill game mix.</span></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Friday morning, a freshman Republican delegate voiced an unusually blunt opinion on why Virginia lawmakers are still finding it so difficult to pass a law stopping them from spending donors’ money on themselves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Acknowledging he’s still “new here,” Del. Paul Milde, R-Stafford, said he sees no reason why the General Assembly couldn’t have figured the issue out over the last decade.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The only rationale I can see for some of us resisting this after 10 years is because they want to have the flexibility to buy things that really aren&#8217;t campaign related,” Milde said during Friday’s meeting of the House Privileges and Elections Committee. “And I just can&#8217;t believe we can&#8217;t get it together on this.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Milde indicated he’s not hopeful this year’s going to be any different for legislation seeking to ban the personal use of campaign funds. But for now, the idea still has a flicker of life.</span></p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;In Virginia’s Democratic legislature, campaign finance reform bills languish without votes&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/02/13/in-virginias-democratic-legislature-campaign-finance-reform-bills-languish-without-votes/embed/#?secret=cV3jqLVrps#?secret=HOJo7wj9Ov" data-secret="HOJo7wj9Ov" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Friday, the House elections committee unanimously passed a <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB377" target="_blank">personal use bill</a> that had already cleared the Senate. However, instead of going to the House floor for a full vote, it’s going to the House Appropriations Committee, the same place a similar bill </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/02/13/in-virginias-democratic-legislature-campaign-finance-reform-bills-languish-without-votes/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">died without a hearing earlier</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the session. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several other campaign finance reform bills aimed at capping contribution sizes and preventing donations from regulated utilities have already failed, leaving the Senate’s personal use bill as the last chance for reform supporters to get a significant piece of legislation passed this year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Jennifer Boysko, D-Fairfax, asked Friday for the bill to go straight to the House floor. But the elections panel instead sent it to the budget committee, a move that complicates its path to passage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an interview Friday, Boysko said she still hopes the bill can pass and is planning to tweak it to try to boost its chances in the House Appropriations Committee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I have an amendment that I think we’ve worked out that I think will be something they will find amenable,” Boysko said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether that amendment gets heard depends on whether the committee dockets the bill as the 2024 session enters its final two weeks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want people to trust us when we ask for money,” Boysko said. “It&#8217;s a commonsense transparency bill.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Boysko’s pending amendment clarifies who would be qualified to file a complaint about alleged violations of the rule. It removes language that says complaints can only come from campaign donors or voters who would be represented by the candidate in question.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s wide-open campaign finance system allows politicians to accept unlimited donations from special interests and wealthy donors and — unlike laws at the federal level and in other states — doesn’t prohibit candidates from spending that money to cover personal expenses that have no connection to their campaigns.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Efforts to bring Virginia into alignment with the rest of the country have failed year after year as legislators have raised concerns that the proposal might backfire and open them to weaponized accusations of corruption where none exists.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Friday’s hearing, House Minority Leader Todd Gilbert, R-Shenandoah, echoed a longstanding concern from lawmakers that the line between official political use and personal use isn’t always as clear as outside observers might think. As a former speaker, Gilbert said people in leadership positions are expected to travel extensively to raise money and support other candidates’ campaigns. The precise wording of the bill, he suggested, shouldn’t be so strict that he or others would be penalized for using campaign funds to pay for parking or a hotel room while attending those types of events.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m not complaining. … I chose to do this,” said Gilbert, who voted for the bill. “But I want to make sure that I can use the natural funds that are available to support those bigger campaign activities.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Cia Price, D-Newport News, who chairs the House elections committee, reminded Gilbert that the bill allows lawmakers to seek guidance from state election officials on what would and wouldn’t count as a legitimate expense.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you did something that you received guidance for, you are covered under it,” Price said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Boysko’s bill spells out that campaign funds could not be used to pay for things like a home mortgage, clothing, cars, country club memberships, vacations, food, tuition payments and entertainment unrelated to a campaign. Mirroring federal law, it would allow elected officials to use campaign funds on “ordinary and necessary expenses incurred in connection with the duties of the individual as an office holder.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill allows campaign funds to be used for child care expenses tied to campaigning, a carveout meant to allow more working parents to run for office without upending their family finances.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The State Board of Elections would be responsible for investigating alleged violations. If a violation were to be found, the candidate would have to repay any money spent on unlawful purposes and could be fined up to $10,000 depending on the severity of the violation. The board would also have the ability to declare complaints frivolous, a finding that could allow legal action against the person who complained for “abuse of process.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Friday’s hearing, Boysko invoked the recent example of former Republican congressman George Santos, who was expelled from the U.S. House of Representatives after being accused of improperly using campaign cash to pay for luxury goods, vacations, Botox treatments and purchases on OnlyFans, an online platform for explicit content.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He spent money on spa days. On vacations. On items from luxury retailers. And rent,” Boysko said. “What is so disturbing to me, in Virginia, the vast majority of his spending currently is legal.&#8221;</span></p>

On Tuesday the Supreme Court will hear arguments concerning whether same-sex marriage is a constitutional right, with decisions expected in June. (Drew Angerer/Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During a national TV interview in 2022, Gov. Glenn Youngkin said, </span><a href="https://www.vpm.org/news/2022-07-15/politifact-va-youngkins-claim-that-virginia-protects-same-sex-marriage-is" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">inaccurately</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, that Virginia law already protects same-sex marriage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a few weeks, he’ll have to weigh in on whether it should.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Democratic-controlled General Assembly has passed legislation meant to enshrine the legality of same-sex marriage in Virginia even if the U.S. Supreme Court reverses its landmark 2015 decision that legalized marriage equality nationwide. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Virginians across the political spectrum have taken heart to see these bills receive bipartisan support in the General Assembly,” Sen. Adam Ebbin, D-Alexandria, said in a news release on the final passage of the bill he’s sponsoring. “I hope Governor Youngkin will sign this critical legislation to create state-level protections for all Virginians regardless of who they love.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s office did not take a position on the bill Wednesday, saying only that the governor “will review any legislation that comes to his desk.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The governor’s office has pointed to the Supreme Court’s 2015 Obergefell v. Hodges decision that legalized same-sex marriage in all states to bolster Youngkin’s assertion the practice is already protected in Virginia. The proposal that passed the legislature this year is meant to clear up any uncertainty about what might happen in Virginia if the Supreme Court removes that protection.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill — which picked up some Republican support on its way through the legislature but is still opposed by staunch social conservatives — says marriage licenses must be issued to any two people seeking a “lawful marriage” regardless of gender, race or sex and that Virginia will recognize such marriages as valid. The proposal includes a carveout giving clergy members and religious organizations the ability to choose not to participate in same-sex ceremonies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For now, the measure is mostly symbolic. Because the Virginia Constitution supersedes state law, Democrats are also pushing to repeal the constitutional same-sex marriage ban Virginia voters approved in 2006. That ban has been moot for nearly a decade, but it could theoretically be reactivated if the conservative-leaning Supreme Court were to revisit the question of whether same-sex marriage is a right protected by the U.S. Constitution. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020, Virginia Democrats </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2020/01/21/va-senate-votes-to-prohibit-conversion-therapy-create-transgender-school-policy-repeal-gay-marriage-ban/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">repealed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a legally defunct statutory prohibition on same-sex marriage, but they didn’t replace it with an affirmative right to marry. To repeal the constitutional ban, the General Assembly has to pass a constitutional amendment in 2025 and 2026 before the question can be put to voters in the fall of 2026.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Rozia A. Henson Jr., D-Prince William, said the legislation would “assuage concerns from the LGBTQ+ community” following the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade and </span><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/06/24/thomas-constitutional-rights-00042256" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">comments from Justice Clarence Thomas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> suggesting the court should reconsider its stance on same-sex marriage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin will have to act on all bills before the General Assembly’s April 17 reconvened session, when lawmakers return to take up the governor’s vetoes and amendments.</span></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After passing the House of Delegates 99-0, legislation that would strip future Virginia governors of their power to handpick the state’s elections commissioner ran into trouble Tuesday in a Senate committee.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB742" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which has drawn bipartisan support in the House despite being sponsored by a Republican, is the latest of several attempts to reduce the role of partisan politics in the state’s election bureaucracy. Similar efforts have failed late in previous sessions, and the new complications in the Senate highlight the complexity of trying to get partisanship out of an election system that’s inherently political.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead of the next governor being able to hire someone to lead the Virginia Department of Elections, the bill under consideration by the Democratic-controlled General Assembly would give that ability to the five-person State Board of Elections. By law, the governor’s party controls that board, but the pending legislation would require a supermajority vote (four of five members) in order to hire and fire elections commissioners.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The supermajority rule seemed to cause the most angst for Democratic senators.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Tuesday’s committee hearing, Sen. Schuyler VanValkenburg, D-Henrico, asked whether it’s realistic to expect Democrats and Republicans to agree on who should run the elections department given the threats and intimidation directed at election officials from the right. If Democrats were to retake the governor’s mansion in 2025, the bill would require at least one Republican board member to vote with the Democratic majority in order to hire or fire an elections commissioner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Why should we believe that the group that’s in the minority is going to step out?” VanValkenburg said. “If it’s a 4-1 vote to elect a commissioner, that one person in the world we’re living in now could face a lot of pressure politically and otherwise.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proponents of the bill have said the elections board, which includes ex-legislators from both parties, has worked in a mostly bipartisan manner and has a real chance of making a “consensus pick” on the next commissioner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t think it’s far-fetched to think that you could have a 5-0 vote,” said Del. Israel O’Quinn, R-Bristol, the bill’s sponsor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VanValkenburg then made a motion to kill the bill. But it was pulled back from the brink by Sen. Danica Roem, D-Manassas, who voted to keep the proposal alive and asked for it to be delayed for a week.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an interview, Roem said she wanted to give O’Quinn more time to work out any issues on the Senate side.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A bill like that that got out of the House 99-0, he’s clearly put in work for it. No question,” said Roem, who clarified she doesn’t have a yes or no position on the bill as it was presented Tuesday in the Senate Privileges and Elections Committee. “If everyone likes the idea, but they don’t like the words on the bill right now, let’s give it a little extra time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s current system of selecting an elections commissioner has often fueled complaints of politics seeping into the work of the supposedly nonpartisan elections department. As the leader of that department, the commissioner has a hand in ensuring voting laws are properly followed, maintaining accurate voter rolls, certifying voting equipment, verifying election results and overseeing the work of local election offices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Current Commissioner Susan Beals, a Republican hired by Gov. Glenn Youngkin, has testified in favor of the bill. The current five-member board, she told a House committee earlier this month, “works very well together to set policy and certify voting systems and election results.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I believe this group is most well-suited to pick the next elections commissioner of Virginia,” Beals said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lobbyist for the Virginia Registrars Association of Virginia, which represents city and county election officials across the state, also spoke in favor of the proposal, calling it “a good government bill.” The League of Women Voters of Virginia also supports the bill.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Complaints about partisan influence in the elections department have run in both directions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, Democrats accused the Youngkin administration of playing politics by erroneously </span><a href="https://www.vpm.org/news/2023-10-27/virginia-reinstate-3400-voters-accidental-purge-youngkin-election" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">removing thousands of eligible voters from the rolls</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/blog-va/virginia-joins-republican-states-pulling-out-of-multi-state-voter-list-program/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ending Virginia’s participation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a multi-state voter roll maintenance program that had come under fire from right-wing “election integrity” activists. A local GOP official also </span><a href="https://cardinalnews.org/2023/03/23/lawsuit-alleges-youngkin-pushed-dept-of-elections-to-change-a-southside-state-senate-nomination-process/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">accused Youngkin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of pressuring the department to intervene in a dispute over how Republicans would pick their nominee in a competitive state Senate race.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2016, a Republican lawmaker </span><a href="https://www.dailypress.com/2016/10/13/gop-leader-fire-virginias-elections-chief/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">called on</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> former Gov. Terry McAuliffe to fire then-Elections Commissioner Edgardo Cortes over alleged partisan bias, and a </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/government-politics/review-finds-virginia-elections-agency-had-culture-of-open-support-for-one-party-over-the/article_2878feb3-7855-5d2b-9123-97e76d43d315.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislative review</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> two years later found the department had an “environment of open support for one party over the other” during the McAuliffe years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When former Gov. Ralph Northam succeeded McAuliffe in 2018, he replaced Cortes with Chris Piper, a former campaign finance compliance specialist who had held a variety of positions in state government. Though Piper drew bipartisan praise in the role, Youngkin announced in 2022 that he wouldn’t keep his job. Piper, who also </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/01/25/youngkin-says-he-intends-to-replace-virginias-top-election-official/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">publicly advocated</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for less political influence over the commissioner position, was then replaced by Beals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill under consideration by the General Assembly, which would retain its ability to confirm or reject the commissioner’s hiring, would change the process that will greet the next governor who will take office in early 2026.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislation would allow Beals to continue in the role until June 30, 2027, a timeline that would give the next governor time to fill three of the elections board’s five seats before the board would consider a new commissioner. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under state law, the governor appoints all members of the board, with three seats reserved for members of the governor’s own party and two seats going to the party that finished second in the most recent gubernatorial election. The supermajority rule would mean the governor’s party could not use its majority control to make unilateral hiring decisions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In addition to depoliticizing the process it gives the board quite a bit of incentive to get to a consensus pick with the 2027 legislative elections and the 2028 presidential elections both coming down the pike,” O’Quinn said as he presented the bill in the House.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Past efforts to give the two major parties equal seats on the board have failed, with skeptical lawmakers warning they would lead to tied votes that would cripple the board.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under O’Quinn’s bill, if the board fails to make a bipartisan choice, the existing commissioner would be deemed reappointed subject to General Assembly confirmation. If the position became vacant, the commissioner’s duties would be handled by the department’s director of operations, who is not a political appointee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year’s bill originally failed in a House committee but was revived after O’Quinn amended it to clarify that the next commissioner decision would be made by a board shaped by whomever wins the 2025 gubernatorial election. Because board members serve staggered terms, Youngkin’s board appointees won’t immediately depart when he leaves office in early 2026.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Tuesday’s hearing, Sen. Creigh Deeds, D-Charlottesville, put the current elections commissioner on the spot by publicly asking her if she feels political pressure from Youngkin. When Beals deflected the question, Deeds asked again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Right now I’m appointed by the governor,” Beals said. “He is my boss.”</span></p>

(Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s yearslong push for tax cuts is still running up against stiff opposition in the General Assembly. His marquee proposal to bring a professional sports arena to Northern Virginia has gotten a mixed reception. And Democrats are still eager to show they’re doing more to boost funding for the state’s K-12 schools.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are not many big items the Republican governor and the Democratic legislature are going to agree on this year. But they have to reach a deal on a new, two-year budget, and the process of working out those details entered a new phase Sunday as Democratic leaders released their counterpoints to the budget Youngkin introduced late last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The complete texts of the budget bills Democrats advanced Sunday were not yet available Monday but are expected to be released this week.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some high-level priorities Democrats laid out in their initial budget remarks and presentations:</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">House and Senate split on arena, Metro funding</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The House budget includes language necessary to advance the pending economic development deal that would create a new sports arena in Alexandria that would be the home of both the Washington Wizards and Washington Capitals. Specifically, the language would create the Virginia Sports and Entertainment Authority, a new public body that would help finance and oversee the arena project.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Senate, which didn’t pass legislation that would pave the way for the deal, didn’t put the arena in its budget. That reflects the anti-arena stance taken by Sen. Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, who chairs the Senate Finance and Appropriations Committee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re not going to let billionaires build their fortunes on the backs of our taxpayers’ dollars,” Lucas </span><a href="https://x.com/SenLouiseLucas/status/1759384567750832478?s=20" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">told reporters</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after Sunday’s budget presentations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The arena deal envisions the authority issuing $2 billion in bonds to fund the project, with those bonds repaid through future revenues generated by the arena and nearby development. There is no upfront state investment in the deal, which means its inclusion in the budget doesn’t require lawmakers to majorly reallocate funds or raise taxes to pay for it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several Democratic senators from Northern Virginia have indicated they’re still open to an arena deal, but whether it makes it into the final budget will depend on whether they can come to an agreement with Youngkin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a transportation funding debate tied to the arena, the House proposed $249.5 million over the next two years for the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, which operates the Metro transit system, to address its budgetary shortfalls.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin did not propose any additional funding above what Virginia pays the authority but would allow Virginia to give more if Metro provides a corrective action plan by Nov. 30 that includes cost-cutting measures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Senate did not propose additional funding above what the state provides for the agency. Still, the upper chamber recommended leaders and the governor’s administration continue discussing financing around Metro and commuter changes post-pandemic. In addition, Senate budget writers recommended enhanced reporting and consultation requirements and temporarily lifting the cap on the allowed budget growth for the Metro system.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Tax cuts: out. Taxing digital goods and services: in.</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Youngkin told the General Assembly this January that his wide-ranging tax reform plan was “a package deal” and he was “only interested in a plan that reduces taxes for Virginians,” both the House and Senate have ignored those desires. </span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="EAvzGOW5DA"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/12/20/youngkin-budget-calls-for-income-tax-cuts-sales-tax-increases/">Youngkin budget calls for income tax cuts, sales tax increases</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Youngkin budget calls for income tax cuts, sales tax increases&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/12/20/youngkin-budget-calls-for-income-tax-cuts-sales-tax-increases/embed/#?secret=B1LW7faK6m#?secret=EAvzGOW5DA" data-secret="EAvzGOW5DA" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neither chamber’s budget proposal includes the across-the-board 12% income tax cut the governor sought or a bump in the state sales tax meant to partially offset it. On Sunday, Lucas called the cuts “not sustainable,” citing a state commission’s July findings that </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/07/10/study-finds-virginia-underfunds-k-12-schools-recommends-spending-billions-more/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia is underfunding local school districts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the House and Senate are embracing Youngkin’s push to close what he has called the Big Tech loophole by extending the sales and use tax to digital goods like software packages, digital downloads and streaming services. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“On this the governor was correct,” said House Appropriations Chairman Luke Torian, D-Prince William Sunday. “It makes no sense to pay sales tax when you buy a Blu-Ray disc but don’t pay a tax when you download the same movie from a digital retailer.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The House GOP is characterizing the rejection of Youngkin’s proposed income tax cuts as “a $1.3 billion tax hike.” And the governor has signaled he hasn’t given up on the idea: In a Sunday evening statement, he said he would be reviewing the plans “through the lens that … Virginians can’t afford another tax increase and, in fact, need additional tax relief.”  </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Big education spending</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats’ House and Senate proposals greatly increase education spending above the levels envisioned by Youngkin, which they say is needed to fill gaps in state funding to local divisions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The recent JLARC review of our funding formula demonstrated the need to modernize and update how we fund public education,” said Sen. Mamie Locke, D-Hampton, referring to the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission. “It also has become apparent that we must do more to address teacher salaries to ensure we have a high-quality system of education for our students.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both chambers are proposing incremental salary increases for teachers — 3% in the Senate and 3.375% in the House — to bring Virginia’s average teacher salary up to the national average in coming years. A House presentation Sunday specified the national average would be based on figures from the National Education Association, the primary teacher’s union in the U.S., and school divisions would have to provide at least 2% increases to access the state funding. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s plan includes a 2% salary increase for teachers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other major spending priorities include hundreds of millions extra for the state’s at-risk add-on, a bucket of money used to supplement funding to school divisions with high numbers of economically disadvantaged students. The House would put an additional $384 million toward that priority over the next two years, while the Senate would devote $200 million. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Agreement on early childhood care funding</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin made early childhood care a centerpiece of his budget proposal, calling for $412 million over the next two years for the state’s child care subsidy program to maintain current levels of care even as federal pandemic relief funds disappear. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both the House and Senate are embracing that proposal, with Locke saying Sunday the Senate “affirm[s] the funding provided in the introduced budget to support early childhood care and education and recommend[s] maintaining the current service level in the second year.” </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">A fresh push for RGGI participation</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats and Republicans have been squabbling over whether Virginia should be part of the multistate carbon market known as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, or RGGI, for years. Youngkin vowed to withdraw Virginia even before he took office and did so through regulation at the end of last year, although environmental groups are fighting the move in the courts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year’s House budget would direct the state to rejoin RGGI and projects $100 million in revenues from participation over the biennium. While Lucas has said the Senate budget doesn’t include that language, the chamber spent much of the past two years defending Virginia’s participation as a “brick wall” issue. </span></p>

But they’re not ready to pass new laws on the topic just yet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Monday, a Democratic-led House of Delegates subcommittee voted to delay action on a Democratic state senator’s </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB359" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">proposal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to prohibit social media companies from using “addictive” feeds to encourage kids under 18 to endlessly scroll through videos and other content served up via algorithms designed to capture attention.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill had passed the Virginia Senate unanimously, but the House Communications Subcommittee voted 9-1 to send it to the legislature’s Joint Commission on Technology and Science for more study. Del. Holly Seibold, D-Fairfax, called the proposal “a great bill” but said it needed a closer look “along with all other social media concerns.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The move came after representatives for Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, and other technology companies said the proposed bill was so vague they wouldn’t be able to comply with it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the House subcommittee hearing, Sen. Schuyler VanValkenburg, D-Henrico, said he found it “kind of baffling” that social media companies claimed to not understand what would be expected of them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I mean, come on,” VanValkenburg said. “All they have to do is turn off the addictive algorithm that makes it so that the nonstop stuff keeps going.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Glenn Youngkin has made safeguarding children from the harms of social media </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/08/08/at-parent-focused-event-youngkin-takes-aim-at-social-medias-destructive-influence/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a major talking point</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In his speech to the General Assembly last month, the governor asked lawmakers to send him a bill “that empowers parents to protect their children and prohibits tech companies from selling the data of children under the age of 18.” Several Republican lawmakers introduced bills on the topic this year, but they too failed to advance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With broad, bipartisan support in the Senate, VanValkenburg’s narrower social media bill seemed to have better odds of passage since Democrats control both legislative chambers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A high school teacher who said he’s seen firsthand how social media can impact teenagers’ schoolwork and mental health, VanValkenburg argued his bill wouldn’t impose sweeping new limits on minors’ access to social media or their ability to see content from friends or accounts they choose to follow. Instead, he said, the bill deals with just “one thing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That one thing is about a minor being on the phone and just staring at it nonstop because they keep getting content pumped to them,” the senator said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislation would have prevented social media platforms from serving an “addictive feed” to users known to be under 18 without parental consent. The definition of addictive feed would still allow minors to see content they have “expressly and unambiguously requested.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to tech companies, the bill wasn’t so simple.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eric Link, a lobbyist for the Northern Virginia Technology Council — whose members include Meta and Google — said it wasn’t clear what “unambiguous” meant because it wasn’t defined in the bill. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We don&#8217;t argue about the policy goals of this bill,” Link told the House subcommittee. “But we do argue about our ability to comply with it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a letter raising concerns about the bill, Meta said it could require all new users of social media platforms to share sensitive personal information in order to verify their identity and age. The company said Instagram already includes several features designed to encourage teens to take breaks after scrolling the app for long periods. A more effective solution to the issue, the company said, is federal legislation requiring parental approval whenever kids under 16 attempt to download products from app stores.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While we acknowledge the underlying intent of Senate Bill 359, we believe this bill, as </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">currently drafted, fails to create robust, industry-wide standards that help Virginia </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">parents and teens manage their online activity,” Meta Public Policy Manager Beauclarine Thomas said in the letter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VanValkenburg </span><a href="https://x.com/ScVanValkenburg/status/1759592906006962439?s=20" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> he’ll work with the technology commission over the next year and reintroduce the legislation in 2025. The negative social impacts of kids getting hooked on social media, he told House members, are increasingly obvious.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When you’re on your phone staring at videos all day, you’re not talking to your friends. You’re not talking to adults,” he said. “You’re not interacting with the world.”</span></p>

Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, addresses his colleagues in the House of Delegates after being elected speaker of the House at the Virginia State Capitol on Jan. 10. (Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The chairman of the Republican Party of Virginia said Thursday that he’ll make “personnel changes” after the party published a social media post attacking House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, over the decades-old drug conviction he moved past to become the first Black person to lead the House of Delegates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Is it any surprise that @DonScott757 spent 8 years in federal prison for peddling drugs to college kids, and now he’s obsessed with legislation to cut breaks for drug dealers? Anything for your buddies, right?” the Virginia GOP account said in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, around noon Thursday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The post was deleted, but screenshots captured by other users sparked condemnation from both sides of the political spectrum, including a denunciation by Gov. Glenn Youngkin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Thursday afternoon, RPV Chairman Rich Anderson said the post “does not reflect my values or that of my party.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I had neither seen nor approved the tweet—but the buck stops with me,” Anderson </span><a href="https://x.com/RichAndersonRPV/status/1758227069081694437?s=20" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said on X</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “I directed its immediate removal and will be making personnel changes effective today.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The controversy came just weeks after </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/01/10/historic-display-of-racial-gender-diversity-marks-the-start-of-2024-general-assembly-session/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scott’s ascension</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the speakership drew bipartisan praise as a </span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2018/11/23/before-he-was-a-prominent-attorney-in-portsmouth-don-scott-spent-7-years-in-federal-prison-2/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">story of redemption and difficulty overcome</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Scott, a U.S. Navy veteran, served nearly eight years in federal prison after a drug conviction in 1994, an episode he recently described as his life’s “lowest” moment. Now a lawyer, Scott joined the House in 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his own social media response, Youngkin called his party’s comment about Scott “unforgivable.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Today, I’ve personally expressed to Speaker Scott my deep respect for him and his life journey, this kind of personal attack has no place in Virginia or anywhere,” </span><a href="https://x.com/GlennYoungkin/status/1758226011294941209?s=20" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Minority Leader Todd Gilbert, R-Shenandoah, who heatedly clashed with Scott and other Democratic leaders earlier this week in a floor battle over abortion, also stood up for his colleague across the aisle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This kind of garbage comment has no place in our discourse,” Gilbert </span><a href="https://x.com/cToddGilbert/status/1758204206555557945?s=20" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said on X</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “Speaker Don Scott’s personal story of redemption is something to behold and admire. He and I have disagreed on policy and process and will continue to do so, but he has earned respect and he certainly has mine.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state GOP’s post targeting Scott first drew notice as the speaker was presiding over Thursday’s floor session in the House, sending his aides scrambling to formulate a response.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After seeing the social media attack shortly after finishing Thursday’s legislative business, Scott said in an interview that some in the Virginia GOP act friendly around him but lack the courage to “come to my face and say stuff like that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If I am what they say I am,” Scott said, “how the hell do they keep losing to me?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of those priorities are expected to win final passage in the weeks ahead, but they’re heading to an uncertain fate at the hands of Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who has not yet played a major role in the policymaking process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the governor pushing hard for a Northern Virginia sports arena deal, the story of the 2024 session could come down to whether Youngkin and Democratic leaders can strike a bargain that gives both sides some of what they want.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of that negotiating could be worked out through the state budget, which will take up more of legislators’ time in the session’s second half.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tuesday was the deadline for the state Senate and House of Delegates to finish work on their bills before they cross over to be heard by the other body. Here’s a rundown of what’s happened on big issues so far: </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Sports arena</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legislation that would create a sports authority to issue $2 billion in bonds to build a new arena for the Washington Wizards and Capitals in Alexandria has been one of the most closely watched proposals of the session. Backed by Youngkin, the project envisions the construction of not only the arena, but a new entertainment district in the Potomac Yard neighborhood that the governor says could produce $12 billion in revenues over the coming decades. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The authority bill has cleared the House with a reenactment clause that would require the General Assembly to approve the proposal again in 2025 for the project to move forward. But it died in the Senate after Finance and Appropriations Chair Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, said </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/02/12/nova-arena-proposal-runs-into-trouble-as-top-senate-democrat-presses-pause/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">she wouldn’t bring it to a vote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, citing concerns with the project’s financing and what she and Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, described as Youngkin’s unwillingness to negotiate with Democrats. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, some members of the Senate have signified they aren’t abandoning the arena idea. “To quote Eric Idle — it’s not dead yet,” Surovell </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/02/12/monumental-arena-youngkin-bowser-bill-general-assembly/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">told The Washington Post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Monday. “We are always open to talking about ways to try to alleviate our concerns, but the conversations need to happen ASAP.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin came into the 2024 legislative session </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/12/20/youngkin-budget-calls-for-income-tax-cuts-sales-tax-increases/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">seeking major tax reforms</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: an across-the-board 12% cut in income taxes, a bump in the state sales and use tax from 4.3% to 5.2%, and an expansion of the sales and use tax to digital goods like digital downloads and streaming services. He also proposed eradication of the widely disliked car tax, a goal that has eluded</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/05/20/two-words-for-local-governments-considering-keeping-windfall-car-tax-collections-jim-gilmore/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> former Republican governors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and would require more than one piece of legislation to accomplish.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/youngkin-tax-cuts-virginia-budget-general-assembly/article_8554e5fa-c4f4-11ee-a464-0b251d3ab4b3.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats rejected bills to carry out much of that agenda</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which they have complained would disproportionately harm lower-income people. While the ideas remain alive in the governor’s budget proposal, their prospects appear dim as the House and Senate prepare to unveil their own two-year spending plans on Sunday. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Banning legacy admissions</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legislation to ban the practice of providing special treatment in college admissions decisions to applicants related to alumni and donors is on course to reach the governor after both chambers </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/blog-va/bills-banning-legacy-admissions-clear-both-virginia-chambers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">unanimously backed the proposal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the legislation passes for a second time and the governor signs it into law, all of Virginia’s public colleges and universities would be prohibited from engaging in the admissions practice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Education Reform Now, a think tank, says more than 100 colleges and universities have ended legacy admissions since 2015, but 787 still used the practice as of 2020.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Gambling</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a major policy reversal for the General Assembly, skill games — the slots-like machines tucked into corners of gas stations and bars all over the state — appear to be on track to be fully legalized, taxed and regulated. Lawmakers have signaled </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/02/13/virginia-lawmakers-vote-to-lift-ban-on-skill-games-but-details-are-uncertain/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">broad, bipartisan support for repealing a skill game ban</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that first took effect in 2021, but they haven’t finalized the details of how tough or lenient the new regulatory structure should be.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers punted on a proposal to allow a voter referendum on </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/02/06/virginia-senate-postpones-northern-virginia-casino-plan-until-2025/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a potential casino in Fairfax County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, blocked an effort to allow </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/01/30/virginia-house-panel-scuttles-plan-for-cruise-ship-casinos-in-state-waters/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cruise ship casinos</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to operate in Virginia waters and again said no to the idea of allowing sports betting on college games involving Virginia schools.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After Richmond voters said no to a casino twice, legislators have advanced a bill to give Petersburg voters a chance to weigh in on whether their city should host a casino in the capital region. Another piece of legislation moving forward would take Richmond off the state’s list of cities allowed to pursue casinos.</span></p>

<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Guns</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leaving </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2020/02/17/va-senate-committee-blocks-assault-weapon-bill-4-democrats-vote-to-push-it-to-2021/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">past caution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> behind, Democrats have passed dozens of new gun control bills, many of which are almost certain to be vetoed by the governor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those proposals include a ban on assault-style weapons manufactured after July 1, a ban on untraceable “ghost guns” assembled at home, a five-day waiting period for gun purchases and several bills meant to encourage safe gun storage, particularly when children are present.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few gun bills have picked up Republican votes, most notably a proposal to ban auto sears, small attachable devices that can produce automatic fire from semi-automatic handguns. Unregistered auto sears are already banned under federal law, but the Virginia bill aims to create a state-level ban that would give police more power to remove them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans have criticized Democrats for blocking their proposals to toughen criminal penalties for people convicted of multiple gun crimes.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Minimum wage</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A top Democratic priority for the session, legislation to raise the state’s minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2026 has cleared both the House and Senate on strict party-line votes. The bills continue a process started by Democrats in 2020, when they began raising the minimum wage from the federal floor of $7.25 per hour to the current level of $12 per hour.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislation is virtually doomed, however: While Youngkin hasn’t promised to veto the bill, he’s tiptoed right up to the line. At a small business-focused event in Richmond this January, </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/01/23/the-market-is-working-youngkin-signals-opposition-to-minimum-wage-hike/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">he told reporters</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> there was no need for the General Assembly to send him a bill “because the market is handling it. And they should allow small businesses to handle this.” </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Behavioral health reforms</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a state report found severe overcrowding and understaffing at Virginia’s nine state-run mental health hospitals, both Democrats and Republicans have backed </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/02/14/bills-to-ease-strain-on-state-mental-hospitals-advance-without-bed-of-last-resort-changes/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">proposals that aim to ease the strain on the facilities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Bills that try to reduce “inappropriate” admissions of patients with conditions like autism or dementia, align nursing schedules with industry standards and step up investigations of abuse and neglect allegations have gotten unanimous support. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers have stopped short of recommendations to reform Virginia’s “bed of last resort” law, which requires state hospitals to accept any patient under an involuntary commitment order if a bed can’t be found for them in a private facility. A December report found the law was contributing to dangerous numbers of patients in state wards. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Constitutional amendments</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats came into the session with several big ideas for constitutional amendments on abortion, same-sex marriage and voting rights, but decided to push them off until next year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those amendments would scrap Virginia’s longstanding policy of stripping voting rights for life after a felony conviction unless a governor restores them, create a state-level right to abortion and ensure same-sex marriage remains legal in Virginia no matter what future rulings come out of the U.S. Supreme Court.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because those amendments need to be approved by the General Assembly in both 2025 and 2026 before going to voters for a final decision, passing the amendments this year wouldn’t have made the process any faster. Waiting a year could also bring strategic advantages for Democrats, giving them more time to reassess the political environment after the 2024 presidential race and build momentum heading into Virginia’s 2025 elections.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Weed</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both chambers have approved legislation to allow retail marijuana sales for recreational use, which remains a major unfinished piece of Democratic efforts to decriminalize and regulate weed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats are still working out the details of how a state-sanctioned retail market would work, but they don’t appear to be having much luck yet convincing Youngkin to allow legal weed stores on his watch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless, a recreational marijuana bill could still land on Youngkin’s desk, forcing him to veto it or give in as part of a broader legislative deal with Democratic leaders.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Abortion</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With abortion access in Virginia protected due to last year’s election results, Democrats have passed several bills meant to protect abortion providers and women seeking abortions in Virginia from being targeted by authorities in other states with abortion bans.</span></p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;‘A slap in the face’: Va. House GOP forced to reject own member’s anti-abortion bill&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/02/12/a-slap-in-the-face-va-house-gop-forced-to-reject-own-members-anti-abortion-bill/embed/#?secret=xLPf5S7FfK#?secret=3rNQQMmxu7" data-secret="3rNQQMmxu7" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=SB377&amp;submit=GO" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would prohibit anyone from being extradited to another state for abortion offenses that are not a crime in Virginia. </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB78" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would prohibit law enforcement from getting search warrants for menstrual data stored in period-tracking apps, a preemptive safeguard abortion rights advocates say would prevent private health information from being seized for abortion-related prosecutions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proposals creating a state-level right to contraception — another measure advocates have pitched as a way to prevent further erosion of reproductive rights — have also passed both chambers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats have defeated several GOP-sponsored bills to ban or restrict abortion. One of those bills created </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/02/12/a-slap-in-the-face-va-house-gop-forced-to-reject-own-members-anti-abortion-bill/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">high drama</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the House when Democrats forced Republicans to take an up or down vote on whether all public funding for abortion should be banned with no exceptions for rape, incest, severe fetal abnormalities and when the life of the mother is at risk. After trying to avoid the vote altogether, nearly all Republicans ended up voting against the bill that came from their side.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re going to continue to push this issue out there until they all capitulate and start backing women’s reproductive health care,” House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, said of his move to bring the anti-abortion bill to the floor for a recorded vote. “Because they’ll continue to lose elections on this issue.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Same-sex marriage</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s Constitution still has an antiquated ban on same-sex marriage voters approved in 2006, but Democrats have been trying for years to overcome GOP opposition and give voters a chance to formally approve marriage equality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats are waiting until next year to begin the process of formally scrapping the ban, but they’ll also probably need to retain control of the House in the 2025 elections and pass the amendment again in 2026 before it can go to voters in November of 2026.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For now, Democrats are pushing forward a mostly symbolic </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB174" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> stating that marriage licenses must be issued regardless of the gender, sex or race of the two people involved. That legislation has picked up a few Republican votes in the process, but it’s unclear how Youngkin will handle it.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Local taxes for modernizing schools</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both chambers backed a bill that would let local governments increase their sales tax by 1% to pay for school construction projects as long as voters OK the increase in a referendum. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the last two years of split control of the General Assembly, the </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB14" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> died twice in the House after Republicans balked at the idea of raising taxes. But this year, the proposals have gotten strong bipartisan support, passing the Senate on a 27-13 vote and the House on a 69-28 vote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, local governments have control over adjustments to their property tax rates but aren’t allowed to change the sales tax rate without explicit permission from the General Assembly. Under current law, </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/02/24/virginia-explained-why-can-just-nine-localities-impose-a-sales-tax-for-school-capital-projects/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">only nine localities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can impose a 1% sales tax to fund school construction and renovation projects. </span></p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;As data centers continue spreading across Virginia, state lawmakers propose new development rules&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/01/15/as-data-centers-continue-spreading-across-virginia-state-lawmakers-propose-new-development-rules/embed/#?secret=Y3atwKTcJ5#?secret=JJrEW1LW9J" data-secret="JJrEW1LW9J" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Data centers</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers introduced roughly a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/01/15/as-data-centers-continue-spreading-across-virginia-state-lawmakers-propose-new-development-rules/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">dozen bills</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to address the ongoing proliferation of data centers in Virginia. But only one has made it through crossover, with the others headed to the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission, which </span><a href="https://jlarc.virginia.gov/pdfs/resolutions/2024_Data%20centers_JLARC.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">voted in December</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to conduct a study of data centers in Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Let’s have JLARC have a look at it and move forward on data center and environment issues created by them in a uniform fashion and come up with really good public policy,” said Sen. Dave Marsden, D-Fairfax, during discussion of one proposal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lone bill to make it out of its chamber, from Del. Josh Thomas, D-Prince William, initially would have required local governments to conduct site assessments ahead of approving a project but was amended to say they can do the assessments if they want. It could face trouble in the Senate, which sent a similar version to JLARC for study.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Paid family and medical leave</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A proposal to set up a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/01/29/virginia-democrats-again-push-for-paid-family-and-medical-leave/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">state-run, universal paid family and medical leave program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> modeled on the state’s unemployment insurance program passed the Senate but never made it out of the House Appropriations Committee. Uniform Republican opposition to the idea also indicates that even if the legislation makes it through the Democratic-controlled legislature, it’s unlikely to gain Youngkin’s favor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the proposal, both employers and employees would contribute small amounts to a state insurance fund that would then pay out 80% of a worker’s wages for up to 12 weeks annually if the worker had to take time off for the birth of a child, care for a family member or a serious health condition. Twelve states and Washington, D.C. have instituted similar programs to date. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Rent stabilization</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The third time was not the charm for Suffolk Democratic Del. Nadarius Clark&#8217;s proposed measure to stabilize rent increases, which </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/11/11/4-takeaways-on-housing-in-light-of-thursdays-inflation-report/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">surged statewide</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> during the pandemic and are still a big concern for some Virginia residents and advocates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clark&#8217;s </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB721" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 721</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would have given localities the option to create anti-rent gouging ordinances and the power to enforce them, required that landlords give tenants at least two months&#8217; notice before hiking rent, and capped annual rent increases between 7% and 15%. Lawmakers in the House Courts of Justice Committee voted to continue the measure until 2025. Clark had put forward similar legislation in the </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+sum+HB596" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2022</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB1532" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2023 </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislative sessions, both of which failed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A companion </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB366" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Sen. Jennifer Boysko, D-Fairfax, was also defeated. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">SCC judges</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It took almost two years for the General Assembly to fill two vacancies on the State Corporation Commission, the arm of state government that regulates utilities, insurance, banking and business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A political standoff in the formerly divided legislature ended this session after Democrats took control of both chambers and appointed Kelsey Bagot, an attorney with NextEra Energy and former adviser to a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission member, and Sam Towell, an attorney for Smithfield Foods and former lawyer with the Office of the Attorney General. The appointments mean retired judges will no longer need to be recalled to maintain a quorum.</span></p>

Manufacturers say they're games of skill, not chance. (Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proposals to legalize and regulate thousands of slots-like skill games in Virginia convenience stores, restaurants and truck stops easily cleared both chambers of the General Assembly this week.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are major differences left to be resolved in the two bills that passed the state Senate and the House of Delegates ahead of Tuesday’s crossover deadline, the legislative session’s halfway point when the two chambers have to finish work on their own bills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the solid, bipartisan vote tallies indicate the legislation is on track to win final passage before lawmakers leave Richmond next month. The vote was </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+vot+HV0575+HB0590" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">32-8</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the Senate and </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+vot+HV0575+HB0590" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">65-34</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the House.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB590" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House version</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the bill has tougher regulations on the machines that would presumably limit their profitability. It includes a higher tax rate and a local approval requirement that would give cities and counties the ability to block skill games in their communities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB212" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which the skill game industry prefers due to its less strict treatment, doesn’t require local approval and would allow the industry to restart the machines on July 1 without waiting for a permanent regulatory structure to be put in place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Today&#8217;s overwhelmingly bipartisan vote reaffirms the General Assembly&#8217;s commitment to supporting these small businesses, and we hope that Governor Youngkin follows their lead,” restaurant owner Rich Kelly said in a statement on behalf of the pro-skill game Virginia Merchants and Amusements Coalition. “It is imperative that we move this legislation forward to ensure struggling small businesses can access the additional revenue generated by skill games without delay.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the votes weren’t exactly close, Virginia lawmakers have sharply differing views on the impact of skill games. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the Senate’s debate on the proposal Tuesday, Sen. Aaron Rouse, D-Virginia Beach, the lead sponsor of the Senate skill game bill, said it was all about helping “the most vulnerable small businesses in our commonwealth,” many of them run by first-generation immigrants.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Jennifer Boysko, D-Fairfax, said she flipped from a no on skill games to a yes after learning from some of those business owners about how revenue from the machines kept them afloat during the COVID-19 pandemic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I have never supported it in the past,” Boysko said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Sen. Adam Ebbin, D-Alexandria, a skill game opponent, suggested the heavy emphasis on helping small businesses (the Senate bill is titled the Virginia Small Business Economic Development Act) was glossing over the actual policy choice legislators are making.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I can&#8217;t help but notice how we&#8217;re expanding gambling in a large way today,” Ebbin said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether the </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/02/05/virginia-explained-the-never-ending-battle-over-skill-games/#:~:text=Like%20other%20gambling%20legislation%20recently,backers%20insist%20it's%20not%20gambling."><span style="font-weight: 400;">tic-tac-toe-style games</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are or aren’t functionally the same as slot machines has been a major question that Virginia and several other states have struggled to resolve with any clarity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pace-O-Matic, a Georgia-based company that’s one of the nation’s leading skill game manufacturers, has argued aggressively that its machines aren’t a form of gambling because they require enough skill that the outcome isn’t entirely dependent on chance. Opponents contend the skill involved is negligible and the “skill game” label is a legal ruse to evade anti-gambling laws.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Glenn Youngkin has </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/01/18/youngkin-said-to-back-push-to-reauthorize-so-called-skill-machines-in-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tentatively supported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> efforts to sanction skill games in the past, but before a bill gets to his desk the legislature will have to work out opposing views on how the machines should be regulated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia lawmakers were on the verge of banning the machines in 2020, but the legislature and former Gov. Ralph Northam agreed to a plan to let them continue operating for only one year under minimal regulation by the Virginia Alcoholic Beverage Control Authority, which already grants licenses to the types of businesses that host skill games. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That ban eventually went into effect in the summer of 2021 but was suspended later that year after skill game supporters filed a lawsuit challenging it. The ban was </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/10/13/virginia-supreme-court-reinstates-ban-on-slots-like-skill-games/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reinstated</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> late last year by the Supreme Court of Virginia after state lawyers spent nearly two years defending it. It was that court decision that prompted the latest push to tax and regulate the games instead of forcing small business owners to get rid of them or continue making money from illegal machines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first draft of the Senate skill game bill would have again given regulatory oversight to ABC, even though the agency has said it shouldn’t be the regulator because its expertise is in alcohol, not gambling. To get over that hurdle, the amended Senate bill would make ABC a temporary skill game regulator until the Virginia Lottery Board, which already oversees casinos and sports betting, could get a long-term regulatory structure in place. The House bill would make the Lottery the regulator and delay legalization until the start of 2025 to give the Lottery more time to prepare.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The big thing that has to be recognized is that only one agency can regulate these machines, and that&#8217;s Lottery,” said Del. Paul Krizek, D-Alexandria, a skill game skeptic who led a significant overhaul of the House bill that created many of the discrepancies that now exist with its Senate counterpart. “ABC is not a gaming regulator. They do alcohol.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Senate plan would give the Lottery until the start of 2026 to prepare its skill game regulations while allowing ABC to oversee “provisional registration” of the machines until then.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How the state would gain access to data on how much money is flowing through the machines could also be a sticking point as negotiations on the bill progress.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Senate bill would allow skill game distributors to file monthly reports showing how much money was wagered and paid back out to players at each machine. The House bill would require a “central monitoring system” giving the Lottery direct access to that financial data instead of relying on the industry to self-report its revenues.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a </span><a href="https://jlarc.virginia.gov/pdfs/reports/Rpt565-1.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report on gambling regulation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> issued two years ago, the General Assembly’s research arm examined how the state could oversee skill games — also known as gray machines due to their legally murky status — and concluded that connecting the machines to a central monitoring system “would be essential for effective regulation.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“ABC staff who regulated gray machines in FY21 noted that without a central monitoring system, they were unable to verify how much money gray machines collected and awarded in prizes,” the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission said in its report. “Instead, they relied on self-reported figures from gray machine manufacturers, which they suspected were not always reliable.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That wasn’t just a hypothetical concern, the report went on to say.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When Georgia connected the machines to a monitoring system in 2015, they found that the machine-reported revenue was nearly double that which was self-reported by machine manufacturers,” JLARC said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a letter to lawmakers last month, the Virginia Council on Problem Gambling — which seeks to mitigate the harms of gambling addiction — urged the General Assembly to act with “extreme caution” on machines that have spread to hundreds of different locations rather than being concentrated in a casino or horse racing facility. The organization asked lawmakers to pay particular attention to safeguards meant to address gambling addiction and block minors from playing the machines. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. John McGuire, R-Goochland, one of the eight senators who voted against skill games, said they “put gambling in every neighborhood in every locality in Virginia.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I had one constituent tell me that their grandmother spends all day at the skill games,” McGuire said. “And they can’t get her out of there.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Senate’s skill game bill would set aside some money for gambling addiction resources, require the machines to have labels saying no one under 21 can play and make it a criminal offense for any business to allow minors to play. The House bill envisions dealing with those issues through the issuance of player cards. By doing an identity check before allowing access to the machines, the player card system would create a tougher barrier for minors and gambling addicts who want to ban themselves from playing skill games.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the initial floor votes on the two bills, there was very little back-and-forth debate over exactly how the machines should be regulated. Many lawmakers said the proposal was a work in progress and the finer points could be settled later.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In some meetings, lawmakers have portrayed the effort as a way to ensure restaurants and gas stations can keep their doors open.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It allows these business owners to stay open longer, pay their help better, be great citizens in our communities,” said Sen. Timmy French, R-Shenandoah, a Shenandoah Valley farmer who is co-sponsoring the Senate bill. “When I get a phone call in the morning and my cattle are out somewhere and I go get those cows in at four in the morning, I like those lights on to stop and get a cup of coffee.&#8221;</span></p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As it gets </span><a href="https://www.vpap.org/visuals/visual/the-cost-of-elections-over-time/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more and more expensive</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to win a seat in the Virginia General Assembly, the state legislature continues to find new ways to stifle efforts to put limits on the state’s wide-open campaign finance laws.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year, several bills meant to slow the flow of money into Virginia politics have been blocked without lawmakers taking a recorded vote showing that’s what they’re doing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the last decade, proposals have been introduced to create stricter campaign finance limits in Virginia and boost public confidence that the legislature can’t be bought by special interests writing checks of unlimited size. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some Democrats have been vocal about making campaign finance reform a priority, and many have accepted big checks from Clean Virginia, a well-funded advocacy group focused on energy and campaign finance reform that says its mission is to “fight corruption in Virginia politics.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the party’s retaking of full control of the General Assembly this year doesn’t appear to be producing any breakthroughs on campaign finance issues as Tuesday’s crossover deadline approaches. As the two chambers rush to finish work on their own bills, no major campaign finance legislation has made it through both sides of the Capitol. If those positions hold in the second half of the session, none of the bills will win final passage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead, Democratic-sponsored campaign finance proposals are languishing in Democratic-controlled committees, where several bills have been allowed to expire without a hearing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Del. Joshua Cole, D-Fredericksburg, presented </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB190" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that would prohibit candidates from accepting campaign money from public utilities like Dominion Energy, the proposal died without a vote when no one on the 22-member House Privileges and Elections Committee made a motion for or against it. </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB874" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sponsored by Del. David Bulova, D-Fairfax, that would have set caps on donations from both corporations and individuals was never docketed by the same committee.</span></p>
<p>In an interview, Cole said he&#8217;ll keep fighting for campaign finance reform, despite his latest bill failing in an unusual fashion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Time will tell what will happen,&#8221; Cole said. &#8220;The appetite is definitely there for it.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the Senate side, another utility-focused campaign finance reform </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB326" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sponsored by Sen. Danica Roem, D-Prince William, made it out of the chamber’s elections committee, but stalled when it was sent to the Finance and Appropriations Committee. It never got a hearing there, despite being projected to have no impact on the state budget.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When asked why Roem’s bill wasn’t docketed, Sen. Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, who chairs the Senate Finance Committee, criticized the bill itself instead of offering any procedural explanation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The people who are complaining about Dominion being a monopoly want to replace them,” Lucas said. “They want to be the monopoly. So what&#8217;s the difference?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clean Virginia’s critics have often accused the organization and its main funder, wealthy Charlottesville investor Michael Bills, of engaging in a new form of influence-peddling by offering substantial checks to lawmakers who vow to stop accepting money from Dominion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an interview, Roem didn’t sound disheartened over her bill’s fate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is the first time we’ve ever gotten out of committee. This still marks progress,” Roem said. &#8220;Clearly we have more steps to go.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nancy Morgan, a campaign finance reform advocate with BigMoneyOutVA, said Democratic leaders appear to be “strong-arming the members to kill the bills in untransparent ways.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Not allowing bills to be voted on, or even heard by legislators, is anathema to our democratic process,” Morgan’s group said in a statement last week.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A seemingly less controversial </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB377" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">proposal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to prohibit spending campaign cash on personal uses unrelated to politics — something already banned at the federal level and in almost every other state — looked to be on track to pass this year after clearing the state Senate 35-4 and passing the House elections committee unanimously. But the </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB40" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House version</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was bottled up in the budget-writing committee after three state agencies estimated it would cost them more than $745,000 to add more staff to implement the law. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the legislature’s own fiscal analysts sharply disagreed with that figure, saying the law would create virtually no new costs and wouldn’t substantially add to anyone’s existing workload.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It just seemed highly inflated,” said Del. Cia Price, D-Newport News, who chairs the House elections committee and formally requested a second opinion on the steep cost estimate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+oth+HB40J110+PDF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">written analysis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> attached to the personal use bill, staffers at the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission said they concluded the proposal wouldn’t substantially burden state agencies after looking at similar laws in Georgia and Tennessee. Both states already have systems for investigating complaints and issuing advisory opinions similar to what the Virginia proposal envisioned, JLARC found, and the strain on staff is minimal because there are usually just a few cases to handle per year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“JLARC estimates the fiscal impact of the bill would be negligible,” the General Assembly’s analysts said in their rebuttal to the estimates from the Virginia Department of Elections and Virginia Department of Corrections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The JLARC statement didn’t address an additional $429,426 estimate from the office of Attorney General Jason Miyares, which claimed it would need two additional attorneys and a paralegal to help implement the law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite JLARC disputing the projected costs of the personal use bill, Del. Marcus Simon, D-Fairfax, said its chances of passage are now “slim to none” after failing to pass the House. The House can still take up the Senate version of the bill, but Simon said it’s unlikely to be a priority for the body late in the session as lawmakers try to finalize more big-ticket items.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite Simon’s less-than-optimistic prediction about the fate of efforts to ban the personal use of campaign money, Clean Virginia said it still hopes a “commonsense ban” can pass this year after clearing the Senate with an “overwhelming bipartisan majority.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Passage of this bill would represent a strong first step towards comprehensive campaign finance and ethics reform in Virginia,” said Clean Virginia Legislative Director Dan Holmes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">General Assembly members and statewide officeholders are prohibited from raising campaign funds during legislative sessions, but the latest effort to extend that ban to special sessions also appears to be on track to die without lawmakers attaching their names to a vote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bipartisan bill banning fundraising during “active” special sessions made it to the Senate floor. But in an unrecorded voice vote last week, the Senate chose to send the bill back to its elections committee, a maneuver that killed the bill because the panel was already done with its work on Senate bills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the floor, Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, said the bill “had a lot of issues.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s going to create more problems than it’s going to solve,” Surovell said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. David Suetterlein, R-Roanoke, the bill’s sponsor, objected to the move, saying his legislation appeared to be heading for the same death by unrecorded vote that often befalls bills to ban the personal use of campaign funds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Every year it found a different way to die on an unrecorded vote,” Suetterlein said.</span></p>

(Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats in the Virginia House of Delegates forced their Republican colleagues to take an up-or-down vote Monday on a sweeping </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB404" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">anti-abortion bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> one lawmaker called “a slap in the face” to women who have been raped or suffer life-threatening complications from a pregnancy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a procedural move designed to put Republicans on the spot over the most extreme anti-abortion proposals emerging from their ranks, Democrats themselves brought a GOP-sponsored bill to the House floor that would have cut off public funding for clinics and hospitals where abortions are performed with no exceptions for rape, incest, severe fetal abnormalities or when the mother’s life is at risk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The hardball move by Democrats to advance the bill just far enough that all Republicans would have to vote on it comes after a hotly contested 2023 election season that Democrats characterized as a referendum on preserving abortion access in Virginia. Forcing Republicans to go on the record Monday, Democrats said, would help illuminate whether they got the message voters had sent by electing Democratic majorities in both the House and Senate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After several rounds of parliamentary battle over whether the bill could be scaled back or stricken from the agenda altogether, Republicans were forced to vote on the bill with no changes. The legislation was rejected in a nearly unanimous 95-1-2 vote, with just a few Republicans abstaining or voting no.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minority Leader Todd Gilbert, R-Shenandoah, tried to amend the bill on the floor and suggested its broad scope was partly a result of the inexperience of Del. Tim Griffin, R-Bedford. But in an unusually testy floor fight, Democrats repeatedly blocked GOP efforts to water down the legislation, saying Republicans should have to own up to the ramifications of Griffin’s original bill.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If the patron didn&#8217;t know what he was doing, maybe he should&#8217;ve stayed out of women&#8217;s business,” said Del. Candi Mundon King, D-Prince William, who called the bill an attack on potentially thousands of women.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans protested that they were trying to fix the very problems Mundon King was decrying when she called the bill a “slap in the face” to women, but were being denied the chance by Democrats more interested in a political stunt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don&#8217;t know where the absurdity of this theater ends,” Gilbert said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The GOP leader attempted to offer a rewritten version of Griffin’s bill that he said would only replicate the longstanding federal Hyde Amendment — which prohibits public funding of abortions with exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother — at the state level.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, rejected that effort, saying what Gilbert was trying to do was so different from the original bill that it wasn’t a valid amendment to a bill that would do away with those same exceptions. Republicans then made a rare attempt to override the speaker’s ruling. The Democratic majority blocked that too.</span></p>

Tim Griffin, R-Bedford (bottom right). (Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the original bill intact, Griffin stood and attempted to make an argument for why the Hyde Amendment exists. Democrats shut down that effort, saying he wasn’t speaking to what his bill actually did.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The delegate has to speak to the bill,” Scott said. “Not to the bill you wished you had introduced.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Marcus Simon, D-Fairfax, said it’s not uncommon for lawmakers to have their own bills turned against them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s happened to me. I&#8217;ve had some bad ideas before,” Simon said. “You put those bills in, and anything can happen. And you&#8217;ve got to be willing to deal with the consequences.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Griffin said it wasn’t up to other delegates to “define what my bill is.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I believe I can define what my bill is,” Griffin said. “And that’s what I’m doing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Griffin then faulted Democrats for turning his bill into a “circus,” saying he supports exceptions for the life of the mother but was never afforded a chance to amend the legislation to reflect that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The intent of this bill is that taxpayers not be forced into something that goes against their religion and their conscience,” Griffin said. “I will not allow these babies and these mothers to be politicized. If this is how it&#8217;s going to go today, I move to strike this bill.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Democratic majority didn’t allow Griffin to cancel his own legislation. That prompted a warning from Del. Bobby Orrock, R-Caroline, who said the body was breaking with its longstanding tradition of letting members retake control of bills that have gone “totally awry.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Understand the consequences that may come home to roost for all the rest of us,” Orrock said, adding that in his 35 years of House service he was aware of just one instance that Republicans had done the same thing to a Democrat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gilbert bristled at accusations Republicans were indifferent to the plight of suffering women, saying Mundon King had a prepared speech that relied on Democrats rejecting every GOP effort to address the problems with the original bill.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You&#8217;re going to accuse us of everything we just got accused of and then deny us the ability to do the very thing you say we don&#8217;t want to do,” Gilbert said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mundon King called the proposal a “scorched-earth bill” that was not the result of a drafting error or a freshman’s inexperience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When the patron introduced this bill,’ she said, “he knew exactly what he was doing.&#8221;</span></p>

(Photo courtesy of Kelly Phillips)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Three months ago, Kelly Phillips got a letter from Virginia officials warning her that the small cake pop business she runs out of her home was selling its bite-sized treats illicitly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week, several grown men waved cake pops around in the Virginia House of Delegates as the body voted 94-2 to pass </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB759" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that would grant more freedom to Phillips and other small purveyors of homemade goods to sell their products without getting in trouble with the government.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am still in shock, obviously, that cake pops are such a huge discussion,” said Phillips, who runs KP’s Kake Pops in the Richmond area, in an interview this week.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill — which initially dealt with homemade pickles — was modified to address the two things that got Phillips crosswise last year with the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services. The agency is responsible for enforcing food safety rules that kick in when small businesses started in home kitchens grow into bigger commercial enterprises. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Safety inspection rules don’t apply to low-risk foods like baked goods, jellies, nuts and pickles produced in home kitchens, as long as they’re sold directly to customers out of the producer’s home or at a farmers market. Uninspected goods cannot be sold online.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislation would clarify that advertising or promoting homemade goods on social media platforms doesn’t count as actually selling them via the Internet as long as all the transactions take place in person. A VDACS representative said the agency supports the bill because, despite past confusion, it aligns with how regulators are now interpreting the law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It would also broaden the range of local events where homemade goods can be sold without being inspected by food safety officials. Under the new version, the farmers market rule would be loosened to allow face-to-face sales at any “temporary event that operates for a period of no more than 14 consecutive days,” a definition that would cover a wider range of craft shows, holiday markets and other events that don’t focus primarily on farm-produced goods.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Phillips was contacted by regulators last year, she was initially told she could not promote her products on social media sites like Facebook and Instagram even if she wasn’t actually conducting transactions digitally. She was also told she had violated the farmers market rule by setting up a booth at an event called the Holiday Handmade Showcase held at a Chesterfield County shopping center.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Del. Nick Freitas, R-Culpeper, presented the legislation on the House floor, he said what started as a pickle bill was “now even more affectionately referred to as the cake pop bill.”</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_37760" class="wp-caption alignright" style="max-width:100%;width:1024px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Freitas.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-37760" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Freitas-1024x582.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="582" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Freitas-1024x582.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Freitas-300x170.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Freitas-768x436.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Freitas.jpg 1060w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Del. Nick Freitas, R-Culpeper, explains his cake pop bill on the floor of the Virginia House of Delegates. Behind him are an enthused Del. Michael Webert, R-Fauquier, and an unenthused House Minority Leader Todd Gilbert, R-Shenendoah. (Virginia House of Delegates video feed)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Presenting the bill earlier in a committee that deals with agricultural issues, Freitas said he modified his proposal after hearing about the cake pop problems.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What this really comes down to is just trying to clarify what the rules are and trying to keep it all reasonable and safe at the same time,” Freitas said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill sponsored by Freitas is broader than cake pops. The exemption in state law allowing some homemade goods to be sold without safety inspections has tougher rules for pickles due to the acidification process and the greater health risks involved with improper pickling and canning. Under current law, uninspected pickle operations are only allowed to make $3,000 in gross sales revenue per year. The bill approved by the House raises the cap to $9,000.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some lawmakers asked for data on whether there had been any pickle-related health scares in the decade or so since uninspected pickles have been allowed. After being assured by the Virginia Department of Health that there haven’t been any issues with people being sickened by homemade pickles, legislators agreed to keep the language tripling the sales cap.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the bill was heard in committee, some lawmakers from more rural parts of Virginia seemed unfamiliar with cake pops.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What&#8217;s a cake pop look like? What&#8217;s the size of it?” asked Del. Tony Wilt, R-Rockingham.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Freitas told him to “think of a little piece of cake.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But it’s on a stick like a popsicle,” he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Chris Runion, R-Rockingham, chimed in to inform the committee that some people in the Shenandoah Valley are aware of cake pops.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In our end of the Valley, we have them,” Runion said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing some delegates try to grasp the unfamiliar concept gave Jaimie Ashton an idea.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An animal rights activist from Spotsylvania County, Ashton observed the cake pop discussion while waiting to see the same agriculture subcommittee take up several animal-related bills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the bills got their next stop in the full House, Agriculture, Chesapeake and Natural Resources Committee, she passed out more than two dozen Starbucks cake pops to the committee members, one of whom seemed to still be confused about whether the pops are supposed to be eaten or licked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They were joking that the best part of it was that Freitas wasn’t there to get one,” Ashton said in an interview.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was apparently some of those cake pops that later made a cameo on the House floor, captured for posterity in the official video recording of the chamber’s proceedings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Phillips, the home baker who partially inspired the bill, has not yet come to the Capitol to testify for the cake pop bill, but she said she’s been asked to potentially make an appearance when the legislation is heard in the state Senate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She’s also been told by her Capitol contacts to prepare for a possible bill-signing ceremony with the governor, who previously shared a </span><a href="https://x.com/GlennYoungkin/status/1742985656731927026?s=20" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">social media post </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">about her predicament in which he vowed to “fix this” and ensure Virginia remains “the best place to live, work and bake cake pops!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;ve heard from them that Gov. Youngkin is excited about cake pops,” Phillips said. “I hope that&#8217;s true.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But in a rare procedural maneuver, Democratic leaders are planning to put </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB404" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to a full vote next week in what appears to be an effort to force all 49 of the chamber’s Republicans to take a public stance on a measure that has no chance of actually becoming law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement Thursday, House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, said he was making the move “so that Virginians know exactly what their representatives choose to do with the power granted to them by their constituents.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans in the General Assembly introduced multiple pieces of legislation to restrict access to reproductive healthcare,” Scott said. “Voters have shown time and time again where they stand on this vital issue and it is only right that their representatives do the same.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under current law, public funds can be used to pay for abortions for low-income women on Medicaid in cases of rape, incest,“incapacitating” fetal abnormalities and when the mother’s life is at risk from continuing the pregnancy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislation — sponsored by Del. Tim Griffin, R-Bedford — is a sweeping attempt to cut off public funding not only to organizations such as Planned Parenthood that provide abortion services but also to any hospital or other facility “at which abortion services are provided.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill specifically repeals two longstanding sections of state law allowing public funds to be used to fund abortions for low-income women in cases of rape and incest and when doctors certify the fetus has a “gross and totally incapacitating” physical or mental abnormality. Griffin’s bill does not include an exception allowing such abortions when the mother’s life is in jeopardy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Griffin’s office did not immediately respond Thursday afternoon to a request for comment on the Democrats’ push to spotlight his bill.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats initiated the move to bring the bill to the floor at a meeting of the House Rules Committee Thursday morning. The committee voted 12-6 to bring the bill straight to the floor, with Democrats overriding Republican opposition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that meeting, House Minority Leader Todd Gilbert, R-Shenandoah, seemed to recognize the scope of the bill would pose political problems for his caucus. Gilbert said he believed the intent of the bill was to replicate the federal Hyde Amendment that clarifies under what conditions public dollars can be used to fund abortions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don&#8217;t believe it includes the Hyde Amendment exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother,” Gilbert said of Griffin’s bill.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gilbert attempted to add those exceptions to the bill, but Democrats overruled him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We can deal with this on the floor,” said Del. Marcus Simon, D-Fairfax.</span></p>

(Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A plan to potentially bring a casino to Northern Virginia is dead for the year in the General Assembly but survived an effort Tuesday to kill it for good.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was already clear heading into this week’s meeting of the Senate Finance and Appropriations Committee that the <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB675" target="_blank">Fairfax County casino proposal</a> was in serious trouble after a subcommittee recommended delaying any decision for at least a year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To make sure lawmakers got the message that many in the county weren’t even interested in having a ballot referendum on the project, a vocal contingent of casino opponents attended the meeting and booed lawmakers just for punting the idea to the 2025 legislative session.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia already has casinos in Bristol, Portsmouth, Norfolk and Danville. A fifth could potentially be on the way to Petersburg after Richmond residents voted twice to reject a casino in their part of the capital region. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year’s push to open the door to a possible sixth casino in one of Virginia’s most populous and well-off areas shows that casinos remain highly controversial in some parts of the state. As the committee voted to halt the bill’s progress for now without rejecting it outright, some in the crowd blurted out, “Shame on you guys” and “You’re addicting our kids.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State Sen. Jennifer Boysko, D-Fairfax, was the opposition’s main ally on the committee. She told colleagues the General Assembly shouldn’t spend any more time on the idea after what she’s heard from constituents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There were hundreds and hundreds of people in my community who have expressed disappointment and disagreement with this proposal,” Boysko said as she made a motion to reject the proposal entirely. That motion failed 5-9-1.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other senators from Fairfax argued all the bill did was give the county and state a chance to further explore a project that could bring major revenue to both. Supporters of </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/01/19/casino-tysons-corner-fairfax/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for a casino and conference center in Tysons Corner estimated it could generate up to $155 million in annual tax revenues for the state while bringing a significant boost to the local economy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There aren’t many bills coming before this committee that offer this much potential revenue to the commonwealth of Virginia in a year and a time when our revenues are short,” said Sen. Dave Marsden, D-Fairfax, the bill’s sponsor. “This absolutely has to be considered.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A  vote to postpone deliberations on the bill to the 2025 session passed 13-2, with Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, and Sen. Jeremy McPike, D-Prince William, voting in opposition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some senators suggested that pushing the bill off another year would give policymakers more time to get refreshed numbers on the economic impact of the proposal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both Surovell and McPike noted that the state had already looked at the possibility of a Northern Virginia casino.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A major </span><a href="https://jlarc.virginia.gov/pdfs/reports/Rpt527-5.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">state gambling study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> completed in 2019 found that Northern Virginia appeared to be the most lucrative home for a casino, even though the region wasn’t up for consideration when lawmakers were first considering allowing gambling facilities in five Virginia cities in need of economic revitalization. That study also indicated a Northern Virginia casino would help prevent Virginians’ gambling dollars from going across the Potomac River to the MGM National Harbor casino resort in Maryland.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Obviously there’s a disagreement within the county about it,” Surovell said. “I can tell you that in my part of the county, where we live right across the river from one of these, the people … </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">don’t feel the same way as the people in the other part of the county.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike other officials in parts of the state that have seen casino projects come to fruition, Fairfax County’s local government has not taken a formal stance on the legislation that would give the county the option of hosting a casino. That difference has fueled opposition from some senators who have said they don’t want to set a precedent of allowing casino developers to start coming to the state before getting buy-in from the local community they intend to partner with.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marsden has defended his legislation by saying Fairfax residents would still have the final say over whether they want a casino or not.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is nothing but democracy,” he said. “It’s allowing local control of the process from here on out.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though Marsden said all development is going to draw some neighborhood pushback, Boysko argued local input from people most impacted should be a paramount concern.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If one of my colleagues would like to have a casino in their part of the county, they’re welcome to bring a bill next year,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In interviews after Tuesday’s vote, Fairfax residents who had traveled to Richmond to oppose the casino said they were frustrated by what they see as a state legislature more responsive to wealthy donors than the people it’s supposed to serve.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They’ve lost in Richmond twice,” said Linda Walsh, referring to the two failed casino referendums in the state capital. “It’s a total waste of time. They have big bucks and we don’t. But we have a vote.”</span></p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legislation that would’ve let Virginia political parties exclude some voters from their primary elections was defeated Monday in a House of Delegates subcommittee that deals with election rules.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rejection of the </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB56" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican-sponsored bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — which would have required voters to register their party affiliation with the state starting next year — preserves Virginia’s open primary system, which gives eligible voters the freedom to participate in any government-run primary regardless of their political leanings. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill would not have automatically blocked voters unaffiliated with a party from participating in that party’s primaries. Instead, it would have given the parties themselves the power to decide whether to exclude independents and voters affiliated with an opposing party.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Monday’s committee hearing on the proposal, Del. Rozia Henson, D-Fairfax, asked what it would mean for voters who live in deep-blue or deep-red areas, where a lack of partisan competitiveness means nominating elections often decide who will represent that area in local, state or federal office.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Tommy Wright, R-Franklin, the bill’s sponsor, said Democrats in a blue area could block Republicans from voting in their primary.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And if they didn’t have a candidate, they wouldn’t vote at all,” Wright said, referring to Republicans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Bill Wiley, R-Winchester, who sponsored the same bill as Wright, told the subcommittee that general elections are the proper time for parties to try to appeal to crossover voters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The primaries are specific for the party,” Wiley said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Democratic-led subcommittee didn’t take a recorded vote on the bill, which failed for lack of a seconded motion to pass it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s lack of registration by party has occasionally given rise to complaints of partisan meddling by allowing Democratic-leaning voters to cast ballots in Republican primaries and vice versa. To avoid crossover votes in primaries, Republicans often choose to hold party-run conventions or firehouse primaries that give party organizers more leeway to ensure only Republican voters participate. When both parties have government-run primaries for the same office at the same time, voters have to choose between a Democratic and Republican ballot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rules for government-run primaries are taking on new importance due to a recently enacted law that makes it more difficult and potentially impossible for political parties to conduct their own conventions or firehouse primaries. By requiring parties to make absentee voting accommodations in party-run elections, the law is expected to force Republicans to hold more open primaries and drop their preference for conventions and other closed processes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to </span><a href="https://cardinalnews.org/2024/01/26/lynchburg-republicans-to-test-virginias-new-law-on-primaries/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reporting by Cardinal News</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Lynchburg Republicans are embarking on the first test of the new election law by attempting to hold a party-run nomination process in upcoming Lynchburg City Council races. That decision has drawn scrutiny from Del. Dan Helmer, D-Fairfax, who asked Attorney General Jason Miyares to ensure the Lynchburg GOP complies with the new law requiring the party to allow remote participation by overseas military personnel, college students who are away from home and would-be voters who can’t attend in person due to a disability or sickness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several people spoke in opposition to the bill at Monday’s meeting, saying injecting more partisanship into state politics would further erode an already fraying democratic system. Letting parties decide who can and can’t participate in a government-run primary, said Mary Crutchfield of the League of Women Voters of Virginia, is a “disturbing prospect in a democracy.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Open primaries invite independents, who are now a majority of all voters, to participate,” Crutchfield said. “Yes, spoiler voters might affect an outcome. But that is not common and affects both parties.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Steve Richardson, a Falls Church resident affiliated with the centrist, election reform-focused Forward Party, said closed primaries would be a “giant step backward for voters.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Closing the primaries is unjust,” Richardson said. “It grants private organizations the power to exclude voters.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the rejected bill, voters who were already registered would have been classified as independent by default unless they changed their status to Democrat or Republican.</span></p>

(Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No matter how many times Virginia tries to ban so-called skill games, it never seems to stick for long.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the last five years, the skill game industry — led by Georgia-based company Pace-O-Matic — has beaten back numerous efforts to outlaw its slots-like game machines found in convenience stores, bars and truck stops across the state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After nearly two years of operating with no regulation or taxation due to an ongoing lawsuit, the machines went dark late last year after the Supreme Court of Virginia indicated the General Assembly’s 2021 decision to ban the machines was a valid exercise of the legislature’s powers to restrict gambling. In court, the industry had argued the ban was an overreaching, business-destroying attempt to suppress video games that have a surface-level resemblance to slots but technically shouldn’t count as gambling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Skill game backers aren’t accepting defeat, and the battle has returned to the political arena as the industry makes an all-out push in the General Assembly to get its machines turned back on under a new tax and regulatory framework.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Backed by a powerful bipartisan group of lawmakers and a large contingent of business owners who feel the state is cruelly yanking away a revenue stream they’ve come to rely on, the proposal appears to be on track to pass in the weeks ahead.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, the legislative discussion has focused less on the question of whether the machines should be allowed at all and more on how strictly they should be regulated if they’re going to stay. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Senate is advancing a <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+ful+SB212S1+pdf" target="_blank">five-page bill</a> with lighter rules preferred by the industry. A group of mostly pro-skill game senators also </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2024/01/15/virginia-senators-refuse-to-send-skill-game-bill-to-committee-that-oversees-gambling/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">refused to allow the Senate bill to be heard</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the committee that usually handles gambling regulation. On Friday, a <a href="https://committees.lis.virginia.gov/pdfs/drafts/24106922D.pdf" target="_blank">71-page substitute bill</a> was introduced in the House of Delegates that takes a tougher regulatory stance, notably by requiring local approval before the industry could turn its machines back on in any particular city or county.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the next month or so, those dueling pieces of legislation will have to converge into something capable of passing both chambers and winning approval from Gov. Glenn Youngkin, whose administration has </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/01/18/youngkin-said-to-back-push-to-reauthorize-so-called-skill-machines-in-virginia/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">signaled support</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for skill games in the past.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are the specifics on what’s happening:</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Who’s for the machines?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several groups representing gas station owners and restaurateurs are advocating for the bill, and initial hearings have been flooded with skill game supporters wearing yellow shirts to support the cause.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proponents have highlighted the fact that many of the affected convenience store owners are first-generation immigrants trying to overcome a ban that’s hobbling their ability to pursue the American dream.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s a chokehold on the future of small businesses,” Kunal Kumar, an advocate with the Virginia Asian American Store Owners Association, said of the skill game ban.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rich Kelly, the owner of Virginia&#8217;s Hard Times Cafe restaurants, said skill game revenue kept many businesses afloat during the COVID-19 pandemic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And what’s going to happen now that the games are off? You’re going to find some of your local restaurants closing,” said Kelly, who’s now leading a group called the Virginia Merchants and Amusements Coalition.</span></p>

Timmy French, R-Woodstock, speaks at a podium flanked by other pro-skill game legislators during a news conference kicking off the new push to get the machines taxed and regulated.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pace-O-Matic, whose Queen of Virginia machines are believed to make up about half of the state’s skill game market, is also heavily involved in the effort. Its lobbyists have explained the finer points of the bill in committee hearings, and company representatives helped organize a press conference earlier this month that emphasized the voices of small business owners.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pleas of small businesses appear to be the most significant factor swaying the General Assembly to reverse the ban.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Friday’s House hearing, Del. Marcus Simon, D-Fairfax, said he had concerns about the machines but “a great deal of sympathy” for small business owners who in 2020 were allowed to host the machines for one year to help the state generate money for a COVID-19 relief fund.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“During COVID, when things were bad, we let them have the machines and we took the money. We used it. We spent it,” Simon said. “And now we’re telling them that they can’t have their cut of it anymore because we don’t need our cut.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the legalization effort is largely framed as a fight for the little guy, Pace-O-Matic has become an influential political force in the state as a major donor to both Republicans and Democrats. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company itself made $67,500 in donations this year before the session began, adding to the more than $1 million the company has donated directly to Virginia politicians, according to the money-tracking <a href="https://www.vpap.org/donors/324698-pace-o-matic/?start_year=all&amp;end_year=all" target="_blank">Virginia Public Access Project</a>. A company-affiliated PAC, <a href="https://www.vpap.org/donors/449412-va-operators-for-skill/" target="_blank">Va Operators for Skill</a>, has donated another $800,000. Several company executives have also made donations in Virginia. Paul Goldean, the company’s Charlotte-based president and CEO, has <a href="https://www.vpap.org/donors/448187-paul-goldean/" target="_blank">donated roughly $200,000</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Political leaders in both parties and both General Assembly chambers have accepted donations tied to the company, as have the legislators sponsoring the bill to legalize skill games.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Who’s against the machines?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Skill game supporters have long argued opposition to the machines is driven largely by Virginia’s newly formed casino industry and its desire to eliminate games that compete with traditional slot machines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Casino interests, which have also made sizable political donations in Virginia, are indeed opposing the bill introduced for the 2024 legislative session. A casino-backed group calling itself Virginians Against Neighborhood Slot Machines is running an anti-skill game campaign pushing back on what it says are the industry’s “inaccuracies and false claims.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The reality is these games line the pockets of huge corporations and are exploitative and predatory to vulnerable community members,” Virginians Against Neighborhood Slot Machines said in a statement opposing the bill.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Representatives from Virginia’s horse racing and charitable gaming industries, both of which offer gambling machines that look like slots, are also opposing skill games, arguing that legalizing them undercuts regulated gambling by rewarding an industry that rushed into Virginia without seeking lawmakers’ permission first.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Casino industry representatives argue their concerns go beyond self-interest. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an interview, Chris Cylke, a senior vice president for the American Gaming Association, said Virginia lawmakers appear to be zooming past serious questions about how to require the skill game industry to comply with the same type of rules and oversight applied to casinos, such as security and consumer protection measures, age verification protocols and a self-exclusion list that lets people with gambling problems ban themselves from putting more money at risk. Maximizing profitability for small businesses, Cylke said, isn’t the only policy concern in play.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Does everybody like more money? Absolutely,” Cylke said. “If all we cared about was driving small business revenue, we could certainly allow convenience stores to do any number of activities that are otherwise highly regulated, whether it be loan sharking, selling prescription drugs, adult entertainment or selling firearms.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The socially conservative Family Foundation has told lawmakers Virginia has too much gambling already and shouldn’t allow more even if skill games could be regulated as tightly as casinos.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Is it gambling?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under current law, skill games are considered a form of illegal gambling. Some Virginians who call the state’s gambling addiction hotline have said skill games feed their addiction. Like other gambling legislation recently passed in Virginia, the bill to legalize skill games would set aside money to fund gambling addiction resources. And skill game supporters agree that children shouldn’t be allowed to play the machines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the industry and its backers insist it’s not gambling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Unlike gambling, a skillful player can win every time they play the games,” read a text message recently sent to Richmond-area cell phones urging recipients to tell a local legislator to vote yes on skill games.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asked last week if she considers skill games a form of gambling, Sen. Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, said the label itself means the machines aren’t the same as what you’d find in a casino.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s a difference,” said Lucas, a key backer of the bill to legalize skill games. “You find it right in the title.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carolyn Hawley, a Virginia Commonwealth University professor who’s one of the state’s top experts on combating gambling addiction, said that from a problem gambling perspective there’s “really no difference” between skill games and slot machines. Skill games are routinely among the top three activities callers identify when they seek help from the state’s gambling addiction hotline, she said. From a harm reduction standpoint, Hawley said, claims that skill games aren’t gambling and can be beaten every time are “very misleading.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It presents an illusion of control for consumers that we know also helps facilitate gambling disorders,” said Hawley, who serves as president of the Virginia Problem Gambling Council and director of the state-funded Virginia Partnership for Gaming &amp; Health. “When we&#8217;re telling people that the activity that they&#8217;re doing is not gambling, they&#8217;re not going to associate the problems that they&#8217;re having as being gambling. They’re not going to reach out for help.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State law defines gambling as placing wagers on any game, contest or event to win something of value when the outcome is “uncertain or a matter of chance.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Jeremy McPike, D-Prince William, who has introduced an alternative bill that would provide tougher regulation for a broader range of electronic games in convenience stores and restaurants, said the gambling hotline data convinces him skill games are a form of gambling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“From my standpoint, skill games are just like slots,” McPike said. “You put money in. You hit a button. You win or lose.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Skill games can take several different forms. The most prominent Queen of Virginia games are an approximation of slots, featuring a nine-square grid of symbols generated by the machine with each play. The goal is to get a winning three-in-a-row pattern — similar to tic-tac-toe — that can run horizontally, vertically or diagonally. Unlike slots, the player has to touch the screen to connect a pattern, typically by picking one square as a “wild” symbol that completes one or more lines or by nudging symbols up or down to complete a line.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_37721" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:1544px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/PaceOMatic_screenshot.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-37721" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/PaceOMatic_screenshot.jpg" alt="" width="1544" height="871" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/PaceOMatic_screenshot.jpg 1544w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/PaceOMatic_screenshot-300x169.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/PaceOMatic_screenshot-1024x578.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/PaceOMatic_screenshot-768x433.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/PaceOMatic_screenshot-1536x866.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1544px) 100vw, 1544px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  A screenshot from a Pace-O-Matic game. (Pace-O-Matic)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like slots, the more a player wagers, the higher the potential payouts go. Symbols that come with the highest-value prizes appear most infrequently, and the lowest-value symbols are the most common. Successfully completing a pattern doesn’t guarantee a player is winning money, because some symbols pay out less than the amount of the original wager.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though skeptics see a glaring disconnect between the industry’s promises of constant wins and the mathematical reality that the machines only generate profits from players losing, at least one person believes he’s mastered what he describes as the loophole.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A YouTube user named JeffTheHokie has published a series of how-to videos explaining a system that he says can provide steady wins for players willing to train their brains with memory techniques and sit at Queen of Virginia machines for hours on end.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After each losing play, the machines give users the option of playing a memory-based subgame called “Follow Me” that allows them to win back what they lost plus a little extra if they can successfully remember and repeat a 20-step pattern playing out on screen. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On his </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/JeffTheHokie" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">YouTube channel</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, JeffTheHokie opines that the memory game is designed to be as boring as possible (it includes several 15-second intermissions that slow things down) so most players won’t bother with it. But by stopping the regular game and taking 8 or so minutes to beat the memory game after each losing spin, JeffTheHokie says, a trained player wagering at the $5 level can keep pursuing jackpots without fear of losing that $5. The only limit, he says, is “fatigue.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It makes the difference between this being a slot machine that takes your money and a slot machine that lets you cancel out ALL of your losses,” JeffTheHokie said in the comment section below one of his videos when skeptical viewers suggested his system might not be worth the effort for people who can’t treat the machines as a full-time endeavor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While others might blow through hundreds of dollars playing on luck, JeffTheHokie went on to say, his method allows him to occasionally win several hundred or even a thousand dollars per session.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Often (about half the time) I break even, but I never lose,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">JeffTheHokie’s YouTube page doesn’t list contact information so he could not be contacted for this article. But his videos have drawn enough notice that he makes a cameo in court filings debating the prevalence of theoretically perfect players. The fact that the industry hasn’t gone bankrupt at the hands of JeffTheHokie and others like him, gambling consultants argued in a report prepared to help the Virginia attorney general’s office defend the ban, shows most players don’t spend huge amounts of time at the machines just to repeatedly win back their $5.</span></p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LSUiHiR4KqQ?si=8CJHUOorfNoZVSvV" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Skill game backers argue that how players choose to use the machines is less relevant than their technical setup, which lets exceptional players achieve nonstop wins as long as they perfect a multi-layered, time-consuming process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pace-O-Matic representatives denied that the intermission-laden memory game is intentionally monotonous to discourage its use but declined to provide statistics on how often players choose to play it.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">How much money is involved?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Skill game proponents say the regulatory scheme they’ve designed, which would impose a 15% tax on gross revenues from the machines, could generate up to $200 million in new tax revenue per year divided between state and local governments. That estimate would put the industry’s total gross revenues somewhere around $1.3 billion per year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The exact amount of revenue would depend on how the state chooses to regulate the machines. The industry-backed bill would allow up to five machines at each restaurant or convenience store licensed by the Virginia Alcoholic Beverage Control Authority, and up to 10 machines at truck stops.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That bill also doesn’t include a cap on the total number of machines allowed statewide. The lack of a cap has led casino lobbyists to argue the bill would allow as many as 90,000 machines in Virginia based on the number of ABC licensees. When skill games were subjected to light ABC oversight from 2020 to 2021, agency data showed a little more than 10,000 sanctioned machines statewide.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers are also considering imposing caps on the machines’ wagers and payouts. The industry-backed Senate bill would set a $5 maximum wager, with payouts capped at $5,000. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The alternative bill that won initial approval in the House has lower stakes, with wagers limited to no more than $1 and a $500 max payout for each play.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The House bill, crafted by Del. Paul Krizek, D-Alexandria, also allows fewer machines at each location, limiting truck stops to five machines and convenience stores to two. Additionally, Krizek’s bill would set a 30% tax rate on the machines, double the rate envisioned in the Senate bill.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What are the other differences between the House and Senate bills?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead of ABC regulating the machines, Krizek’s bill would give that responsibility to the Virginia Lottery, which already regulates casinos and sports betting. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Senate bill aims to get the machines back on by July 1, but the House bill envisions Jan. 1, 2025, as a more reasonable start date given the bureaucratic work required to set up a new regulatory structure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Krizek, the co-chair of a General Assembly subcommittee taking a broader look at whether the state should create a single gambling oversight agency instead of spreading those duties among numerous departments, noted that he too is the son of immigrant parents and understands the “work ethic” of newcomers pursuing success in America.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is a great nation. And hard work will get you a long way,” Krizek said Friday. “But I do remain troubled by the scale at which these devices expanded.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saying even he’s not fully convinced his legislation is a good idea, Krizek gave a lengthy presentation last week on the “more robust” regulatory features of his bill.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The House bill Krizek drafted would prohibit the Lottery from granting any skill game licenses unless a locality has explicitly approved the machines via the passage of a local government ordinance or direct approval from voters through a ballot referendum. The Senate bill has no such requirement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Senate bill doesn’t have clearly defined protocols for preventing access to the machines by minors and people struggling with gambling addiction. The House bill would require skill games to have clearer disclosures on problem gambling resources and would subject the machines to the voluntary exclusion programs that already exist for other types of gambling. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The House version includes tougher age verification checks, requiring players to verify they’re 21 or older before being issued a card that can be used to play skill games. The House plan also makes it a criminal offense for any business to allow underage play. The Senate bill would require stickers on each machine saying no one under 21 can play but doesn’t lay out specifics on how that rule would be enforced.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the current Senate bill would rely on the skill game industry to self-report its revenues, the amended House bill would require a “central monitoring system” giving regulators direct oversight of how much money is flowing through the machines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Carrie Coyner, R-Chesterfield, asked if the House bill could be beefed up in other ways, such as ensuring the machines aren’t wedged into tight areas of convenience stores in a way that impedes Americans with Disabilities Act compliance and potentially capping how many machines can be located in economically disadvantaged areas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The House gambling subcommittee approved Krizek’s bill by a 6-0 vote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was some tension at Friday’s meeting over the dramatic rewrite of what began as industry-friendly legislation. Del. Cliff Hayes, D-Chesapeake, the original sponsor of the bill before Krizek overhauled it, said his side had told supporters not to attend after seeing the new version drop roughly 24 hours prior to the hearing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s an opportunity that we can’t get back,” Hayes told Krizek. “Those individuals are not here to speak their case.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Krizek said he was unaware skill game supporters had been told to skip Friday’s meeting, which began late in the afternoon and stretched into the early evening, but felt it was important to fix what he called the “very scant” regulations in the original bill.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You decided on your own to not invite your folks to come,” Krizek said. “We put this in the biggest room in the General Assembly so that you could have everybody here. We’re willing to go as long as it takes. I don’t want it to be said that we didn’t give you that opportunity.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Friday night, the business coalition backing skill games released a statement saying its members “remain committed” to the original version of the bill.</span></p>

(Getty Images)

</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a split vote, the Democratic-led Virginia House of Delegates passed </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB110" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Thursday that would lift a longstanding but seemingly never-used law meant to block anyone from making money by pressuring women to become surrogate mothers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proponents of the legislation, which passed 50-48 over GOP opposition, say it would remove a law that has had no real-world impact other than scaring people trying to start or grow families through surrogacy by raising the specter of criminal charges. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though some people who connect would-be parents with prospective surrogates and help both sides through the process already make a profit from their services, supporters say there’s no evidence anyone has ever used the type of coercive tactics the decades-old law was put in place to prevent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Colleen Maria Quinn, an attorney who specializes in family law governing adoption and surrogacy, told lawmakers no other state has a criminal prohibition like the one in Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This 30-year-old statute is just absolutely obsolete, and it&#8217;s not enforced,” Quinn said at a House subcommittee hearing last month.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Responding to claims the proposal would overly commercialize an industry in which financial incentives should play little or no role, Del. Rip Sullivan, D-Fairfax, said there are already legal and professional safeguards in place to ensure prospective surrogates don’t feel pressured.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You’ve got to have your own lawyer, for goodness’ sake,” Sullivan said, “who’s obligated to make sure you’re acting of your own free will.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both political parties, Sullivan said, often talk about making Virginia the best place to “raise a family.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We ought to be removing outdated parts of the code that may chill Virginians’ ability to do just that,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The law at issue prohibits compensation for “recruiting or procuring surrogates” or “arranging or inducing an intended parent and surrogate to enter into surrogacy contracts.” Violations are a class 1 misdemeanor, punishable by up to 12 months in jail or a fine of up to $2,500. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the bill is being presented as pro-family, it’s drawn strong pushback from socially conservative groups and Republican lawmakers who say it could lead to the exploitation of poor women and the commodification of human life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;re putting a dollar amount on a woman&#8217;s womb,” said Tom Intorcio of the Virginia Catholic Conference, which opposes surrogacy altogether. “We&#8217;re making them pregnancy machines in third-world countries.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, Pope Francis </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/08/world/europe/pope-francis-surrogacy-ban.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">called for a global ban on surrogacy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, calling the practice a “grave violation of the dignity of the woman and the child.”</span></p>
<p><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title20/chapter9/section20-160/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s laws</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on surrogacy contracts and compensation only allow surrogates to be reimbursed for medical bills and other ancillary living expenses during the pregnancy. The state doesn’t allow direct payment to surrogates solely for having a baby on someone else’s behalf. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is and will remain illegal in Virginia to pay a woman to carry a baby,” Sullivan said Wednesday during debate on the House floor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those assurances weren’t enough for Republican delegates who opposed the bill.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a back-and-forth with Sullivan, Del. Mark Earley Jr., R-Chesterfield, called the measure a step toward a “dystopian future,” adding that there’s a “huge power imbalance” between people looking for surrogates and lower-income women who can meet that need.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There used to be a booming commercial surrogacy market in places like India and Thailand until there were enough horror stories that they finally pared it back,” Earley said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to Earley, Del. Candi Mundon King, D-Prince William, said the bill would give more choices to women with “skin in this child-bearing game.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Being economically disadvantaged does not make you any less intelligent. It does not make you any less able to make your own decisions, whether they be financial, health or otherwise.,” said Mundon King. “We should be careful not to stigmatize those who are economically disadvantaged or put them into a category that they cannot understand how complicated and deeply personal surrogacy is.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislation now goes to the state Senate. If it passes the upper chamber, also controlled by Democrats, it will then go to Gov. Glenn Youngkin for approval, veto or amendment.</span></p>

(Ezra Shaw/Getty Images) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After hearing from angry Yorktown residents who said they don’t want to encourage more cruise ships in coastal Virginia, a House of Delegates panel voted 5-3 Tuesday to reject </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB1478" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a proposal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to allow large cruise ships to activate their casinos within Virginia waters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The vote doesn’t mean the legislation is fully dead, because it’s still </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2024/01/24/virginia-senate-panel-approves-first-batch-of-casino-bills/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">advancing in the Virginia Senate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But it’s a sign one of the more unexpected gambling bills of the 2024 legislative session may be in trouble.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At a meeting of a House subcommittee that deals with gambling and alcohol, Del. Paul Krizek, D-Alexandria, said he opposed the bill because it’s not following the same referendum process Virginia has used in the past to allow casino gambling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is about gambling in Virginia waters before they go out into international waters,” Krizek said. “Frankly, I don’t understand why it’s such an important thing for the cruise industry to have that couple of hours headstart on their gambling.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proponents of the bill have argued it would help invite more cruise ship activity, bringing revenue and tourism to the Hampton Roads area. Princess Cruise Lines, which makes port stops in Norfolk, is pushing for the bill this year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think if we throw out the welcome mat we could start up a new cruise industry that we haven’t seen before,” said former Sen. Frank Wagner, a lobbyist for Princess.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislation would allow cruise ships to conduct casino gambling at least one mile from Virginia ports or other Virginia stops on their itinerary, which would give them several additional hours of casino time while coming into or pulling out of Virginia. The ships’ route would have to include at least one foreign port, a provision supporters said would prevent the law from greenlighting floating casinos that stay in one spot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This bill was written to exclude any riverboat-style casinos or booze cruises,” said Del. Shelly Simonds, D-Newport News, the bill’s sponsor. “It is for large ships that weigh over 50,000 tons, with at least 2,000 passengers on overnight voyages.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cruise ships stopping in Virginia would be required to pay the state a $50,000 annual fee for local casino privileges. Vessels traveling through Virginia waters without stopping would have to pay $125,000 annually. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wagner said the bill would help bring more attention to Virginia’s Historic Triangle area and attractions like Colonial Williamsburg and Jamestown, but several Yorktown residents who attended the meeting said they’re not interested in encouraging cruise ships to come to their area.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If passed, this bill would exacerbate the problem by presenting yet another enticement for this multi-billion-dollar industry,” said Mary Jo O’Bryan of the anti-cruise ship group Preserve Yorktown.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before the vote, Simonds said the proposal was broader than the question of whether cruise ships are appropriate for one particular place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These ships are already traversing Virginia waters. They’re already coming. Norfolk has already made a $12 million commitment to cruise operations,” Simonds said. “You can not like the cruise industry, but this bill is not specifically about cruising in Yorktown.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The subcommittee’s three Republicans voted in favor of the bill, but five Democrats overruled them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Krizek noted that the state is already grappling with big questions about how to properly regulate gambling, and maritime casinos haven’t been part of that already complicated discussion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I would think that while you’re on the boat in the rivers, you’re looking out, looking at beautiful Virginia, rather than sitting in their little casino and playing the games,” Krizek said before voting no. “But that’s just me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislation, one of the first gun control measures put to a full vote in either chamber this year, still needs to pass the House of Delegates and is likely at risk of being vetoed by Gov. Glenn Youngkin after the session ends. Still, the issue highlights the two parties’ diverging views on how to address gun crime, with Democrats trying to reduce the number of guns flowing onto the streets and Republicans calling for tougher enforcement of existing laws.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Dave Marsden, D-Fairfax, said </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB447" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> he’s sponsoring uses a “light touch” to try to limit the supply of guns available to people who shouldn’t have them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We cannot have our vehicles here in the commonwealth act as vending machines for firearms,” Marsden said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If authorities spot a vehicle with a visible handgun inside, the bill would allow them to have the vehicle towed. The law would apply to any &#8220;unattended motor vehicle&#8221; left on a public highway or public property where neither the driver nor a passenger can see it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To illustrate the extent of the problem they’re attempting to solve, Democratic lawmakers pointed to recent statistics presented by the Richmond Police Department showing a major uptick in the number of guns stolen from vehicles in Virginia’s capital. There were 225 such thefts in 2017, </span><a href="https://vscc.virginia.gov/2023/Nov21Meeting/Crime%20Commission%20Chief%20Edwards_Richmond%20PD.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to city police</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and 637 in 2022.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All 19 Republicans in the Senate voted against the bill, with the chamber’s 21 Democrats voting to pass it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Mark Peake, R-Lynchburg, said the fundamental problem is people breaking into cars to begin with, adding that thieves could steal money or anything else of value left in a car and use the proceeds to buy a gun.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We have to stop it at the beginning,” Peake said. “And that is by stopping people who are breaking into cars.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Mark Obenshain, R-Rockingham, argued the bill would have no impact because he’s doubtful many gun owners are so careless as to leave a handgun in plain sight for would-be thieves. The state should instead focus on different kinds of incentives for safe storage, Obenshain said, such as a bill passed in 2023 that </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/youngkin-signs-bill-creating-300-tax-credit-for-gun-safes/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">created a $300 tax credit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help Virginians buy gun safes and lockboxes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We ought not be punishing victims of crimes,” Obenshain said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic senators said the law’s passage alone would send a message to Virginia gun owners to be more thoughtful about how they store firearms in vehicles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Responsible gun owners ought to get in the habit of putting their gun in the glovebox,” said Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax. “Put it in the glovebox every time they get out of their car. Just make it a habit.&#8221;</span></p>

(Aaron Black / Getty Images) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Virginia lawmakers continue to discuss the addition of new casinos in the state, Richmond appears to be out, Petersburg seems to be in and Northern Virginia looks like a question mark.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A state Senate panel took action on an initial batch of gambling bills Wednesday, offering some early indicators of what policymakers might do on the topic this session.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bill that sailed through the Senate General Laws and Technology Committee 15-0 would permanently remove Richmond from the list of cities eligible to host casinos after voters rejected casino referendums in 2021 and 2023.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;m voted in by the people of the city of Richmond. And they&#8217;ve said twice that they don&#8217;t want it,” Sen. Lamont Bagby, D-Richmond, told colleagues as he presented the bill.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Efforts to shift a prospective central Virginia casino to Petersburg also appear to be getting a favorable reception as the committee easily approved legislation adding the smaller, economically struggling city south of Richmond to the list of approved cities. Sen. Lashrecse Aird, D-Petersburg, said she feels her city meets all the criteria lawmakers had in mind when they passed a 2020 law allowing casinos in areas in need of revitalization like Bristol, Danville, Portsmouth and Norfolk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The city of Petersburg more than exhibits that same need,” Aird said this week.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Northern Virginia wasn’t a major part of the state’s initial casino conversation, but a bill to start the process of potentially bringing one, along with a conference center and event venue, to Tysons Corner in Fairfax County also cleared its first hurdle in the Senate.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="mZEv36um6B"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/02/13/why-some-think-going-all-in-on-a-fairfax-county-casino-would-be-a-bust/">Why some think going all in on a Fairfax County casino would be a bust </a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Why some think going all in on a Fairfax County casino would be a bust &#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/02/13/why-some-think-going-all-in-on-a-fairfax-county-casino-would-be-a-bust/embed/#?secret=ljTixK81ME#?secret=mZEv36um6B" data-secret="mZEv36um6B" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Dave Marsden, D-Fairfax, who’s leading the charge for a casino in his region, told lawmakers Northern Virginia isn’t the booming area it once was due to the pandemic-induced shift to remote work. That’s led to empty office space, he said, and weaker incentives for businesses to establish themselves in close proximity to Washington, D.C.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Fairfax County is no longer quite the behemoth that it was,” Marsden said as he argued a casino could reinvigorate the region and keep more of Virginians’ gambling dollars from going across the border to the MGM National Harbor resort in Maryland.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The idea of a Northern Virginia casino </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/02/13/why-some-think-going-all-in-on-a-fairfax-county-casino-would-be-a-bust/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">was floated in last year’s session</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> but was withdrawn before it could be put to a vote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some senators expressed concerns that the potential casino in Northern Virginia doesn’t have the same groundswell of local support that earlier projects did. A representative from Fairfax County told the Senate’s gambling subcommittee that the county didn’t have a position on the bill but wants to preserve its options.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In all the other casinos that we&#8217;ve considered in the past, we&#8217;ve had the local government come forward and ask for the authority to put on a referendum,” said Sen. Adam Ebbin, D-Alexandria, who voted against the bill. “And we&#8217;ve had some demonstrated support from the community.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Northern Virginia casino bill cleared the General Laws committee 10-5-1, a sign it may face a tougher path than the legislation to make Petersburg the state’s fifth casino site.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m not going to vote to go to six,” said Sen. Schuyler VanValkenburg, D-Henrico. “Five is what we voted on back in 2020. Five is an important number. We don&#8217;t want to create a precedent where we are just coming here and letting any old locality get another one.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Jennifer Carroll Foy, D-Prince William, said she’s supporting the Northern Virginia bill because it leaves the final decision in the hands of Fairfax residents if the county chooses to move forward with a casino referendum.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If the people of the area do not want this casino, then they will vote in the negative,” Carroll Foy said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With </span><a href="https://www.axios.com/local/richmond/2023/03/01/norfolk-cruises-virginia-carnival" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more cruise ships expected to be coming in and out of Norfolk</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the Senate committee also gave initial approval to a bill allowing cruise ship casinos to operate off Virginia’s coast. Lawmakers say the bill only applies to cruise ships traveling from port to port and would not allow floating casinos that stay in one spot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is for ticketed passengers as cruise ships come into the port and back out,” said Sen. Jeremy McPike, D-Prince William, the chairman of the General Laws subcommitee that deals with gambling. “Likewise in traversing up to Baltimore up the Chesapeake, when they’re within Virginia they can still have that entertainment available to passengers.”</span></p>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The committee also approved a bill to allow sports betting on college games involving Virginia schools. When the General Assembly legalized sports betting in 2020, lawmakers included a carveout prohibiting wagers involving college sports teams from Virginia but allowed bets on college games in other states. That limitation was meant to shield student athletes from the gambling industry, but some lawmakers feel it’s complicated efforts to bring sports betting into the light and have it taxed and regulated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You see a lot of people who are still gambling on Virginia sports,” said VanValkenburg, who’s sponsoring </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB124" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the bill to lift the college sports restriction</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “They’re doing it in D.C. They&#8217;re doing it in Tennessee. They’re doing it illegally. They’re doing it through a friend. All of our surrounding states can gamble on Virginia universities.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the sports betting bill, prop bets on college sports would still be prohibited, meaning bettors could only wager on the outcome of a game rather than the performance of individual student athletes.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Skill games</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Senate’s gambling committees haven’t provided much clarity on how the chamber will handle skill games, the slots-like machines that spread throughout Virginia gas stations and restaurants. Those machines are now banned, but the industry is pushing to have them taxed and regulated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Wednesday, the General Laws committee briefly discussed an electronic gaming bill filed by McPike that would legalize similar machines seen as competition for skill games but add tougher regulations, such as a higher tax rate, player cards that could be used to exclude minors and people suffering from gambling addiction and stricter rules on how much money the machines can keep versus paying back out to players.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The industry-preferred bill </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2024/01/15/virginia-senators-refuse-to-send-skill-game-bill-to-committee-that-oversees-gambling/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">was routed around the Senate’s gambling committees entirely</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. At Wednesday’s meeting, a key backer of the industry’s bill, Sen. Aaron Rouse, D-Virginia Beach, raised objections to McPike’s bill on the grounds that it hadn’t been put to a vote in the committee’s gambling-specific subcommittee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a brief, private huddle involving Rouse and McPike, the committee agreed to delay action on McPike’s bill for the week.</span></p>

Abigail Spanberger, D-Henrico. (Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Congresswoman Abigail Spanberger is much better known among Virginia Democrats than Richmond Mayor Levar Stoney, according to early poll numbers gauging how familiar voters are with the two Democrats running for governor in 2025.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The poll from the Wason Center for Civic Leadership at Christopher Newport University found 52% of Democrats back Spanberger, 8% support Stoney and 40% are unsure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This early in the campaign season these numbers are likely to heavily reflect name recognition of the candidates and signal that Mayor Stoney has a long way to go in getting his name and message out to voters,” CNU researchers said in their </span><a href="https://cnu.edu/wasoncenter/surveys/archive/2024-01-24.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">summary of the poll’s findings</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spanberger, a former CIA officer, has served in Congress since 2019 after winning several tough elections in her original district in the Richmond suburbs and — after redistricting — a newly drawn district in Northern Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stoney, who has been mayor of the capital city since 2017, is a former executive director of the Democratic Party of Virginia who also served as secretary of the commonwealth under former Gov. Terry McAuliffe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both are seeking the chance to succeed current Gov. Glenn Youngkin when the Republican’s four-year term concludes at the end of 2025. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin can’t run again next year under Virginia’s term limits, but Attorney General Jason Miyares and Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears are considered possible GOP nominees for governor in 2025.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aligning with other recent poll results, the CNU survey of 1,000 registered Virginia voters found 50% approved of Youngkin, compared with 36% approval for President Joe Biden.</span></p>

Glenn Youngkin (Sarah Vogelsong / Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Glenn Youngkin indicated Tuesday he’s unlikely to support </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2024/01/18/virginia-democrats-continue-push-to-hike-state-minimum-wage-to-15/#:~:text=Legislation%20to%20raise%20the%20state,effort%20they%20began%20in%202020." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pending legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> increasing Virginia’s minimum wage, saying market forces do a better job of determining hourly pay rates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking to reporters after a small business-focused event in Richmond, Youngkin stopped short of saying he’d veto a Democratic-backed bill that would raise Virginia’s minimum wage to $13.50 per hour next year and $15 per hour by 2026. But the governor was clear about his belief an increase isn’t necessary.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don&#8217;t think that you need to send a bill because the market is handling it,” Youngkin said. “And they should allow small businesses to handle this.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Democrats took full control of the General Assembly in 2020, they set in motion a plan that gradually raised the minimum wage from the $7.25 federal floor to $12 at the start of 2023. That plan envisioned a pause to assess the impacts of the initial increases, and Democrats are re-upping the proposal this year to try to achieve their initial goal of getting the wage to $15.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The election of a Republican governor in 2021 complicated that plan.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you go around and see what people are paying around the commonwealth of Virginia, there are very rare circumstances where people are paying minimum wage. And yet here we are with lots of economic counsel that says that it harms job growth,” Youngkin said. “So the market is working. Virginians are earning lots of money. We&#8217;ve now gotten our labor participation rate back up to where it was before the pandemic, and now we&#8217;re at a 12-year high.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a speech to a National Federation of Independent Businesses group, Youngkin said he won’t sign any bills coming out of the Democratic-controlled legislature that are “inherently anti-business.” But those bills even being advanced and discussed, he warned, can still set a “tone” that harms Virginia’s competitiveness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The tone that they take with the bills that they are progressing, the tone that they take with the bills that they are not progressing, is not just being watched by the pundits who pay attention to political activity,” Youngkin said. “It is being watched by the business community every single day. And that business community will vote. Not in an election. But when their next expansion opportunity is going to happen. Where that next franchise is going to go. Whether they’re going to go from five employees to eight.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his State of the Commonwealth speech earlier this month, Youngkin vowed to veto any potential effort to repeal Virginia’s right-to-work law, which impedes the ability of labor unions to organize by prohibiting mandatory union membership. The governor reiterated that stance in Tuesday’s address, but his comments on the minimum wage were his most extensive remarks yet on a more concrete piece of pro-worker legislation. Unlike right-to-work repeal, Democratic leaders have identified the minimum wage bill as a top priority.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="https://rga.lis.virginia.gov/Published/2023/SD6/PDF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">state study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> completed last year estimated that roughly 500,000 Virginians made $12 or less per hour as of 2021, with a million workers earning $15 or less. That study noted that data limitations make it difficult to measure the exact size of Virginia’s population earning minimum wage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While Virginia’s minimum wage population could be characterized as small in absolute terms, Virginia nonetheless has the ninth largest minimum wage workforce in the country in absolute terms and the eighth largest in terms of percentage of hourly workers,” the study found.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic lawmakers have said their phased approach to increasing the minimum wage to $15 was a prudent one, and raising the minimum wage further will help workers keep up with the rapid inflation that coincided with the COVID-19 pandemic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a news release celebrating initial votes in favor of the bill to put Virginia on track for a $15 wage, left-leaning advocacy group Progress Virginia said “no one should have to choose between putting food on the dinner table and keeping the lights on.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Working families deserve a raise, and we won’t stop fighting until we make that a reality,” said Progress Virginia Executive Director </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">LaTwyla Mathias.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his remarks to reporters, Youngkin said he has “constructive” relationships with the General Assembly’s new Democratic leaders, but stressed he’s most interested in legislation both parties can support.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Anything that is simply being sent to me in order to elicit a political response is wasted time,” Youngkin said.</span></p>

(Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s assertion this month that the state’s gun laws are already strong enough for his liking isn’t deterring Democrats from moving forward with major proposals limiting access to firearms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Policymaking committees in both chambers of the General Assembly have started to advance significant gun control bills while defeating Republican efforts to repeal existing gun restrictions and make guns legal to carry in more places.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On both sides of the legislature, bills to prohibit future sales of assault-style weapons and high-capacity magazines have passed out of committee on party-line votes. So have bills to ban so-called “ghost guns,” untraceable firearms assembled at home often with do-it-yourself kits that can be purchased online.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other bills have been introduced to impose a five-day waiting period for all firearm purchases, require buyers to prove competency through gun safety courses, create a $500 civil penalty for leaving a handgun visible in an unattended vehicle, remove gun rights from anyone who gets two DUI convictions within five years, prohibit existing assault weapons from being carried in public and require state-issued permits prior to any gun purchase. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of that legislation has not yet been heard in committee. But regardless of how Democratic legislators fine-tune the details, few gun control proposals are expected to win the favor of the Republican governor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Monday, Youngkin spokesman Christian Martinez said the governor will review all legislation but reiterated a line from Youngkin’s recent State of the Commonwealth speech calling Virginia’s gun laws “already among the toughest in the nation.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He’s asking the General Assembly members to hold accountable those criminals that commit crimes with guns by lengthening and making more severe the penalties in order to keep criminals off the streets,” Martinez said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That echoes much of the criticism raised by GOP lawmakers and gun rights groups in committee hearings, where opponents have characterized the proposals as misguided and potentially unconstitutional due to the U.S. Supreme Court’s </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/23/us/supreme-court-ny-open-carry-gun-law.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">newly expanded view</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the right to carry firearms outside the home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But proponents of tougher gun laws appear unswayed, pitching the new bills as common-sense attempts to stop gun violence before it happens rather than doubling down on efforts to pursue lawbreakers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We expect the governor to support these measures and to save lives in the commonwealth,” said Lori Haas, a longtime gun violence prevention activist whose daughter was wounded in the 2007 mass shooting at Virginia Tech.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most votes on gun bills this session have broken down predictably along party lines, with occasionally contentious debate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a House of Delegates subcommittee hearing last week on the assault weapon bill, Del. A.C. Cordoza, R-Hampton, one of the few Black Republicans in state politics, pointedly noted that rifles of any kind are rarely used in gun homicides or suicides. Most gun murders, he said, involve handguns being used against Black men.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Why do you not have a bill that’s going to stop this violence against African Americans?” Cordoza said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Dan Helmer, D-Fairfax, the patron of the assault weapon bill, said Democrats have filed numerous pieces of legislation aimed at stopping more common forms of gun violence.</span></p>
<p>https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/northam-signs-landmark-gun-control-bills-recommends-tweaks-to-two-others/</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I find it deeply disturbing that the delegate has no interest in stopping 5% of the murders in the commonwealth,” Helmer said. “Because I think 5% is too much.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Marcus Simon, D-Fairfax, also jumped in, saying he would be happy to debate Cordoza at any time about which party has a better record of trying to prevent gun violence in communities of color.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is not an either-or situation,” said Simon, who chairs the House Public Safety Committee. “I can’t let that suggestion lay there. I can’t let that go.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The assault weapon bill cleared the House Public Safety Committee last week in an 11-9 vote. Its counterpart in the other chamber got a green light in the Senate Courts of Justice Committee Monday in a 9-6 vote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Defining what assault weapons are has been a challenge for lawmakers in the past. </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+ful+SB2+pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> under consideration this year defines them as weapons capable of being used with high-capacity magazines and other modifications like stocks, grips and suppressors. The proposal excludes such weapons made prior to July 1, a concession that allows assault weapon owners to keep firearms they already purchased legally. The restrictions would only apply to assault weapons manufactured after the ban were to take effect.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Senate committee rejected an effort to repeal Virginia’s so-called red flag law, which was part of a major gun control package Democrats approved in 2020 and allows authorities to temporarily take firearms from people deemed a threat to others or themselves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Glen Sturtevant, R-Chesterfield, made a lawyerly case for the bill’s repeal, indicating he sees it more as a question of due process rights and limitations on government seizures of property. But Democrats on the panel reminded Sturtevant — who lost a swing seat in 2019 and returned this year after unseating former GOP Sen. Amanda Chase in a redder district — that he previously thought red flag laws were a promising idea.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You voted for it in 2019,” said Sen. Creigh Deeds, D-Charlottesville. “Now you want to take it off the books. How come?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sturtevant said the bill that passed in 2020 wasn’t identical to the one he voted for in 2019. The law’s problems, he said, have become more apparent over time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats on the panel disputed that notion, saying the law has now been used more than 1,000 times without any serious legal challenges poking holes in its due process provisions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though Youngkin is widely expected to veto the most sweeping gun bills Democrats send to him, more modest proposals could be more difficult for the governor to flatly reject.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats have been pushing to toughen the state’s laws on safe gun storage via bills that would make gun owners liable if a minor gets ahold of a firearm and uses it to commit a crime.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Presenting a bill to allow fines for gun owners who leave handguns visible to passersby in an unattended vehicle, Sen. Dave Marsden, D-Fairfax, said he hopes the governor can support his proposal to reduce what he described as rampant gun thefts from cars. The bill doesn’t come with criminal penalties, he noted, and he specifically excluded long guns to avoid impacting hunters and others who might have a gun rack in the cab of a truck.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is a minimalist approach to dealing with a huge problem,” Marsden said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gun rights supporters said the proposal effectively fines someone for being the victim of a crime and authorities should instead focus their efforts on catching and prosecuting those who steal guns out of cars.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Punish them,” said Sen. Mark Peake, R-Lynchburg. “Send a message.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One proposal has picked up some bipartisan support in early committee votes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With backing from the Richmond Police Department, freshman Del. Mike Jones, D-Richmond, is sponsoring a bill to ban auto sears, which are small plastic or metal devices that can be used to turn semi-automatic guns into automatics by rapidly emptying all ammunition with a single trigger pull. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That proposal has gotten unanimous support in House committee votes so far, and gun rights groups have said they’re neutral on the matter because the bill largely aligns with federal law that already restricts use of the devices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some Senate Republicans, however, raised concerns that the proposal might be overbroad.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You want these things to be illegal, period, so that criminals can’t get them to harm people with,” said Sen. Richard Stuart, R-Westmoreland, who voted to advance the bill as four of his GOP colleagues opposed it.  “You wouldn’t have an objection to somebody shooting a watermelon in a field? You’ve got 1,500 acres and you’re in a 300-acre field of corn and they want to do it for fun.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Russet Perry, D-Loudoun, said the bill she’s sponsoring is an effort to address a public safety issue posed by widely available devices that help guns spray more bullets with less control.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you’re trying to kill a watermelon,” added gun violence prevention activist Andrew Goddard, “you probably wouldn’t want the gun flailing all over the place anyway.”</span></p>
