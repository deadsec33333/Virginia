<p>But it came with a hitch: the law is due to sunset in 2020.</p>
<p>The Virginia Department of Health&#8217;s goal was to collect enough data to illustrate the programs&#8217; efficacy. But a year away from the sunset, only four sites have been approved, three of which are up and running: <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/11/01/virginias-second-needle-exchange-which-opened-this-month-in-richmond-is-off-to-a-slow-start/" target="_blank">Health Brigade in Richmond</a>, along with the Lenowisco and Mount Rogers health districts.</p>
<p>“It’s a new concept for Virginia, and I think even in the communities where there’s a lot of support, nobody’s really certain who wants to jump on as the lead agent,” said Elaine Martin, director of Virginia’s HIV and hepatitis prevention services.</p>
<p>Needle exchanges, also known as harm-reduction or syringe-services programs, allow injection drug users access to clean needles and a safe place to dispose of their used ones. Reams of public health research show they are an effective way to prevent the spread of deadly infections like HIV and hepatitis C through injection drug use, a particular concern nationwide in light of the opioid epidemic.</p>
<figure id="attachment_3369" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:300px;"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-3369 size-medium" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/PA300544-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/PA300544-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/PA300544-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/PA300544-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/PA300544-696x464.jpg 696w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/PA300544-1068x712.jpg 1068w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/PA300544-630x420.jpg 630w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/PA300544-1920x1280.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Health Brigade in Richmond is providing injection drug users clean needles and syringes in an attempt to stem the spread of HIV and hepatitis C. (Katie O&#8217;Connor/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p>But even with only three programs up and running, VDH has data to show how the programs have worked, at least so far. Virginia&#8217;s sites have distributed 28,000 sterile syringes to participants, and nearly 25,000 have been returned — an 86 percent return rate.</p>
<p>Martin noted that neither VDH nor any of the sites have received complaints from the public or law enforcement about the programs. She said if the sunset is extended, the department could collect more valuable information on the sites.</p>
<p>“We would like more data because, obviously, only one site has been open for a year, and the others have been open for a few months,” Martin said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s clear that the opioid epidemic is not over, even though we are seeing some shifts in drug use to <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/08/01/reflecting-national-trends-meth-arrests-and-deaths-continue-to-climb-in-virginia/" target="_blank">methamphetamines</a>,&#8221; she continued. &#8220;For anybody who is injecting or needs referral to drug treatment — I think we want to keep those doors open.&#8221;</p>
<h2><strong>A fourth site</strong></h2>
<p>There have been several barriers keeping potential sites from opening. The nature of Virginia’s law calls for numerous agencies within each community to sign onto the idea, requiring letters of support from both the locality’s governing body and its <a href="https://www.richmond.com/life/health/needle-exchange-programs-have-yet-to-get-off-the-ground/article_cbff2211-bb12-5366-93dc-80bedbdb7169.html" target="_blank">law enforcement</a> agency.</p>
<p>In Chesterfield County, though the sheriff was interested in starting a program, its <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/11/05/despite-sheriffs-support-chesterfield-countys-opioid-committee-tables-needle-exchange/" target="_blank">Opioid Steering Committee tabled the idea</a>. And in Roanoke, the chief of police refused to give his support for more than a year, <a href="https://www.roanoke.com/news/local/roanoke-chief-supports-new-needle-exchange-plan-officials-say/article_e4926cf0-72c2-519d-8b4d-ba5525fc2040.html" target="_blank">though he changed course in April</a>.</p>
<p>This week, VDH officially approved the Council of Community Services’ application to start a needle exchange in Roanoke.</p>
<p>Colin Dwyer, harm reduction and substance use program coordinator for the Council of Community Services, said the organization doesn’t have a concrete date for opening its program yet, but it hopes to do so sometime in the fall.</p>
<p>That might not provide much time to collect meaningful data on the program before the 2020 General Assembly session, when the sunset will have to be extended.</p>
<p>Dwyer pointed out that more sites coming online will make it easier for others to open, as seeing Health Brigade&#8217;s program made it easier for the Council of Community Services to pull together its application.</p>
<p>&#8220;The more people see it that works and is an effective intervention, the easier it’ll be to make it happen in other places,&#8221; he said.</p>
<h2><strong>Connecting clients to services, naloxone </strong></h2>
<p>The data that VDH does have shows that the sites aren’t just distributing clean needles — they’re also linking people to the services they need.</p>
<p>Of the 241 participants that have enrolled, 69 percent have been tested for HIV and hepatitis C, according to Martin. Thirty-six percent had confirmed hepatitis C, and 41 clients were connected to treatment. Though none tested positive for HIV, two others who were known to have the virus were successfully connected to care as well.</p>
<p>Another 85 participants received referrals to substance use disorder treatment, and 28 attended their first appointments. Eight participants reported becoming abstinent from drug use.</p>
<p>Breanne Forbes-Hubbard, population health manager with the Mount Rogers Health District, said in an email that some of the comprehensive harm reduction program participants have accepted a wide range of additional services, from medical care and birth control to food banks and parenting classes.</p>
<p>She said one of the participants who tested positive for hepatitis C received treatment and was cured, while three have stopped using substances.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we ask participants why they are involved with our services, some have responded that they want to get a better job than what they currently have, that they want to go back to school to get their master&#8217;s degree, or that they want to be a better parent to their children than their parents were to them,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The sites also distribute naloxone, the opioid-reversal drug, and Martin said that there have been 32 overdose reversals reported by participants.</p>
<p>“To me, that’s really compelling — that 32 lives may have been saved,” Martin said.</p>
<h2><strong>Slow starts</strong></h2>
<p>Not only has it taken time for the programs to get off the ground, but it is also a slow process to convince participants to trust that the needle exchanges aren’t simply traps intent on getting them in trouble with the law.</p>
<p>Colin King, comprehensive harm reduction program associate with Health Brigade in Richmond, said the program started slowly, but participation began improving around the start of the year, and now 10 or more participants typically visit during the days the site is open. Often those are returning clients, though they usually see at least one new participant, as well, he said.</p>
<p>Key to Health Brigade’s approach is meeting clients without judgment: allowing them to simply obtain clean needles or to be connected to additional services if they’re interested without pressuring them.</p>
<p>“Each participant that comes in here is different and unique and uses drugs for different reasons,” King said. “People use drugs for recreation, sometimes because it’s cheaper to buy on the street than it is from a pharmacy, because of past trauma or mental health issues… Substance use is a very complex space.”</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.vhha.com/communications/new-poll-shows-virginians-strongly-support-medicaid-expansion-view-hospitals-favorably-believe-copn-should-be-maintained/" target="_blank">poll</a> — commissioned by the Virginia Hospital &amp; Healthcare Association and conducted by Mason-Dixon Polling &amp; Strategy — found that 71 percent of the 800 Virginians polled approved of expanding the program.</p>
<p>According to VHHA, the poll was commissioned &#8220;to help identify health care issues of concern to Virginians and to inform the association&#8217;s approach to development corresponding public policy solutions,&#8221; a news release states.</p>
<p>Three-fourths of responders were not aware that hospitals &#8220;are the only health care sector partner making financial contributions to the state (totaling roughly $300 million each year) to cover the state&#8217;s share of Medicaid expansion costs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hospitals pay a <a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/virginia/government-politics/general-assembly/as-va-budget-fight-resumes-hospitals-balance-benefits-of-expanding/article_9573ac93-57f1-5261-9f82-fc4850767e31.html" target="_blank">provider tax</a> that funds Virginia&#8217;s share of Medicaid expansion, while the federal government picks up the bulk of the tab. Virginia&#8217;s hospitals agreed to the tax last year during the budget battle over expansion.</p>
<p>The poll also delved into the fraught <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/01/08/the-story-behind-the-certificate-of-need-what-it-is-why-it-exists-and-why-it-has-been-a-thorn-in-virginias-side-for-decades/" target="_blank">Certificate of Public Need</a>, or COPN, debate, which is meant to control the number of medical facilities and services available in different regions of the state. Opponents say it stifles competition that could lower prices for patients.</p>
<p>Hospitals have traditionally supported the program, and 55 percent of those polled say it should remain in place while 13 percent say it should be eliminated and 32 percent responded &#8220;Not sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>The poll also queried respondents about a more recent debate in Virginia health care: balance billing, otherwise known as surprise medical bills, which can happen when a patient at an in-network facility gets a doctor or other provider who isn&#8217;t, then gets hit with a hefty bill. An attempt by lawmakers to end the practice for emergency room visits <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/02/21/lawmakers-vowed-to-do-something-about-balance-billing-this-session-they-didnt/" target="_blank">collapsed under the weight of the two arguing sides</a>: hospitals and doctors on one end, and insurers on the other.</p>
<p>According to the poll, 51 percent believe insurance companies should be held financially responsible for paying the balance that would otherwise be sent to the patients. Another 19 percent said the hospital should be responsible, 14 percent said the patient and 6 percent said the doctor should be responsible.</p>
<p>In addition to the 51 percent who think insurers should be responsible for the balance (in a balance billing scenario), 14 percent think the patient should be responsible, 6 percent think the doctor, and 19 percent think the hospital should be responsible.</p>
<p>While 55 percent think the COPN program should be kept, 13 percent think it should be eliminated and 32 percent say they&#8217;re not sure.</p>

(Katie O'Connor / Virginia Mercury)</p><p>Virginia’s psychiatric hospitals are dangerously full. Though considered safest when operating at 85 percent capacity, often nearly every single bed is taken.</p>
<p>Yet at any given time, many of those patients have been deemed ready for discharge, but they remain in the hospital because they have nowhere else to go.</p>
<p>In May, there were 246 people on the state’s Extraordinary Barriers to Discharge List, meaning some extenuating circumstance has prevented them from leaving the hospital, most often because there is no appropriate provider or facility in their community able to offer them care. May marked the largest the list has been in the past five years.</p>
<p>In total for the 2019 fiscal year, there was an average of 186.7 people on the list, compared to 167.2 in 2018 and 186.6 in 2017, said Daniel Herr, deputy commissioner for facility services with the Department of Health and Developmental Services.</p>
<p>The list illustrates the <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/12/03/you-have-no-control-as-psychiatric-admissions-rise-virginia-grapples-with-a-hospital-crisis-that-threatens-care-and-safety/" target="_blank">numerous pressures squeezing state hospitals</a>. Not only have they seen a huge influx of admissions over the last five years, they have also consistently had trouble finding a place for those patients to go once their treatment is complete.</p>
<p>The core challenge in Virginia, Herr said, is that the state divides its funds about equally between crisis services, including state hospitals, and community services. Most other states invest 75 percent of their funds into the community and only 25 percent in the state hospitals.</p>
<p>Advocates often argue that the problem is twofold: There aren’t enough community services to prevent people from experiencing psychiatric crises in the first place, and there aren’t enough places for them to stay, either long-term or as a transitional option, in the community once they finish their treatment in the hospital.</p>
<p>“Hundreds of individuals are being held in violation of their constitutional rights,” said Colleen Miller, executive director of the disAbility Law Center of Virginia, which released a <a href="https://www.dlcv.org/hundreds-trapped-in-state-hospitals-unable-to-move-to-the-community" target="_blank">report</a> on the discharge list last month. “This is the highest number of people we have ever seen who are ready to move to the community and can’t because the community is not resourced enough to meet those needs.”</p>
<h2><strong>Lingering in the hospital</strong></h2>
<p>In May, 18 percent of all adult residents receiving care in one of the state’s psychiatric hospitals were on the Extraordinary Barriers to Discharge list, according to the report.</p>
<p>Herr noted that there were about 20 fewer patients on the list in June and said that, while the size of the list is concerning, May was likely an outlier.</p>
<p>But on average there are more than 100 people stuck in the hospital even though their clinicians have said they&#8217;re ready for discharge.</p>
<p>“I can’t imagine what that would do for that individual’s mental health,” said Rhonda Thissen, executive director of the National Alliance on Mental Illness of Virginia. “They&#8217;re around people who are still in crisis, or that need long-term care, and this person is ready to go home and ready to be out and live a normal life in the community.”</p>
<p>Ultimately, lingering in the hospital for weeks on end can potentially undo the work that patients may have completed in the hospital, Herr said.</p>
<p>It can deteriorate trust between patients and therapeutic providers because they might think their caregivers aren’t doing enough to help them make the transition out of the hospital.</p>
<p>It could even result in behaviors that might get in the way of their discharge.</p>
<p>“If someone started anger management or has a history of aggression and, in a period of being frustrated or angry, does something in the hospital — all these things can then actually delay the discharge,” Herr said. “For some individuals, it can actually increase the psychiatric symptoms that brought them into the hospital in the first place because of the stress and frustration it can cause.”</p>
<h2><strong>Various barriers</strong></h2>
<p>Each of the individuals on the Extraordinary Barriers to Discharge List has been waiting to be discharged for at least two weeks. But on average, people are on the list for more than four months, according to the disAbility Law Center of Virginia report.</p>
<p>The barriers themselves vary. Typically, between 50 and 60 of the people on the Extraordinary Barriers to Discharge List have received a not guilty by reason of insanity acquittal, as well. Finding placements for them after they leave the hospital is especially complex, Herr said, because the court is also involved in their cases.</p>
<p>And often those patients, like the rest of the people on the extraordinary barriers list, require providers who can handle their situations.</p>
<p>The patients may have not only a psychiatric diagnosis, but also a substance use disorder, a developmental disability or a complex medical condition.</p>
<p>“Finding providers with specialized skill sets to do all that is always an issue,” Herr said.</p>
<p>Most often, people on the list are waiting for a nursing home or assisted living facility that will take them —  <a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/virginia/a-place-to-sleep-many-of-virginia-s-mentally-ill/article_859274aa-6938-509d-bfe7-ef2050cc71fe.html" target="_blank">housing is a major challenge for people with mental illness</a> in Virginia. They often cycle between unstable housing, homelessness, jail and the hospital.</p>
<p>“These housing issues are really problematic,” Thissen said.</p>
<p>Nursing homes and assisted living facilities can refuse to accept patients, depending on their histories. Virginia has grappled with the problem of housing and mental illness for years, often relying on assisted living facilities who accept recipients of Virginia’s <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/10/01/despite-deaths-dozens-of-violations-and-revoked-licenses-richmond-assisted-living-facility-remains-open/" target="_blank">auxiliary grant</a> program to take people with serious mental illness.</p>
<p>But there are fewer and fewer facilities accepting auxiliary grants, with operators often arguing the reimbursement is too low. In 2017, fewer than 300 of the 580 licensed assisted living facilities in the state accepted auxiliary grant residents, according to the Department for Aging and Rehabilitative Services, which administers the program. And many of the facilities that accept the program often only take a limited number of residents.</p>
<h2><strong>&#8216;There is something deeply broken&#8217;</strong></h2>
<p>Over the past several years, Virginia’s lawmakers have <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/02/27/with-a-mental-health-system-in-crisis-virginia-lawmakers-inch-toward-stabilization/" target="_blank">pumped millions of dollars</a> into the state&#8217;s mental health system to attempt to shift more money into community services — to keep people out of the hospital in the first place.</p>
<p>The General Assembly has devoted more money to addressing the Extraordinary Barriers to Discharge list, Herr said. In 2015, the Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services had $22 million in discharge assistance funds to help people transition out of the hospital, but for the 2020 fiscal year it has more $32 million.</p>
<p>But there is still a long way to go. In April, May and June of this year, the state hospitals were operating at 97 and 98 percent capacity, Herr said.</p>
<p>With the discharge list spiking in May, advocates are pointing again to housing as a major priority. The evidence-based model known as permanent supportive housing is often lauded as the best option for people with serious mental illness. It allows the resident to choose her or his own independent housing, but surrounds them with the services they need, like case management and counseling, so they can remain stably housed.</p>
<p>Lawmakers put $5 million toward permanent supportive housing this year and has allowed auxiliary grant recipients to transition into it, as well.</p>
<p>“If we had more of those services in the community, moving those people on and upward into permanent supportive housing frees up nursing homes and assisted living facility beds for the folks coming out of the state hospital who need them,” Thissen said.</p>
<p>That would alleviate the Extraordinary Barriers to Discharge list — and get people out of the hospital who no longer need to be there.</p>
<p>“They’re in a very condensed congregate setting, which is not the way any of us do well, not the way any of us thrive,” Miller said. “There is something deeply broken in the system.”</p>

(Image via USDA)</p><p>The <a href="https://www.dgif.virginia.gov/wildlife/feral-hogs/hunting-faq/" target="_blank">frequently asked questions</a> page on the Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries&#8217; website says it best.</p>
<p>&#8220;Feral hogs are four-legged ecological disasters.&#8221;</p>
<p>Earlier this week the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/06/us/feral-pigs-twitter-trnd/index.html" target="_blank">“30-50 feral hogs”</a> meme swarmed the internet, an unexpected by-product of the nationwide gun debate.</p>
<p>But in many parts of the country, including Virginia, feral hogs have posed a huge threat to natural habitats and endangered plants and animals, according to DGIF. They multiply fast, have few  or no natural predators aside from humans and, once established, are nearly impossible to eradicate.</p>
<p>Starting in the 1980s, the population of feral hogs exploded in the southeastern U.S. — a phenomenon wildlife experts deemed “the pig bomb.” The USDA estimates there are over <a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/wildlifedamage/operational-activities/feral-swine/sa-fs-history" target="_blank">6 million</a> pigs in 35 states.</p>
<p>Feral hogs are considered a nuisance species in Virginia state code. Not only are they destructive to their environment, including agriculture, they carry <a href="https://www.dgif.virginia.gov/wp-content/uploads/feral-hogs-disease-concerns.pdf" target="_blank">diseases</a> that can spread to livestock or humans, such as swine brucellosis or tularemia, also known as rabbit fever. Plus, they&#8217;re smart and often evade traps.</p>
<p>In Virginia, DGIF, the United State Department of Agriculture and animal control agencies started getting reports of populations of hogs popping up in the state around 2010, according to Aaron Proctor, a policy analyst and wildlife biologist with DGIF.</p>
<p>“There were groups of loose wild hogs in areas where we know there weren’t wild hogs before, and they were always there under suspicious pretenses,” Proctor said. “They were either more feral-looking colors — which means longer, more coarse hair than your typical pink colored, barnyard pigs — or they were shy of humans. But these things don’t pick up from North or South Carolina and walk dozens or hundreds of miles north overnight.”</p>
<p>Nobody knew where the hogs were coming from, which suggested they were getting human help. They were so numerous in some eastern parts of the state that <a href="https://pilotonline.com/news/government/virginia/article_75036c0a-7741-53b2-a1d7-f28f0f44c54f.html" target="_blank">helicopters</a> were called in to take out some of the wily critters.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have to suspect that there have been and currently are people moving feral hogs to new areas where feral hogs didn’t exist previously and releasing them for sporting (hunting) purposes,&#8221; DGIF says.</p>
<p>With the ultimate goal of freeing the Virginia landscape of the feral hog, DGIF started a campaign working with USDA to nab hogs in the field and remove them. But they also worked to educate and dissuade people from bringing them in for hunting in the first place.</p>
<p>Unlike deer and bear populations, hunting isn&#8217;t an effective way to control feral hogs.</p>
<p>“All you do is create more hog hunting and incentivize those who want to bring them in,” Proctor explained. “Which is illegal.”</p>
<p>The public education campaign was successful, and people started calling in sightings of hogs to have them removed, he said. Now, the USDA Wildlife Services division has largely taken over the effort to root out all the pigs. Between <a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/wildlife_damage/feral_swine/images/2017-feral-swine-distribution-map-county.jpg" target="_blank">2017</a> and <a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/wildlife_damage/feral_swine/images/2018-feral-swine-distribution-map.jpg" target="_blank">2018</a>, fewer Virginia counties were plagued with feral hogs, according to the USDA.</p>
<p>That’s good news for the state, because feral hog populations can balloon fast. One conservationist told the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/virginia-acts-to-reduce-population-of-wild-pigs-the-most-invasive-animal-in-us/2013/11/24/aa4077ca-52b9-11e3-9e2c-e1d01116fd98_story.html?noredirect=on" target="_blank">Washington Post</a> in 2013 that, if pigs build a strong presence in the state, they would be as numerous and common in suburban settings as deer — or more so.</p>

(Ned Oliver/ Virginia Mercury)
</p><p>Methamphetamine arrests and overdose deaths are climbing in Virginia, reflecting a national trend amid a crackdown on opioids.</p>
<p>Seizures of methamphetamine spiked between 2017 and 2018, <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/07/29/745061185/seizures-of-methamphetamine-are-surging-in-the-u-s?utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=atc&amp;utm_term=nprnews&amp;utm_content=20190729" target="_blank">NPR reported</a>, marking a national resurgence of the highly addictive stimulant that Virginia has also seen.</p>
<p>Preliminary data from the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner for the <a href="http://www.vdh.virginia.gov/content/uploads/sites/18/2019/07/Quarterly-Drug-Death-Report-FINAL-Q1-2019.pdf" target="_blank">first quarter of 2019</a> shows that an upward trend in methamphetamine deaths has continued, with 47 deaths in the first three months of this year, making it the deadliest quarter Virginia has seen in terms of meth overdoses in at least 12 years.</p>
<p>The office is now projecting there will be 160 methamphetamine deaths this year, up from 127 last year. In 2015, there were only 29 deaths.</p>
<p>According to NPR, seizures of meth rose by 142% nationally between 2017 and 2018. In that same time in Virginia, arrests related to meth jumped from about 2,500 to 3,500, state police numbers show. In 2009, there were only 442 arrests.</p>
<div class="flourish-embed" data-src="visualisation/551425"></div>
<p><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>&#8220;It&#8217;s a big concern,&#8221; said Rosie Hobron, statewide forensic epidemiologist with the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner. &#8220;We&#8217;ve been dealing with the opioid crisis for years, but we&#8217;re starting to see upticks of the non-opioid drugs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some drug users have <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/08/09/as-opioid-epidemic-drags-on-meth-deaths-also-start-to-rise/" target="_blank">turned to meth</a> as prescription painkillers have become more difficult to obtain. Whereas it was once known to be made in homemade batches, increasingly meth is coming into the U.S. from Mexico, particularly as the U.S. has been cracking down on opioids entering the country.</p>
<p>But methamphetamine is typically not as lethal as other drugs, like opioids, Hobron pointed out. Many of the meth overdose deaths seen in Virginia have been from a combination of not just meth, but fentanyl, as well — an especially deadly opioid.</p>
<p>Last year, 46.5 percent of the fatal methamphetamine overdoses in Virginia also involved fentanyl. Officials saw the same pattern with heroin deaths: People will use one drug, heroin or methamphetamine, sometimes without realizing that the drug dealer had mixed in fentanyl.</p>
<h2><strong>Potentially more drug deaths</strong></h2>
<p>State health officials are projecting that this year the number of fatal drug overdoses will continue its nearly 10-year upward trajectory, <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/were-cautiously-optimistic-drug-data-shows-a-dip-in-opioid-deaths-but-meth-fatalities-skyrocket/" target="_blank">despite a slight decrease last year</a>.</p>
<p>The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner is currently predicting 1,546 deaths from all drugs this year, which would be 60 more than last year and nearly 500 more than five years ago.</p>
<p>Hobron said her office projects the number of fatalities for the year based on the previous four quarters. There were 395 deaths from all drugs — including opioids, methamphetamine, cocaine and others — in the first three months of this year, compared to 354 deaths in the fourth quarter of last year.</p>
<p>The projections can change from quarter to quarter, Hobron said. In the middle of last year her office was expecting a greater decline overall for the year — until that changed after a particularly deadly third quarter.</p>
<p>Right now, the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner is predicting that this year could be the deadliest that the state has seen in terms of opioid overdoses. It&#8217;s projecting nearly twice as many fatal opioid overdoses this year than Virginia saw in 2013.</p>
<p>&#8220;It could potentially be the highest we&#8217;ve seen,&#8221; Hobron said.</p>

<p>Virginia hit the 300,000 enrollees mark last week, and Gov. Ralph Northam announced the milestone on Wednesday at Neighborhood Health, a health center in Alexandria with 12 locations around northern Virginia.</p>
<p>Nearly 100,000 of those who have signed up have already received treatment for a <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/05/21/thousands-of-medicaid-expansion-patients-have-diabetes-cancer-addiction-new-data-shows/" target="_blank">chronic disease</a> such as diabetes, heart disease, cancer or substance use disorder, said Dr. Jennifer Lee, Virginia&#8217;s Medicaid director. But before they were covered by Medicaid, they rarely had access to care, she said.</p>
<p>Nearly 80 percent of expansion adults had trouble paying medical bills in the year before they enrolled in Medicaid, Lee said. About two-thirds of them said in a survey that they often struggled to have enough money to pay for food, frequently going without needed medical care because they couldn&#8217;t afford it.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re all going to have a day when we don&#8217;t feel well and we need to go see a provider,&#8221; Northam said during Wednesday&#8217;s announcement. &#8220;Nobody in Virginia — nobody really in the richest country in the world, if you think about it — should have to make a decision of whether they stay home and put food on the table or go see a provider.&#8221;</p>
<p>The state estimated that nearly 400,000 people would be eligible for Medicaid under the expansion rules. Lee said in an interview that this fall her department is going to start reaching out to the populations who haven&#8217;t signed up yet, particularly parents of kids enrolled in Medicaid and Spanish-speaking populations.</p>
<p>Dr. Basim Khan, Neighborhood Health&#8217;s executive director, said former Gov. Terry McAuliffe toured the health center five years earlier and spoke about the importance of passing Medicaid expansion. But after years of back-and-forth between Democrats and Republicans, the state didn&#8217;t pass expansion until a <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/07/23/four-years-of-political-battling-over-medicaid-expansion-has-ended-what-comes-next/" target="_blank">special session last year</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;For the last five years — and I credit Gov. McAuliffe and his staff — we worked hard, we fought every day, and just couldn&#8217;t get it done until this past year,&#8221; said Northam, who served as McAuliffe&#8217;s lieutenant governor. &#8220;It took bipartisan support.&#8221;</p>
<p>To clinch that bipartisan support, lawmakers agreed to institute <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/state-expects-medicaid-work-requirement-approval-no-later-than-the-summer/" target="_blank">work requirements</a> for Medicaid members. The state is still waiting on approval from the federal government to do so, but in other states, the effort has been blocked by the courts. Earlier this week, a federal judge <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/federal-judge-strikes-down-new-hampshires-medicaid-work-requirements/2019/07/29/a8e7fb6c-b237-11e9-951e-de024209545d_story.html?utm_term=.f1fc9dec2701" target="_blank">struck down</a> the work requirement program in New Hampshire, following Kentucky and Arkansas.</p>
<p>Lee said her agency is following the court decisions closely, but pointed out that, at this point, Virginia&#8217;s work requirement program rests with the federal government as it awaits permission to implement.</p>
<p><a href="http://gatehousenews.com/ruralhospitals/financialtroubles/" target="_blank">A report</a> out this week from Gatehouse News found that states that refused to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act were more likely to have shuttered or struggling rural hospitals.</p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>For Kim Bobo, co-executive director of the Virginia Interfaith Center for Public Policy, the issue is simple.</p>
<p>&#8220;How can we call ourselves a civilized society and not allow people to take a few days of paid sick time for themselves or their kids?&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The Richmond-based, nonprofit organization is working on legislation for Virginia lawmakers to consider that would provide five paid sick days to full-time employees, while exempting employers with five or fewer employees.</p>
<p>So far, 13 states and numerous cities have instituted mandatory paid sick days, with <a href="https://www.nevadacurrent.com/blog/nevadasenate-passes-paid-sick-leave/" target="_blank">Nevada</a> and <a href="https://www.pressherald.com/2019/05/28/maine-workforce-gets-paid-sick-days/" target="_blank">Maine</a> doing so earlier this year, according to <a href="http://familyvaluesatwork.org/states" target="_blank">Families Value @ Work</a>, a national paid leave advocacy group. Another eight states, plus Washington, D.C., have created paid Family and Medical Leave programs.</p>
<p>Though the two are similar, leave typically refers to long-term situations, like for pregnancy or a prolonged illness. Sick days are exactly what they sound like: The chance for workers to simply take a day off if they or a family member is sick.</p>
<p>The Interfaith Center supports both options, Bobo said, though it is pushing for paid sick days specifically this year. Five days per year is a reasonable standard, she argues.</p>
<p>According to a 2015 estimate by the <a href="http://www.nationalpartnership.org/our-work/resources/workplace/paid-sick-days/workers-access-to-paid-sick-days-in-the-states.pdf" target="_blank">Institute for Women&#8217;s Policy Research</a>, about 41 percent of Virginia workers do not have access to paid sick days. That&#8217;s about 1.2 million workers.</p>
<p>Though it was named the <a href="https://wtop.com/business-finance/2019/07/virginia-back-on-top-on-cnbc-top-states-for-business/" target="_blank">top state to do business</a> earlier this month, Virginia came in at <a href="https://policy-practice.oxfamamerica.org/work/poverty-in-the-us/best-states-to-work/" target="_blank">number 51</a> (the rankings include Washington, D.C.) overall in Oxfam&#8217;s Best and Worst States to Work in America for 2018, Virginia AFL-CIO President Doris Crouse-Mays&#8217; pointed out in a <a href="https://bluevirginia.us/2019/07/virginia-afl-cio-president-doris-crouse-mays-virginias-1-for-business-and-last-for-workers" target="_blank">column</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Workers are really struggling, both because we still have the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour and because there are very few standards in Virginia,&#8221; Bobo said.</p>
<p>Legislation has been submitted to the General Assembly pretty consistently over the last few years, whether for paid <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=191&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=HB2120" target="_blank">Family and Medical Leave</a> or for <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?171+sum+SB824" target="_blank">paid sick days</a>. But in the Republican-controlled legislature, the bills rarely make it out of committee.</p>
<p>Bobo, though, is optimistic about the chances of her organization&#8217;s legislation. Though she said the Interfaith Center is working with Sen. Barbara Favola, D-Fairfax, and Del. Lashrecse Aird, D-Petersburg, she is hoping that Republican cosponsors will sign on.</p>
<p>&#8220;And there will be some who say: &#8216;Well, we don&#8217;t think there should be a standard, people will voluntarily do it,'&#8221; Bobo said. &#8220;Well, they would have done it and they have not.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nicole Riley, Virginia state director for the National Federation of Independent Businesses, argues that, with Virginia&#8217;s economy doing well, small business owners who can make paid sick days available to their employees likely already have.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unfortunately, when you have a broad mandate that requires one-size-fits-all, it really restricts the flexibility that small business owners have in providing paid leave that really works for the employees,&#8221; she argues.</p>
<p>Riley said she hasn&#8217;t seen the proposal for five sick days, but she noted that “In general our members would still have concerns how a mandate, no matter how small it may seem, would limit their flexibility in setting employees benefits that work for both the employee and employer.”</p>
<p>Mandates would likely require businesses to cut staff, Riley said. NFIB has made similar arguments when leave proposals were floated in other states and cities, such as <a href="https://www.nfib.com/content/news/labor/watch-this-why-mandating-paid-sick-leave-hurts-small-business/" target="_blank">Austin</a>, Texas, last year.</p>
<p>&#8220;The amount of paperwork that they would have to do to comply with these new mandates is actually pretty burdensome for small business owners,&#8221; Riley said. &#8220;A lot of people forget that they don&#8217;t have a human resources department or compliance officers that handle this stuff like a large corporation does.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Bobo points to studies that show paid sick day policies are cost-effective. In a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/research-rounds/resroundsv3n4.html" target="_blank">2017 report</a>, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that paid sick leave could help reduce absenteeism related to the spread of flu and other illnesses. If employees with the flu had the option to stay home, they could prevent coworkers from getting infected. The CDC estimated it would save employers almost $1 to $2 billion in absenteeism costs.</p>
<p>The public health benefits are just one of the slew of reasons Bobo said the Interfaith Center is supporting paid sick days. Another major issue is children&#8217;s health and preventing sick kids from going to school.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s absolutely critical for children, when they&#8217;re sick, to be able to stay home, which means a parent has to stay home with them,&#8221; she said. &#8220;If you have no paid sick days, it&#8217;s really a tough choice, particularly for low-wage workers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kids sent to school sick infect other students and their teachers, and Bobo said teachers have told her that sometimes older children will be made to stay home from school to be with their sick, younger siblings so their parents can go to work.</p>
<p>&#8220;For the average low-wage worker, if you lose three-and-a-half days of work due to being sick — that&#8217;s a month&#8217;s worth of groceries,&#8221; Bobo added. &#8220;So the connection between paid sick days and food insecurity is also really clear.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Department of Health <a href="http://www.vdh.virginia.gov/news/2019-news-releases/update-virginia-department-of-health-is-investigating-an-increase-in-intestinal-illness-associated-with-cyclospora/" target="_blank">issued a news release</a> notifying state residents that an increase in cases of cyclosporiasis that began in mid-June has persisted, with 39 confirmed cases compared to a year-to-date average of just nine cases in the past five years.</p>
<p>The investigation began in northern Virginia, but an additional outbreak was identified in the central region. VDH specifically notes that it is currently investigating cafeterias in the Capital One and Valo Park buildings in McLean, as well as the CarMax in Richmond.</p>
<p>Cyclosporiasis is caused by a microscopic parasite, but it&#8217;s unlikely to be spread from one person to another, according to the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/cyclosporiasis/index.html" target="_blank">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>. It is usually spread through food, but Virginia&#8217;s public health officials have yet to identify a food or water source of the outbreaks.</p>
<p>Outbreaks have been linked to produce, &#8220;such as raspberries, basil, arugula, snow peas, mesclun lettuce and cilantro,&#8221; the VDH news release states. There were 39 <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/cyclosporiasis/outbreaks/index.html" target="_blank">outbreaks</a> of the illness in the U.S. between 2000 and 2017.</p>
<p>Symptoms typically start within one to two weeks of exposure and include diarrhea, loss of appetite, weight loss, abdominal cramping and nausea.</p>
<p>&#8220;If untreated, the illness may last for a few days to a month or longer and may seem to go away but come back again,&#8221; the news release states.</p>
<p>The department says washing hands and fruits and vegetables thoroughly is the best way to prevent the infection.</p>

<p>Drugs and alcohol, though, were the most frequently reported methods of attempted suicide.</p>
<p>The report might reignite discussions within the military around limiting access to firearms to reduce the suicide rate among active-duty personnel, reports Patricia Kim with <a href="https://www.military.com/daily-news/2019/07/20/new-military-suicide-report-may-revive-debate-over-gun-restrictions.html" target="_blank">Military.com</a>.</p>
<p>Public health researchers have pointed to restricting gun access as a means of reducing suicides. According to the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, studies show that when a particularly lethal method is <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/means-matter/means-matter/saves-lives/" target="_blank">less available</a>, “suicide rates by that method decline.”</p>
<p>In Virginia, <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/06/16/the-number-one-form-of-gun-violence-in-virginia-isnt-homicide-its-suicide/" target="_blank">the most common form of fatal gun violence is suicide</a>. In 2017, about half of the 1,157 suicides that occurred in the state involved a firearm. When it came together for a special session earlier this month, the General Assembly did not act to limit accessibility to firearms. There were nearly 129,400 active duty military personnel in Virginia as of March 31, second only to California,<a href="https://www.dmdc.osd.mil/appj/dwp/dwp_reports.jsp" target="_blank"> according to the Department of Defense</a>. In 2017, the Republican-controlled legislature <a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/virginia-lawmakers-debate-letting-off-duty-military-members-carry-concealed/article_8bdae91f-00a5-51b2-8d0e-a6d9dddcc026.html" target="_blank">passed a bill</a> allowing anyone with a valid military ID to carry a concealed firearm without a permit, <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?171+sum+SB1362" target="_blank">though it was vetoed</a> by then-Gov. Terry McAuliffe.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2735465" target="_blank">study</a> looking into suicide risk among U.S. Army soldiers, published in June in the Journal of the American Medical Association, found that “firearm accessibility was associated with a significant increase in the risk of suicide” in the psychological autopsy of 135 soldiers.</p>
<p>“This study suggests that identifying possible targets for intervention, such as promoting the separate storage of guns and ammunition as well as discouraging public carrying of firearms when not required for military duties, has important implications for suicide prevention,” it states.</p>
<p>The Department of Defense study also found that about half of those who died by suicide “did not have a documented behavioral health diagnosis.”</p>
<p>Active-duty military suicides in 2018 <a href="https://www.military.com/daily-news/2019/01/30/active-duty-military-suicides-near-record-highs-2018.html" target="_blank">hit the highest number</a> in at least six years, military.com reported.</p>

<p>As the president of Virginia&#8217;s Kids Belong, Kelly, the former secretary of the commonwealth in Gov. Bob McDonnell’s administration, spends her days in meeting after meeting with faith leaders, government workers, elected officials and others, leaning on her experience in state government to try to win more support for foster families, children who have aged out of the system, their birth families and social workers.</p>
<p>“I can’t let go of it,” she said. “I live it every day. I see the stakes every day.”</p>
<p>Kelly fell into her work unintentionally. She had a chance encounter with a woman who was lost and pregnant in a Richmond-area shopping center in 2010. They became friends and eventually Kelly and her husband adopted the woman’s son. Their arrangement is often referred to as fictive <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/06/02/they-forgot-about-us-thousands-of-families-are-doing-the-same-work-as-foster-parents-in-virginia-without-the-support/" target="_blank">kinship care</a>, meaning they aren’t blood related but have a strong relationship with the birth mother.</p>
<p>Virginia’s Kids Belong has been working in about a dozen localities in Virginia so far, ranging from southwest to northern Virginia. Kelly describes the organization as a connector. Almost everyone wants to help kids, she said, but not everyone understands how. Her organization shows them the way, by connecting different parts of the community with their department of social services to meet the needs of families in their area.</p>
<p>“It’s a grind,” she said. “It’s meetings and meetings and meetings and at the end of every meeting I am just asking: ‘What can you do to help kids?’”</p>

<h2><strong>Virginia Fosters</strong></h2>
<p>Virginia’s Kids Belong describes itself as the “catalyst partner” for the <a href="https://www.virginiafosters.org/" target="_blank">Virginia Fosters campaign</a>, a statewide initiative with the immediate goal of adding 1,000 new foster families to Virginia by July 2020.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the state hired Leslie Frazier, who already worked in Gov. Ralph Northam’s office on issues involving veterans, as the campaign director for Virginia Fosters. Though she is officially employed by the Department of Social Services, she still works out of Northam’s office.</p>
<p>“It gives the ability for the campaign to have that high-level visibility,” Frazier said, adding that she wants the campaign to last in perpetuity, and not be something that disappears after just a few years.</p>
<p>“The Virginia Fosters campaign is really a component of a much larger, comprehensive effort around foster care reform in Virginia,” said Gena Boyle Berger, Virginia’s deputy secretary of health and human resources. “We have a lot of system redesign going on, and this is just one of the really complex, but important, pieces of that puzzle.”</p>
<p>The timing around the campaign and Virginia’s Kids Belong ramping up its work has been made all the more relevant by the effort within the Department of Social Services to implement the <a href="http://www.ncsl.org/research/human-services/family-first-prevention-services-act-ffpsa.aspx" target="_blank">Family First Prevention Services Act</a>. The federal act allows states to, for the first time, put significant funds toward prevention services for families, rather than just responding when a situation has deteriorated and a child needs to enter foster care.</p>
<p>The push also coincides with a biting <a href="http://jlarc.virginia.gov/pdfs/reports/Rpt513-2.pdf" target="_blank">report</a> on Virginia&#8217;s foster care system released by the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission in December. In many ways, the report helped fuel the reform effort. Among many problems the report identified, it found that Virginia’s system has a <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/12/11/its-very-unfortunate-for-these-children-state-report-highlights-health-and-safety-problems-in-virginias-foster-care-system/" target="_blank">severe lack of foster parents</a>, with 79 percent of local department staff reporting a shortage of foster families in their localities. They especially have trouble finding families for kids with disabilities, large sibling groups and teens.</p>
<p>The state also one of the worst rates of children aging out of foster care without a permanent connection, a circumstance that positions them for <a href="https://www.nfyi.org/51-useful-aging-out-of-foster-care-statistics-social-race-media/" target="_blank">a host of negative outcomes</a>.</p>
<p>At the <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/03/27/new-campaign-aims-to-fix-virginias-severe-shortage-of-foster-families/" target="_blank">launch event for Virginia Fosters in March</a>, an array of state politicians threw their support behind improving foster care. Some had already carried legislation during this year’s General Assembly session, largely spurred by the JLARC report. But many others were there because Kelly had told them about the problem herself.<strong> </strong></p>
<p>“That event was a year’s worth of work,” Kelly said. “More than that — November 2017 to March. So, almost 18 months. It’s as if you’re buried in the dark, like a seed, and the work all of a sudden sprouts to life. If you don’t realize the point, you can get really discouraged in the dark.”</p>

<h2><strong>Making foster care a community issue</strong></h2>
<p>Virginia’s Kids Belong is an offshoot of another organization that Kelly and her husband, Ryan, also helped get off the ground in 2015: America’s Kids Belong, which launched affiliate groups to increase the number of foster families in both <a href="https://kfor.com/2017/03/07/number-of-oklahoma-children-up-for-adoption-reaches-record-low/" target="_blank">Oklahoma</a> and <a href="https://www.commercialappeal.com/story/news/local/2017/02/28/dcs-finds-new-ways-support-foster-parents-and-families/98371524/" target="_blank">Tennessee</a>. Both those campaigns, Kelly said, have increased the number of foster families by more than 40 percent.</p>
<p>Virginia requires a slightly different approach, though. It is one of just <a href="https://www.childwelfare.gov/pubs/factsheets/services/" target="_blank">nine states</a> that are run as <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/10/29/little-kingdoms-administration-of-social-services-in-virginia-rests-largely-in-the-hands-of-localities-what-happens-when-they-cant-fix-themselves/" target="_blank">state-supervised, locally administered</a> systems. Whereas in Oklahoma and Tennessee, big, statewide campaigns were sufficient, Virginia’s Kids Belong — which has three employees, two full-time and one part-time, and several interns— has to essentially run campaigns in each of the 120 local departments of social services.</p>
<p>That means working with each local department to figure out what their specific needs are and how their foster families might be struggling, then partnering with the local faith, business and creative communities in each locality to meet those needs, which can range from not having the ability to recruit foster parents to not being able to give those parents the support they need. It also means it might take longer to achieve the same results that Oklahoma and Tennessee have seen.</p>
<p>“But I think this approach is good, anyway,” Kelly said. “It’s a lot more work, but it’s going to create more sustainable, relationship-based changes.”</p>
<p>The first locality that Virginia’s Kids Belong worked with closely was Henrico County. There, the organization has done what it hopes to replicate across the state.</p>
<p>“We may have always realized it — but we didn’t know it was an issue until a solution was offered to us — but we didn’t realize that we couldn’t do it alone,” said Gretchen Brown, division manager of the county’s child welfare programs.</p>
<p>Virginia’s Kids Belong has gotten several churches in the community together to hold foster parent nights out. People can help support those events in any number of ways, like donating time to entertain the foster kids, or donating gift cards so their foster parents can go to dinner or a movie without the kids.</p>
<p>It worked with volunteer videographers to do videos of kids available for fostering or adoption, and worked with a local church to organize a pre-orientation event for prospective foster parents. Brown said that typically, at the department’s formal, monthly orientation, four or five prospective parents attend. After the pre-orientation event the church held, 25 people attended.</p>
<p>“What Virginia’s Kids Belong has done is say there’s really no one way to solve this crisis, and every contribution that can be made, either through time or finances or a commitment of bringing children into your home, anything is significant to solving the crisis, and that’s something we have struggled with on our own,” Brown said.</p>
<p>The churches have also started supporting social workers through simple gestures like bringing them lunch, Brown said. But the overall effort might have an even bigger impact by making life easier for workers so they stay longer — addressing a larger problem of <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/08/27/long-hours-low-pay-and-constant-turnover-social-services-agencies-in-virginia-struggle-to-keep-staff/" target="_blank">recruitment and retention</a> within social services.</p>
<p>“They provide that relief and support for staff that will make people stay longer because they understand they’re not in it by themselves,” Brown said. “There’s a whole community committed to solving the problem.”</p>

<h2><strong>Involving the business world</strong></h2>
<p>Working with faith communities comes naturally in the overarching effort to help kids, Kelly said, though it&#8217;s not restricted to that sphere.</p>
<p>“There is a disconnect between the child welfare system and change agents in the community,” she said. “Virginia’s Kids Belong exists, in part, to bridge that disconnect.”</p>
<p>Involving businesses is another critical side of the work, she said.</p>
<p>“We ask them to open up their social capital and calendar to kids who aged out of foster care,” she said. “It’s really open to any community leader who just has about an hour a week to invite a kid into their lives. Lots of these kids haven’t had anyone who hasn’t been paid to be in their lives.</p>
<p>“What we really hope to see over time — and hopefully not that much time — is this awareness of the full spectrum of needs in a foster care system.”</p>
<p>The philosophy around both Virginia’s Kids Belong and the Virginia Fosters campaign is that the responsibility to build a strong foster care system doesn’t rest solely on the shoulders of local departments of social services. It is a community responsibility.</p>
<p>“This approach isn’t just about government, it’s touching the nonprofit base and the business base,” Frazier, the campaign director of Virginia Fosters, said. “It’s not something that the local departments can do on their own, and neither can the state, so we’ve got to really coordinate and collaborate together.”</p>
<p>Finding solutions to the foster care crisis is personal for Kelly. Her son is now 8, and she intimately understands what foster and kinship families struggle through — from how difficult it can be to find resources to the stress of accomplishing seemingly small daily tasks while caring for an adopted child.</p>
<p>She often points out that, if her family is facing these issues even with all the connections they have, how is another family or a teen who has aged out of the system getting by?</p>
<p>“My kids have access to everyone in my Rolodex just by nature of being my kids,” she said. “These foster kids don’t deserve any less than that.”</p>

<p>The department <a href="http://www.vdh.virginia.gov/news/2019-news-releases/virginia-department-of-health-warns-residents-of-increase-in-respiratory-illnesses-2/" target="_blank">warned</a> state residents and health providers about the uptick in diseases, which include influenza, Legionnaire’s disease, pneumonia and pertussis, or whooping cough.</p>
<p>Each of the illnesses have their own particular seasonal pattern, said Jonathan Falk, epidemiology program manager with VDH. There isn&#8217;t necessarily a common factor influencing the increase.</p>
<p>“Generally speaking, we do see respiratory illnesses of different sorts year round,” he said. “We noticed this particular uptick happening once we were officially out of flu season and that coupled with the heat warranted making everyone aware of what’s going on.”</p>
<p>According to the state’s <a href="http://www.vdh.virginia.gov/surveillance-and-investigation/virginia-reportable-disease-surveillance-data/virginia-monthly-morbidity-surveillance-report-2018/" target="_blank">reportable disease data</a>, there have been 80 cases of Legionellosis disease, or Legionnaire’s disease, so far this year compared to a year-to-date average of 66 cases. There have also been 75 reported cases of <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hi-disease/index.html" target="_blank">haemophilus influenzae</a> infection, which can cause pneumonia, compared to the typical 64 cases.</p>
<p>The diseases are spread through person-to-person contact, so the release advised Virginia residents to wash their hands often and avoid close contact with people who are sick.</p>
<p>The heat raging through the state can make a bad situation worse, Falk explained, potentially increasing the severity of heart and lung diseases. Heat especially affects older people, and the uptick in respiratory illnesses have largely been seen in assisted living and long-term care facilities.</p>
<p>Attorney General Mark Herring’s office also warned about the extreme heat, urging Virginians to take appropriate precautions especially to protect children and pets.</p>
<p>“The extreme temperatures in Virginia continue to pose a real threat to health and safety, especially for young children or animals left in vehicles or outside without adequate precautions and shelter,” Herring said in a statement.</p>

(Getty Images stock photo)</p><p>Every year, between 100,000 and 300,000 children nationwide are diverted from the foster care system to live with relatives, according to a new report from the national research group Child Trends that answers some — though not all — questions around the practice.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/06/03/every-year-children-are-diverted-away-from-foster-care-and-placed-with-relatives-nobody-knows-what-happens-next/" target="_blank">Diversion</a> occurs when child protective services has gotten involved with a family and the parent or social worker identifies a relative the child can live with as an alternative to foster care.</p>
<p>The practice varies widely between Virginia’s local departments of social services, with some using it commonly and others not at all. But there is no regular tracking statewide of the practice, so language in the 2016 budget ordered some data collection between July 2016 and December 2018.</p>
<p>Child Trends used that data from Virginia and other states to craft its <a href="https://www.childtrends.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/kinship-diversion_ChildTrends_June2019-1.pdf" target="_blank">report</a> on the practice of diversion, and it concluded what many involved in Virginia’s child welfare system already knew: There isn&#8217;t enough information, including how many children are involved.</p>
<p>“To understand how children are faring in these arrangements, and whether their outcomes are better or worse than those of children formally removed to <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/06/02/they-forgot-about-us-thousands-of-families-are-doing-the-same-work-as-foster-parents-in-virginia-without-the-support/" target="_blank">kin caregivers</a>, child welfare agencies will need to collect child- and family-level information,” the report concludes.</p>
<p>“My greatest conclusion is: We need more information,” said Allison Gilbreath, policy analyst with Voices for Virginia’s Children. “Generally speaking, this said, ‘Hey, you need a lot more data to be able to show comparisons and really show if kids are better off.’”</p>
<p>Carl Ayers, director of the Division of Family Services with the state Department of Social Services, said he was disappointed the report didn’t include any concrete recommendations on evidence-based ways to practice diversion. Virginia doesn’t have any guidelines for its localities, so each of the 120 local departments conduct diversion differently.</p>
<p>In 2016 the state held a work group to develop guidance, but it essentially couldn’t reach a consensus, Ayers said. Child welfare professionals and advocates are often split on diversion. Some see it as a great way to avoid the inherent trauma children experience when they’re separated from their families. Others view it as too unstructured without ensuring that the child is safe or that the parent has a clear road to reunification.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, I’m not sure this gets us any closer to bridging that gap between these two groups,” Ayers said. “As a state we have to make a decision on where to go forward with this practice.”</p>
<h2><strong>What the data shows</strong></h2>
<p>The report offers a glimpse into how diversion is practiced and demographics of the children involved. But in many cases the data highlighted the variability of diversion practice across localities: some jurisdictions were more likely to divert children who were school age, between 6 and 11, than younger children, while other agencies were took an opposite approach.</p>
<p>One takeaway for Ayers was that nothing in the data suggested that diverting children in the manner Virginia does places them at risk.</p>
<p>“If you’re diverting a child away from foster care, you’re saying they’re unsafe in the home they were in,” he said. “There’s nothing that says they are any less safe in the diversion practice than they were in foster care.”</p>
<p>Agencies generally performed criminal and child abuse/neglect background checks on the relatives providing care, and they often held family meetings with the diversion families, which generally encourage partnership and empowers the family, the report states.</p>
<p>It also shows that most diversion placements generally last only about three months or less, but Child Trends points out that there “are significant limitations with the dataset, and that estimates exclude cases that remained open at the end of the time period for which we had data.”</p>
<p>The report does not identify Virginia specifically, though Ayers provided more information on the state’s numbers. Of the 33 localities that participated in the data collection, two did not divert any children. Most counties that provided information were from the western part of the state, though others like Fairfax and Prince William counties participated as well.</p>
<p>In the 18-month period, Pulaski County diverted the most children of the participating localities: 281. Washington County was the next closest with 153 diversions. Counties in the northern part of the state, like Fairfax and Prince William, diverted 66 and 85 children, respectively.</p>
<p>Ayers attributed the high use of diversion in some parts of the state to substance use, which has hit the child welfare system hard. Almost half of the children were diverted due to parental substance use.</p>
<h2><strong>Next steps</strong></h2>
<p>Valerie L’Herrou, an attorney with the Virginia Poverty Law Center, said the report eases some of her concerns about diversion because it showed that background checks and family meetings were taking place most of the time.</p>
<p>If that is the case in all diversion cases, she said it could be a useful tool for situations when a child welfare worker has identified concerns with a family that can be remedied without removing the child.</p>
<p>“The problem is when you use it indiscriminately to address both short-term and long-term problems, and when we don’t put protections in place for the child and for the birth parents,” she said.</p>
<p>In encouraging localities to collect more data on the children who are diverted, Child Trends developed a <a href="https://www.childtrends.org/publications/does-your-child-welfare-agency-divert-children-to-kin-guide-using-kinship-diversion-estimation-tool" target="_blank">tool</a> that helps them estimate how many children are diverted.</p>
<p>But beyond shining some light on the practice and how it is used, the report still left many questions unanswered, reinforcing the need for the state to develop some kind of guidance for Virginia’s local departments of social services.</p>
<p>“I firmly believe this is something we have to tackle as a system,” Ayers said. “We have to come up with a consistent guidance so that each of the families are treated in a similar fashion across each of the 120 local departments.”</p>

<p>The data, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/76-billion-opioid-pills-newly-released-federal-data-unmasks-the-epidemic/2019/07/16/5f29fd62-a73e-11e9-86dd-d7f0e60391e9_story.html?_view=prod&amp;utm_term=.9c58aab18651" target="_blank">according to the Washington Post</a>, tracks the path of each pain pill sold in the country. Though Virginia wasn’t in the top five states with the highest concentration of pills, according to the Post’s analysis two towns, Norton and Martinsville, topped the list for per capital pills in rural areas from 2006 to 2012.</p>
<p>Norton received the highest concentration, with 306 pills per person, while Martinsville followed with 242.</p>
<p>The Post also developed an <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/investigations/dea-pain-pill-database/?utm_term=.41c53015acb8" target="_blank">interactive graphic</a> that shows, locality-by-locality, the number of pills distributed per person, per year.</p>
<p>In Virginia, the darkest areas — representing the greatest pill distribution — were concentrated in the far southwestern part of the state, bordering Kentucky, Tennessee and West Virginia, all three of which were included in the top five states with the greatest concentration of pills.</p>
<p>The data tracks 12 different types of highly addictive opioid painkillers, which includes prescription drugs like oxycodone.</p>

<p>“This new data just reinforces what we’ve long known: the roots of this crisis run through American medicine cabinets into the boardrooms and marketing offices of pharmaceutical companies, and they need to be held accountable,” Herring said.</p>
<p>Virginia has been hit hard by the opioid epidemic, though last year there were <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/were-cautiously-optimistic-drug-data-shows-a-dip-in-opioid-deaths-but-meth-fatalities-skyrocket/" target="_blank">slightly fewer fatal opioid overdoses</a>, representing the first decline since 2012. Other sorts of drug overdoses spiked, though, including methamphetamine and cocaine fatalities.</p>

(Photo by Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the month after the mass shooting in Virginia Beach that killed 12 people and injured four others, lawmakers, candidates and activists have traveled around the state talking about the best way to curb gun violence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Ralph Northam held roundtable discussions. Moms Demand Action held listening events. And the National Rifle Association held members-only</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/they-want-our-state-virginia-republicans-and-nra-say-gun-control-is-just-the-start-of-upheaval/2019/07/02/7821f8bc-99c2-11e9-916d-9c61607d8190_story.html?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.cabbc4c62797" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> town halls with Republican lawmakers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> where policy conversations focused on mental health reform. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Tuesday, lawmakers will come back to Richmond to hash out the details of potential new gun laws, though it may be unlikely any will pass.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the Northam roundtable in Abingdon, Sen. Ben Chafin, R-Russell, gave a hint of what to expect when he promised Virginia Secretary of State Brian Moran he would  </span><a href="https://www.roanoke.com/news/politics/abingdon-crowd-rejects-governor-s-call-for-action-on-gun/article_089dd9ab-7671-548d-93e7-3ae37976474d.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“oppose every single thing you got.”</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans hold slim majorities in both chambers, giving the party the ability to block bills and determine content of the special session.</span></p>
<h2><b>Here’s what Northam wants</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Northam called the special session, his priorities were a list of legislative items that </span><a href="https://www.dailypress.com/news/politics/dp-nws-ga-gun-bills-20190116-story.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">died over a span</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of two days in committee or subcommittee meetings during the regular session. Little changed after his roundtable discussions. Some of the legislation for the special session has <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?192+lst+ALL" target="_blank">already been introduced</a>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Northam’s wish list includes universal background checks; a ban on assault weapons, which would include suppressors and bump stocks; an extreme risk protection or red flag law; reinstating Virginia’s one-handgun-a-month law; child access protection measures; required reporting of lost or stolen firearms and giving municipalities the power to regulate firearms in government buildings. </span></p>
<p><b>• The <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?192+sum+HB4003" target="_blank">red flag bill</a></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would allow judges or magistrates to bar people who appear to be in danger of hurting themselves or others from keeping or purchasing guns for 14 days. Law enforcement would hold any weapons the subject of the order owned. The order would have to be based on a history of violence and supported by an investigation by police. The subject could file a motion to dismiss the order at any point during those 14 days and the court could extend the order to six months.</span></p>
<p><b>•  Cities, counties and towns would be able decide</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> whether to regulate firearms <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?192+sum+SB4001" target="_blank">in local government buildings</a>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><b>• </b>In the last session, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+sum+SB1454" target="_blank">the legislation</a> to require </span><b>background checks for most gun transactions</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> included exemptions for a number of situations, including sales between family members or antique guns. Under current law, background checks are only required for transactions with federally licensed firearms dealers. Private sellers — including vendors at gun shows who aren’t federally licensed — have the option of conducting a background check through the state police, but it is not required.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><b>• </b>The </span><a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+ful+HB2492" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><b> to ban gun magazines that hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the past session defined an &#8220;assault firearm&#8221; as any gun that holds more than 10 rounds of ammunition. A separate </span><a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+sum+SB1008" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill would have banned bump stocks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. (A national <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/25/trump-administrations-bump-stock-ban-set-to-go-into-effect-tuesday.html" target="_blank">ban on bump stocks</a>, which were used in the Las Vegas massacre and enable semi-automatic weapons to increase their rate of fire, went into effect in March)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><b>• </b>The </span><b>one-handgun-a-month bill</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?192+sum+SB4002" target="_blank"> reinstates a 1993 law</a> championed by former Democratic Gov. Doug Wilder. Republican Gov. Bob McDonnell signed the repeal of the law in 2012. Since then,</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/mcauliffe-attempts-to-revive-virginias-one-gun-a-month-law/2017/03/27/fc07ec8c-1336-11e7-9e4f-09aa75d3ec57_story.html?utm_term=.dcd9d77ec119" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats have tried but failed to pass it again</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Under the failed proposal, anyone purchasing more than one gun a month could do so after getting an “enhanced background check.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><b>• Gun owners would be required to report a lost or stolen weapon within 24 hours</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of realizing it was gone. (Here&#8217;s a bill on the issue <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?181+sum+HB43" target="_blank">that failed</a> from the 2018 session). Law enforcement would report it to the National Crime Information Center. The legislation provided immunity for people who report the lost or stolen weapon if the weapon is used in a crime.</span></p>
<p><b>• Leaving a loaded gun around children under 18 would become a Class 6 felony</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+sum+SB1096" target="_blank"> according to a bill</a> filed in the past session— the lowest level felony punishable by one to five years in jail or some jail time with a $2,500 fine. Right now leaving a loaded gun around a child under 14 is a misdemeanor charge.</span></p>
<p><b>•</b> Del. Cia Price, D-Newport News, filed a bill Sunday that would allow <strong>localities to adopt regulations around possessing, storing, carrying and transporting guns. </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><b>• </b>One of Northam’s proposals wasn’t introduced in the regular session. Right now, only subjects of &#8220;family abuse&#8221; protective orders are prohibited from having a gun. Northam wants to <strong>block all subjects of protective orders from possessing firearms</strong>, which can include people accused of stalking, harassment and other non-physical intimidation or violence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Northam said at an event in Radford in late June that some of his preferred proposals wouldn&#8217;t have</span><a href="https://www.roanoke.com/news/nrv/northam-embraces-gun-debate-at-boys-state/article_453bf521-7b56-5945-93dc-cc55195c8ed3.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8220;necessarily prevented&#8221;</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the shooting in Virginia Beach. But his focus is also larger than mass shootings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the press conference announcing the special session, he </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/all-releases/2019/june/headline-840912-en.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">listed a number of </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">individual incidents that happened around the same time of the Virginia Beach shooting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is wrong that we now view these mass shootings as the new normal. In fact, it is wrong that we view gun violence in general as the new normal,” he said at the time.</span></p>
<h2><b>Here&#8217;s what Republicans want</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans have said they want to focus on mandatory minimum sentences for violations of existing gun laws.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">House and Senate Republicans are still finalizing legislative packages for the session. But one guiding principle for House Republicans will be protecting victims of gun violence, especially domestic violence victims, said Parker Slaybaugh, spokesman for House Speaker Kirk Cox, R-Colonial Heights.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans in both chambers are interested in reviving a bill that would have required</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/05/16/how-well-do-minimum-sentences-protect-victims-of-domestic-violence/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">a minimum 60-day sentence</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">for a person&#8217;s second domestic violence charge. The bill passed both chambers with bipartisan support, but Northam vetoed it and said he wouldn&#8217;t sign any mandatory minimum sentence laws because they disproportionately affect people of color.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead, Northam last week suggested expanding current Virginia law to ban anyone who is the subject of a protective order from possessing firearms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement after Northam announced the special session, Cox also reiterated his party&#8217;s &#8220;ongoing efforts to strengthen the mental and behavioral health system.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The National Rifle Association, the powerful pro-gun organization headquartered in Fairfax, has also said mental health is the real issue causing gun violence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“None of his gun control proposals will prevent criminals from accessing firearms and committing crimes, nor would they have prevented what happened in Virginia Beach,” Chris Kopacki, the Virginia state director for the NRA’s Institute for Legislative Action, said in a statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If the governor were serious about improving public safety he would address the underlying issues like our broken mental health system.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Mark Cole, R-Spotsylvania, filed the first two bills of the session Wednesday: </span><a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?192+sum+HB4001" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to codify a </span><a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/dc-v-heller/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Supreme Court decision</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that owning guns is an individual right and another to allow government employees, including municipal employees, with a </span><a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?192+sum+HB4002" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">concealed carry permit to have a weapon at work</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If the agency employs armed security or has law enforcement on site, it could prohibit employees from having a concealed weapon under Cole’s bill.</span></p>
<h2><strong>How does anything get resolved? </strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the governor triggered the special session, the General Assembly decides what direction it goes. Once lawmakers assemble, typically the first step is to get organized and get the legislators on task.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the first pieces of legislation typically taken up during special sessions are joint resolutions that broadly dictate what the lawmakers will focus on. During last year’s special session to finalize the budget during the Medicaid expansion debate, lawmakers</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?182+ful+HJ5002+pdf" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">agreed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> first to prioritize budget bills, though they gave themselves wiggle room for things like memorial resolutions, rules of procedure, the election of judges and appointments.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/mechelleh/status/1147928186073812995" target="_blank">https://twitter.com/mechelleh/status/1147928186073812995</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The joint resolution is sort of our road map,” said House Clerk Paul Nardo. “The legislation that should be introduced should be similar to what the purpose of the governor calling us into special session is.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But the legislative branch has the ability to do pretty much whatever it wants. He says he wants us to talk about gun violence, well one person’s gun violence is another person’s public safety, which can be interpreted a number of different ways.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s also possible lawmakers will go off their road map during this session. House Republicans have already renewed calls to hold </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/house-republicans-want-hearing-on-sexual-assault-allegations-against-justin-fairfax-during-special-session/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a bipartisan hearing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with the two women who have accused Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax of sexual assault.</span></p>
<h2><strong>How long will this take?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike regular sessions, which have to be concluded in either 45 or 60 days depending on the year, there’s not much structure around the timing of a special session. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because of that, if the session lasts a significant amount of time, each chamber might adjourn more often than usual while they wait for the other to complete its work. The joint resolution usually includes language requiring at least 48 hours’ notice before recessing or adjourning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are still two special sessions still open from 2018 — one for redistricting and one that was called for the budget and for judicial appointments. Lawmakers could opt to close the redistricting session, since the </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/06/17/supreme-court-rejects-republicans-appeal-in-gerrymandering-case/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Supreme Court made a decision in the case.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The session on judicial appointments could stay open for lawmakers to make a permanent appointment to the </span><a href="https://www.roanoke.com/news/virginia/circuit-court-judge-anita-filson-retires-after-years-on-the/article_248a0cc7-239f-58d3-9aa0-ab32fb35b76b.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rockbridge County Circuit Court.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Either way, those sessions will expire in 2020. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other than timing and some procedural differences, special sessions are identical to regular sessions. Cox will still refer bills to committees, bills still have to be read a third time and some will get killed and others will pass to the opposite chamber.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There will still be a</span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/constitution/article4/section6/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">veto session</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, when the General Assembly reconvenes on the sixth Wednesday after adjournment to reconsider bills that may have been altered or vetoed by the governor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the state</span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/constitution/article4/section13/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Constitution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, laws passed during the special session will become effective on the first day of the fourth month following the month of adjournment.</span></p>

<p>The center found that population growth has decelerated to 8 percent, from 13 percent last decade. The rate is expected to hold steady &#8220;assuming that the commonwealth continues to experience lower birth rates, higher death rates (the result of an aging population) and fewer people moving into the state,&#8221; a <a href="https://news.virginia.edu/content/population-projections-show-virginia-aging-growing-more-slowly?utm_source=DailyReport&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=news" target="_blank">UVAToday</a> daily report states.</p>
<p>Virginia can also expect to see a deepening rural-urban divide, with population growth in urban areas and declines in rural communities. Seventy percent of the population reside in the northern Virginia, Richmond or Hampton Roads metro areas, while only 12 percent of Virginians live in non-metro areas, according to the report.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/the-avenue/2018/12/21/us-population-growth-hits-80-year-low-capping-off-a-year-of-demographic-stagnation/" target="_blank">Just as it is nationwide</a>, the share of older Virginians who are 65 and older is expected to increase, from 12 percent in 2010 to 18 percent in 2030.</p>
<p>&#8220;In rural areas like Lancaster, Northumberland, Middlesex, Highland and James City counties, more than 30 percent of residents are projected to be over the age of 65 by the end of this decade,&#8221; the UVAToday report states.</p>

Ralph Northam&#8217;s announced <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/northam-announces-2025-goal-to-eliminate-racial-disparity-in-pregnancy-related-deaths/" target="_blank">goal</a> to end the racial disparity in maternal mortality by 2025.</p>
<p>In Virginia, black women are <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/03/05/birthing-while-black-african-american-women-face-disproportionate-risks-during-pregnancy/" target="_blank">three times more likely</a> than their white counterparts to suffer a pregnancy-associated death. That is due to a <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/in-maternal-mortality-causes-vary-significantly-by-race/" target="_blank">variety of causes</a>. From 2009 to 2013, 66 percent of pregnancy-related deaths for black women were due to natural causes, according to the Virginia Department of Health.</p>
<p>Medicaid covers 1 in 3 births in Virginia, and Dr. Jennifer Lee, Virginia&#8217;s Medicaid director, pointed to expansion as one factor that will help the state meet the goal. Under the previous Medicaid rules, women were eligible for the program only during their pregnancies and 60 days afterward if they didn&#8217;t meet the other income requirements.</p>
<p>Expansion opens up the number of women who will remain covered by Medicaid after that 60 day period. Of the more than 296,000 people who have signed up for the program under its new expansion rules, 60 percent are women.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Medicaid expansion opens the door to greatly improve access to care for low-income pregnant women in our Commonwealth,” Secretary of Health and Human Resources Dr. Daniel Carey said in a news release. “It is imperative that we continue to build on expansion as a means to achieve better health outcomes for Virginians, including mothers and infants.”</p>
<p>The agency has identified several additional ways to end maternal and infant mortality among its members, the majority of which involve partnering with other state departments, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>the Department of Social Services, to streamline Medicaid enrollment with policy changes and system upgrades so that the eligibility of pregnant women can be decided faster to avoid delays, and to share data to evaluate health outcomes of mothers and infants</li>
<li>the Department of Health, to decrease tobacco use and reduce childhood asthma</li>
<li>the Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services, to &#8220;strengthen early childhood interventions,&#8221; the release states.</li>
</ul>
<p>According to the release, Virginia Medicaid will also implement technology upgrades so that women can transition between Medicaid eligibility categories seamlessly and avoid interruptions in coverage; launch a campaign to educate women about the new expansion rules and the importance of prenatal and postpartum care; increase the percentage of pregnant and postpartum women with substance use disorder who are receiving treatment; and develop online dashboards to increase transparency on maternal and infant health goals.</p>
<p>All the different initiatives fall into the existing Medicaid program, a spokeswoman for the agency said in an email, and there are no specific cost impacts associated with them at this time.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft wp-image-7399 size-medium" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/From-The-Bulletin-300x44.png" alt="" width="300" height="44" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/From-The-Bulletin-300x44.png 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/From-The-Bulletin-768x112.png 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/From-The-Bulletin-696x102.png 696w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/From-The-Bulletin.png 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>The left-leaning Richmond institute says that, as many parts of Virginia struggle to find enough workers, many immigrants are &#8220;relatively young, well educated, fluent in English and more likely to participate in the workforce.&#8221;</p>
<p>The one million immigrants in Virginia make up 12.5 percent of the state population. More than two-thirds live in Northern Virginia, where they make up 27 percent of the population.</p>
<p>And while immigration from Mexico tends to dominate the national debate, Virginia&#8217;s immigrant population comes from a wide variety of countries.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mexican immigrants make up just 5% of all immigrants in Virginia, fourth after people born in El Salvador (11%), India (9%), and Korea (6%),&#8221; the report says. &#8220;Looking at continent of birth, rather than country of birth, there is a similar diversity. Forty-three percent of Virginia’s immigrant population was born in Asia, the largest group from any continent.&#8221;</p>
<p>Most of them are also between the prime working ages of 25 and 54.</p>
<p>&#8220;Legislators often bemoan the fact that workforce participation within the state is lower than a decade ago, leaving the state vulnerable to a shrinking tax base,&#8221; the report states. &#8220;What is less commonly noted is the role Virginia immigrants play in supporting the labor force overall. Immigrants participate in Virginia’s workforce at a much higher rate than U.S.-born residents — 72 percent compared to 65 percent — and at a rate six percentage points higher than the national participation for foreign-born residents.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the report also points to public policies that would help address the challenges immigrants face.</p>
<p>More than one in three noncitizen residents lack access to health insurance in Virginia, &#8220;even worse than in the country as a whole,&#8221; the report states.</p>
<p>&#8220;While the national uninsured rate for noncitizens has dropped 16 percentage points since 2009, Virginia’s rate has dropped just five percentage points,&#8221; it adds.</p>
<p>That means immigrants face all the challenges that come with lack of health insurance, like large medical bills and a lack of preventative care. Virginia is also one of only six states to require legal, noncitizens <a href="https://ideastations.org/radio/news/virginia-immigrants-have-work-10-years-qualify-medicaid" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">to work for at least 10 years</a> before they qualify for Medicaid.</p>
<p>Housing and poverty remain problems for the state&#8217;s immigrants, as does what&#8217;s called &#8220;brain waste&#8221;: when people aren&#8217;t working jobs that match their educational attainment.</p>
<p>&#8220;In Virginia, 21 percent of college-educated immigrants 25 and older are working in low-skill jobs or are unemployed. This is well above the average for U.S.-born Virginians,&#8221; the report states. &#8220;Lawmakers, employers, and workforce development officials all have a role to play in reducing this needless inefficiency and maximizing opportunity for the state.&#8221;</p>

<p>Pregnancy-associated deaths are a wide category that include deaths that occur when a woman is pregnant or within a year of termination of a pregnancy, regardless of the cause of death or outcome of the pregnancy, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The category includes deaths from medical conditions as well as from car crashes, drug overdoses and homicides.</p>
<p>From 2009 to 2013, the most recent year data was available, 66 percent of pregnancy-related deaths for black women were due to natural causes, compared to 45 percent for white women.</p>
<p>The leading causes of death for white women were accidental overdoses, motor vehicle accidents, cancer, infection and suicide. For black women, the leading causes were cardiac disorder, homicide, exacerbation of a chronic illness, pulmonary embolism and motor vehicle accidents.</p>
<p>The racial disparities, Rouse explained, &#8220;have been found to extend beyond all socioeconomic and educational backgrounds.&#8221;</p>
<p>Virginia&#8217;s <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/general-assembly-passes-legislation-ordering-review-of-maternal-mortality/" target="_blank">Maternal Mortality Review Team</a>, which is preparing to release a report on its most recent findings, also found that the most prevalent risk factors for pregnancy-associated death, Rouse said, include mental illness, chronic substance abuse and chronic medical conditions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Over 25 percent of maternal decedents in Virginia had been diagnosed with depression and approximately 20 percent had been diagnosed with anxiety at some time in their lives,&#8221; Rouse told lawmakers. &#8220;Nearly 25 percent of maternal decedents were also found to have chronic substance abuse.&#8221;</p>
<p>The team also concluded that there is a &#8220;lack of coordination of care with many women not receiving the appropriate screenings, referrals, and/or being able to navigate a complicated health care system on their own.&#8221;</p>
<p>But because the data used in the report was from years before Medicaid expansion, increased coverage among women is expected to have a positive effect.</p>
<p>Gena Boyle Berger, deputy secretary of health and human resources, followed Rouse&#8217;s presentation to the lawmakers by detailing Gov. Ralph Northam&#8217;s recently-announced goal to eliminate the <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/northam-announces-2025-goal-to-eliminate-racial-disparity-in-pregnancy-related-deaths/" target="_blank">racial disparity</a> in pregnancy-related deaths by 2025.</p>
<p>She said the administration is developing a strategic plan for reaching that goal based on the Maternal Mortality Review Team&#8217;s findings, recent literature and best practices from other states.</p>
<p>The Joint Commission also unanimously agreed to have its staff do a thorough analysis of additional data so it can potentially recommend that the General Assembly put additional resources toward addressing maternal mortality in Virginia.</p>

<p>The poverty level, currently $12,490 for a single adult, is adjusted every year to account for inflation, but the new proposal would use a lower measure of inflation than in the past. The Office of Management and Budget is currently accepting <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2019/05/07/2019-09106/request-for-comment-on-the-consumer-inflation-measures-produced-by-federal-statistical-agencies" target="_blank">comments</a> on the proposal.</p>
<p>The change would essentially mean that the poverty line would increase <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/poverty-and-inequality/administrations-poverty-line-proposal-would-cut-health-food" target="_blank">more slowly</a>, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal-leaning research and policy institute, and millions of people nationwide who would otherwise be eligible for programs like Medicaid and free school lunches, which use the poverty line to determine eligibility, will not have access.</p>
<p>After the Friday deadline for comments, the administration could move forward with the changes, according to the center.</p>
<p>The programs range from Medicare and Medicaid to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. It would also impact those who receive subsidies on the Affordable Care Act’s marketplace and kids covered by the Children’s Health Insurance Program, or CHIP.</p>
<p>About 9,000 <a href="https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/publication/100410/proposed_changes_to_the_poverty_line_would_reduce_snap_participation_over_time_1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fewer households</a> in Virginia would have been eligible for SNAP in 2016 if the federal government had used the proposed method of calculating inflation, according to the Urban Institute.</p>
<p>The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities says 250,000 adults nationwide would lose coverage to Medicaid expansion, while 300,000 children would lose health insurance through CHIP.</p>
<p>By the 10th year using the proposed poverty level calculation, “millions of people would lose eligibility for, or receive less help from, health coverage programs,” the center says. “These widespread cuts would raise uninsured rates and worsen access to care, financial security, and health.”</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear how many people in Virginia are at risk of losing eligibility to the state&#8217;s health programs, but thousands are currently enrolled in them. More than 290,000 people have signed up for Medicaid through the state&#8217;s expansion, and almost 80,000 of those have incomes just below the eligibility threshold.</p>
<p>Another 138,233 Virginia children were enrolled in CHIP in June, according to the Department of Medical Assistance Services.</p>
<p>Freddy Mejia, policy analyst with the Commonwealth Institute for Fiscal Analysis in Richmond, <a href="https://thehalfsheet.org/post/185684194403/take-action-against-federal-proposal-that-could" target="_blank">noted</a> in a blog that many whose incomes are just above the federal poverty line already struggle to make ends meet. A 2017 Urban Institute survey noted that 60 percent of those living between 100 and 200 percent of the poverty line experience food insecurity, problems paying medical bills or missed rent or mortgage payments.</p>
<p>“These numbers show that the current poverty guidelines are extremely low given the needs of families with low incomes, and this proposal could put more families in hardship,” Mejia wrote.</p>

<p>That equates to almost three people every day. Guns take more lives than car crashes.</p>
<p>And nearly two-thirds of those gun-related deaths in Virginia are suicides.</p>
<p>In 2017, almost <a href="http://www.vdh.virginia.gov/content/uploads/sites/18/2019/04/Annual-Report-2017.pdf" target="_blank">65 percent of gun-related deaths in Virginia were suicides</a>, according to the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner’s annual report.</p>
<p>While the number of gun-related homicides has crept down in the past three years — dropping by about 30 between 2016 and 2018 — the number of gun-related suicides has been slowly rising since 1999.</p>
<p>“There tends to be this incorrect and false sense of fatalism about suicide, and I think it makes it hard sometimes for policymakers or others to feel like we can do anything,” said Jon Vernick, a professor at Johns Hopkins University’s Bloomberg School of Public Health and co-director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research.</p>
<p>“And that’s just wrong.&#8221;</p>
<h2><strong>Fast and efficient</strong></h2>
<p>Though the 2018 numbers aren’t finalized yet, preliminary data shows that, of the 1,035 deaths due to guns in Virginia last year, 674 were suicides.</p>
<p>In 2017, about half of the 1,157 suicides that occurred in the state involved a firearm.</p>
<p>“There are studies that show that <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/means-matter/" target="_blank">removing the lethal means is the best way to prevent suicide</a>,” said Bruce Cruser, executive director of Mental Health America of Virginia. “In this country, that is guns.”</p>
<p>Not only are they accessible and easy to use, but guns are also terribly efficient, said Nicole Gore, Virginia’s suicide prevention coordinator. People <a href="https://www.nami.org/Blogs/NAMI-Blog/September-2017/Learning-More-About-Suicidal-Ideation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">contemplating suicide </a>often make the decision quickly. An article in the New England Journal of Medicine pointed out that between one-third and four-fifths of suicide attempts are <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp0805923" target="_blank">impulsive</a>.</p>
<p>Yet studies also show that if people survive the first attempt, they are much <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/means-matter/means-matter/survival/" target="_blank">less likely to try again</a>, especially if they find <a href="https://afsp.org/about-suicide/preventing-suicide/" target="_blank">treatment</a>.</p>
<p>But guns work so fast that there’s less of a chance to reconsider.</p>
<p>“If you take an overdose of pills, you may be able to get your stomach pumped,” Gore said. “But the firearm is so lethal that it’s very less likely that you can reverse the effects.”</p>
<p>The Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services has been promoting a project called <a href="http://www.lockandtalk.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lock and Talk, </a>intended to limit access to &#8220;lethal means&#8221; like guns and pills.</p>
<p>&#8220;The focus is to lock up your meds, lock up your guns, and talk often,&#8221; Gore said. &#8220;We focus primarily on medication and guns because we know that firearms account for more than half of the suicides in the United States, but we&#8217;ve also seen an uptick in opioid-related suicides.&#8221;</p>
<p>The initiative began in 2016 and involves educating people about the importance of safely locking up firearms and prescription drugs, and providing trigger locks to the community. So far Community Services Boards, which provide mental health care to their respective regions around the state, in the western part of the state have started the project. The goal is to eventually implement the program statewide.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/means-matter/means-matter/case-fatality/" target="_blank">case fatality rate</a>, which means the percentage of people who die in a suicide attempt, for firearms is above 80 percent, according to a study in the American Journal of Public Health. Drug overdoses have a case fatality rate of only 1.5 percent.</p>
<p>“Unlike suicide attempts using most other methods, a suicide attempt with a gun is very likely to be lethal,” Vernick explained. “The really good news is most people who survive the first suicide attempt get some kind of treatment.</p>
<p>“If all we did — and we should clearly do more than this — but if all we did was shift peoples’ first suicide attempt from using a gun to using pills, we would save hundreds of lives.”</p>
<h2><strong>Policies</strong></h2>
<p>There are several evidence-based policies that public health experts and mental health advocates point to that would address gun violence and suicides.</p>
<p>One policy is a handgun <a href="https://lawcenter.giffords.org/gun-laws/policy-areas/gun-owner-responsibilities/licensing/" target="_blank">licensing law</a>. Right now, when someone wants to buy a gun they can go to a dealer, who then performs a criminal background check by calling the <a href="http://www.vsp.virginia.gov/Firearms_VFTP.shtm" target="_blank">Virginia State Police</a>. (There are no background checks <a href="https://lawcenter.giffords.org/private-sales-in-virginia/" target="_blank">required for private sales</a>, a loophole Democrats have been pushing to close).</p>
<p>In 2017, handguns were used in about half of the suicides in Virginia.</p>
<p>In states with handgun licensing laws, people wishing to buy handguns are typically required to go to a law enforcement agency in person, which usually involves a more thorough background check and helps safeguard against fraud.</p>
<p>Licensing laws can reduce homicides, Vernick pointed out, but they also can impose a very important waiting period that can reduce suicides, as states that have implemented the laws have seen. &#8216;</p>
<p>According to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, after Connecticut’s licensing law was passed, the firearm suicide rate decreased by 15 percent. When Missouri repealed its law, the rate increased by 16 percent.</p>
<p>Another policy option, which Gov. Ralph Northam has <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/06/04/northam-hopes-to-ratchet-up-pressure-on-gop-but-some-advocates-see-little-hope-for-special-session-on-gun-control/" target="_blank">already identified</a> leading up to the special session next month, are extreme risk protection orders, also known as red flag laws.</p>
<p>These laws would allow someone — sometimes family members or law enforcement or a medical professional — to petition a court to temporarily remove a firearm from someone who poses a danger to themselves or others.</p>
<p>“You’re not taking their gun away forever,” Vernick said. “You just want to keep them alive. I think that’s why it’s been quite appealing to a bunch of states.”</p>
<p>Vernick said that 15 states have enacted these types of laws.</p>
<h2><strong>The myths around mental illness and violence</strong></h2>
<p>Mental health advocates are open to extreme risk protection orders — with a caveat.</p>
<p>In his testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee earlier this year, Ron Honberg, senior policy adviser with the National Alliance on Mental Illness, said in his written testimony that the laws “can be potentially lifesaving, particularly in preventing suicides, which are frequently impulsive acts.”</p>
<p>But he added that the language should emphasize that the laws are based on risk, and not “stereotypical assumptions about specific groups of people.&#8221; He also recommended states allow the subject due process protection and that law enforcement officers removing firearms receive training in crisis intervention and de-escalation.</p>
<p>“We would oppose efforts to deny people their rights or discriminate against people on the basis of a mental health condition,” said Cruser with Mental Health America of Virginia. “The basis has to be based on behavior, not an illness or a diagnosis.”</p>
<p>Advocacy organizations do not want the laws to be used as a reason to deny the rights of people with mental illness, but they fear they might be used that way due to the misguided belief that mentally ill individuals are often violent toward others.</p>
<p>“Overall, only 4 % of violent acts in the U.S. are attributable to mental illness,” Honberg said in his written testimony. “Most people with serious mental illness are never violent towards others and are more often victims of violence than perpetrators of violence.”</p>
<h2><strong>Prevention</strong></h2>
<p>Ultimately, advocates say that there needs to be more resources for people experiencing suicidal thoughts.</p>
<p>&#8220;When people die from suicide, there are normally multiple contributing factors,&#8221; Gore said. &#8220;Yes, it can be the one event that pushed people over the edge, but it&#8217;s very rarely one thing. Over half of the people who die by suicide have a mental health diagnosis, but just because they have a mental health diagnosis doesn&#8217;t make them suicidal.&#8221;</p>
<p>But key to that is reducing the stigma that surrounds talking about suicide in the first place.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is still a lot of stigma around asking for help,&#8221; Gore said. &#8220;Everybody has a role in being able to prevent suicide. One thing we need to be better at is being able to recognize when someone is showing us signs that something is not right in their life and we have to be comfortable asking questions clearly and directly: Are you thinking of suicide?&#8221;</p>
<p>Putting some restrictions on someone&#8217;s ability to quickly get a gun, though, would help reduce the sheer number of suicides. But, Vernick pointed out, a key part of developing strategies to prevent suicide is to overcome the sense of fatalism.</p>
<p>&#8220;The sense of fatalism is, &#8216;Well, if a gun is not available, they&#8217;ll just find some other way,'&#8221; he said. &#8220;But if that other way is much, much less lethal than a gun, and they survive it, then we can get them help and, again, the data suggests that they&#8217;re much less likely to make a next attempt.&#8221;</p>
<p><em><strong>If you or a loved one are in a crisis, call the national suicide hotline at 1-800-273-TALK. There is also a <a href="https://www.crisistextline.org/" target="_blank">crisis text line</a>. </strong></em></p>

<p>Using 47 measures, including those related to quality and access to health care as well as income-based disparities, the newly-released Commonwealth Fund’s 2019 <a href="https://scorecard.commonwealthfund.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scorecard</a> on State Health System Performance ranks states in categories like prevention, treatment, avoidable use and cost.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://interactives.commonwealthfund.org/2018/state-scorecard/files/Virginia.pdf" target="_blank">2018 scorecard</a>, Virginia came in a notch higher at 28th.</p>
<p>The scorecard, which mostly uses data from 2017, though some measures go back farther, shows that Virginia has made good strides in reducing some <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/07/18/virginias-health-care-acquired-infection-rates-mirror-national-averages-but-is-that-good-enough/" target="_blank">hospital-acquired infections</a> and in lowering the number of alcohol-related deaths. In 2017, the rate of alcohol-related deaths per 100,000 people in Virginia was 7.1 percent compared to the national average of 9.6 percent.</p>
<p>But Virginia struggled in some areas, like in the number of children who did not receive <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/05/27/more-kids-are-being-admitted-to-the-states-psychiatric-hospital-for-children-but-few-have-psychotic-illnesses/" target="_blank">needed mental health care</a>. In 2017, according to the Commonwealth Fund’s report, 35 percent of Virginia’s children did not receive needed mental health care, compared to the U.S. average of 22 percent.</p>
<p>Also, there were 21.8 breast cancer deaths in Virginia per 100,000 women in 2017, compared to 19.9 percent nationwide.</p>
<p>Other data points are slightly outdated. Virginia ranked 40th in the scorecard based on 2017 data for adults ages 19-64 who are uninsured, but that was before the state expanded its Medicaid program. Expansion states have typically lower uninsured rates compared to those that have not expanded their programs.</p>
<p>This year the Commonwealth Fund, a nonprofit private foundation that supports independent research on health policy reform, began ranking states within their regions to allow better comparisons with their neighbors, according to David Radley, senior scientist with the organization. Virginia was ranked first in the southeastern region.</p>

(Image via Centers for Disease Control and Invention Public Image Library)</p><p>Virginia&#8217;s<a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/04/07/virginia-health-officials-sleeping-with-one-eye-open-amid-measles-outbreaks-elsewhere/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> success in evading the measles</a> this year might be at an end.</p>
<p>Health departments in Northern Virginia are currently investigating a possible case of the highly contagious disease involving a child who traveled internationally, though the case is <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/signs-symptoms.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">not related</a> to the ongoing outbreaks in other parts of the country.</p>
<p>Preliminary testing occurred Wednesday, said Christy Gray, director of the Department of Health’s division of immunization. Though the case is not yet confirmed, the department has <a href="http://www.vdh.virginia.gov/news/2019-regional-news-releases/virginia-health-officials-investigating-potential-measles-exposure-in-northern-virginia/" target="_blank">notified people that they may have been exposed</a> if they visited certain places earlier this week: Dulles International Airport, Novant Health UVA Health System Haymarket Medical Center and Inova Fair Oaks Hospital.</p>
<p>It can take time, sometimes several weeks once samples are sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, to confirm a case of <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/signs-symptoms.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">measles</a>, Gray said. That’s why officials have already moved forward with the public health response to raise awareness for those potentially exposed.</p>
<p>As of Wednesday, measles outbreaks have spread through more than 25 states with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2019/06/05/us/05reuters-usa-measles.html" target="_blank">1,001 cases</a>, the highest number recorded since 1992. The U.S. had declared measles eradicated in 2000, but this year the disease has taken off quickly in unvaccinated communities.</p>
<p>There are usually very few, if any, reports of measles in Virginia. According to the Department of Health&#8217;s <a href="http://www.vdh.virginia.gov/surveillance-and-investigation/virginia-reportable-disease-surveillance-data/virginia-monthly-morbidity-surveillance-report-2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reportable Disease Monthly Surveillance Report</a>, in 2018 and 2015 there was one case of measles in the state, while 2014 saw two cases.</p>
<p>“Our program has set a public health structure in place in order to respond quickly,” Gray said. “And there are a few different factors involved with preparing the commonwealth for being able to either withstand or prevent outbreaks like this.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the major pillars is to have a strong, responsive public health system with good communication that private providers know to contact the health department, (the) health department responds, provides guidance, we provide testing, we reach out to contacts.”</p>
<p>Virginia enjoys a high immunization rate compared to other states. The measles, mumps and rubella, or MMR, vaccine has been “well-accepted” in the community, Gray said, and Virginia also has low rates of children receiving exemptions from vaccinations.</p>
<p>There are some blind spots in the vaccination data, though, such as homeschooled children. Gray said that’s something the department is interested in exploring to see if there are pockets of the population with low vaccination rates — which is what caused outbreaks to surge in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/26/nyregion/measles-outbreak-rockland-county.html" target="_blank">New York</a>.</p>
<p>“Once measles gets into an unvaccinated population, it spreads like wildfire,” she said.</p>
<h2><strong>Continuing to battle hepatitis A</strong></h2>
<p>Meanwhile, Virginia continues to target another outbreak that reached the state earlier this year: <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/04/25/national-hepatitis-a-outbreak-spreads-to-virginia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hepatitis A</a>.</p>
<p>The nationwide outbreak has been ongoing since 2016. It&#8217;s unique because, while hepatitis A outbreaks are usually related to contaminated food, this time the disease has been spreading through high-risk populations: homeless people, recently incarcerated individuals, men who have sex with men and injection drug users.</p>
<p>So far there have been 55 cases in Virginia related to the outbreak, according to a presentation Gray made Wednesday to the Virginia Board of Health, and the vast majority have been in Southwest Virginia.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s because the neighboring states — Tennessee, Kentucky, West Virginia — have been real hot spots for this outbreak, with thousands and thousands of people having hepatitis A,&#8221; explained Dr. Norman Oliver, the state health commissioner, to the Board of Health on Wednesday.</p>
<p>But local health departments in Southwest Virginia have been effective in targeting the most at-risk populations with messaging to keep the outbreak largely under control, both Oliver and Gray said.</p>
<p>The state has gone on a major communications campaign to spread awareness of the hepatitis A vaccine, working with the Pandora music app and Grindr, a dating app geared toward gay, bisexual, transgender and queer people, to develop ads spreading its message.</p>
<p>Virginia also experienced a significant hepatitis A outbreak in 2016 related to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/outbreaks/2016/hav-strawberries.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">frozen strawberries</a>. The ramifications of that, Gray said, might be helping the state withstand the current outbreak.</p>
<p>&#8220;That could have created higher adult vaccination rates that we are benefiting from,&#8221; Gray said. &#8220;There&#8217;s no definitive way to know, but I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s a factor in that we have some coverage of hepatitis A for adults.&#8221;</p>
<h2><strong>Sexually transmitted diseases</strong></h2>
<p>But neither hepatitis A nor, potentially, measles are presenting the only communicable disease threat to Virginia&#8217;s public health at the moment. The increase in <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/09/14/sexually-transmitted-diseases-make-a-comeback-in-virginia-with-a-dangerous-antibiotic-resistant-twist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sexually transmitted diseases</a> that the entire country and Virginia have seen continues.</p>
<p>Both the rates and case counts of chlamydia, syphilis and gonorrhea have increased substantially. Between 2009 and 2018 the rates of chlamydia and gonorrhea have risen by 30.2 and 42.4 percent, respectively. Meanwhile, the rate of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/syphilis/symptoms-causes/syc-20351756" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">early syphilis</a>, which hasn&#8217;t progressed to the more serious tertiary, or late, syphilis, increased by 122 percent. Cases of babies with congenital syphilis, meaning they were born to a woman who had the disease, have gone up by 400 percent.</p>
<p>Those between the ages of 18 and 25 have the highest rates of the diseases.</p>
<p>The Department of Health has taken a two-pronged approach to the increase, Oliver told the Board of Health.</p>
<p>The first is increasing the training and capacity of staff in the field who are conducting case investigations, patient interviews and treatment. That has meant hiring new field and surveillance staff to handle the increasing caseloads.</p>
<p>It has also encouraged local health departments to expand STD clinic availability by staying open later.</p>
<p>&#8220;These increases are very concerning,&#8221; Oliver said, adding that STDs can be asymptomatic, and &#8220;are therefore likely under-diagnosed. &#8230; These numbers are probably actually higher than we have here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Many represented their kids, who have physical and developmental disabilities. Some represented brothers or mothers-in-law with health problems, and still others represented themselves.</p>
<p>This year, the Department of Medical Assistance Services created the Medicaid Member Advisory Committee, an 11-member group of people from all over the state who deal with Medicaid in some fashion, either because they or a family member relies on it for health coverage.</p>
<p>Only Colorado has a similar committee, according to DMAS officials.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the group&#8217;s second meeting, the members shared their experiences with the program and offered advice to DMAS on ways to improve outreach.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/05/20/thousands-received-addiction-treatment-once-medicaid-paid-for-it-could-that-happen-for-mental-health/" target="_blank">James Murdoch</a>, a Tappahannock resident, suggested including on the DMAS website programs that other state agencies offer, because often members need services that another department can provide.</p>
<p>They also shared concerns about how the department can improve its <a href="https://www.coverva.org/screening/" target="_blank">screening tool</a>. Margaret Crowe, a Stafford County mother of a child with disabilities, pointed out that some people may think they&#8217;re ineligible if they are only seeking coverage for a disabled child.</p>
<p>A lot of the suggestions centered around how to make things easier for struggling parents of children with disabilities who have a <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/01/14/waiting-for-help-developmental-disability-advocates-push-for-funding-to-meet-an-ever-growing-need/" target="_blank">waiver</a> through Medicaid. Accessing programs often isn&#8217;t intuitive, the members pointed out. About half of the 1.4 million people who receive Medicaid in Virginia are children.</p>
<p>DMAS staff were at the meeting to present to the group and take notes on what advice the members had.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s why we exist: we&#8217;re here for our members,&#8221; said Dr. Jennifer Lee, the director of Virginia&#8217;s Medicaid program, in an interview. &#8220;As we learned today, they give us insights that we just cannot get without talking to them. It&#8217;s so important for us to understand what&#8217;s happening outside these walls, on the ground, in reality.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lee thought of creating the committee when she took the job last year.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the reason I&#8217;m here doing this job and not working in a hospital ER as a physician,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Some of the suggestions that the members offered went outside of DMAS&#8217;s scope, though, like increasing rates for personal care attendants. Late in the meeting, Rachel Pryor, deputy director for administration, noted that the department can only work within the fiscal perimeters that the General Assembly sets.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our money comes from somewhere, and we don&#8217;t decide how much money we have,&#8221; she said. &#8220;That is the decision of the General Assembly.&#8221;</p>

<p>The racial divide in maternal mortality is a<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/11/magazine/black-mothers-babies-death-maternal-mortality.html" target="_blank"> national trend</a> that has increasingly received more attention, and on Wednesday Gov. Ralph Northam announced a new state goal of eliminating the disparity by 2025.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“A critical component of improving maternal health outcomes is the elimination of the racial disparity we are seeing in Virginia and across the nation,” Northam said<a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/all-releases/2019/june/headline-840941-en.html" target="_blank"> in a statement</a>, adding that it is &#8220;a worthy goal that is perfectly within reach.&#8221;</p>
<p>As he continues his <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/02/25/no-short-road-to-redemption-budget-is-a-step-toward-racial-reconciliation-black-lawmakers-say/" target="_blank">racial reconciliation</a> effort post-<a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/05/22/good-teeth-big-legs-and-a-bow-tie-inconclusive-report-details-chaos-in-northams-office-and-how-he-finally-decided-it-wasnt-him-in-blackface-photo/" target="_blank">blackface scandal</a>, Northam said he has directed his administration to develop strategies to reach the 2025 goal, which he announced during a ceremonial bill signing for <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+sum+HB2546" target="_blank">House Bill 2546</a>, which codifies the Maternal Mortality Review Team in Virginia, and <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+sum+HB2613" target="_blank">House Bill 2613</a>, which adds perinatal anxiety to the list of information providers must give patients.</p>
<p>Part of the effort includes implementing <a href="https://mchb.hrsa.gov/maternal-child-health-initiatives/home-visiting-overview" target="_blank">home visiting</a> for families and increasing training on implicit bias and cultural competency for health care professionals.</p>
<p>It also includes having the state&#8217;s Medicaid program and the Department of Social Services expedite enrollment for pregnant women into Medicaid.</p>
<p>Northam is &#8220;directing all applicable executive branch agencies to provide recommendations for improving maternal health,&#8221; the release states.</p>
<p>In an interview, Dr. Jennifer Lee, director of Virginia&#8217;s Medicaid program, said her agency is &#8220;fired up&#8221; about the effort and eager to develop a plan moving forward. She noted that Medicaid expansion will help many mothers retain coverage and access health services after they&#8217;ve given birth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Before expansion, most pregnant women lost their coverage 60 days after delivery,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Now with expansion, we have an opportunity to keep the mom covered and to be able to offer more services for both her and the baby. Because obviously the baby is not going to be able to thrive without the mom being healthy.&#8221;</p>

(Ned Oliver/ Virginia Mercury)</p><p><em>Last in a two-part look at kinship care in Virginia. To read the first installment, click <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/06/02/they-forgot-about-us-thousands-of-families-are-doing-the-same-work-as-foster-parents-in-virginia-without-the-support/" target="_blank">here</a>. </em></p>
<p>There is an inherent conundrum built into child welfare. Social workers are trying to protect kids, but  separating them from their parents is traumatizing, even if it&#8217;s for their own safety.</p>
<p>And reams of <a href="https://www.childwelfare.gov/topics/permanency/relatives/impact/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">research</a> shows that, if they have to be removed from their homes, children do best when they’re placed with family members.</p>
<p>So, for more than a decade, Virginia has been pushing to do just that: Divert the kids away from the system entirely by identifying relatives who can take custody if they’re unsafe in their homes.</p>
<p>The trouble is, nobody knows what happens next.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you’re asking me, at the state, what’s occurring with that diversion practice — how is that happening, how is it occurring, which families are getting services, which are not, how quickly are the kids going back to the family — the biological family — what are the outcomes, do they ultimately stay with that family, that sort of thing, I can’t answer those questions for you,&#8221; said Carl Ayers, director of the Division of Family Services with the Virginia Department of Social Services.</p>
<p>Diversion is, according to Ayers, the most &#8220;high risk&#8221; area within social services. By that he means there is no standardization to the practice. The state has no guidance, no regulation, no code that governs how local departments should practice diversion. And because Virginia is <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/10/29/little-kingdoms-administration-of-social-services-in-virginia-rests-largely-in-the-hands-of-localities-what-happens-when-they-cant-fix-themselves/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">state-supervised and locally-administered</a>, each local department of social services practices diversion in whatever way it sees fit.</p>
<p>That means that some families may get a home visit from a social worker before taking in the child. Some may not. In some counties, a caseworker might provide support to the family after diversion has taken place.</p>
<p>But often, the cases are &#8220;closed prematurely and meaningful permanency may not be established for the child,&#8221; states a 2016 state Department of Social Services <a href="https://rga.lis.virginia.gov/Published/2016/SD9/PDF" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">report</a> on the practice.</p>
<p>Advocates largely agree that diversion is well-intentioned. It&#8217;s an attempt to lessen, as much as possible, the trauma that a child will inevitably go through when being separated from their parents by at least keeping them with familiar people.</p>
<p>But in Virginia the practice is engulfed in a mountain of uncertainties. While foster care is often less than an ideal situation, it at least gives caseworkers the legal standing to check on the child, ensures the family has training to help them cope with emotional trauma and that a judge can determine if the child should be reunified with their parent.</p>
<p>In diversion, none of that is guaranteed.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve lost all control,&#8221; said Cathy Pemberton, a recently-retired DSS employee who worked at the state, regional and local levels over her 34-year career. &#8220;We want to do the right thing for the child, but then we lose the contact, we lose the control and we don&#8217;t really know.&#8221;</p>
<h2><strong>Lack of data</strong></h2>
<p>Diversion is a national practice that many states use, and Virginia really started ramping up its use during Gov. Tim Kaine&#8217;s administration in an effort to reduce foster care numbers.</p>
<p>The term &#8220;kinship care&#8221; refers to all sorts of situations, including informal relationships when grandparents take custody of a child without any involvement from DSS. Diversion occurs when child protective services has already gotten involved with the case, and when the parent or social worker identifies a relative who the child can live with to avoid foster care.</p>
<p>Often, once it is decided that a child cannot live with their biological parents and a relative is willing to take them, the case is closed and no additional tracking occurs. And it&#8217;s unclear how long diversion placements last. They can last just a few days, or they can become permanent.</p>
<p>Tomi Turner, family services manager with the Bedford Department of Social Services, said in her department diversion could be used when there is a heated argument teetering on emotional or physical abuse within the family. Then it might last a few days for things to cool off and for workers to connect the family to services.</p>
<p>In other cases, she said, there may be some intense mental health or substance abuse challenges, for example, that require the diversion to last longer while the parents get whatever services they need. Or it may ultimately result in the relative taking custody so that the child has some long-term permanence.</p>
<p>The best insight into the number of diversions that occur in Virginia is data from language in the 2016 budget, which had some local departments track all diversion placements.</p>
<p>Thirty-one departments participated, and from July 2016 to December 2017, about 1,300 families were diverted, encompassing about 2,200 children, Ayers said.</p>
<p>There are 120 local departments in Virginia. If all of them practice roughly the same amount of diversion, around 5,000 children may have been diverted within that 18-month time frame. There are about <a href="https://datacenter.kidscount.org/data/tables/6243-children-in-foster-care?loc=48&amp;loct=2#detailed/2/48/false/871,870,573,869,36,868,867,133,38,35/any/12987" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">4,700 children</a> in foster care in Virginia.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s how prevalent diversion practice is, that&#8217;s what it looks like,&#8221; Ayers told the Virginia Board of Social Services during its April meeting. &#8220;We have to figure out some type of guidance.&#8221;</p>
<h2><strong>Different opinions</strong></h2>
<p>There are varying thoughts on diversion within the world of child welfare. Few experts would say that it does not have its uses, but there are concerns around whether it really sets the child up for success.</p>
<p>&#8220;While some family members may offer a safe, less intrusive alternative to the bureaucratic complexities of state-supervised foster care, some child welfare experts worry that too many abused or neglected children are being inappropriately &#8216;diverted&#8217; to live with relatives without the necessary safeguards and supportive services for children, caregivers and birth parents,&#8221; states a comprehensive report by the Annie E. Casey foundation on the <a href="https://www.aecf.org/m/pdf/KinshipDiversionDebate.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kinship diversion debate</a>.</p>
<p>In Virginia, kinship caregivers are often doing<a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/06/02/they-forgot-about-us-thousands-of-families-are-doing-the-same-work-as-foster-parents-in-virginia-without-the-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> the same work as foster parents</a> but without the support or financial assistance. That&#8217;s concerning to many child welfare experts, because the children almost always come with a lot of emotional trauma that their new caregivers may not be equipped to handle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Parenting is the hardest job in the world in the best situation,&#8221; said Lisa Specter-Dunaway, CEO of the advocacy group Families Forward. &#8220;So when you add mental health issues, behavioral health, significant trauma, it makes something difficult even more difficult.&#8221;</p>
<p>Others argue that the foster care system is inherently traumatizing and keeping kids out of it is always better for their well-being.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some agency leaders and families believe strongly that, when relatives are willing and able to care for children safely, children do better without the uncertainty and potential disruption of ongoing system involvement,&#8221; the Annie E. Casey foundation report states.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is complex,&#8221; Pemberton said. &#8220;We don&#8217;t want kids in foster care, it&#8217;s not good for kids at all. But when it happens, and there&#8217;s no other option, then we need to make sure that we&#8217;re doing everything that the child needs to recover from whatever brought her to us to begin with. And when you don&#8217;t have any mandated follow up or even legal ground to follow up, you just don&#8217;t know that that happened.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the biggest problem for advocates and those working in child welfare in Virginia is the uncertainty. Maybe diversion is working, but nobody can know for sure.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think, in our effort to reduce the number of children in foster care, one of the ways to do that is to increase these types of placements,&#8221; said Jeanine Harper, executive director of Greater Richmond SCAN, or Stop Child Abuse Now. &#8220;And that&#8217;s a really healthy, good thing for children and their families and for caregivers: To know their children are with people that will maintain the bonds, potentially.</p>
<p>&#8220;But we&#8217;re doing it, and we don&#8217;t really know how well we&#8217;re doing it,&#8221; she continued. &#8220;Ultimately we don&#8217;t know if children are better off.&#8221;</p>
<h2><strong>Reunification with parents</strong></h2>
<p>Additional concerns swarm around whether or not parents are getting a fair shot at reunifying with their children once they&#8217;ve been separated. In foster care, a judge can decide if the child can live with the parent again. But there is no court oversight in diversion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anytime the state does something that interferes with someone&#8217;s constitutional rights, the state has a responsibility there,&#8221; said Valerie L&#8217;Herrou, an attorney with the Virginia Poverty Law Center. &#8220;Diversion, arguably, creates that responsibility.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would certainly agree that we don&#8217;t have to have the courts involved in that situation where there&#8217;s a clear pathway for kids to come back,&#8221; she added. &#8220;So the problem is when there isn&#8217;t a clear pathway and the kid stays away forever.&#8221;</p>
<p>The 2016 Virginia Department of Social Services report points out that, &#8220;when custody is transferred to a kin caregiver,&#8221; the department &#8220;has no further legal obligation to the parent in terms of reunification.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve deprived this parent of their child using the force of the state, in this case as a threat, but they&#8217;ve provided no due process whatsoever,&#8221; L&#8217;Herrou said.</p>
<h2><strong>Regulations</strong></h2>
<p>Right now, the state is waiting on a report from Child Trends, a child-focused research organization, with more details on the data collected between 2016 and 2017 on diversion. From there, Ayers said, the state will determine how to provide guidance to the local departments.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure where diversion will take us,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m not sure that I&#8217;m majorly worried that we&#8217;re placing children at risk. I&#8217;m not worried about their safety from that end of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Andy Crawford, director of the Bedford Department of Social Services, said regulations are a double-edged sword. He would like to see some guidance around diversion, but not if it becomes an unfunded mandate.</p>
<p>Local departments of social services are <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/08/27/long-hours-low-pay-and-constant-turnover-social-services-agencies-in-virginia-struggle-to-keep-staff/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">struggling with high turnover and low retention</a> rates in their work forces. If they don&#8217;t get the staff they need to institute new requirements for diversion — to pay for the time a social worker would have to spend checking up on families, for example, or inputting data — new regulations could hurt more than they help.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a problem where we don’t have enough staff in this state,&#8221; said Crawford, who is also the president of the League of Social Services Executives. &#8220;So what happens when you don’t have enough staff is people make mistakes or they don’t do their jobs well because they’re stressed. So when people make mistakes the General Assembly makes more policy. When the General Assembly makes more policy, that makes the work even harder.&#8221;</p>
<p>The first step with diversion, though, is understanding if it actually helps children.</p>
<p>&#8220;We cannot answer the question: What happens to these kids?&#8221; said Allison Gilbreath, policy analyst with Voices for Virginia&#8217;s Children. &#8220;We don’t have any data, we don’t know qualitatively: Are they better off? Are they having their basic needs met long term, do they enter the system later, do they eventually go back to their family of origin? We can’t answer those questions. And that concerns me.</p>
<p>&#8220;That’s a lot of children who we’re not 100 percent sure we did the right thing. We may have, but we don’t know.&#8221;</p>

To read the second installment, click <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/06/03/every-year-children-are-diverted-away-from-foster-care-and-placed-with-relatives-nobody-knows-what-happens-next/" target="_blank">here</a>. </em></p>
<p>On a June day in 2011, Ray Richardson was at work when he got a call from his daughter and was given a choice: Either his granddaughter, 7-year-old Lilia, would be staying with Richardson and his wife, or she was going into foster care.</p>
<p>“Period. Point blank,” Richardson recalled.</p>
<p>So he and his wife, Carolyn, drove up to Fredericksburg that day. They packed Lilia and the black garbage bags filled with her toys into their car, and Carolyn Richardson asked her daughter: “Please, let them both stay together. Let me take Isaiah, too, so they’ll be together.”</p>
<p>They would get 5-year-old Isaiah the next day, when their daughter — the children&#8217;s father had recently died — dropped him off. Carolyn Richardson would keep the kids in the same room for a while after they moved into their grandparents’ house in Chesterfield, because she wanted them to stay together after so much upheaval.</p>
<p>The Richardsons found themselves in a role they never expected, and now they’re both parents and retirees. They’ve had to answer the same question presented to every other family in their situation: How will they make ends meet?</p>
<p>About <a href="https://datacenter.kidscount.org/data/tables/108-children-in-the-care-of-grandparents?loc=48&amp;loct=2#detailed/2/48/false/871,870,573,869,36,868,867,133,38,35/any/433,434" target="_blank">70,000 children</a> are in the care of their grandparents in Virginia, according to the Annie E. Casey Foundation. That’s about 4 percent of Virginia’s children. More are being raised by other relatives: aunts, uncles and cousins.</p>
<p>Known as kinship families, they’re doing the same exact work as foster families, yet in Virginia they get none of the support or financial assistance that formal foster families receive. They could get a monthly stipend if they jumped through the numerous hoops — from background checks to training — required to become a licensed foster home, but most simply bring the children into their homes without thinking twice about their options.</p>
<p>They struggle with poverty, caring for children who often have gone through traumatic experiences and frequently have nowhere to turn for help.</p>
<p>“I call kinship families the net underneath child welfare,” said Allison Gilbreath, policy analyst with Voices for Virginia’s Children, an advocacy group. “And if someone were to pull that safety net away, child welfare would truly crumble. Caseloads would double and they would have such a spike in need for families that they would not be able to properly care for them all.”</p>
<p>Sometimes, relatives take the child in proactively, before social services has gotten involved. Other times, local departments help parents identify relatives and intentionally divert kids from the foster care system.</p>
<p>But almost always, the relatives take the children in to protect them and keep them connected to family. Sometimes, advocates and social services workers say, they understand the challenges they will face.</p>
<p>Sometimes they don’t.</p>
<h2><strong>Scraping by</strong></h2>
<p>Janet Wheeler doesn’t know how she’s going to buy a new stove. It inexplicably caught fire last week, and the 63-year-old Glade Spring resident has already taken out a loan against her home to do some repairs to the house.</p>
<figure id="attachment_9098" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:300px;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-9098" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/cutting-nanas-hair-for-chemo-300x273.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="273" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/cutting-nanas-hair-for-chemo-300x273.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/cutting-nanas-hair-for-chemo-768x699.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/cutting-nanas-hair-for-chemo-696x634.jpg 696w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/cutting-nanas-hair-for-chemo-461x420.jpg 461w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/cutting-nanas-hair-for-chemo.jpg 791w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Janet Wheeler&#8217;s granddaughter cuts her hair in preparation for chemotherapy. (Photo courtesy of Janet Wheeler)</p></figure>
<p>“We barely scrape by,” she said.</p>
<p>Wheeler has been looking after her 13-year-old granddaughter most of her life. She couldn’t have foreseen that she’d be diagnosed with both breast and colorectal cancer seven years ago.</p>
<p>“I almost died once, and I remember I wanted to go because it was so peaceful,” she said.</p>
<p>“And they called my daughter in, and one of my good girlfriends was there with me, and she had my granddaughter. And I looked at my granddaughter and I looked at my daughter, and it’s like I knew I can’t go yet. I have to fight. So my prayer was, ‘God, let me live to see her grow.’ So, yeah. … It’s been hard … for both of us.”</p>
<p>Her health problems have only added to her litany of challenges. She has numerous specialists she’s supposed to see, but she doesn’t see them all because she can’t afford the co-pays.</p>
<p>She’s found out through online grandparent groups that not every state is like Virginia. She hears stories of kinship families in Tennessee in situations just like hers who get $1,000 a month.</p>
<p>“I’d be happy with $500,” she said. “Oh my gosh, $500 would help me astronomically.”</p>
<p>Becoming a kinship family has transformed Wheeler into an advocate. She thinks it’s unfair that non-relative foster families get a monthly maintenance payment and training to help their children get the therapy and help they need to overcome traumatic experiences — while kinship families can&#8217;t access any of that.</p>
<p>She has ensured her granddaughter gets counseling. Wheeler needs counseling herself. But she can&#8217;t afford it.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are so isolated,&#8221; she said. &#8220;At the end of the day, if you have a few minutes, you have nobody to call. Nobody wants to talk to you and hear about this stuff. They’re living their lives.&#8221;</p>
<p>There are a few basic benefits available to kids living with relatives. They can receive Medicaid or free lunch at school, among others. Some localities have their own supports in place for kinship families, too, that aren&#8217;t available statewide.</p>
<p>They can also qualify for what&#8217;s known as child-only Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, or TANF, which is meant for kinship-care situations. But not everyone is eligible. Wheeler hasn&#8217;t had success in applying, she said, but the Richardsons have.</p>
<p>Ray Richardson said the family receives $247 per month for both Lilia and Isaiah through TANF. That hardly covers groceries.</p>
<p>The kids are doing well. Lilia, now 15, says other families probably face bigger challenges than hers.  Carolyn Richardson retired when they got the kids because, since they were so young, she needed to make sure she was home to get them off the bus every day. Ray Richardson continued to work until he retired in 2014, about three years after Lilia and Isaiah moved in with them.</p>
<p>Once the family went on a fixed income, things got tougher, he said.</p>
<p>“We have to try to stretch the social security from paycheck to paycheck and we also — I tucked my tail and applied for the food bank, and we were approved to go to the food bank twice a month,” he said.</p>
<p>“And you’ve got to understand that that hurt me to my heart.”</p>
<p>Both the Richardsons and Wheeler wonder: They were proactive and took their grandchildren in before they were at risk of becoming part of the foster care system. Why don’t they get any of the support?</p>
<p>“The ones that went to court out of love in our hearts,” Wheeler said. “They forgot about us.”</p>

<h2><strong>Setting them up for failure</strong></h2>
<p>The 2019 General Assembly session saw an outpouring of support from lawmakers for Virginia’s foster care system, spurred by a scathing Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission <a href="http://jlarc.virginia.gov/pdfs/reports/Rpt513-2.pdf" target="_blank">report</a>.</p>
<p>Advocates are hoping that momentum will lead to more investments in the child welfare system, particularly for kinship families so they can receive the same support as foster families: annual training on how to help a child who has been through trauma or assistance managing behavior, as well as the monthly stipend.</p>
<p>It’s a big ask. There are about 4,700 children in foster care in Virginia. Thousands more live in an informal kinship household. Right now Virginia offers between about $470 and $700 a month to registered foster parents, depending on the age of the child.</p>
<p>There are also many other areas within the social services system that need funding — from upgrading the <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/10/29/little-kingdoms-administration-of-social-services-in-virginia-rests-largely-in-the-hands-of-localities-what-happens-when-they-cant-fix-themselves/" target="_blank">training</a> system to <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/04/30/upcoming-review-expected-to-find-uncover-similar-problems-in-child-protective-services-as-foster-care/" target="_blank">bolstering the workforce</a>.</p>
<p>But the cost of not providing financial support to kinship families is even higher, pointed out Lisa Specter-Dunaway, CEO and president of Families Forward Virginia, an advocacy organization.</p>
<p>“It really sets up the adults, and it sets up the kids, for failure because the information they need is not readily available, the supports are not readily available,” she said.</p>
<p>In advance of the 2020 General Assembly session, Gilbreath, with Voices for Virginia’s Children, has been working to identify how other states provide funds and support to kinship families, and how they pay for it so that maybe Virginia could do the same — but it’s turned into a surprisingly difficult task.</p>
<p>“Many states already had kinship care created in their system from the onset,” she said. “So trying to figure out what they did is such a challenge because when you ask them, they don’t understand my question. They’re just like, ‘This is the way it’s always been.’”</p>
<p>Virginia is expected to be an early implementer of the federal <a href="https://www.grandfamilies.org/Portals/0/Documents/FFPSA/FFPSA%20brief%20summary%20grandfamilies%20provisions%20only.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Family First Prevention Services Act</a>, though, which is likely to help kinship families. It could increase funding for kinship navigator programs, to help people like Wheeler and the Richardsons figure out what benefits they might qualify for. Some localities already have such programs, but they&#8217;re not readily available statewide.</p>
<p>Last year, Gilbreath went on a <a href="https://vakids.org/our-news/blog/kathy-dial-kinship-care-champion" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">listening tour</a> in which she met with kinship families all over the state.</p>
<p>“I was really shocked by the stories we heard,” she said. “In Hampton Roads we asked: ‘Tell us if you’ve been impacted by the opioid epidemic.’ And every single person raised their hands.”</p>
<p>Many of the participants were grandparents, but there were also great-grandparents, Gilbreath said, some in their late 70s, some in their 80s, raising very young children. All of them said that their financial situation is the number one source of stress in their lives.</p>
<p>“All of them said that they were jealous of foster parents,” she said, “because the state would pay a stranger to raise this relative child, but they won’t give them any assistance to do the same exact thing.”</p>
<h2><strong>&#8216;It didn’t do anything for us&#8217;</strong></h2>
<p>There has already been a slight push in Virginia to expand services to kinship families, but it applies to only a sliver of those who are actually caring for relatives&#8217; children.</p>
<p>There are many ways that a child may come into the care of their relatives. One is becoming a registered foster family and taking the child in that way.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://vakids.org/our-news/blog/virginia-lawmakers-pass-the-kinship-guardianship-assistance-program" target="_blank">2018</a>, state lawmakers created a Kinship Guardian Assistance Program, or <a href="https://vakids.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Kinship-Guardianship-Fact-Sheet.pdf" target="_blank">KinGAP</a>,  which provides monthly payments for those children who enter foster care and are placed with a relative. It took five years of advocating and submitting the legislation before it was passed.</p>
<p>But eligibility is restricted to those who have been placed with the relative for at least six months and for whom reunification with the birth family or adoption has been ruled out.</p>
<p>Both the Richardsons and Wheeler were excited about the program and advocated for its passage. But then they realized they wouldn’t be eligible: Both families are examples of informal kinship care relationships. They had never been licensed foster families.</p>
<p>“I thought it took care of people like us, as well,” Ray Richardson said. “But then I found out that it didn’t cover our situation. … Basically, it didn’t do anything for us. Zero.”</p>
<p>Virginia has very few registered relative foster families. Only <a href="https://datacenter.kidscount.org/data/tables/6247-children-in-foster-care-by-placement-type?loc=48&amp;loct=2#detailed/2/48/true/871,870,573,869,36,868,867,133,38,35/2622,2621,2623,2620,2625,2624,2626/12994,12995" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">7 percent</a> of children in foster care are living with a relative, according to the Annie E. Casey foundation, compared to a nationwide average of 32 percent.</p>
<p>One reason for that, pointed out Carl Ayers, director of the Division of Family Services with the Department of Social Services, is that families prefer not to have social services in their lives. Rather, he said, the state focuses on preventing kids from coming into foster care in the first place by diverting them to live with a relative once child protective services deems the parent or guardian is unable to care for the child.</p>
<p>A lot of families don’t want to become foster parents, he said, because they don’t want the oversight — background checks and court visits — that go along with that.</p>
<p>But some worry that families might not know what their options are when they take in relative children, and they’re often making the decision to accept the kids quickly, usually because safety is a concern.</p>
<p>Advocates are hoping that KinGAP is the first step, and that it shows a willingness on the part of lawmakers to extend support to kinship families.</p>

<h2><strong>The role of trauma</strong></h2>
<p>There is an inherent understanding by people who work in child welfare — including workers at local departments of social services and advocates alike — that being with a relative is the best place for a child who has to be separated from her or his parents.</p>
<p>“Kids do better in kinship families, when they aren’t taken away from everything they know, and they maintain those connections,” said Laura Ash-Brackley, chief programs office with the Children’s Home Society of Virginia. “And we really should be supporting these families and helping them to make this work.”</p>
<p>A relative is also more likely to stick with the child while they’re dealing with whatever trauma they may have experienced that forced the separation from their biological parents — or from the inherent difficulty of separating from their parents in the first place.</p>
<p>“For one thing, the trauma is less because they don’t feel like, ‘I’ve been ripped away from everything I’ve ever known,’” said Valerie L’Herrou, an attorney with the Virginia Poverty Law Center. “They might be two or three removals from mom, but the connection is still there. Chances are, you know this person, if it’s a grandpa or aunt or uncle.</p>
<p>“And when kids in trauma act out, a stranger is more likely to say, ‘I just can’t keep this kid,’ and find them a different placement. A relative is more likely to say, ‘We’re going to try and stick this out.’”</p>
<p>But it’s not all upside, L’Herrou added, especially if families aren’t given the support they need. Many are poor, and many are single grandmothers or great-grandmothers.</p>
<p>Plus, raising children who are traumatized is different and more difficult.</p>
<p>“What’s happened is: That person who was supposed to care for you, comfort you and help you regulate your emotions is a person who now is threatening, or doesn’t take care of you and you have to take care of your own needs,” Ash-Brackley said.</p>
<p>“Your whole emotional regulation system gets hijacked and so you’re much more hyperaware, hypersensitive to things. You see kids totally blowing up and overacting to something very small, and it’s because they feel threatened physiologically and emotionally.”</p>
<p>Older caregivers from a different generation may not realize that a traumatized child is going to react badly if they’re told to go to their room, for example, especially if they’ve been neglected for long periods of time, Ash-Brackley said. Or a child who has experienced food insecurity might have a meltdown if their request for a snack before dinner is denied.</p>
<p>“There has been, I think, among some folks, an attitude that they’re kin, so they ought to step in and do this, and we don’t need to support them,” said Bruin Richardson, chief advancement officer with the Children&#8217;s Home Society of Virginia.</p>
<p>“And we don’t think that’s correct. It may be how you feel, but it doesn’t reflect the reality that sometimes these are folks of limited means, and they need assistance to help care for another child they weren’t planning on having to care for.”</p>

<p>And children seeking treatment are facing the same problems, with one big difference. Only one state psychiatric facility accepts children: the Commonwealth Center for Children and Adolescents in Staunton.</p>
<p>With 48 beds, the center has been forced to adjust to the reality that more children and teens are being admitted for treatment involuntarily through temporary detention orders, or TDOs, <a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/virginia/government-politics/as-summer-ends-pressures-build-again-at-virginia-s-only/article_125540ea-5f1c-5e29-958b-6147540fb46f.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">than ever before</a>. They&#8217;ve limited other types of admissions so very few voluntary patients are treated there.</p>
<p>&#8220;We do occasionally take a transfer from a private hospital, rarely a voluntary admission,&#8221; said Dr. Jack Barber, the facility&#8217;s acting director. &#8220;What the center&#8217;s task (is), primarily, at this point, is stabilization after a crisis. It&#8217;s no longer a place where people are going to stay for weeks and months and get psychotherapy and that sort of thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>The shift of focus adds to the sense that Virginia&#8217;s mental health system is lopsided in favor of crisis care.</p>
<p>Some parents, whose child would otherwise have been a voluntary placement, may seek treatment via a temporary detention order if they think it&#8217;s their only option, said Margaret Nimmo Holland, executive director of Voices for Virginia&#8217;s Children.</p>
<p>&#8220;When a child really needs treatment and a parent can&#8217;t get it any other way, and they can&#8217;t get in the front door, they&#8217;re going to find another way to get in,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;And you can&#8217;t blame them. They&#8217;re going to do anything they can to help their kids.&#8221;</p>
<h2><strong>The vast majority of children have behavioral problems, not psychotic illnesses</strong></h2>
<p>Fewer than five percent of the patients at the Commonwealth Center actually have a psychotic illness. The vast majority have behavioral problems, and they wind up with a detention order because no other provider in the state can manage their aggression, Barber said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most of the kids who come here are not acutely ill,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;They have ongoing difficulties and what has happened is that they either become acutely frustrated, anxious, confused, disappointed, disrespected and they have had a behavioral crisis during which they&#8217;ve, typically, become aggressive toward other people, made threats toward other people and, occasionally, threatened themselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>Many of the children have experienced trauma, he added. Some of their diagnoses include generalized anxiety, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, depression or post-traumatic stress disorder. Few have the psychotic illnesses commonly seen in adult hospitals, where people may experience symptoms like delusion or paranoia.</p>
<p>As of last week, the facility has had 993 admissions in this fiscal year so far, more than the entire 2018 fiscal year. Only about 12 to 15 of the admissions this year were not TDOs, according to the Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services.</p>
<p>But increasingly, the facility is seeing more children with developmental disabilities. In the 2015 fiscal year there were only 193 admissions of children and teens with a developmental disability, but that jumped to 267 in 2018. For the first six months of the 2019 fiscal year, these patients represented 32 percent of all admissions.</p>
<p>The increase is concerning, Barber said, because a busy children&#8217;s hospital unit is not ideal for someone with a diagnosis like autism, for example.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everybody understands that, you know, in a crisis there may be nothing else that can be done because they&#8217;re too aggressive to be accepted somewhere else,&#8221; Barber said. &#8220;But I think it would be much better for them if they didn&#8217;t stay very long here, if there was some place they could go that would be more settled, more consistent.&#8221;</p>
<h2><strong>With shift to stabilization, kids are staying for shorter periods of time</strong></h2>
<p>To adjust to the primary focus of stabilization after a crisis, patients are getting support and acute treatment in a very short time frame. In 2015, the average length of stay was about 16 days. Last year, it was only nine days.</p>
<p>But that doesn&#8217;t apply to all the kids treated there. The facility struggles with children who are &#8220;stuck,&#8221; Barber said, waiting for out-of-state placement. Though the average length of stay is less than 10 days, some patients are staying for six weeks to several months.</p>
<p>&#8220;No one in Virginia will accept them,&#8221; Barber said. &#8220;Usually because of their histories. They have aggressive histories and so they get denied by all the in-state providers. &#8230; These are kids who need residential treatment or residential support and have not been safe in the community.&#8221;</p>
<p>During the 2018 calendar year, the facility sent 14 children out of state, Barber said. In 2017, it sent only three.</p>
<h2><strong>Staffing has improved </strong></h2>
<p>One bright spot for the Staunton facility, though, is its workforce. As of 18 months ago, Barber said, 50 percent of the nursing positions were vacant.</p>
<p>Now they&#8217;re full, as are the psychiatrist and psychologist positions.</p>
<p>&#8220;A year and a half ago the center was in pretty difficult straits because <a href="https://www.newsleader.com/story/news/2018/10/03/restraint-commonwealth-center-virginia-treatment-center-children-juvenile-center-seclusion/1301297002/" target="_blank">we did have staff who were being injured,</a> we had staff working mandatory overtime, we didn&#8217;t have full treatment teams,&#8221; Barber said. &#8220;It was a very difficult spring in 2018.&#8221;</p>
<p>Two major efforts have helped improve the staffing numbers: making good use of international recruitment to stabilize the registered nurse workforce and significant improvements to the work environment.</p>
<p>Barber said the hospital has made an effort to improve communication, have regular meetings and avoid mandatory overtime. The changes have worked: The facility is now getting more applications than people it can hire for some direct care jobs, which can be difficult to fill.</p>
<h2><strong>The solutions are the same</strong></h2>
<p>While the challenges facing kids who receive a detention order are slightly different than adults, the solutions are largely the same: They need to be prevented from coming to the hospital in the first place.</p>
<p>According to Mental Health America&#8217;s <a href="http://www.mentalhealthamerica.net/issues/mental-health-america-youth-data" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2019 report</a>, 63 percent of the children in Virginia who experience a major depressive episode — characterized by a <a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/major-depression.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">two-week period</a> in which a person experiences a depressed mood and symptoms like problems sleeping, eating or self worth — did not receive treatment. Of those who did, only 20 percent were treated consistently.</p>
<p>Getting a detention order is an inherently traumatizing experience, Holland pointed out. The kids are separated from their families, often they lose access to their belongings and they must be <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/state-aims-to-reduce-transportation-trauma-for-involuntary-mental-health-detentions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">transported to the hospital</a> in the back of a law enforcement vehicle, <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/09/11/handcuffed-and-in-crisis-with-a-shortage-of-nearby-beds-police-drive-mental-patients-across-the-state-for-treatment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">handcuffed</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a really painful thing for families to talk about,&#8221; Holland said. &#8220;Kids have developing brains, so trauma you experience as a child has lifelong mental and physical health repercussions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Almost all the kids at the Commonwealth Center have gone through some troubling times, Barber said. They need a range of additional supports that aren&#8217;t readily available everywhere: outpatient work to help them with their behavioral skills, psychotherapy or work on their trauma histories, among others.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sometimes it&#8217;s just teaching them how to manage their frustration, how to help them feel more comfortable in their own skin,&#8221; Barber said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s not just once-a-week seeing the psychiatrist or something. It needs to be much more encompassing to develop the ability to tolerate frustration or rejection or be a little less sensitive or see what they might be able to accomplish so they have some hope and meaning and motivation.&#8221;</p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>More than 280,000 people have signed up for Medicaid now that Virginia has expanded the program, and the state is starting to get a clearer picture of what sort of illnesses the new enrollees are dealing with.</p>
<p>According to new data that Dr. Jennifer Lee, director of the state&#8217;s Medicaid program, presented to the <a href="http://sfc.virginia.gov/pdf/committee_meeting_presentations/2019%20Interim/052119_No3_DMAS.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Senate Finance Committee</a> on Tuesday, in January and February more than 175,000 of the new members visited a provider.</p>
<p>During that same time period, more than 81,000 received a prescription, Lee told lawmakers.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is probably higher at this point in time,&#8221; she said. As of the beginning of March, about 240,000 adults had signed up for the program, according to the state&#8217;s new Medicaid expansion <a href="https://www.dmas.virginia.gov/#/dashboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dashboard</a>.</p>
<p>The data shows that many of the new members are dealing with complex health problems. Nearly 35,000 have a history of hypertension, more than 16,000 have a diabetes diagnosis, about 2,500 have cancer and more than 15,000 have a substance use disorder.</p>
<p>Lee broke that last number down further, telling the committee that around 7,000 have an opioid use disorder and more than 5,500 have an alcohol use disorder.</p>
<p>Additionally, more than 25,000 have a <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/05/20/thousands-received-addiction-treatment-once-medicaid-paid-for-it-could-that-happen-for-mental-health/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">serious mental illness</a>.</p>
<p>The data allows Virginia to better comprehend what needs the new enrollees have. Previously, the state had based their estimates on the experiences of other states when they expanded their programs.</p>
<p>Lee noted that Virginia has also been getting back surveys it sent members and providers, which show that 1 in 5 new enrollees have a mental health need.</p>
<p>&#8220;And the other interesting finding in the member survey is that two-thirds of them are saying they have an unmet dental care need,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>Medicaid does not have a comprehensive <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/09/04/the-gaping-dental-gap-as-virginia-prepares-to-expand-medicaid-thousands-still-lack-access-to-dental-care/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dental benefit</a> for adults.</p>
<h2><strong>Arguing over work requirement continues</strong></h2>
<p>During the same presentation, Lee updated the lawmakers on where the state stands with its work requirement application, <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/state-expects-medicaid-work-requirement-approval-no-later-than-the-summer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">which the federal government has to approve</a> before the state can implement the changes.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/09/20/senate-republicans-fume-over-medicaid-work-requirement-time-frame/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Just as they did last year</a>, Republicans lawmakers expressed dismay that penalties for failing to meet the state&#8217;s work requirements will likely not go into effect until 2021 at the earliest.</p>
<p>Lee explained that the delay is because the state is still working out the details of its work requirement program with the federal government. Once its application is approved, Virginia will go live with its requirements for the first year, then in the second year it will institute the penalties for those who do not comply.</p>
<p>Medicaid beneficiaries will risk losing coverage if they do not meet the work requirements or properly document that they qualify for one of the exemptions.</p>
<p>Sen. Stephen Newman, R-Lynchburg, told Lee that the timeline she described &#8220;just isn&#8217;t what we were promised.</p>
<p>&#8220;From the moment we came into the Senate Finance meetings, it just feels like it is delay, delay, delay,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Sen. Janet Howell, D-Fairfax, came to the state&#8217;s defense, pointing out that the source of any delay rests with the federal government.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see any delay on the part of Virginia at all,&#8221; she said. &#8220;What I do see is the expansion population is a relatively unhealthy one. And as we bring them back to health, they will want to work, and I think that&#8217;s a fundamental difference, frankly, between Democrats and Republicans: We think people want to work. You think they want to be lazy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Newman countered that the plan to delay work requirements&#8217; implementation by over two years was not discussed on the floor when lawmakers were arguing over <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/07/23/four-years-of-political-battling-over-medicaid-expansion-has-ended-what-comes-next/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">whether or not to expand Medicaid</a>. Work requirements made expansion more palatable to the state&#8217;s Republicans.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s clear up here that opinions haven&#8217;t changed,&#8221; said Sen. Emmett Hanger, R-Augusta, who was a<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/key-gop-state-senator-reaches-compromise-with-va-house-on-medicaid/2018/05/21/5f1eb2d4-5d45-11e8-9ee3-49d6d4814c4c_story.html?utm_term=.58979a5cbab1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> key vote</a> in expanding Medicaid. &#8220;Those who are for it are for it, and those who are against it are against it. But we&#8217;re working through it.&#8221;</p>

<p>“Say you open one door, six more open after that,” Murdoch, now a Tappahannock resident, said of Maryland. “Whereas, in Virginia, it was the total opposite. Nobody would tell us anything.”</p>
<p>In Virginia, it took two years to secure a Medicaid <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/01/14/waiting-for-help-developmental-disability-advocates-push-for-funding-to-meet-an-ever-growing-need/" target="_blank">waiver</a> for his son, who was later diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder, which the National Alliance on Mental Illness describes as a mental illness &#8220;characterized primarily by symptoms of schizophrenia, such as hallucinations or delusions, and symptoms of a mood disorder, such as mania and depression.&#8221;</p>
<p>“In order to get the services, my son had to be hospitalized,” said Murdoch, who is a member of the state’s newly-created Medicaid Member Advisory Committee. “If I hadn’t gone that route, I wouldn’t be able to get what I needed for him, because they said I made too much, but there’s no way I could afford the services.”</p>
<p>Murdoch’s story isn’t unique. Advocates tell similar tales when appealing to lawmakers to change the state’s behavioral health system from one with a distinct focus on crisis care to a system in which people can get the treatment they need before the crisis ever occurs.</p>
<p>Right now, Virginia is in the midst of a massive transformation of the behavioral health system so it provides ample access to outpatient and preventative care.</p>
<p>The Department of Medical Assistance Services and the Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services are working on changing Virginia’s Medicaid program so it covers a continuum of behavioral health services.</p>
<p>The Medicaid changes will create a funding stream so clinicians can be reimbursed and patients can have more consistent access. The hope is that by making more services eligible for Medicaid coverage, more providers will emerge to meet the demand,<a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/virginia/medicaid-program-expands-access-for-addiction-treatment-but-the-death/article_ca0ad5f9-7b95-5b10-8521-800cd12b9614.html" target="_blank"> a model that has proven successful</a> in addiction treatment in Virginia.</p>
<p>“I like to think of it like this: You get what you pay for,” Dr. Hughes Melton, the state behavioral health commissioner, told a panel of lawmakers in early April. “And the reality is that Medicaid pays for … a behavioral delivery system that we wanted in the &#8217;80s and the &#8217;90s.”</p>
<p>The goal of the redesign effort is to pivot the system away from an over-reliance on intensive treatment services and to instead fund outpatient and community-based services, said Dr. Alyssa Ward, behavioral health clinical director with the Department of Medical Assistance Services.</p>
<p>The two departments have been working since October to come up with a plan to redesign the system and they hope to roll out the first phase of services by the summer of 2020. That will include functional family therapy, partial hospitalization and intensive outpatient programs, among others. After that, additional services will be phased in over time, like school-based behavioral health, family programs and case management.</p>
<p>Medicaid did something similar in 2017 for those with substance use disorders. Its <a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/virginia/virginia-rolls-out-new-substance-use-disorder-benefit/article_042c34bc-d222-544d-8562-aa3e5dae4bec.html" target="_blank">Addiction and Recovery Treatment Services</a> program expanded access to addiction treatment for thousands of Virginians. After its implementation, there was a <a href="http://farleyhealthpolicycenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Continuum-Report.pdf" target="_blank">69 percent</a> increase in Medicaid members receiving substance use disorder treatment, and a 25 percent decrease in total emergency department visits related to an opioid use disorder.</p>
<p>“The difference lies in the fact that behavioral health, which really is the global term around mental health and substance use, is a much larger picture than just substance use services,” Ward said. “What we’re really looking to do is make some really significant changes to the structure of the Medicaid-funded behavioral health system in order to drastically improve access to care.”</p>
<h2><strong>The need</strong></h2>
<p>It is an ambitious effort. As of 2017, an estimated 28 percent of Virginia’s Medicaid population had a behavioral health diagnosis, according to the state. That equates to more than 386,000 people with challenges ranging from anxiety and depression to bipolar disorder or schizophrenia.</p>
<p>There may be even more need within the Medicaid expansion population. Virginia anticipates that <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/09/20/up-to-half-of-medicaid-expansion-population-could-have-behavioral-health-or-substance-use-diagnoses/" target="_blank">up to half</a> of those enrollees will have a behavioral health or substance-use diagnosis, which could add as many as 200,000 people.</p>
<p>But for that roughly half a million people in need of treatment, access is far from consistent. Medicaid coverage is filled with gaps. For example, it will reimburse inpatient hospitalization, but not intensive outpatient or <a href="https://www.medicare.gov/coverage/mental-health-care-partial-hospitalization" target="_blank">partial hospitalization</a>, which allows someone to receive treatment during the day but not stay overnight.</p>
<p>Without access to consistent treatment — or a financial incentive for providers to offer it in the first place — the overall behavioral health system has similarly tilted toward a crisis-driven approach, in which state hospitals are <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/12/05/lawmakers-recommendations-address-temporary-detention-order-crisis-mental-health-in-jails/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dangerously crowded</a> with patients and a patchwork array of community services are available in different parts of the state.</p>
<p>The Virginia Hospital and Healthcare Association recommended creating a Medicaid benefit to pay for partial hospitalization and intensive outpatient treatment, both of which will help reduce inpatient admissions.</p>
<p>As state hospitals have seen a huge increase in the number of <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/12/03/you-have-no-control-as-psychiatric-admissions-rise-virginia-grapples-with-a-hospital-crisis-that-threatens-care-and-safety/" target="_blank">involuntarily detained</a> patients, private hospitals have also seen an increase in voluntary patients seeking care. Collectively, the hospitals are adding 159 new psychiatric beds across the state by 2022 to help address the need.</p>
<p>“Our system is overly focused on crisis care,” said Rhonda Thissen, executive director of the National Alliance on Mental Illness of Virginia. “If we can enhance community-based mental health services that reduce the need for crisis treatment, then this problem will ameliorate, and that’s the whole goal of behavioral health redesign.”</p>
<h2><strong>A statewide effort</strong></h2>
<p>The Department of Medical Assistance Services is not alone in trying to right-size Virginia’s behavioral health system and focus on prevention.</p>
<p>The state&#8217;s System Transformation Excellence and Performance, or <a href="http://www.dbhds.virginia.gov/developmental-services/step-va" target="_blank">STEP-VA</a>, is currently working to ensure that people in every region in the state have access to the same services through their local community services board, or CSB.</p>
<p>In social services, the state is preparing to implement the Families First Prevention Services Act, which will, for the first time, allow local departments to be reimbursed for preventative, rather than reactive, services.</p>
<p>But providing a Medicaid benefit, Ward said, will bolster and help sustain all those efforts.</p>
<p>“There’s been quite significant development and progress over the past couple of years around strengthening and building out the behavioral health system,” said Mira Signer, chief deputy commissioner of the Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services.</p>
<p>“That’s sort of one reason why redesign is so essential: It supports the long-term sustainability of STEP-VA and is a key component of helping them move the system further along.”</p>
<p>Right now, the Department of Medical Assistance Services is working on a rate study to determine how much it will cost the state to expand Medicaid coverage.</p>
<p>“The rate study is this fiscal impact analysis that projects the path forward,” Ward said. “It’s why it’s a phased design, so we can do this incrementally and understand in the first wave the cost impact.”</p>
<p>But the ultimate hope is that the savings the state will see from fewer people using intensive services, like trips to the emergency room or psychiatric hospitalizations, will offset the cost.</p>
<p>DMAS is due to submit reports to the General Assembly outlining the projected costs by October and December.</p>
<p>But for people like Murdoch, the cost is less significant than what standardized access across the state will mean to people dealing with behavioral challenges.</p>
<p>“You shouldn’t have to go find it. You should be told where to get it,” he said. “People should not have to struggle.”</p>

<p>The case targets four of the state&#8217;s abortion regulations, several of which have been on the books for more than four decades. They include rules stating that abortions can only be provided by physicians and women must receive an ultrasound 24 hours before the procedure is performed as well as additional regulations that apply to the clinics that provide abortions.</p>
<p>The federal case, which boasts between 5,000 and 7,000 pages of documents, is before Judge Henry E. Hudson, who was appointed to his position on the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia by President George W. Bush. It is due to last two weeks.</p>
<p>The first witness for the plaintiffs, Dr. Mark Nichols, an OB/GYN from Oregon, testified to the safety of different types of abortions. He said the rate of complications is lower than several other common procedures, like tonsillectomies and vasectomies, and that when complications do occur during an abortion they are almost always easily treated outside of a hospital.</p>
<p>He also noted that abortions are far safer than childbirth, where the mortality rate is 14 to 17 times greater than having an abortion.</p>
<p>The plaintiffs — several clinics around Virginia that provide abortions — claim that the laws around clinics, including that they must meet hospital-like standards in some cases, are onerous. Nichols agreed, questioning why abortion clinics have been &#8220;singled out&#8221; and adding that he sees no medical benefit to the procedure.</p>
<p>Lawyers for the defendants — numerous state officials responsible for enforcing the regulations and licensing requirements the suit is challenging — pointed out that complications do occur, and that the woman may have to travel a great distance to get to a hospital if the procedure takes place in an outpatient facility.</p>
<p>Though the Attorney General&#8217;s Office, responsible for defending state laws, has had some active involvement in the case, the bulk of the defense is being handled by lawyers with the law firm Hirschler, who were hired as outside counsel.</p>
<p>Hudson often interjected to clarify Nichols&#8217; testimony, frequently asking him to clarify that he was referring to first-trimester abortion care, rather than those performed later on in pregnancy, and asking if the medical procedures Nichols referred to, such as vasectomies, are only performed by physicians.</p>
<p>The judge had already ruled on Virginia&#8217;s physician-only rule, but <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/seeking-more-information-federal-judge-backtracks-on-decision-allowing-abortions-without-a-physician/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rescinded</a> his decision about a week later, saying he wanted more information during trial. His decision in allowing non-physician clinicians, like nurse practitioners and physician assistants, to perform abortions had only applied to first-trimester abortions rather than second-trimester.</p>

<p>The state estimated that fewer than 200,000 adults would be enrolled in coverage from January to June of this year, according to a <a href="https://thehalfsheet.org/post/184872969608/new-medicaid-data-tells-story-of-success-and" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">report</a> by Freddy Mejia of the Commonwealth Institute for Fiscal Analysis.</p>
<p>Virginia&#8217;s Medicaid agency operates an expansion <a href="https://www.dmas.virginia.gov/#/dashboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dashboard</a> that regularly updates with the number of newly-enrolled adults. As of May 3, nearly 100,000 of the new enrollees were parents, and 45 percent were between the ages of 19 and 34 years old.</p>
<p>At 61 percent, women made up the vast majority of those who have enrolled so far, too, while nearly 200,000 of the enrollees earned below 100 percent of the federal poverty level, or $20,780 for a family of three.</p>
<p>But looming over the state&#8217;s enrollment numbers are coming <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/11/27/after-some-adjustments-federal-government-takes-over-virginias-medicaid-work-requirement-application/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">work requirements</a>. The state submitted a waiver to the federal government, seeking permission to institute work requirements for its Medicaid members and expects <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/state-expects-medicaid-work-requirement-approval-no-later-than-the-summer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">approval by the end of the summer.</a></p>
<p>In his analysis, Mejia noted that many of those who have been enrolled in Medicaid so far are parents. When parents sign up for insurance, their children are more likely to be signed up, too. But he added that the opposite is also true: When parents lose coverage, their children often go uninsured as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;As Virginia awaits federal permission to impose work reporting requirements and additional costs on some parents who receive Medicaid, it is important to consider the ways that pushing adults off health insurance may also harm Virginia’s children,&#8221; Mejia wrote.</p>

<p>The case, filed by several abortion clinics against numerous state officials responsible for enforcing regulations around abortions, is due to go to trial on Monday. But Judge Henry E. Hudson of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia had already issued a <a href="https://www.reproductiverights.org/sites/crr.civicactions.net/files/documents/2019-05-06-412-VA-Memorandum-Opinion.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">judgment</a> last week in which he agreed with the plaintiffs that non-physician clinicians should be allowed to perform first-trimester abortions.</p>
<p>With his decision to <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.vaed.390528/gov.uscourts.vaed.390528.151.0.pdf" target="_blank">vacate that judgment</a>, though, the legitimacy of Virginia&#8217;s physician-only law will now be decided at trial, alongside other regulations like the state&#8217;s rules on abortion patients receiving ultrasounds and requiring second-trimester abortions to be performed in hospitals.</p>
<p>Plaintiffs argue that several Virginia regulations present an &#8220;undue burden&#8221; on women seeking abortion care, and should be overturned. Though at first agreeing with them when it comes to first-trimester abortions, Hudson wrote on Tuesday that whether or not the physician-only law truly &#8220;presents an undue burden to Virginia women who seek an abortion is a material fact that is genuinely in dispute.</p>
<p>&#8220;The court is of the opinion that summary judgment was improvidently awarded,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There is overwhelming evidence that medical professionals other than physicians can safely and effectively provide abortion care,&#8221; Jenny Ma, an attorney with the Center for Reproductive Rights, which is representing the defendants, said in an emailed statement. &#8220;We will be presenting this evidence at trial next week.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kevin Walsh, a University of Richmond School of Law professor, said it is unusual for a judge to vacate his decision &#8220;but I wouldn&#8217;t read too much into it.</p>
<p>&#8220;All he&#8217;s saying is: I want a fully developed factual record before I make a final determination,&#8221; Walsh said. &#8220;It&#8217;s notable in one sense that he granted summary judgment and then vacated it, but, in a case like this where you&#8217;re going to trial anyhow, it kind of makes sense that he wouldn&#8217;t want the facts as presented at trial to be limited.&#8221;</p>

<p>News of legislatures in <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/georgia-governor-signs-heartbeat-bill-giving-the-state-one-of-the-most-restrictive-abortion-laws-in-the-nation/2019/05/07/d53b2f8a-70cf-11e9-8be0-ca575670e91c_story.html?utm_term=.faf7ceed6791" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Georgia</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/10/us/abortion-laws-alabama-georgia.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alabama</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2019/05/10/sponsor-an-ohio-abortion-bill-thinks-you-can-reimplant-ectopic-pregnancies-you-cant/?utm_term=.7a0d92244545" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ohio</a> either considering or passing laws restricting access to abortions have dominated national headlines in recent weeks.</p>
<p>Yet in Virginia, a federal judge took a step in the opposite direction last week when he <a href="https://www.reproductiverights.org/sites/crr.civicactions.net/files/documents/2019-05-06-412-VA-Memorandum-Opinion.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ruled</a> that Virginia&#8217;s physician-only law puts an &#8220;undue burden&#8221; on patients, opening the door for clinicians like nurse practitioners and physician assistants to perform first-trimester abortions.</p>
<p>The decision was part of a far-reaching <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/abortion-amended-complaint.pdf" target="_blank">lawsuit</a> filed last year by several Virginia clinics that provide abortions against numerous state officials — from Health Commissioner Norman Oliver to a few commonwealth&#8217;s attorneys — who are responsible for enforcing the abortion regulations and licensing requirements that the suit is challenging.</p>
<p>The judge — Henry E. Hudson with the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, who was nominated to his position by George W. Bush — hasn&#8217;t yet issued a final decision on several other regulations that the advocates are challenging. Those, which include rules about patients receiving ultrasounds and second-trimester abortions being performed in hospitals, will be heard next week.</p>
<p>&#8220;The lawsuit really targets laws and regulations that are designed to make abortion different than other medical procedures and really don&#8217;t provide any medical benefit,&#8221; said Dr. Shanthi Ramesh, medical director with the Virginia League for Planned Parenthood, one of the plaintiffs in the case.</p>
<p>The case continues the momentum started by the <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2015/15-274" target="_blank">Whole Woman&#8217;s Health vs. Hellerstedt</a> Supreme Court decision, which concluded that some regulations pose an unnecessary burden on patients seeking abortion care.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s one of <a href="https://www.reproductiverights.org/press-room/oklahoma-court-strikes-down-restrictions-on-medication-abortion" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">several lawsuits</a> nationwide pushing for abortion accessibility, even as some states are simultaneously enacting anti-abortion policies that <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/05/09/which-states-are-blocking-abortion-and-which-are-enacting-protections/?utm_term=.023b0278ed1e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">try to force the issue in the other direction</a>, hoping a conservative-leaning U.S. Supreme Court will tighten restrictions on the medical procedure.</p>
<p>Some of the laws and regulations that the clinics are challenging have, in some cases, existed for over four decades — long before the pro-abortion attorney general charged with defending the state came into office.</p>
<p>While Attorney General Mark Herring&#8217;s office has played a role in the suit, including calling for its <a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/virginia/government-politics/virginia-ag-asks-court-to-throw-out-federal-lawsuit-challenging/article_8dda5b7c-7972-5abf-960a-ad3274556c65.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dismissal</a>, the state&#8217;s defense is being handled by lawyers from the law firm Hirschler Fleischer, who were brought in as outside counsel.</p>
<h2><strong>Whole Woman&#8217;s Health case</strong></h2>
<p>The Whole Woman&#8217;s Health Supreme Court case has already made an impact on Virginia. The state&#8217;s Board of Health preemptively <a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/virginia/government-politics/virginia-board-of-health-votes-to-remove-contested-regulations-on/article_c49cb635-65d6-5b25-b344-e00f48afe8cc.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">altered some of its regulations</a> to align with the decision in 2016, rolling back some rules that required facilities providing five or more abortions a month to meet hospital-like building standards.</p>
<p>Yet in the lawsuit, the plaintiffs argue that the Board of Health did not go far enough. While the board reversed &#8220;some of the most egregious parts of the regulations,&#8221; the complaint states, the underlying law mandating what the abortion clinics call the &#8220;licensing scheme&#8221; remains.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s still this underlying politically-motivated law that says the facilities providing five or more first-trimester abortions in a single month must be regulated as hospitals,&#8221; said Anna Scholl, executive director of Progress Virginia.</p>
<p>Such laws and regulations are common nationwide, said Lois Shepherd, a University of Virginia School of Law professor. They&#8217;ve been cropping up ever since the Roe vs. Wade decision in 1973.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are hundreds of these kinds of laws across the country of different kinds, and they make it harder for clinics to stay open,&#8221; Shepherd said. &#8220;It chips away at access, it causes delays, causes it to be more expensive, causes women to travel further. So Whole Woman&#8217;s Health was a hugely important case because it said: The courts are going to take that seriously.&#8221;</p>
<p>Many of the regulations that the Virginia clinics are challenging have been on the books for decades. The physician-only rule dates back to 1975, as does the rule that second-trimester abortions be performed in a hospital, which the plaintiffs are also challenging.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re also hoping Hudson knocks down requirements that patients must make two trips to an abortion facility: one to get an ultrasound and the second to receive the actual procedure. The lawsuit claims the two-trip law forces patients &#8220;to jump through needless hoops, without any corresponding benefit.&#8221;</p>
<h2><strong>The defense </strong></h2>
<p>Attorney General Mark Herring <a href="https://www.oag.state.va.us/media-center/news-releases/772-june-27-2016-on-supreme-court-ruling-in-whole-woman-s-health-v-hellerstedt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">argued</a> on the side of Whole Woman&#8217;s Health, joining an <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/State-of-New-York.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">amicus brief</a> that said the regulations pose an &#8220;undue burden&#8221; on women seeking abortion care.</p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p>And in his office&#8217;s <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/AG-support-of-dismissal.pdf" target="_blank">motion to dismiss</a> the Virginia lawsuit, Deputy Solicitor General Matthew McGuire acknowledged that the Supreme Court &#8220;has repeatedly recognized and reaffirmed a woman&#8217;s constitutional right to obtain an abortion,&#8221; and that the &#8220;plaintiffs make powerful arguments&#8221; about some of the regulations.</p>
<p>&#8220;But a federal courtroom,&#8221; the motion continues, &#8220;is not the proper venue for debating the wisdom of these policies.&#8221;</p>
<p>Herring&#8217;s office declined to comment for this story, and lawyers with Hirschler Fleischer, the law firm serving as outside counsel, did not return requests for comment.</p>
<p>There are moments in the case when even the defendants seem to help the plaintiffs&#8217; case. In his decision, Hudson references Virginia Health Commissioner Norman Oliver&#8217;s testimony.</p>
<p>Oliver, who was appointed to his role by Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam, said he thinks the minimum standards for medical facilities that the plaintiffs are challenging &#8220;restricts access to abortion care&#8230; I can&#8217;t tell you how detrimental it is, but I don&#8217;t feel that it&#8217;s in the interest of women.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Virginia Department of Health declined to comment.</p>
<p>Anti-abortion groups see a lackluster legal effort from Herring.</p>
<p>&#8220;When Virginia&#8217;s laws don&#8217;t have adequate defense because our Attorney General Mark Herring is an abortion enthusiast, long-standing, good public policy gets overturned,&#8221; said Victoria Cobb, president of The Family Foundation.</p>
<p>Tarina Keene, executive director of NARAL Pro-Choice Virginia, a policy and advocacy group, says Herring is &#8220;doing his job, and the advocates are doing ours.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scholl, executive director of Progress Virginia, stressed that the laws being challenged predate Virginia&#8217;s current administration, which &#8220;just happens to be who is in office when the suit was filed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The attorney general has always been a staunch advocate for reproductive rights and health access for people in Virginia,&#8221; Scholl said. &#8220;It is also his role in that office to defend the state in suits such as these.&#8221;</p>
<h2><strong>Non-physicians performing abortions</strong></h2>
<p>For most clinics that provide abortions, nurse practitioners are there every day as full-time staff. Generally, Keene explained, doctors come in a few times a week to perform abortions because of Virginia&#8217;s law.</p>
<p>According to the Guttmacher Institute, a research and policy organization aimed at advancing sexual and reproductive health and rights, <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/medication-abortion" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">34 states</a> require licensed physicians to provide nonsurgical, medication abortions.</p>
<p>Hudson&#8217;s decision, Keene said, &#8220;opens the door to increasing that access to a lot of women around the state because nurse practitioners and physician&#8217;s assistants will now be able to provide that care, and that will also increase access to abortion and it will lower costs to patients.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ramesh, the medical director of the Virginia League for Planned Parenthood, said the organization&#8217;s three clinics — one in Richmond and two in Hampton Roads — are usually staffed by nurse practitioners already.</p>
<p>&#8220;With this ruling, it means a patient could get an abortion when it&#8217;s most convenient for them,&#8221; Ramesh said.</p>

<p>Patients can download the app — which was developed by the national Planned Parenthood organization — and fill out a health questionnaire just as they would if they went into the doctor&#8217;s office, said Medical Director Shanthi Ramesh. Then a clinician reviews health information within one business day before sending a prescription either to the patient&#8217;s home or their designated pharmacy if they are eligible for medication.</p>
<p>&#8220;For us, the app was really a no-brainer in terms of reaching populations for whom it&#8217;s hard to get to the office,&#8221; Ramesh said. &#8220;We&#8217;re open in person seven days a week, but even still it can be hard to get the time off of work and school.&#8221;</p>
<p>Patients log into the app at all hours, she said, even in the middle of the night. And though the organization only has locations in Richmond and Hampton Roads, patients from all over the state have used it.</p>
<p>Right now Planned Parenthood offers virtual access for only birth control pills and urinary-tract infection medication, but eventually it will expand to additional forms of birth control, such as rings and patches, as well as emergency contraception.</p>
<p>So, too, does Planned Parenthood expect the use of the app to pick up. Ramesh said, based on the increased volume it&#8217;s seen so far, the organization anticipates that by 2020 about 1,500 patients will use it every month.</p>
<p>The app allows some back-and-forth communication between the clinician and the patient, and in-person visits are offered to those who need additional consultation.</p>

<p>So the patient is put in the back of a police vehicle, often handcuffed even though the vast majority have not committed a crime, to travel to a psychiatric hospital that can be all the way across the state.</p>
<p>Mental health advocates argue that the practice deepens the trauma of the experience. And the state is in the process of instituting a new alternative transportation model that will shift the responsibility away from law enforcement.</p>
<p>The Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services announced Tuesday that it awarded a $7 million, two-year contract to G4S, a security company that operates in 90 countries, to implement new transportation services for people under a TDO.</p>
<p>The company will use &#8220;unarmed, specially trained drivers in secure, unmarked vehicles,&#8221; to transport the individuals, a DBHDS press release states. The new alternative transportation program will start in the summer, and the state estimates that G4S will transport 50 percent of all TDOs in Virginia during its contract, which has an option for extension.</p>
<p>In the 2018 fiscal year, more than 25,000 TDOs were issued in Virginia, &#8220;and it is estimated that law enforcement transported 99 percent of these individuals,&#8221; the release states.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ideally we would like for as many people as possible to be transported in a way that supports their dignity and hopefully their engagement in treatment,&#8221; Daniel Herr, deputy commissioner for facility services with DBHDS, said in an interview last month. &#8220;We will just see, over time, how that works and whether we&#8217;re able to actually transport more folks than we originally estimated.&#8221;</p>
<p>Law enforcement officers will still need to transport individuals who do not meet criteria for alternative transportation, though, such as if there is a safety concern.</p>
<p>Officers will also continue to transport minors, Herr said, until the program has gotten off the ground and specialized processes for children are developed, like potentially allowing a parent or legal guardian to accompany them to the hospital.</p>
<p>&#8220;For me, that was a particular pressure point because I&#8217;m so cognizant to what it would mean to a child or adolescent to be transported the way they are now,&#8221; Herr said. &#8220;It just felt like we would be able to make the largest impact the most quickly by starting with adults.&#8221;</p>
<p>The program will roll out gradually across the state, Herr said, and though every community is different, the goal is for the same process to apply everywhere.</p>
<p>&#8220;The level of collaboration that’s required for this to be successful is hard to overstate,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You have the law enforcement, you have the community services board clinicians, you have the emergency department, you have the magistrate and then the hospital providing the care, so you have a minimum of five different agencies and players that must all interact in a coordinated way and understanding the process for it to work well.&#8221;</p>

<p>Virginia&#8217;s Commission on Youth held a foster care seminar for legislators on Monday, with presenters covering everything from how the <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/10/29/little-kingdoms-administration-of-social-services-in-virginia-rests-largely-in-the-hands-of-localities-what-happens-when-they-cant-fix-themselves/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">current system works</a> to what foster parents and youth aging out of the system go through.</p>
<p>The point of the seminar, explained Amy Atkinson, the commission&#8217;s executive director, is to get ready for the 2020 session and educate lawmakers on foster care, in particular to supplement the work of the newly-formed foster care caucus.</p>
<p>The reform effort launched, in part, to respond to a <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/12/11/its-very-unfortunate-for-these-children-state-report-highlights-health-and-safety-problems-in-virginias-foster-care-system/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">December report</a> by the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission, which highlighted a host of ills within foster care.</p>
<p>&#8220;Foster care is still a gray area for a lot of people,&#8221; said Del. Richard &#8220;Dickie&#8221; Bell, R-Staunton, the Commission&#8217;s chair, during the seminar. &#8220;We have taken some heat because of our system. We&#8217;re here today to start the fix on that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Both advocates and social services officials, while applauding the upgrades instituted last session, have long urged the legislature not to treat the reform as a one-time effort, claiming the problems will take years to fix.</p>
<p>While there are several areas in which Virginia performs well — like in speedily responding to reports of child abuse or neglect — there are other challenges within the <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/04/30/upcoming-review-expected-to-find-uncover-similar-problems-in-child-protective-services-as-foster-care/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">overarching child welfare system</a> that have persisted for decades and which lawmakers have yet to address. Many of those have to do with the <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/08/27/long-hours-low-pay-and-constant-turnover-social-services-agencies-in-virginia-struggle-to-keep-staff/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">workforce</a>: Social services agencies deal with high turnover, low salaries and an antiquated training system.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have turnover rates that are approaching 40 plus percent in many of our local departments,&#8221; Carl Ayers, director of the Division of Family Services with DSS, told the commission on Monday. &#8220;The reality is we cannot keep our family services specialists inside our local departments for, generally, two years. Our training program — to get them educated and ready for their actual work — is two years. So we aren&#8217;t even getting them through the training program to serve our children and families.&#8221;</p>
<p>The lawmakers also heard from current foster parents and the challenges they face, along with young adults who aged out of foster care without a permanent connection. Staff from the Bedford County Department of Social Services also presented on how difficult and traumatizing the job can be, while informing lawmakers that a new social worker makes as much as a new employee at Hobby Lobby.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s easy to dwell on the negative,&#8221; Bell said. &#8220;We live in that kind of world, that&#8217;s the culture we live in these days. But let&#8217;s not turn the challenges of foster care into some kind of &#8216;Eeyore&#8217; moment: &#8216;Woe is me, we can&#8217;t fix it.&#8217; Because we can fix it.&#8221;</p>

Ralph Northam on Thursday vetoed a bill that would have made it a <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/04/15/im-not-calling-911-should-drug-overdose-deaths-be-treated-as-felony-murder/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">felony homicide to sell, distribute, manufacture or gift drugs that cause a fatal overdose</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=191&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb2528" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">legislation</a> was condemned by some groups who argued it would penalize those struggling with addiction for giving or selling drugs to a fellow user and could cause more deaths by discouraging them from calling for help during overdoses.</p>
<p>But prosecutors argued they need the legislation to close a loophole in Virginia law that restricts their ability to go after drug dealers.</p>
<p>Northam had tried to amend the legislation so the felony act only applied to selling or manufacturing drugs, and added an affirmative defense if the seller helped the person overdosing. The General Assembly rejected his recommendation during their veto session.</p>
<p>&#8220;While I share the goal of addressing the opioid crisis and ensuring drug dealers are punished for supplying dangerous drugs, this bill goes beyond drug dealers and would punish individuals who are themselves struggling with addiction,&#8221; Northam said in his veto statement. &#8220;The way to help individuals struggling with addiction is to ensure they receive proper treatment.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a news release, Republican lawmakers pointed to the high number of drug fatalities surging through Virginia in light of the opioid epidemic. Though <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/were-cautiously-optimistic-drug-data-shows-a-dip-in-opioid-deaths-but-meth-fatalities-skyrocket/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">slightly fewer people died of a drug overdose last year</a>, fatal drug overdoses remain the leading cause of unnatural death in Virginia, according to the <a href="http://www.vdh.virginia.gov/content/uploads/sites/18/2019/04/Quarterly-Drug-Death-Report-FINAL-Q4-2018.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Office of the Chief Medical Examiner</a>.</p>
<p>Del. Tim Hugo, R-Fairfax, argued that a person who sells someone heroin laced with fentanyl, an incredibly dangerous and deadly opioid, &#8220;is no less a killer than if he had pointed a gun and pulled the trigger.</p>
<p>&#8220;Constituents are losing friends and family members. When we tried to take action, Gov. Northam stood in the way,&#8221; Hugo continued. &#8220;It’s appalling.&#8221;</p>
<p>Northam argued in his veto statement that the state should continue to focus on the &#8220;biological, psychological and social factors that foster addiction so that those factors can be addressed and mitigated in order to save Virginia’s families and communities from the destruction of drug addiction.&#8221;</p>

<p>But foster care was just the most recent area within social services that the watchdog agency scrutinized. In <a href="http://sfc.virginia.gov/pdf/Jt%20Sub%20HHR%20Oversight/2018/091918_No1_%20JLARC.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2020</a>, it is due to analyze child protective services, the program that includes receiving, responding to and investigating reports of child abuse or neglect.</p>
<p>Just as few involved in social services were surprised by the findings in JLARC&#8217;s foster care report, so too are they anticipating that the commission will find problems in CPS rooted in the same foundational shortcomings plaguing foster care: too few workers, high caseloads and a decades-old training system that hasn&#8217;t been updated to meet the needs of a modern workforce.</p>
<p>“It’s obvious that there are systems issues. It’s not one person or one locality,” said Lisa Specter-Dunaway, CEO of Families Forward, a child welfare advocacy organization. “If you look at the root cause, it’s all about personnel.”</p>
<p>As of March, nearly 20 percent of family services specialist positions, which provide child and adult protective services, were vacant, according to the state. The turnover rate in the 2018 calendar year ranged from 25 to 50 percent for some positions.</p>
<p>While the reform effort directed at foster care has attempted to alleviate some of the problems, it doesn&#8217;t affect the entire social services system, nor does it correct the systematic struggles related to recruiting and retaining social workers, <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/08/27/long-hours-low-pay-and-constant-turnover-social-services-agencies-in-virginia-struggle-to-keep-staff/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">which have persisted for years</a>.</p>
<p>The JLARC foster care report notes that, when a local CPS department &#8220;does not function as it should, local departments can miss or fail to respond appropriately to situations in which children are actively experiencing maltreatment — and may need to be removed from their homes for their safety.&#8221;</p>
<h2><strong>Putting out fires</strong></h2>
<p>Like almost <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/10/29/little-kingdoms-administration-of-social-services-in-virginia-rests-largely-in-the-hands-of-localities-what-happens-when-they-cant-fix-themselves/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">all things related to social services in Virginia</a>, the 120 local departments spread across the state are responsible for administering child protective services, including receiving, responding to and investigating reports of child abuse or neglect.</p>
<p>Local staff must determine and document if an allegation of child maltreatment is founded. The case might also require a family assessment, in which the local staff provides ongoing prevention and case management services to the family.</p>
<p>Salaries and staff sizes can vary between social services departments depending on how much funding they receive from their locality. Some simply have more resources than others.</p>
<p>“Not every agency in the system, but there are some agencies in the system that are really understaffed and don’t have enough people to, number one, make timely responses, and number two, be able to thoroughly provide ongoing services,” said Rick Verilla, assisted director of York-Poquoson Social Services.</p>
<p>Data on how often local departments are meeting requirements set for them by laws and regulations — like how quickly they must respond to certain allegations or how they need to document their work — paints a portrait of a system in which workers struggle to keep their heads above water, caught in a cycle of constantly putting out fires and responding to crises.</p>
<p>“My staff can’t finish a case because they can’t stop responding,” said Andy Crawford, director of the Bedford Department of Social Services and president of the League of Social Services Executives. “All they do is meet the immediate response.”</p>
<p>According to data from the Virginia Department of Social Services for the 2018 fiscal year, local departments generally do well in making that first response to a report of child abuse or neglect. They must do so within 24 or 48 hours, or five business days depending on the circumstances reported.</p>
<p>When it comes to actually making contact with a child victim, though, they’re not quite as successful. In 79.9 percent of cases, local departments are compliant with the requirement to make contact with the child within the allotted time frame. They’re not compliant in 9.6 percent of cases, and the compliancy is unknown for 10.6 percent — like when it’s not documented properly. The department notes, though, that many cases were likely documented correctly later.</p>
<p>“We certainly would like for that to be higher,” said Carl Ayers, the director of the Division of Family Services for DSS. “But we can’t find people sometimes.”</p>
<h2><strong>Documentation</strong></h2>
<p>The data on responses and making contact shows workers trying to deal with crises and reports of maltreatment as they arise. But the ball is inevitably dropped when it comes to documentation and completing investigations. Except in some circumstances when the worker can request extensions, a CPS report must be completed within 45 days of receipt, according to DSS.</p>
<p>But only 32 percent of cases were closed within 45 days in the 2017 fiscal year. Nearly as many took more than 90 days to close.</p>
<p>“We’re getting out to everybody as soon as we can get to them, so the thing that falls to the backburner is going back in and doing all your documentation, putting it in the system, getting it approved, having the supervisor approve it,” Ayers said. “The reality is you’re just having them go into longer time frames because we do not have the workforce to be able to get them through.”</p>
<p>To help local workers deal with the documentation that numerous laws and regulations require, Ayers asked the General Assembly to let him put some funding toward a new mobile app that is due to roll out in the late fall of this year.</p>
<p>“We’ve created this mass of requirements but we haven’t ever given them the tools to ease that mass of requirements,” Ayers said. “So that’s why the technology and mobile conversation is so important to ease some of those regulations so that workers can handle everything that’s required of them, and ensure that our kids are safe.”</p>
<h2><strong>Existing scrutiny</strong></h2>
<p>While JLARC is due to conduct a thorough assessment of child protective services in 2020, the agency has already looked into the program in both past reports and its most recent deep dive into foster care. Also, the state Department of Social Services and regional staff routinely review samples of child protective services cases from local departments.</p>
<p>In a <a href="http://jlarc.virginia.gov/pdfs/reports/Rpt317.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2005 review of the program</a>, JLARC identified some problems that still persist, noting that, “CPS staff in some localities indicated that inadequate funding and staffing limit them to providing only a minimum level of support to families who are not categorized as high risk.”</p>
<p>Largely, the deficiencies the state has outlined in local departments relate to timeliness and documentation, according to JLARC’s <a href="http://jlarc.virginia.gov/pdfs/reports/Rpt513-2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">December foster care report</a>.</p>
<p>But the report also states that, in 24 percent of 3,867 CPS cases that the state sampled, “key participants were not interviewed,” and that regional staff “have documented the same concerns across multiple annual reviews for some departments — indicating that problems with the administration of CPS in those departments are not being resolved after local departments have been made aware of them.”</p>
<p>Problems in CPS could also impact foster care because it “may contribute to an undercounting of the extent to which children in foster care actually experience maltreatment.”</p>
<p>“The obvious statement is: There needs to be more money put into the system,” said Specter-Dunaway, the CEO of Families Forward. “When you look at all the personnel-related issues, that’s what DSS is: It’s people. That’s what child welfare is. And so, until you address that, you know, we’re not going to see any big improvements.”</p>

<p>The report, compiled by Virginia&#8217;s Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, shows total drug deaths falling from 1,536 in 2017 to 1,484 last year.</p>
<p>There was a slight decrease in deaths from all opioids — including prescription painkillers as well as heroin and fentanyl. It dropped from 1,230 in 2017 to 1,213. (Previous data showed 1,229 deaths in 2017, but later reports confirmed an additional fatal opioid overdose.)</p>
<p>&#8220;I think probably the best phrase to say is: We&#8217;re cautiously optimistic,&#8221; said Rosie Hobron, statewide forensic epidemiologist with the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner.</p>
<p>The report notes that the 2018 data is not final, as 30 cases remain open, &#8220;awaiting additional reports to certify cause and manner of death.&#8221;</p>
<p>While the overall numbers are positive, the <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/despite-earlier-estimates-opioid-fatalities-in-2018-now-expected-to-match-2017-deaths/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">third quarter of last year</a> was the worst on record for fatal drug overdoses in Virginia, with 423 deaths, Hobron said.</p>
<p>There was also a substantial increase in the number of <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/08/09/as-opioid-epidemic-drags-on-meth-deaths-also-start-to-rise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">methamphetamine deaths</a>. They rose by 44.3 percent, and cocaine deaths increased by 11.5 percent.</p>
<p>The total number is still far lower than opioid deaths, but, according to the report, most of those fatal overdoses included a mixture of drugs — usually fentanyl, the incredibly dangerous and deadly synthetic opioid.</p>
<p>&#8220;People are using multiple drugs, unbeknownst to them,&#8221; Hobron said.</p>
<p>A whopping 65 percent of cocaine deaths and 46.5 percent of methamphetamine deaths were mixed with fentanyl.</p>
<p>In total, fentanyl or a fentanyl analog, which are slightly different in their chemical structure, caused or contributed to nearly 55 percent of the fatal overdoses in 2018.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve heard reports of users going out and saying &#8216;I&#8217;m looking for cocaine, I want to buy cocaine,&#8217; and they buy what they think is cocaine, and it&#8217;s laced with fentanyl,&#8221; Hobron said.</p>
<p>The next iteration of the Fatal Drug Overdose Quarterly Report is due to come out in July with data from the first quarter of 2019.</p>

<p>In its 20th annual State of the Air report, the association gave municipalities grades based on their ozone and short-term air pollution. Many cities and counties in Virginia were marked as DNC, or &#8220;Data Not Collected.&#8221; That mean the municipality <a href="https://www.lung.org/our-initiatives/healthy-air/sota/city-rankings/states/faq.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">doesn&#8217;t have a monitor</a>, which are located &#8220;in less than 1,000 of the 3,068 counties in the United States,&#8221; according to the association.</p>
<p>&#8220;More must be done to address climate change and to protect communities from the growing risks to public health,&#8221; the report states. &#8220;This year&#8217;s report covered the three warmest years in modern history and demonstrates the increased risk of harm from air pollution that comes despite other protective measures being in place.&#8221;</p>
<p>Six areas in <a href="https://www.lung.org/our-initiatives/healthy-air/sota/city-rankings/states/virginia/#hide-tabs-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Virginia</a> made it on the list of <a href="https://www.lung.org/our-initiatives/healthy-air/sota/city-rankings/cleanest-cities.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cleanest cities</a> for measures like particle and ozone pollution: Roanoke, Richmond, Lynchburg, Charlottesville, the Harrisonburg-Staunton area and the Virginia Beach-Norfolk area.</p>
<p>That doesn&#8217;t mean those cities are free from pollution, though. <a href="https://www.lung.org/our-initiatives/healthy-air/sota/city-rankings/msas/richmond-va.html#pm24" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Richmond</a> had zero days when fine particle pollution reached unhealthy ranges <a href="https://www.lung.org/local-content/_content-items/about-us/media/press-releases/for-twelfth-year-richmond.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">for the seventh year in a row</a>, but it experienced more unhealthy days of ozone smog than were recorded in the last report with 2.5 days a year, earning a D grade.</p>
<p>The northern part of the state did not fare well in the report. <a href="https://www.lung.org/local-content/_content-items/about-us/media/press-releases/air-quality-in.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Air quality</a> in the Washington-Baltimore-Arlington metro area &#8220;was the worst in four years for ozone smog,&#8221; the association found. <a href="https://www.lung.org/our-initiatives/healthy-air/sota/city-rankings/states/virginia/fairfax.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fairfax</a> and <a href="https://www.lung.org/our-initiatives/healthy-air/sota/city-rankings/states/virginia/arlington.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Arlington</a> received F ozone grades. The metro area ranked 16th on the list of the <a href="https://www.lung.org/our-initiatives/healthy-air/sota/city-rankings/most-polluted-cities.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">most polluted cities</a>.</p>
<p>“Ozone especially harms children, older adults and those with asthma and other lung diseases,” Kevin Stewart, the American Lung Association’s director of environmental health for advocacy and public policy, said in a news release. “When older adults or children with asthma breathe ozone-polluted air, too often they end up in the doctor’s office, the hospital or the emergency room. Ozone can even shorten life itself.”</p>
<p>The D.C. metro area did make some improvements to its year-round particle pollution, according to the association, but it &#8220;continued to rank among the 50 worst in the country for this pollutant.&#8221;</p>
<p>Particle pollution includes tiny particles from coal-fired power plants, diesel emissions, wood-burning devices and other sources, Stewart said in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;These particles are so small that they can lodge deep in the lungs and trigger asthma attacks, heart attacks and strokes, and can even be lethal,” Stewart said in the release. “Residents of Washington and the entire metro area should be aware that we’re breathing unhealthy air, driven by local emissions, upwind sources, and extreme heat as a result of climate change, placing our health and lives at risk.&#8221;</p>

</p><p>The hepatitis A outbreak that has spread across 18 states, infecting over 15,000 people, has crept into Virginia.</p>
<p>According to the state&#8217;s Department of Health, there have been <a href="http://www.vdh.virginia.gov/news/2019-news-releases/virginia-department-of-health-warns-residents-of-increase-in-hepatitis-a-cases/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">45 cases</a> reported in Virginia as of the beginning of this week, a 132 percent increase in cases compared to this time last year.</p>
<p>The nationwide outbreak has been going on since 2016. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/outbreaks/2017March-HepatitisA.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Of the 15,000 cases</a>, 57 percent required hospitalizations, and 140 deaths resulted from the virus, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
<p>Largely, those impacted have been high-risk populations like drug users, people experiencing homelessness, men who have sex with men and people who are or were recently incarcerated.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what makes this outbreak different from others the state has experienced in the past (like the one related to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/outbreaks/2016/hav-strawberries.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">frozen strawberries</a> in 2016), explained Marshall Vogt, epidemiologist with the Department of Health’s Division of Immunization: it&#8217;s spreading from person to person and isn&#8217;t tied to a food source.</p>
<p>Hepatitis A is primarily spread by the &#8220;fecal-oral route,&#8221; Vogt said — like when people use the bathroom and don&#8217;t thoroughly wash their hands. Then, the virus can spread through close interactions with others or through sexual contact. It can also be spread intravenously.</p>
<p>Hepatitis A is acute, meaning it doesn&#8217;t become chronic like hepatitis B or C. An inflammation of the liver, the virus typically lasts a few months before it runs its course. There is no treatment other than supportive care and monitoring for the disease, which often causes jaundice — the yellowing of the skin or eyes. Other symptoms include fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, joint pain, dark urine and clay-colored stools. Symptoms develop 15-50 days after exposure to the virus.</p>
<p>Southwest Virginia saw the increase in cases first, Vogt said, possibly due to the fact that West Virginia, Kentucky and Tennessee are also dealing with the outbreak. But now the Department of Health has seen cases statewide.</p>
<p>The best defense for the virus is vaccination, though good hand hygiene helps as well. According to the CDC, children are routinely vaccinated between their first and second birthdays, but the vaccine has only been available since <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/hav/havfaq.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1995</a>, so some adults may not have received it.</p>
<p>In Virginia, the vaccine is not required for school entry, so there is no statewide data on how well-immunized the population is. Vogt said that&#8217;s a frustrating limitation, but the outbreak related to frozen strawberries may have prompted many adults across the state to get their vaccination already, though there&#8217;s no way to know that for sure.</p>
<p>But, fortunately, the vaccination is very effective, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;One dose is 95 percent effective, and after two doses, protection reaches almost 100 percent, with minimal side effects,&#8221; Vogt said. &#8220;Vaccination is one of the most effective ways to protect from this, and that&#8217;s why we want to raise attention of the importance of people checking their vaccination status.&#8221;</p>
<p>The old adage often heard by mothers, he added, would also help: frequent and thorough hand washing.</p>
<p>Local health departments are conducting a<a href="http://www.vdh.virginia.gov/immunization/hepatitis-a-vaccination-resources/" target="_blank"> vaccination campaign</a> that began in January and is focused on high-risk groups.</p>

(Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images)</p><p>Between 2013 and 2017, the number of <a href="http://www.dss.virginia.gov/family/ons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">refugees</a> entering Virginia crept up until it topped 4,200, more than double the number who entered the state just four years earlier.</p>
<p>But in 2018, the number plummeted to its lowest in six years, leaving some resettlement agencies scrambling and causing at least one to close its doors.</p>
<p>In the 2018 fiscal year, only 1,749 refugees were settled in Virginia. The vast majority came from Afghanistan, while the second and third most-represented countries were the Democratic Republic of Congo and El Salvador.</p>
<p>While a large number of refugees entering the country and Virginia would pose its own obvious difficulties for resettlement agencies in terms of finding resources, too few presents its own challenges, said Seyoum Berhe, Virginia&#8217;s state refugee coordinator.</p>
<p>The reduction in Virginia follows a national trend. Even as <a href="https://www.unhcr.org/en-us/figures-at-a-glance.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the number of displaced people</a> worldwide has surged to 68.5 million, including 25.4 million refugees, the U.S. has been <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/number-of-refugees-down-sharply-again-under-restrictions-set-by-trump-administration/2019/04/02/94251ef4-54b7-11e9-814f-e2f46684196e_story.html?utm_term=.04e6baf32a20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">accepting a fraction</a> of the number of refugees it has in years past. In fiscal year 2018, President Donald Trump&#8217;s administration set the national cap on refugees entering the country to 45,000, then <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-slashes-the-number-of-refugees-it-will-allow-into-the-country/2018/09/17/a26f398a-bac1-11e8-bdc0-90f81cc58c5d_story.html?utm_term=.e785bdfd1d0e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">slashed it</a> again to 30,000 this fiscal year. There was a 110,000 refugee cap in place when Trump took office, The Washington Post reported.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s mostly, of course, concerning for the families who need to come, who had been cleared to come, some of whom would be reunited with family members and friends already here, many of whom have been waiting for many, many months, and sometimes many years, and sometimes a decade or two, and now will not be coming at least for the foreseeable future,&#8221; said John Baumann, Virginia director of Church World Services, one of the nine resettlement agencies nationwide.</p>
<p>For the agencies themselves, six of which operate in Virginia, the largest impact is on personnel. Once you let staff go or close an entire location, you lose people with valuable resettlement knowledge, Berhe said.</p>
<p>&#8220;People who are capable linguistically and culturally are now leaving to work with private agencies because there is no security,&#8221; he told the state Board of Social Services during a meeting at the beginning of the month. &#8220;That&#8217;s the biggest challenge.&#8221;</p>
<p>Most agencies, he said, have downsized. <a href="https://ideastations.org/radio/news/after-decades-resettling-refugees-church-world-service-richmond-office-closing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Church World Services</a> is in the process of <a href="https://cwsglobal.org/cws-richmond-office-to-close-in-september-2019/" target="_blank">closing its Richmond location</a> by the end of September, though it will continue its work in Harrisonburg.</p>
<p>&#8220;All nine resettlement agencies, including CWS, have had to shrink their networks through layoffs and office closings,&#8221; Baumann said in a <a href="https://cwsglobal.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Letter_RichmondClosing.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">letter</a> on the agency&#8217;s website. &#8220;And all are struggling to hold the line as we await a return to more historically normal, and more compassionate, policies and funding levels.&#8221;</p>
<p>Not every resettlement agency has instituted layoffs, but they have scaled back in other ways. The International Rescue Committee&#8217;s Charlottesville location has trimmed its staff through attrition, said Harriet Kuhr, executive director of the agency&#8217;s Richmond and Charlottesville locations.</p>
<p>Because they haven&#8217;t been resettling as many refugees, IRC has been focusing its efforts on improving and expanding the services it offers to those who are already here, Kuhr said.</p>
<p>That means helping individuals get back on track with their careers or starting up new youth and health programs. It&#8217;s a goal they&#8217;ve had for a long time, Kuhr said, but they&#8217;re now able to devote the time and energy that would otherwise go to helping new refugees.</p>
<p>Fluctuations in the number of refugees entering the U.S. and Virginia is not necessarily new for these agencies. Kuhr pointed out that often agencies have to deal with huge differences on a month-to-month basis, with 31 refugees arriving in one month and only a handful the next, for example.</p>
<p>But such a drastic reduction particularly fuels concerns over the loss of experienced staff, Baumann and Berhe said, especially if the country ultimately returns to the levels it has supported in the past.</p>
<p>Resettlement agencies are government-regulated operations. They can&#8217;t be opened overnight.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would say you&#8217;re talking many months and maybe even years,&#8221; Baumann said. &#8220;You&#8217;re not talking days and weeks.&#8221;</p>
<p>And the reductions are hard on those refugees who do make it to the U.S. Baumann said that families are sometimes split up into more than one case, and when that happens one case can be chosen for resettlement and then the remainder of the family usually expects to be approved, too. But that&#8217;s not always the case.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you can have folks who are separated from their family members for many years,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and some folks have a legitimate worry that they may not really have an opportunity to see them again for a very long time.&#8221;</p>

<p>The state expects the federal government will sign off on its work requirement program no later than the summer, said Karen Kimsey, chief deputy director of the Department of Medical Assistance Services, which manages Medicaid in Virginia.</p>
<p>The state submitted its work requirement application to the federal government in <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/11/27/after-some-adjustments-federal-government-takes-over-virginias-medicaid-work-requirement-application/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November</a> after receiving 1,800 public comments (the vast majority of which were against the program). Since then, the federal government held a public comment period of its own before certifying Virginia&#8217;s application and starting negotiations with DMAS.</p>
<p>The negotiations, Kimsey said, largely involve ironing out the details, like how many federal dollars the state can put toward which activities.</p>
<p>&#8220;Significant turnover&#8221; in terms of staffing at the federal level, she said, has slowed down the process a bit.</p>
<p>But looming over the negotiations are a federal judge&#8217;s ruling blocking work requirement programs in Kentucky and Arkansas — <a href="https://khn.org/news/federal-judge-again-blocks-medicaid-work-requirements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">for the second time</a>. The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/trump-administration-appeals-rulings-blocking-medicaid-work-requirements/2019/04/10/689024f6-5bb9-11e9-a00e-050dc7b82693_story.html?utm_term=.d6edf3cbd2fc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">appealed</a> the decision.</p>
<p>Kimsey said that, while Virginia is closely tracking court decisions and pending litigation, &#8220;At this time it does not have an impact on us in terms of moving forward.&#8221;</p>
<p>In Arkansas, more than 18,000 Medicaid enrollees have lost coverage, not because they&#8217;re not working, but because they simply did not know how, or could not, report their work to the state.</p>
<p>Kimsey noted that Virginia has the benefit of seeing the &#8220;lessons learned&#8221; from other states, particularly Arkansas, in determining how to implement its program.</p>
<p>Virginia&#8217;s Republican lawmakers have <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/09/20/senate-republicans-fume-over-medicaid-work-requirement-time-frame/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">expressed frustration </a>at the time frame attached to getting a work requirement program up and running in the state. DMAS Director Dr. Jennifer Lee told them last year it could take up to a year to receive federal approval and then potentially another year for implementation.</p>
<p>Virginia&#8217;s <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/09/20/senate-republicans-fume-over-medicaid-work-requirement-time-frame/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">proposed program</a>, which includes cost-sharing requirements for some populations, offer a slew of exemptions for those who cannot work, such as people with disabilities or full-time caregivers. It also has a <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/11/12/a-game-changer-proposed-medicaid-benefit-would-cover-housing-services-ed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">housing</a> component.</p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>The best way Jordan Siebert knows to describe it is simple: chaos.</p>
<p>The 39-year-old Richmond woman has battled drug use on-and-off since she was an adolescent and she’s seen overdoses. She’s seen strangers carry an unconscious woman from a room. She’s been the subject of those emergency calls for help.</p>
<p>“There’s such panic and chaos,” Siebert said. “You’re not actually thinking, other than this very — how do I explain this — it’s very instinctual. It’s ‘Oh my God, that could’ve been me. We’re shooting out of the same bag. Why did this person go out, and I didn’t go out?&#8217; It’s awful.”</p>
<p>Siebert’s drug of choice was heroin, one of several opioids that have caused the <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/despite-earlier-estimates-opioid-fatalities-in-2018-now-expected-to-match-2017-deaths/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fatal drug overdose rate to surge</a> in Virginia. And a potential new law that is sitting on Gov. Ralph Northam’s desk awaiting his signature, she said, will do nothing to help people in the throes of addiction — but she does think it will deter them from calling emergency services for help.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=191&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb2528" target="_blank">bill</a>, sponsored by Del. Tim Hugo, R-Fairfax, states that a person is guilty of felony homicide if they manufactured, sell, gift or distribute drugs that cause a fatal overdose.</p>
<p>On one side, law enforcement officials argue they need the legislation to go after dealers and suppliers who are putting dangerous drugs on the streets after a 2013 appeals court decision impeded their ability to do so.</p>
<p>But groups like the ACLU of Virginia and the Substance Abuse and Addiction Recovery Alliance, or SAARA, argue that the legislation continues to treat the disease of addiction as a crime, and would allow prosecutors to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/25/us/drug-overdose-prosecution-crime.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">press charges against friends and fellow users</a> rather than big-time dealers.</p>
<p>Several states have grappled with the question of whether fatal overdoses should be treated as homicide cases, particularly as <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/federal-state-authorities-step-up-fentanyl-prosecutions-as-drug-drives-spike-in-overdoses/2018/06/07/5631edd0-69c0-11e8-bf8c-f9ed2e672adf_story.html?utm_term=.8c86d8755148" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fentanyl</a> — an incredibly deadly synthetic opioid — has become more prevalent. According to the Drug Policy Alliance, which argues that drug-induced homicide laws are misguided, <a href="http://www.drugpolicy.org/resource/DIH" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">20 states</a> have such laws on the books.</p>
<h2><strong>The appeals court decision</strong></h2>
<p>A 2013 <a href="https://www.newsadvance.com/go_dan_river/news/danville/murder-conviction-overturned-for-danville-man/article_3c6cdb4c-9709-11e2-a6c0-001a4bcf6878.html" target="_blank">appeals court decision</a> in a case called Woodard vs. The Commonwealth of Virginia set a new standard for felony homicide, requiring not only a causal connection between the felony and the death, but that it also has to occur at the same time and place as the underlying felony.</p>
<p>Before that case, prosecutors would handle drug overdose deaths as felony murder because the distribution of drugs is a felony, explained Mike Doucette, executive director of the Virginia Association of Commonwealth’s Attorneys. But the Woodard case changed things.</p>
<p>“Contrary to what usually happens in a drug deal, you now have to show the transaction took place, that the user used the drugs basically in the same time and same place as the distribution and died on the spot,” Doucette said. “Well, that almost never happens.”</p>
<p>Most often, a dealer will sell drugs and the buyer will go around the corner, to their car or go home to use them, he explained.</p>
<p>The General Assembly has tried to pass legislation to address the Woodard decision over the past several years, to no avail until this year.</p>
<p>The legislation includes a clause dictating a less severe punishment when the substance was given “as an accommodation&#8221; to an individual without the intent to profit. In those cases, the crime is punishable by one to 10 years in prison, compared to the five to 40 years that a felony murder charge carries.</p>
<p>Northam took a stab at changing the bill that limited the felony act to sale or manufacturing of drugs, and added an affirmative defense if the seller helped the individual overdosing.</p>
<p>But the House rejected his recommendation on a 51-47 vote.</p>
<p>&#8220;I stood with the commonwealth&#8217;s attorneys and opposed the amendment because the time has come to say enough is enough,&#8221; Hugo said in an emailed statement. &#8220;This is about standing with opioid victims and their families and saying if you give somebody drugs and they die, you are going to be prosecuted for felony homicide.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a statement, a spokeswoman for Northam&#8217;s office, Alena Yarmosky, said “the bill would criminalize individuals who are struggling with addiction instead of providing them with the necessary treatment,” adding that the governor &#8220;was concerned that the overly-broad language of the legislation could discourage people from seeking medical help for a friend or family member in need.”</p>
<p>Now, the legislation sits in limbo on Northam’s desk. He has until midnight on May 3 to act. Yarmosky did not say if the governor intends to veto the bill.</p>
<h2><strong>Going after suppliers</strong></h2>
<p>As a former commonwealth&#8217;s attorney himself, Doucette said he&#8217;s seen the understanding of drug use and addiction change within law enforcement over the past 35 years.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I started, I thought, &#8216;these people should just quit,'&#8221; he said. &#8220;It took me a long time as a prosecutor to understand it&#8217;s not a moral failing on these peoples&#8217; parts.&#8221;</p>
<p>Prosecutors want to go after those putting the drugs on the streets, he said, but the Woodard decision has created problems for commonwealth&#8217;s attorneys all over the state.</p>
<p>“Every single drug overdose death is going to be a potential case,” he said, but right now, law enforcement officers are treating those cases as accidental death scenes. If Northam signs the legislation, they’ll have to change their mindset, he said, and treat them as crime scenes.</p>
<p>During a Senate Committee for Courts of Justice hearing in February, Matthew Lowry, assistant commonwealth’s attorney in Prince William County, said his office runs into problems prosecuting drug dealers all the time.</p>
<p>“There is a gap in the law where we cannot go after the superior drug dealers for the deaths they’re causing,” he told the committee. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a mystery to anybody on this committee that when we talk about drug dealers, we&#8217;re talking about people who peddle poison for profit.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was joined by the Chazen family, who spoke of the death of their daughter, <a href="https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/virginia-mom-hopes-new-bill-brings-justice-she-didnt-get-in-daughters-overdose-death/65-dbfd2cc4-5065-4518-b19f-e06fc19ab7fa" target="_blank">Amanda Chazen</a> of Manassas. She developed an addiction to opioids after she suffered an injury as an EMT and died of an overdose last year.</p>
<p>Chazen’s mother, Mary Ellen Chazen, told the committee that she knows her daughter wasn’t completely innocent, but that there should be a stiffer penalty when a death occurs.</p>
<p>That’s what Doucette said the Association of Commonwealth’s Attorneys is hoping for, too.</p>
<p>“In our opinion, there does need to be some accountability because someone has, in fact, died,” he said.</p>
<h2><strong>Punishing an illness </strong></h2>
<p>Groups against the legislation argue that it punishes people who have the disease of <a href="https://www.drugabuse.gov/related-topics/addiction-science" target="_blank">addiction</a>. Kathy Harkey, executive director of the Substance Abuse and Addiction Recovery Alliance, said the word “gift” used in the legislation can just mean “handing it to your buddy next to you.</p>
<p>“If a person is manufacturing drugs and they’re distributing them for money and they sell somebody a drug that kills, then in my opinion that is a true drug dealer: They should know what they’re putting out there on the street and if somebody dies as a result of their negligence then they certainly do need to go to jail,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>But it’s different in cases when someone is giving drugs to a friend or just passing them along. Charging people in those cases with felony homicide is punishing them for their sickness, she said, because they’re not intending to kill anyone.</p>
<p>The ACLU of Virginia is against the legislation in all forms, said spokesman Bill Farrar, who said it reverts back to tactics from the war on drugs, &#8220;that have been proven over and over to be wrong-headed and designed for failure.&#8221;</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://www.roanoke.com/opinion/commentary/gasta-aga-time-to-make-sense-not-war/article_4ce84384-5a4f-5188-9a00-e9c77b33a2de.html" target="_blank">op-ed</a> in the Roanoke Times, Claire Guthrie Gastañaga, executive director of the ACLU of Virginia, argued that the legislation will not solve the drug problem.</p>
<p>“Expanding the law to allow someone to be charged with murder for selling a drug to another adult who takes it voluntarily and dies or prosecuting as felons friends who gave a drug to a friend who takes it and dies will not end overdoses,” she wrote.</p>
<p>Siebert has been through addiction. She’s seen those she loves go through it, too. And the legislation, she said, would punish people with an illness.</p>
<p>“It would be really difficult for you to find any addict, especially a heroin addict, who has never given someone else drugs,” she said. “This affects someone who has an addiction.”</p>
<p>People with active addictions are always looking for a way to get an opiate in some form, she argued. That means relying on friends to buy or give them drugs — and at times it means selling and providing drugs to friends, too.</p>
<p>“And a lot of times, that means I’m going to be sharing what I have because I need more money to get some later, or vice versa,” she said.</p>
<p>Siebert has been in recovery for over three years now. As a peer counselor, she helps others who are transitioning into recovery. But she still remembers what it&#8217;s like to be in the grips of addiction, and worries about the impact the legislation will have if it becomes law.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think what you&#8217;re going to see because of this is going to be a higher rate of death because people are not going to call,&#8221; she said. &#8220;If I am in the midst of my addiction, you&#8217;re not thinking clearly and your entire existence hinges on getting your fix. I&#8217;m not going to be able to do that very well in jail — it&#8217;s difficult and more expensive. I&#8217;m not calling 911, and that person is absolutely going to die.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Working Families Tax Relief Act would expand both the Earned Income Tax Credit and the Child Tax Credit. Currently, more than 600,000 Virginia families receive the former, and more than 400,000 receive the latter, according to the left-leaning Richmond nonprofit. Both make a big difference to working families.</p>
<p>&#8220;Taken together, these two credits lifted over 200,000 people, including 100,000 children, out of poverty in Virginia each year from 2011 to 2013,&#8221; the institute states, adding that, nationally, the proposal would also lift 11 million children above or closer to the federal poverty level.</p>
<p>The act was submitted by a group of Senate Democrats, and has the support of Virginia&#8217;s senators, Mark Warner and Tim Kaine, both Democrats.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-budget/working-families-tax-relief-act-would-raise-incomes-of-46-million-households" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities</a>, the act would expand the Earned Income Tax by about 25 percent for families with children, and make the Child Tax Credit fully refundable &#8220;so children in lower-income households, including those with little or no income, could benefit fully from it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The changes would have a huge impact on children in &#8220;deep&#8221; poverty, according to the center, meaning they live below half of the poverty line — making less than $11,000 a year for a family of three. Under the proposal, 1.3 million children would be lifted out of deep poverty.</p>
<p>The tax credit would especially benefit people of color. The Commonwealth Institute says since 2001, median real wages in Virginia for black and Hispanic workers have grown more slowly than for white workers.</p>
<p>The institute estimates that a single mom with two children would receive a $3,700 boost if she has a $20,000 income, while a family of four who make $45,000 a year would get $3,500 more.</p>
<p>Other versions of the Act have been submitted before, <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-tax/2019/04/11/as-expected-423674" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Politico reports</a>, and six Democratic presidential hopefuls have signed on in support this year.</p>

<p>“We actually had to have Verizon come in and install two more lines,” says office manager Missy Miles. “Our system started dropping calls and wasn’t able to handle the volume.”</p>
<p>But while patient interest has been high, so far most doctors are steering clear of the program and major medical groups are treading with caution.</p>
<p>Some, like Bon Secours Medical Group, are flat out prohibiting their physicians from recommending or certifying patients for medical marijuana, a spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>Others are placing strict limits on when and how their staff can recommend marijuana as a treatment. Sentara Health System will only let neurologists sign up to treat patients with intractable seizures and the University of Virginia Health System only support its use in clinical trials.</p>
<p>And others, including Carilion Clinic, Riverside Health System and VCU Health, say they’re still trying to figure out what to do and are waiting for more guidance from the state Board of Pharmacy or through their own physician workgroups.</p>
<p>The medical groups cited two major concerns. First, the fact that marijuana remains illegal at the federal level, leaving them uncertain of what liability they might be exposed to by recommending it to patients.</p>
<p>Second, there has been relatively little <a href="https://www.richmond.com/opinion/their-opinion/guest-columnists/aron-lichtman-column-medical-marijuana-don-t-overlook-the-value/article_aa3d2ffe-543d-5918-bb5c-5c8d16481073.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">research</a> about the drug in the U.S., particularly by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which clinicians often rely on when they prescribe medication.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are drug interactions, there are some risks, so it&#8217;s not like you can say this is an innocuous drug we can add to your regimen,&#8221; said Cindy Williams, vice president and chief pharmacy officer for Riverside.</p>
<p>Sen. Siobhan Dunnavant, R-Henrico, a practicing OB/GYN, acknowledged that medical marijuana lacks some of the evidence that clinicians usually rely on, &#8220;but that&#8217;s not to say there&#8217;s not good literature,&#8221; through international <a href="https://norml.org/library/recent-research-on-medical-marijuana" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">studies</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;As those studies become more and more apparent, different specialties will embrace different aspects of recommending this, and it will follow the same kind of process that all best practices in medicine do,&#8221; said Dunnavant, who originally sponsored the legislation that created Virginia&#8217;s new program.</p>
<h2><strong>Few doctors registered</strong></h2>
<p>In total, only 251 of the 35,404 doctors licensed to practice in Virginia have registered with the state to write recommendations. The situation has left patients seeking medical marijuana unsure where to turn.</p>
<p>“I don’t think it’s necessarily going to impact the success of Virginia’s program, but it is going to pose a great barrier of access to Virginia patients,” says Jenn Michelle Pedini, executive director of Virginia NORML, the state chapter of the National Organization for the Reform Marijuana Laws.</p>
<p>She says the majority of the calls her office have fielded in recent weeks have come from patients trying to figure out how they can find a doctor participating in the program.</p>
<p>“A lot of the people I heard from are frustrated with how difficult the process is to navigate,” she said, noting that while the state has made it possible to search for physicians who are registered, the system is difficult. Calls to several of the registered doctors on the state’s list revealed many aren’t accepting patients.</p>
<p>Beyond difficulty finding participating doctors, there’s still significant confusion surrounding how Virginia’s medical marijuana program actually works and what products will be produced and dispensed.</p>
<p>Lawmakers significantly broadened the program last year to allow doctors to issue medical marijuana recommendations for any condition, ailment or illness. Legislation passed this year further <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/03/07/virginia-looks-more-and-more-like-it-has-a-full-blown-medical-marijuana-program/" target="_blank">relaxed regulations and clarified</a> that the program, which was initially viewed as focused on non-intoxicating CBD oil, also allows preparations that include THC at levels that would be considered intoxicating in a recreational setting and therapeutic in a medical context.</p>
<p>Five medical marijuana dispensaries, which will be operated as compounding pharmacies and are required to grow all the marijuana they process on site, are scheduled to open in December at the latest.</p>
<p>The industry group that represents them, the Virginia Medical Cannabis Coalition, says it’s actively working on reaching out to doctors and medical groups to make sure they understand the program and their roll in it.</p>
<p>“I think our interest is just to be sure that everyone has the resources and the knowledge they need,” said executive director Katie Hellebush.</p>
<h2><strong>Specialized clinics</strong></h2>
<p>Reticence among the medical community is not unique to Virginia’s program. News reports suggest a similar dynamic has played out in the dozens of other states that have already permitted medical marijuana.</p>
<p>To fill the vacuum, clinics focused on medical marijuana have popped up.</p>
<p>In Virginia, so far Ailment in Fredericksburg is the only to actively advertise itself as a participant in the program. The clinic specializes in anti-aging and weight loss treatments.</p>
<p>Miles says the clinic’s two doctors have issued about 200 medical marijuana certificates, which represents half of the 400 the Board of Pharmacy says it’s received and processed to date.</p>
<p>Ailment promotes its medical marijuana practice with low-budget <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4YNfyPrkCQ" target="_blank">YouTube ads</a> and yard signs in medians. Miles said most patients who have sought them out are suffering from chronic pain, PTSD, anxiety and depression. They charge a flat $250 fee for an appointment.</p>
<p>Like doctors around the state, Miles said patients are sometimes nervous when they approach the office about the program.</p>
<p>“They’re scared to give me their names, phone numbers, address,” she said. “They’re like, ‘Why do I need to give out this information.&#8217; I tell them, ‘This is a doctor&#8217;s office. I need to make you an appointment. That’s how it works.’”</p>
<p>Ailment’s approach has raised eyebrows in the General Assembly. Del. Robert Orrock, a Republican whose district is near the Fredericksburg clinic, told his colleagues he was disturbed by the yard signs he had seen advertising a “medical marijuana doctor,” which he does not believe is an appropriate description of the state’s program.</p>
<p>He filed legislation banning physicians from referencing marijuana in advertisements. The law, which still allows physicians to advertise that they are registered with the state to write certifications, goes into effect in July.</p>
<p>Regardless of how it&#8217;s advertised, advocates like Pedini at Virginia NORML say they expect more clinics and doctors to eventually get on board. Dunnavant agrees.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t really know how this is all going to play out, but I can say that none of it is out of the realm of other things in medicine that we have to adapt to,&#8221; Dunnavant said. &#8220;That&#8217;s one thing I&#8217;d say about medicine: The only given is change. It&#8217;s always going to be changing and we have to try to keep up.&#8221;</p>

<p>Because the U.S. eliminated measles in the 1990s, Vogt explained, any cases were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/03/health/measles-outbreaks-ukraine-israel.html" target="_blank">imported</a> in, leaving people who have not been vaccinated vulnerable.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unfortunately, we do have pockets across the country of people that are not adequately immunized, so when we see an imported case of measles and it hits one of those populations, we see transmission happening again across the United States,&#8221; Vogt said.</p>
<p>Most of the measles outbreaks are among those who have not been <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/02/28/698606894/states-move-to-restrict-parents-refusal-to-vaccinate-their-kids?utm_campaign=KHN%3A%20First%20Edition&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=70379732&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--jVTYTEQbjLtSjZS24-NBlqf1PZSO0EtnHOyEJ0p0PaprvWjCjhmGnbwDk2SxUkdYdeqjeQgosIxO8BZQpuCie1_SGl9Vcwuz7ob2U_UhOiSuwy9Y&amp;_hsmi=70379732" target="_blank">vaccinated</a>, even prompting a county in New York to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/26/nyregion/measles-outbreak-rockland-county.html?utm_campaign=KHN%3A%20First%20Edition&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=71173433&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-92exTH0FDhS5clRUH0OSp7AKfolbm0CsoNXzE4EJzq2gs1W3VBcq60-4A8Mpt8CszaLFou_YUIPoVoyF-rml9mzuwlirbBozRmkxrMi9LEGvIC5yY&amp;_hsmi=71173433" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bar unvaccinated children and teens</a> from public places. The outbreaks have caused <a href="https://khn.org/news/measles-outbreak-sends-vaccine-demand-soaring-even-among-the-hesitant/?utm_campaign=KHN%3A%20First%20Edition&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=69684739&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9frSx8dcjQJBDjAVWyFWBOZ6qq6jBtmDxhINK1Ajg4og9HlQKFSBo80l-Dph0oETxUa4SvcAKPGxJoYA01zRtuXy-JUte1jjA4kcNqxTLw4e4QluY&amp;_hsmi=69684739" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">demand</a> for the measles vaccine — the measles, mumps, and rubella, or MMR, vaccine — to rise.</p>
<p>Virginia typically maintains a strong vaccination rate, Vogt said. Between 2012 and 2017, vaccinations for kindergarten, daycare and head start programs <a href="http://www.vdh.virginia.gov/content/uploads/sites/11/2016/04/VAISCompliance.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">have hovered around 80 percent</a>, according to the Virginia Annual Immunization Survey.</p>
<p>Sixth grade vaccinations, though, declined in that time frame, falling by 10 percentage points. Vogt said the Department of Health is monitoring that trend, but the likely culprit in the most recent dip (a five percent drop between 2015 and 2017) was the addition of a two-dose <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/varicella/public/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">varicella</a>, also known as the chickenpox vaccine, requirement in 2016.</p>
<p>But according to national data from the CDC, Virginia typically performs well compared to other states. Its rate of children age 19 to 35 months who receive the MMR vaccine, for example, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/imz-managers/coverage/childvaxview/data-reports/mmr/reports/2017.html" target="_blank">is one of the highest in the country</a>. That could be due to a variety of reasons, from public health education campaigns to Virginia&#8217;s rules on how to exempt kids from the school vaccination requirements.</p>
<p><a href="https://khn.org/news/measles-outbreaks-easy-vaccine-exemptions-oregon/" target="_blank">Some states</a> have pretty loose rules around how vaccine exemptions can be obtained, requiring little more than parents printing a form and signing it.</p>
<p>But in Virginia, where philosophical exemptions aren&#8217;t allowed, a doctor must sign off on a medical exemption, and religious exemptions must be notarized.</p>
<p>&#8220;So if people want to use those exemptions in Virginia, they do have to expend a little bit of effort to use them,&#8221; Vogt said.</p>
<p>There are far more religious than there are medical exemptions in Virginia. And while <a href="http://www.vdh.virginia.gov/content/uploads/sites/11/2016/04/VAISExemptions.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the number</a> tends to fluctuate year over year, between 2006 and 2017 they rose from just 0.54 percent of kindergarten students to 1.23 percent.</p>
<p>Vogt said the Department of Health tries to provide resources to families who may be &#8220;vaccine hesitant:&#8221; They aren&#8217;t necessarily staunchly opposed to vaccines, but they may be confused about information they&#8217;re reading on social media, for example.</p>
<p>&#8220;These diseases and conditions — people don&#8217;t realize how serious they can be,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Because they are so rare these days and because people don&#8217;t suffer from them, we don&#8217;t see the consequences that we did 50 years ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the decade before 1963, when a vaccine became available, nearly all children got measles by the time they were 15 years of age, according to the CDC.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is estimated three to four million people in the United States were infected each year,&#8221; the agency says. &#8220;Also each year, among reported cases, an estimated 400 to 500 people died, 48,000 were hospitalized, and 1,000 suffered encephalitis (swelling of the brain) from measles.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ear infections happen in about one of 10 children with measles, which can result in permanent hearing loss.</p>
<p>Among other complications, per the CDC: as many as one out of every 20 children with measles gets pneumonia — the most common cause of death from measles in young children — and about one child out of every 1,000 who get measles will develop encephalitis that can lead to convulsions, deafness or intellectual disability.</p>
<p>&#8220;For every 1,000 children who get measles, one or two will die from it,&#8221; the CDC says.</p>

The Republican majority didn’t have the votes to overturn any of Northam’s vetoes, but they did consider a hefty package of legislative recommendations, delivering several significant policy breakthroughs that had Northam <a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/all-releases/2019/april/headline-839924-en.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">declaring it</a> a successful session by day&#8217;s end.</p>
<p><strong>Suspended drivers licenses</strong>: With bipartisan support in both chambers, lawmakers approved a budget amendment that will end the practice of suspending drivers licenses over unpaid court fines and fees.</p>
<p>More than 600,000 people will be eligible to get their driving privileges back at no cost when the provision goes into effect on July 1.</p>
<p>Opponents worried it would eliminate any incentive for people to pay court fines for traffic infractions and argued payment plans are already available. Supporters said it amounts to a modern-day debtors’ prison. “We should never be punishing people for being poor,” said Del. Alfonso Lopez, D-Arlington. (<em>See the <a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/virginia/government-politics/general-assembly/update-virginia-lawmakers-vote-to-scrap-license-suspensions-for-unpaid/article_896edd70-63bb-5e4d-892f-c1e2a9cec0f4.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Richmond Times-Dispatch</a> for a full story.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>I-81 funding</strong>: It’s an issue that’s vexed lawmakers for years. Northam abandoned a proposal he had backed at the beginning of the session to add tolls along the 325-mile stretch of road, instead striking a deal with the trucking industry to increase the gas tax in localities along the interstate. The plan will also hike tractor-trailer registration fees.</p>
<p>The new revenue will fund long-planned roadway and safety improvement. (<em>See <a href="https://www.roanoke.com/news/politics/general_assembly/general-assembly-approves-northam-s-funding-plan-for-i/article_2ddedfef-751f-5647-afd5-fc8b063c5f4a.html" target="_blank">The Roanoke Times</a> for a full story.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>Tax rebates for low-income earners: </strong>Northam’s proposal to extend tax rebates — $110 for individuals and $220 for families — to about 150,000 low-income residents passed in the House but failed on a party line vote in the Senate, with Republicans opposing.</p>
<p>There was debate over whether some people would end up getting more money back than they actually paid in taxes, though the administration insisted that was not the case.</p>
<p><strong>Hands-free driving:</strong> Northam tried to revive legislation that would ban driving while holding cell phones, but as promised, House leadership refused to consider the amendment.</p>
<p><strong>Census money</strong>: Northam had also proposed dedicating $1.5 million to fund outreach efforts to make sure as many people as possible are counted. Again, it passed the House but failed in the Senate.</p>
<p><strong>Police body cameras: </strong>Northam asked lawmakers to eliminate a ban on Virginia State Police using body cameras, which the agency already purchased as part of an equipment package. House Republicans refused, citing the cost associated with storing and reviewing the footage, which they said can be especially burdensome for prosecutors in small localities.</p>
<p>They promised to take the issue up again next year, framing the ban as a temporary moratorium.</p>
<p><strong>Minority contracts</strong>: Republican lawmakers also shot down Northam’s package of budget amendments aimed at making sure more state contracts go to minority- and women-owned businesses, who, at last report, won less than 3 percent of the state’s business.</p>
<p>They argued that the office established to help those businesses is set for a major audit this year and it didn’t make sense to boost their funding or implement new programs until that work is complete.</p>
<p><strong>Abortion</strong>: The House rejected Northam&#8217;s attempt to remove language in the budget that restricts state funding for abortion services unless required by federal law on a 45-50 vote.</p>
<p>Under the Hyde Amendment, federal funds can pay for an abortion in cases of rape, incest or when the mother&#8217;s life is in danger. But Virginia also <a href="http://www.vdh.virginia.gov/pregnancy/state-funding-of-certain-abortions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.vdh.virginia.gov/pregnancy/state-funding-of-certain-abortions/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1554460897457000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGUv4FKjM4YRehwFpqNZdsNOXVAaA">covers</a> the procedure for low-income women if a physician certifies that the fetus has an incapacitating physical deformity or mental deficiency.</p>

That is, if the time capsule was buried just a month ago and pretty much nothing had changed since then.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, after weeks of relative silence, the scandals that consumed the state’s executive branch roared back to life in a series of events that unfolded before the General Assembly had even convened for its noon session.</p>
<p>The House GOP did its best to lay the pressure back on Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam for his blackface <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/02/02/in-his-own-words-northam-describes-moonwalking-in-blackface-denies-appearing-in-kkk-photo/" target="_blank">admission</a>.</p>
<p>Members of the Legislative Black Caucus reiterated their push for equitable policies and defended their decision to begin working with Northam again despite calling for his resignation.</p>
<p>Democratic Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax offered what might have been his most forceful rebuttal yet of two sexual assault allegations.</p>
<p>And hundreds (if not thousands – no official crowd estimate yet) of anti-abortion activists rallied on the steps of the Capitol, still enlivened and enraged by <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/02/01/does-the-va-gop-really-believe-the-governor-supports-infanticide-you-saw-the-tape/" target="_blank">fumbling</a> remarks made by Northam in late January that were prompted by a <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/01/30/failed-legislation-loosening-restrictions-on-late-term-abortions-which-are-already-legal-in-some-cases-in-virginia-ignites-furor/" target="_blank">widely shared</a> video of Del. Kathy Tran, D-Fairfax, being questioned by about a bill loosening restrictions on late-term abortions that was defeated in committee.</p>
<figure id="attachment_7624" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="max-width:100%;width:1920px;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-7624" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/abortion-rally-1.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1280" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/abortion-rally-1.jpg 1920w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/abortion-rally-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/abortion-rally-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/abortion-rally-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/abortion-rally-1-696x464.jpg 696w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/abortion-rally-1-1068x712.jpg 1068w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/abortion-rally-1-630x420.jpg 630w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Thousands of abortion opponents rallied at the Capitol as the General Assembly reconvened for its annual veto session. (Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p>Republicans kicked things off, with House Majority Leader Todd Gilbert staging an early-morning press conference to remind people that Northam never really made good on his promise to investigate how an extremely racist picture <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/why-does-gov-northams-yearbook-page-include-blackface-and-kkk-robes/" target="_blank">appeared</a> on his yearbook page.</p>
<p>As for Fairfax, Gilbert reiterated the GOP’s dissatisfaction that Democrats have steadfastly refused to agree to hold legislative hearings. And he dismissed a lie detector <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/justin-fairfax-embattled-virginia-lt-governor-releases-polygraph-test-results-to-counter-two-sexual-assault-allegations" target="_blank">test</a> Fairfax has argued proves his innocence, dryly noting that “serial killers pass them.”</p>
<p>Next up was the black caucus, which highlighted its work on a range of policy issues important to them, including drivers license suspensions, tax refunds for the poor and police body cameras.</p>
<figure id="attachment_7625" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="max-width:100%;width:1920px;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-7625" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/gilbert-1.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1280" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/gilbert-1.jpg 1920w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/gilbert-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/gilbert-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/gilbert-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/gilbert-1-696x464.jpg 696w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/gilbert-1-1068x712.jpg 1068w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/gilbert-1-630x420.jpg 630w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Republican House Majority Leader Todd Gilbert told reporters Gov. Ralph Northam still hasn&#8217;t answered for how a racist photo appeared on his yearbook page. (Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p>The meeting ended with a response to Gilbert’s criticism of Democrats’ willingness to once again work with Northam.</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s important to understand there are issues, some of which we&#8217;ve discussed today, that the black caucus has been working on for decades,” said Sen. Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond.</p>

<p>Virginia&#8217;s Board of Psychology recently concluded a 30-day <a href="http://townhall.virginia.gov/L/comments.cfm?generalnoticeid=938" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">public comment</a> period that generated more than 500 comments on the proposed guidance. The majority were in favor of banning the practice on minors, while 120 were opposed.</p>
<p>Conversion therapy is intended to change a person&#8217;s sexual orientation. The board was the first to take a step toward banning it in January after a <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/10/08/the-general-assembly-has-consistently-stopped-efforts-to-outlaw-conversion-therapy-but-state-licensing-boards-might-be-able-to-do-it-themselves/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">work group</a> comprised of Virginia regulatory boards generally agreed to the idea last October.</p>
<p>Because the public comment period had closed, during a meeting Tuesday the board needed to vote to retain, revise or withdraw the guidance document. They voted unanimously to retain it, and the next step is to respond to the comments over the next 30 days.</p>
<p>The document will become effective May 1.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a clinical psychologist but on this board, I&#8217;m a representative of the citizens of Virginia,&#8221; said Board of Psychology Chairmain Herbert Stewart during Tuesday&#8217;s meeting, &#8220;and we have a mission to protect the public.&#8221;</p>
<p>The guidance essentially clearly states the board&#8217;s position that, in accordance with best practices established by professional organizations, practicing conversion therapy or sexual-orientation change efforts on minors &#8220;could result in a finding of misconduct and disciplinary action against&#8221; board licensees.</p>
<p>The document is a more immediate first step for the board. It is simultaneously working to update its regulations to match the guidance document, but that process can take as long as two years to complete.</p>
<p>In February, the <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/02/11/we-cant-change-what-we-never-chose-a-second-state-board-agrees-to-ban-conversion-therapy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Board of Counseling</a> voted to do the exact same thing, and public comments are currently <a href="http://townhall.virginia.gov/L/comments.cfm?generalnoticeid=956" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open</a> on its guidance document. The Board of Social Work agreed to do the same last month, though public comments won&#8217;t open until April 15.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/all-releases/2019/march/headline-839669-en.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">news release</a> that Gov. Ralph Northam issued in late March couldn&#8217;t have come as much of a surprise to anyone. It mirrored another from<a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/all-releases/2018/may/headline-825685-en.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> last year</a>, in which he explained why he vetoed a string of health care bills.</p>
<p>The arguments were the same: The bills &#8220;put Virginians at risk of being underinsured, result in rapidly increasing marketplace premiums and undermine key protections in the Affordable Care Act.&#8221;</p>
<p>During General Assembly committee hearings, Republican lawmakers&#8217; also repeated <a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/virginia/government-politics/general-assembly/assembly-passes-insurance-bills-meant-to-help-with-rising-costs/article_9302d704-219c-5a85-a03d-7415b0e755ab.html" target="_blank">prior year arguments:</a> Health care is too expensive, and while the federal government fumbles for a solution, Virginia needs to do something to ease the burden for its residents.</p>
<p>At issue are bills that would expand access to short-term and catastrophic health plans. To Republicans, they present a reprieve from the high costs that many who don&#8217;t qualify for subsidies are facing on the individual market. To Democrats, they risk uprooting the market and leaving people on the hook for huge deductibles.</p>
<p>The political lines aren&#8217;t exactly stark in Virginia. Two of the bills were unanimously supported in the Senate, though the House was generally divided along party lines. But the back-and-forth tracks with the debate at the federal level as Republicans have tried to either repeal or dismantle the Affordable Care Act and the passionate divisions between the two parties on health care have become increasingly fierce.</p>
<p>But what are short-term and catastrophic plans, and why does one side see them as common sense solutions and the other label them as amplifying, rather than fixing, problems in the American health care system?</p>
<h2><strong>Short-term plans</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/01/upshot/buying-short-term-health-insurance-what-to-know.html" target="_blank">Short-term plans</a> are traditionally considered coverage bridges for people switching between health insurers. They&#8217;re aimed at those who are between jobs, for example, or a college student who graduates in the spring but won&#8217;t start a new job until the fall.</p>
<p>But last year, the Trump administration issued a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/01/us/politics/trump-short-term-health-insurance.html?module=inline" target="_blank">new rule</a> that would allow states to expand short-term policies so people can remain on them up to a year, with renewals for up to 36 months.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re very cheap, but for a reason. They aren&#8217;t compliant with the Affordable Care Act, so they don&#8217;t have to cover pre-existing conditions, nor do they have to offer the ACA&#8217;s essential health benefits, such as maternity care, mental health care or prescription drug coverage.</p>
<p>Sen. Bryce Reeves, R-Spotsylvania, submitted bills for Virginia to expand access to short-term plans, <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=191&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=sb1240" target="_blank">one</a> expanding the amount of time the coverage can last and the <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=191&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=sb1674" target="_blank">other</a> that guarantees someone can purchase the plan again without re-underwriting. They were among those Northam vetoed.</p>
<p>During a House Commerce and Labor Committee meeting in February, Reeves told a story about a friend of his who doesn&#8217;t qualify for subsidies on the marketplace and he says pays more than $3,000 a month in premiums.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t have other options out there,&#8221; Reeves told the committee.</p>
<p>Both short-term and catastrophic plans bring with them fears of weakening the traditional, more comprehensive pools. In insurance, pooling is a way to ensure that the risks — like a major flood in the case of flood insurance, or massively expensive cancer treatment in health insurance — are spread across all the members of the pool.</p>
<p>&#8220;We know that if the problem is that insurance is too expensive, and you continue to drain healthy people out of the pool, then the only people left in the pool are going to be sick people, and the insurance premiums are going to go up even more, creating this <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/research/stopping-the-death-spiral" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">death spiral</a> in insurance lingo,&#8221; said Carolyn Engelhard, a health policy professor at the University of Virginia.</p>
<p>Some states, like California, Massachusetts and Oregon, among others, have prohibited the sale of short-term health insurance policies altogether if they don&#8217;t protect people with pre-existing conditions.</p>
<p>But consumers, some proponents of the plans argue, should know the risks. Short-term plans are required to have a prominent notice to consumers that reminds them to &#8220;check your policy carefully to make sure you are aware of any exclusions or limitations regarding coverage of preexisting conditions or health benefits,&#8221; according to the <a href="https://www.kff.org/health-reform/fact-sheet/aca-open-enrollment-for-consumers-considering-short-term-policies/" target="_blank">Kaiser Family Foundation</a>.</p>
<h2><strong>Catastrophic plans</strong></h2>
<p>Catastrophic plans are already offered in the ACA marketplace and are compliant with the health law&#8217;s requirements: They cover those with pre-existing conditions and must offer <a href="https://www.healthcare.gov/coverage/what-marketplace-plans-cover/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">essential health benefits</a>. In terms of the individual market&#8217;s <a href="https://www.healthcare.gov/choose-a-plan/plans-categories/#catastrophic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">metal tier</a> system (platinum, gold, silver and bronze), these plans will make up a copper tier, meaning they&#8217;re at the bottom.</p>
<p>But access to them is limited. Currently they&#8217;re only available to those who are 30 years or younger and to people who have experienced a financial or other hardship. <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=191&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=sb1027&amp;submit=GO" target="_blank">Legislation</a> submitted this year and last year would have required the state to request a waiver from the federal government so that anyone would be eligible for the plans.</p>
<p>Like short-term insurance, catastrophic plans have cheaper premiums but the trade-off is a much higher deductible. Patients have to pay more for their services before their plan will pick up the tab, other than the three primary care visits guaranteed under the ACA. For 2019, the deductible for these plans is $7,900, according to <a href="https://www.healthcare.gov/choose-a-plan/catastrophic-health-plans/" target="_blank">healthcare.gov</a>.</p>
<p>Freddy Mejia, a policy analyst with the Commonwealth Institute for Fiscal Analysis, <a href="http://thehalfsheet.org/post/182830915988/pump-the-brakes-on-green-lighting-high-deductible" target="_blank">pointed out</a> that, if eligibility is broadened and more older, high-risk people sign up for catastrophic plans, they may not remain cheap.</p>
<p>The position against catastrophic plans is similar to those against their short-term counterparts. In his veto statement, Northam argued those plans fragment the individual market, as they attract otherwise healthy people who can afford to put off preventative care into the catastrophic plans, destabilizing the remaining risk pools.</p>
<p>He added that the plans leave people under-insured in much the same way that short-term plans do. Because they&#8217;re on the hook for such huge deductibles, many people will likely put off care, increasing the likelihood that their medical conditions could worsen — and get more expensive — without preventative care.</p>
<p>But lawmakers like Sen. Glen Sturtevant, R-Richmond, who sponsored the legislation (along with Del. <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=191&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb2260" target="_blank">Roxann Robinson</a>, R-Chesterfield), adamantly disagree with that notion. He argues that more people are choosing to forego insurance altogether in light of how expensive it can be for those who don&#8217;t get subsidies. At least these health plans give them an option and ensure their pre-existing conditions are covered.</p>
<p>He also took issue with the suggestion that the plans would fragment the individual marketplace. Someone with catastrophic coverage would remain in the exchanges, he pointed out, rather than encouraging them to opt out of insurance altogether.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a way to help bring people back in to that health insurance risk pool, make sure that more people are covered, and at the same time give them an affordable option,&#8221; he said.</p>
<h2><strong>How to fix the marketplace</strong></h2>
<p>While big decisions about the individual market are largely made at the federal level, the states do have some options to address high premiums.</p>
<p>One is creating a <a href="https://georgetown.app.box.com/s/8gvwo4zjatasrz3ptkpwe2uqi0qnz04x" target="_blank">reinsurance</a> program, which some states are doing successfully. It essentially <a href="https://www.commonwealthfund.org/blog/2019/administration-tried-make-it-easier-states-waive-aca-rules-will-any-take-plunge" target="_blank">moderates premiums</a> by helping to pay the costs of people with high medical bills so that companies can, in turn, lower premiums.</p>
<p>The Virginia Market Stability Work Group, which Northam convened <a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/virginia/government-politics/general-assembly/state-begins-study-to-stabilize-insurance-markets-lower-premiums/article_d9637169-d46f-5f99-8c79-c2f855374b16.html" target="_blank">last year</a> to study ways the state can stabilize premiums on the individual market, published a <a href="https://rga.lis.virginia.gov/Published/2018/RD564/PDF" target="_blank">report</a> in December that identified reinsurance as one of the &#8220;most promising&#8221; options &#8220;to stabilize Virginia&#8217;s individual market.&#8221;</p>
<p>Like their Republican counterparts, Democrats have also pushed to address health care costs for patients. In addition to Northam&#8217;s work group, legislators this session proposed options like <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+sum+HB2427" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">increasing transparency</a> and strengthening the rules around <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+oth+HB2345F171+PDF" target="_blank">minimum loss ratio</a>, which requires insurers spend 80 percent on their premium revenues on health claims.</p>
<p>Sen. Barbara Favola, D-Arlington, proposed a <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+sum+SB1344" target="_blank">bill</a> that would have required several types of coverage, like short-term and catastrophic plans, as well as association health plans and others, to provide preventative care, but it was defeated early in session on a party-line vote.</p>
<p>Until the state can agree to take a more drastic move to stabilize the individual market, though, legislators like Sturtevant will still try to do what they can to address high health care costs, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a problem that still has not been solved,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Health care coverage has only gotten more expensive.&#8221;</p>

Ralph Northam shares the stage with Carlos Johnson, who aged out of the state's foster care system, during the Virginia Fosters event at U-Turn Sports Academy in Richmond on Wednesday. (Katie O'Connor/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>Carlos Johnson knows better than most how often the foster care system is overlooked in Virginia. But he makes an important distinction: those kids aren&#8217;t forgotten, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have to know about something before you forget about it,&#8221; said Johnson, who spent four years in the foster care system until he aged out when he turned 18. &#8220;Too often, we&#8217;re just invisible.&#8221;</p>
<p>During an event on Wednesday that was well attended by lawmakers and child welfare advocates alike, the <a href="https://www.virginiafosters.org/" target="_blank">Virginia Fosters</a> campaign launched. An effort to drastically increase the number of foster care families in Virginia, the campaign is aimed at coordinating grassroots organization across the state. <a href="https://www.vakidsbelong.org/" target="_blank">Virginia&#8217;s Kids Belong</a>, a nonprofit group with the same goal, describes itself as the &#8220;catalyst private partner.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got to be honest, this is bittersweet for me,&#8221; Johnson said. &#8220;If this event had been held 10 years ago, I have no doubt a lot of youth in foster care would be a lot better off — including me.&#8221;</p>
<p>At about <a href="https://vakids.org/our-news/blog/jlarc-report-on-foster-care-highlights-virginias-long-standing-failings-in-foster-care" target="_blank">500 youth</a> a year, Virginia has one of the worst rates in the country of children aging out of its foster care system without a permanent family.</p>
<p>Gov. Ralph Northam was in attendance, as were numerous state senators and delegates, and he <a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/all-releases/2019/march/headline-839719-en.html" target="_blank">signed several bills</a> aimed at reforming the foster care system. The bills will:</p>

<li><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/01/16/virginias-foster-care-system-has-needed-reform-for-decades-will-a-new-effort-last-long-enough-to-really-make-a-difference/" target="_blank">Institute numerous changes</a> to the foster care system, including adding new positions and limiting social workers&#8217; caseloads.</li>
<li>Align Virginia with the federal Family First Prevention and Services Act of 2018, which is meant to focus on prevention services to stop kids from winding up in foster care in the first place.</li>
<li>Require local departments to alert relatives of children who are entering foster care and explain their opportunities to become a kinship foster family.</li>
<li>Encourage post-adoption contact and communication with birth parents.</li>
<li>Establish a dispute resolution process so foster parents may contest an alleged violation of regulations.</li>
<li>Allow local departments to place a <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/there-are-5-year-olds-that-have-five-year-credit-histories-cracking-down-on-foster-care-identity-theft/" target="_blank">security freeze</a> on a foster child&#8217;s credit report to prevent identity theft.</li>
</ul>
<p>&#8220;While we&#8217;ve made tremendous strides during this session, we know the challenges we have did not come about overnight and cannot be solved in one General Assembly session,&#8221; Northam said. &#8220;My team and I are committed to developing a strategic plan for continued investment and reform over the next several years.&#8221;</p>
<p>During the event, Northam and legislators referenced the Joint Legislative and Audit Review Commission <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/12/11/its-very-unfortunate-for-these-children-state-report-highlights-health-and-safety-problems-in-virginias-foster-care-system/" target="_blank">report</a> released in December, which highlighted several deficiencies within the foster care system.</p>
<p>One of the problems <a href="http://jlarc.virginia.gov/pdfs/reports/Rpt513-2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JLARC referenced</a> was a lack of foster care families. Seventy-nine percent of local department staff who responded to the JLARC survey identified a shortage of foster families in their localities.</p>
<p>The Virginia Fosters campaign is pushing to change that, said Janet Kelly, president of Virginia&#8217;s Kids Belong. The group, which is an affiliate of the nationwide organization <a href="https://americaskidsbelong.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">America&#8217;s Kids Belong</a>, has run similar campaigns in two other states: Oklahoma and Tennessee. There, she said, they successfully increased the number of foster families by more than 40 percent.</p>
<p>The idea, Kelly explained, is to connect government, faith, business and nonprofit groups to help support &#8220;children, families and workers in Virginia&#8217;s child welfare system.&#8221; The hope is to accomplish that through both grassroots efforts like community organizing and a &#8220;grass-tops&#8221; push like a government-led awareness campaign and legislative changes.</p>
<p>Virginia&#8217;s Kids Belong has been operating in the state for about a year and has so far worked in about 25 localities, said Kelly, who also served as secretary of the commonwealth under former Gov. Bob McDonnell.</p>
<p>The nonprofit organization has raised almost $200,000 from private businesses like Bank of America and CGI.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s something about these kids that draws people to them and keeps them wanting to help,&#8221; Kelly said. &#8220;Once people find out there are children right here in their own backyard who need help, I know that they&#8217;ll step up.&#8221;</p>

<p>But health insurers have developed a tactic that essentially negates that benefit by refusing to count the value of the coupon or copay assistance toward the patient&#8217;s deductible.</p>
<p>Thanks to two bills that made their way successfully through the General Assembly and received the governor&#8217;s signature last week, though, health insurers will have to count any payments made on an enrollee&#8217;s behalf toward their deductible.</p>
<p>According to Fair Health Care VA, a patient advocacy group, Virginia is the first state to take action to address the issue.</p>
<p>&#8220;Patients should not be denied one of the key benefits of copay assistance programs, particularly since insurers are already getting the value of negotiated drug price discounts while withholding these benefits from patients,&#8221; <a href="https://www.dailyprogress.com/opinion/opinion-commentary-virginia-legislation-counters-pharmacy-surprises/article_cae9bfd2-4ce0-11e9-8ae4-17a24b00be3e.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr. Bruce Silverman</a>, a Richmond nephrologist and member of Fair Health Care VA, said in a statement.</p>
<p>Nearly one in five major employers do not count coupons and copay assistance programs toward a patient&#8217;s deductible, the group says.</p>
<p>Changes in insurance regulation at the state level, though, will not impact self-insured companies, who are subject to federal regulations instead. <a href="https://www.kff.org/report-section/ehbs-2016-section-ten-plan-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sixty-one percent</a> of people who get their insurance through their employers are covered by a self-insured plan, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.</p>
<p>Del. Timothy <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+cab+HC10205HB2515+RCHB3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hugo</a>, R-Fairfax, and Sen. Siobhan <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+sum+SB1596" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dunnavant</a>, R-Henrico, carried the legislation, which requires &#8220;any carrier issuing a health plan in the commonwealth to count any payments made by another person on the enrollee&#8217;s behalf, as well as payments made by the enrollee, when calculating the enrollee&#8217;s overall contribution to any out-of-pocket maximum or any cost-sharing requirement under the carrier&#8217;s health plan.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gov. Ralph Northam signed the bills last week, around the same time he also signed legislation that will require health insurers to create <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/10/15/some-state-employees-can-now-shop-for-cheaper-medical-procedures-will-the-rest-of-us-be-able-to-as-well/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shared savings programs</a>. The programs are designed to give patients incentives to choose lower-cost health options because they&#8217;ll share in some of the savings with their insurer. It also includes a transparency component so patients can log onto their insurer&#8217;s website and compare costs. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+sum+SB1611" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dunnavant</a> and Del. Kathy <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+sum+HB2639" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Byron</a>, R-Bedford, carried the bills.</p>
<p>But Northam also axed several other bills related to short-term and catastrophic health plans that Republicans see as a potential alternative to high costs. Opponents have argued that the plans&#8217; meager benefits put patients unnecessarily at risk, while proponents claim they&#8217;re an inexpensive alternative for healthy individuals.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/all-releases/2019/march/headline-839669-en.html" target="_blank">In a statement</a>, Northam said he vetoed the bills because they &#8220;put Virginians at risk of being underinsured, result in rapidly increasing marketplace premiums, and undermine key protections in the Affordable Care Act.&#8221;</p>

(Katie O'Connor/ Virginia Mercury)</p><p>Like each of Virginia&#8217;s psychiatric hospitals, Central State Hospital in Petersburg is almost always near capacity. But thanks to a broad effort to rightsize Virginia&#8217;s entire behavioral health system, Gov. Ralph Northam&#8217;s new plan to replace the outdated facility might actually cut the total number of beds.</p>
<p>Following a brief tour of one of the buildings on the 600-acre campus Monday, Northam announced plans to propose budget amendments that would use bonds to cover the cost of replacing the facility within five years, a $315 million endeavor.</p>
<p>His new proposal addresses two of legislators&#8217; concerns that prevented the funds from being included in the original budget: That it would take too long and <a href="https://www.richmond.com/no-money-in-budget-to-plan-replacement-for-central-state/article_28691575-2dd1-5dc8-acd7-cf616396c8c9.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cost too much</a>. The General Assembly will reconsider the new proposal when it reconvenes April 3.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think there is general consensus that we need to move forward, and we need to do it now,&#8221; Northam said.</p>
<p>Right now, Central State has 277 beds, but Northam&#8217;s plan would reduce the number to 252 beds initially, all in single rooms, while leaving some flexibility to add another 48 if necessary.</p>
<figure id="attachment_7365" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:1920px;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-7365 size-full" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/DSCF0530.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1280" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/DSCF0530.jpg 1920w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/DSCF0530-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/DSCF0530-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/DSCF0530-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/DSCF0530-696x464.jpg 696w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/DSCF0530-1068x712.jpg 1068w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/DSCF0530-630x420.jpg 630w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  A shared living space in the long-term intensive care building at Central State Hospital in Petersburg. (Katie O&#8217;Connor/ Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p>The goal, said Secretary of Health and Human Resources Daniel Carey, is to prevent people from winding up in the hospital in the first place by investing more in community-based services.</p>
<p>As the state bolsters its community services boards, which provide behavioral health care across the state, patients won&#8217;t need to be admitted to a psychiatric hospital, the thinking goes. <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/02/27/with-a-mental-health-system-in-crisis-virginia-lawmakers-inch-toward-stabilization/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The legislature has put additional funds</a>, both this year and last year, toward increasing community-based services, such as housing opportunities and ensuring consistent behavioral health services across the state.</p>
<p>Over the past few years, state mental hospitals have been dealing with dangerously high census numbers due largely to the sharp increase in <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/12/03/you-have-no-control-as-psychiatric-admissions-rise-virginia-grapples-with-a-hospital-crisis-that-threatens-care-and-safety/" target="_blank">temporary detention orders</a> statewide.</p>
<p>For Central State, the upgrade is desperately needed, as staff told Northam, along with Sen. Rosalyn Dance, D-Petersburg, and Del. Lashrecse Aird, D-Petersburg, during their tour. As buildings crumble on the massive campus, and some remain vacant, patients must share rooms and a sparse living area boasting glaringly white walls and an occasional poster of an animal.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s like they&#8217;re put in jail,&#8221; Dance observed as she looked around one of the rooms. &#8220;&#8216;You said you were going to help me, but you really put me in jail.&#8217; Because I don&#8217;t think any of us would like to live under these conditions.&#8221;</p>

<p>A new <a href="https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2019/mar/how-will-medicaid-work-requirements-affect-hospitals-finances" target="_blank">study from the Commonwealth Fund</a> found that Medicaid work requirements not only <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/more-than-4300-arkansas-lose-medicaid-under-work-requirements/2018/09/12/168bedce-b5f2-11e8-94eb-3bd52dfe917b_story.html?utm_term=.93e6166df3b8" target="_blank">will cause more people to lose insurance</a>, but could also increase uncompensated care and hurt hospitals&#8217; bottom line as well.</p>
<p>Under work requirements, Medicaid beneficiaries must document that they are working or that they qualify for an exemption in order to retain coverage.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth Fund concluded that, in the 15 states it studied, loss of Medicaid coverage due to implementing the work requirements will likely have a significant impact on revenue for hospitals due to an expected increase in uncompensated care. Hospital revenue could decline by as much as 22 percent in Kentucky, though <a href="https://www.modernhealthcare.com/medicaid/feds-approve-ohios-request-implement-work-requirements" target="_blank">Ohio hospitals</a> are expected to take a smaller hit of between 12 and 13 percent.</p>
<p>The analysis does not specifically include Virginia hospitals because the state has only recently expanded its Medicaid program. Like many other states, Virginia&#8217;s work requirement application is still pending approval by the <a href="https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/section-1115-demo/demonstration-and-waiver-list/?entry=29032" target="_blank">Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;This analysis demonstrates that imposing Medicaid work requirements could have a detrimental effect not only for people who could lose their health care coverage, but on hospital finances,&#8221; Dr. David Blumenthal, Commonwealth Fund president, said in a news release. &#8220;The way that states design these work requirements will play a big role in the severity of the loss.&#8221;</p>
<p>The report found that the severity of revenue loss will vary based on who the requirements apply to. States that apply them only to their expansion populations — such as Ohio — will see hospital revenues decline by smaller degrees versus others, like Kentucky, that apply the requirements to all their Medicaid beneficiaries, including those covered before the state expanded.</p>
<p>Virginia&#8217;s proposed program applies work requirements to its entire Medicaid population, though it has numerous exemptions. In its application, the state estimates that about 120,000 enrollees will be subject to work requirements.</p>
<p>In an emailed statement, Virginia Hospital &amp; Healthcare Association spokesman Julian Walker noted that it is still unclear how much work requirements could impact Virginia hospitals.</p>
<p>&#8220;Uncompensated care and the hundreds of millions in financial losses it represents to Virginia hospitals and health systems each year is a constant reality in our nation&#8217;s health care delivery system,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That was true prior to coverage expansion in Virginia and it remains true now that the Commonwealth has expanded Medicaid eligibility to thousands of previously uninsured Virginians.&#8221;</p>

<p>More than 20 percent of Virginia&#8217;s black, American Indian and Hispanic populations report poor or fair health, compared to 14 percent of the state&#8217;s white residents.</p>
<p>Annual data from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation&#8217;s County Health Rankings reveal <a href="https://www.chrrtoolkit.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/CHR2019_VA.pdf" target="_blank">wide discrepancies</a> in health outcomes among Virginia residents, based largely on geography, income and race.</p>
<p>The group develops its rankings through a broad variety of data sources, ranging from the National Center for Health Statistics to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
<p>Year over year, the rankings essentially tell the same story: Virginia&#8217;s healthy counties, many of which are nestled in the northern part of the state, remain healthy, while its unhealthy localities, clumped together in the south and southwest, continue to struggle with poor outcomes.</p>
<p>Loudoun, Arlington and Fairfax counties fill Virginia&#8217;s top three spots, respectively, in the <a href="http://www.countyhealthrankings.org/app/virginia/2019/rankings/outcomes/overall" target="_blank">newly-released 2019 rankings</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Petersburg, Covington and Galax cities rank in the bottom three localities — all three of which were similarly ranked in the bottom five last year, as well. Petersburg has come in either last or second-to-last in the state over the past four years.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are significant differences in health outcomes according to where we live, how much money we make, or how we are treated,&#8221; the report states.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are fewer opportunities and resources for better health among groups that have been historically marginalized, including people of color, people living in poverty, people with physical or mental disabilities, LGBTQ persons and women.&#8221;</p>
<p>The organization found that black Virginians have the highest rate of premature deaths, with 8,900 years lost per 100,000 population, compared to 6,300 years lost for whites and 2,600 for Asian residents.</p>
<p>White Virginians reported more poor mental health days: 3.8 on average in the past 30 days, compared to 3.5 among the state&#8217;s black residents and 2.7 among Hispanic.</p>
<p>Black infants had the highest rate of births with a low birthweight than any other race, with 13 percent compared to seven percent for white and Hispanic residents, and eight percent for American Indian and Asian residents. That trend matches national data on <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/03/05/birthing-while-black-african-american-women-face-disproportionate-risks-during-pregnancy/" target="_blank">disproportionate pregnancy risks for African-American women</a>.</p>
<p>This year, the rankings drew attention specifically to the <a href="https://www.chrrtoolkit.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/IMMEDIATE-Virginia_2019-State-Release.pdf" target="_blank">relationship between housing, poverty and health</a>. Twenty percent of households headed by black residents were burdened by severe housing costs, compared to 10 percent of households headed by white residents.</p>

(Photo courtesy the Franklin family)</p><p>More than four years later, Diane Franklin&#8217;s children still choke up when they describe what happened to their mother.</p>
<p>It was Dec. 13, 2015, and as she approached Franklin&#8217;s apartment in a Charlottesville independent living community, Jackie Carney could already smell urine.</p>
<p>Franklin had been trapped there for four days, her broken clavicle preventing her from reaching a phone and calling for help until her daughter finally found her, soaked in urine and laying in feces.</p>
<p>Their mother&#8217;s traumatic experience shook the whole family. It led to a lawsuit, <a href="https://www.commonwealthseniorcare.com/about" target="_blank">advocacy</a> for increased oversight of independent living communities, and a state report on the industry released earlier this year that outlines concerns about lax accountability.</p>
<p>The facility where Franklin lived at the time, Commonwealth Senior Living at Charlottesville, promised daily check-ins. That was appealing to her three children, because though their mother was capable of living on her own, they wanted the assurance that someone would check on her every day, just in case.</p>
<p>Over those four days, 74-year-old Franklin waited in vain for someone to find her, lying in bed, stranded because the broken clavicle worsened her already limited mobility as a result of multiple sclerosis. She managed to get her leg over the edge of the bed, hoping to crawl to the phone. But she had strength neither to get the rest of her body over nor to lift her leg back up.</p>
<p>Each day, the scheduled check-in time came and went, and nobody found her.</p>
<p>In a statement, a Commonwealth Senior Living spokesman said the company is &#8220;extremely sorry for what occurred,&#8221; and that it &#8220;took immediate action to resolve&#8221; the gaps in the resident check-in procedure after the incident.</p>
<p>Franklin&#8217;s experience led her children to champion an effort to bring awareness to the deficits they see with independent living communities: lack of accountability, protection and a unified voice to represent the residents&#8217; needs.</p>
<figure id="attachment_7150" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:175px;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-7150 size-medium" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/412-175x300.jpg" alt="" width="175" height="300" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/412-175x300.jpg 175w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/412-245x420.jpg 245w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/412.jpg 282w" sizes="(max-width: 175px) 100vw, 175px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Diane Franklin with her daughter, Jackie, as a child. (Photo courtesy of the Franklin family)</p></figure>
<p>They met with Franklin&#8217;s representatives, Del. Rob Bell, R-Albermarle, and Sen. Creigh Deeds, D-Bath, who proposed a resolution in 2018 that ordered the Department of Social Services to study independent living communities to better understand if the state should begin regulating them.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s staggering to think what our mother had to go through for four days simply because the organization failed to live up to its contractual responsibilities,&#8221; said Franklin&#8217;s son, Al Franklin.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://rga.lis.virginia.gov/Published/2019/HD6/PDF" target="_blank">report</a> describes an independent living industry steeped in confusion for consumers, in which even the definition of &#8220;independent living&#8221; is unclear.</p>
<p>DSS found that some residents remain in independent living even though they need more care than these communities can provide because a nursing home or assisted living facility is financially out of reach. Some communities have very sound procedures for protocols like daily check-ins or access to emergency services, while others are vague, with poor follow through. And there is no method for documenting complaints or problems with independent living.</p>
<p>Diane Franklin&#8217;s children agree that &#8220;fiercely independent&#8221; is the best term to describe their mother. But she was stripped of her independence in a community meant to uphold it.</p>
<p>Soon after the incident, she developed cancer. Her children believe what she endured over those four days robbed her of the strength to undergo treatment and she died the following year.</p>
<h2><strong>Lack of oversight</strong></h2>
<p>The Virginia Department of Social Services regulates assisted living. That means the facilities that come under that designation have a slew of policies they must adhere to and residents have a clear path they can follow to file a complaint, with an assurance that an investigator will look into it. They have all their meals taken care of and are assisted with activities of daily living, such as dressing, bathing or moving from a bed to a wheelchair.</p>
<p>But none of that applies to independent living communities. They lack any oversight from either the federal or state governments, and if Virginia does decide to implement direct oversight, it would be the first state to do so.</p>
<p>The communities themselves run the gamut in their size, style and rules. They generally offer a few services like meals, housekeeping or transportation to residents who are 55 and older, but not medical or nursing care. And many offer safety services, like daily check-ins or emergency call systems, but not all. Some can simply be apartments dedicated to a certain age group.</p>
<p>But all the variations aren&#8217;t always clear in marketing brochures, and consumers can become easily confused, DSS found.</p>
<p>Without state or federal oversight, there is no official data on how often complaints arise in independent living. Problems can easily getswept under the rug privately, said Doris Gelbman, an elder law attorney in Charlottesville, in part because the  contracts residents are required to sign almost always contain arbitration clauses.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever seen one that doesn&#8217;t have an arbitration clause,&#8221; Gelbman said. &#8220;When they arbitrate, the settlement agreement always has a gag order in it, so when something goes wrong and some kind of settlement is finally reached, no one can talk about it. So it happens over and over and over again because it doesn&#8217;t come up in the press.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the end of the arbitration process between Franklin&#8217;s family and Commonwealth Senior Living, Franklin was awarded $900,000. The family refused settlement agreements that included confidentiality requirements, because they promised their mother they wouldn&#8217;t be quiet about what happened, Carney said.</p>
<p>Franklin&#8217;s children acknowledged that many may not have the ability to speak out as they have. Some residents might not have children able or willing to do so in the first place.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have the financial means and wherewithal, as well as the time, to be able to move this cause forward,&#8221; Al Franklin said. &#8220;Most people in our positions do not have the financial independence that we do, and most people would have been backed into a corner — a corner created by legal fees, by time, by the desire to just put it behind them and be done with it.&#8221;</p>
<h2><strong>In need of more care</strong></h2>
<p>Despite what the term &#8220;independent living&#8221; suggests, residents do not have to be physically independent to reside in those communities. Rather, they must be able to manage their care on their own without relying on community staff.</p>
<p>According to the report, DSS staff &#8220;found an overwhelming number of frail, neglected seniors who remain in independent living apartments because they cannot afford the higher price tag of assisted living.&#8221;</p>
<p>The average cost of independent living is $2,155 a month in Virginia, according to DSS. The average assisted living rate is more than twice that at $4,508 a month.</p>
<p>That problem points to a deeper issue within Virginia&#8217;s long-term care landscape: Assisted living is prohibitively expensive for many people. But the one safety net that the state has, the auxiliary grant program, offers a pittance of a reimbursement, deterring most operators from accepting it.</p>
<p>If it were increased, said Judy Hackler, executive director of the Virginia Assisted Living Association, many more facilities would participate.</p>
<p>&#8220;But at the current rate, they would be constantly in a negative balance for those residents,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The auxiliary grant program only pays $1,271 per month, though that is increased by about $200 for Northern Virginia. That amount is less than a third of the average cost of staying in an assisted living home in Virginia, according to <a href="https://www.genworth.com/aging-and-you/finances/cost-of-care.html" target="_blank">Genworth&#8217;s cost of care calculator</a>.</p>
<div class="subscriber-only">
<p>The report does point out that, if Virginia were to increase the rate, &#8220;this change would enable more seniors to attain the level of care and supervision they need.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jennifer Inker, a professor with the Virginia Commonwealth University Department of Gerontology who has managed both independent and assisted living facilities, described the regulations and oversight surrounding assisted living as almost comforting for an administrator.</p>
<p>It was structured and provided protection, because she knew what residents she could care for, and she had documentation of their level of need to ensure they moved on to an even higher level of care, a nursing home, if they needed to.</p>
<p>&#8220;Independent living had none of that,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We need to be asking ourselves: Could any of these decisions about who can live here and what kind of support they need to live here, could they have life or death consequences? If they could, then I think we need to really be clear with ourselves that, therefore, we need to have a way to protect consumers and operators.&#8221;</p>
</div>
<h2><strong>Residents are voiceless</strong></h2>
<p>Diane Franklin&#8217;s children couldn&#8217;t turn to the Department of Social Services after their mother&#8217;s experience. Though Commonwealth Senior Living had an assisted living facility on the same campus, her apartment was on the independent living community side, and DSS had no jurisdiction, they were told.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a big reason they want more oversight. Families should have someone to turn to, and the businesses should be held accountable when a service they promise their residents, such as the daily check-ins, fail.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s something my mom felt, and some of the other residents felt: That they were afraid to speak up for fear that if they went to somebody at the facility, they&#8217;d be treated differently for having a voice and being willing to speak up,&#8221; Carney, Diane Franklin&#8217;s daughter, said.</p>
<p>The state has a long-term care ombudsman program, operated by the Department for Aging and Rehabilitative Services, that supports residents in assisted living or nursing homes, helping them resolve conflicts and problems.</p>
<p>And, though the program accepts calls from residents in independent living, those facilities are not required to make residents aware of the program, explained Joani Latimer, the state&#8217;s long-term care ombudsman.</p>
<p>The program has only about 30 statewide staff members, and just half of those work full time. They&#8217;re stretched thin, Latimer said. If Virginia wanted to expand the program to explicitly include independent living, it would need to provide more funding and resources.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a consumer-driven industry, and that&#8217;s perfectly fine, but the consumer still needs to have some measure of protection, or some place to turn to if things don&#8217;t go as expected,&#8221; Inker said.</p>
<h2><strong>Is it time to regulate?</strong></h2>
<p>Hackler, with the Virginia Assisted Living Association, said she thinks the DSS report is a good first step, but she hopes the state continues to research the industry before it leaps into regulations.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think there still needs to be some more fine-tuning of the definitions,&#8221; said Hackler, whose organization also works with businesses that offer both assisted and independent living. &#8220;You also don&#8217;t want to create regulations based on one negative occurrence, either. Sometimes you want to look at the whole broad spectrum.&#8221;</p>
<figure id="attachment_7149" class="wp-caption alignright" style="max-width:100%;width:222px;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-7149 size-medium" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/DSC_0828-222x300.jpg" alt="" width="222" height="300" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/DSC_0828-222x300.jpg 222w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/DSC_0828-310x420.jpg 310w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/DSC_0828.jpg 665w" sizes="(max-width: 222px) 100vw, 222px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Diane Franklin (Photo courtesy the Franklin family)</p></figure>
<p>She added that, if regulations were to be implemented, she&#8217;d hope they would be paced to ensure that residents retain their independence. Not all residents would want a daily check-in procedure, for example.</p>
<p>Inker said she thinks a lighter regulatory touch could be more effective, such as requiring the communities to have written procedures and maintain daily logs if they have a check-in system, or providing a disclosure statement with information about accommodations and services.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the huge benefits of independent living is its flexibility,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I can move into independent living, and I can bring in the care that I need, and I just hopefully stay there until the end of my life, and that&#8217;s a really worthy goal for both the resident and the provider — but that&#8217;s only going to work if there&#8217;s clarity.&#8221;</p>
<h2><strong>&#8220;She didn&#8217;t want to be alone&#8221;</strong></h2>
<p>The fiercely independent mother that Diane Franklin&#8217;s children grew up with couldn&#8217;t be left alone after her experience in an independent living community.</p>
<p>When he lived near his mother in Charlottesville before moving to Milwaukee, Chris Franklin said he would visit her when she had a list of things for him to do, like change light bulbs.</p>
<p>&#8220;She was always smiling, always happy,&#8221; he recalled. &#8220;She always had a glint in her eye.</p>
<p>&#8220;But after this, when mom was out of the hospital and moved into a skilled nursing facility, where she lived for the rest of her days, we made sure she was never alone. She didn&#8217;t want to be alone,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;For the first time in my life, I had seen my mom just be afraid. And she had lived alone for a number of years.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Insisted upon it,&#8221; Carney added.</p>
<p>Yet when Chris Franklin went to visit his mother after her experience at the independent living community, there wasn&#8217;t a lot of talking.</p>
<p>&#8220;She had a well-lived life, and to see that just pissed away because of someone&#8217;s negligence &#8230;&#8221; he trailed off. &#8220;They basically robbed us of those last few months with our mom. And that makes me angry. It really does.&#8221;</p>

<p>The change in policy applies to Suboxone films, a form of <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/medication-assisted-treatment/treatment/buprenorphine" target="_blank">buprenorphine</a> and naloxone that is applied to the tongue. The medication is used to help people reduce or quit their use of opioids — including prescription painkillers ss well as illicit drugs like heroin.</p>
<p>Virginia continues to see <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/despite-earlier-estimates-opioid-fatalities-in-2018-now-expected-to-match-2017-deaths/" target="_blank">staggering numbers of people die due to opioid addiction</a>.</p>
<p>In the past, providers have needed prior authorization from the Department of Medical Assistance Services, which manages Virginia&#8217;s Medicaid program, or one of its contracted health plans before they could prescribe Suboxone. The change will help increase access and reduce delays in treatment.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We have a responsibility to understand and to meet the needs of our members and the providers who treat them,&#8221; Dr. Chethan Bachireddy, acting chief medical officer for DMAS, said in a news release. &#8220;We are achieving that goal with effective, proactive strategies that are putting Virginia at the forefront in the fight against the opioid crisis.&#8221;</p>
<p>The removal of the prior authorization requirement only applies to the Suboxone films and not other forms of buprenorphine that are not on the Medicaid preferred drugs list.</p>
<p>According to the release, a study published last year &#8220;found a 40 percent lower death rate after one year among individuals who were being treated with Suboxone after surviving a previous overdose compared to individuals with a history of overdose,&#8221; who were not treated with <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/medication-assisted-treatment" target="_blank">medication assisted treatment</a>, which uses medications to treat addiction.</p>
<p>According to Virginia Commonwealth University researchers, an estimated 60,000 uninsured adults in Virginia with substance use disorder will gain access to treatment under Medicaid expansion, including 18,000 people with opioid use disorder, according to the release.</p>

<p>Past efforts to reform step therapy in Virginia <a href="https://www.richmond.com/life/health/state-commission-hears-controversy-over-step-therapy/article_22afaed0-b84e-54ab-af7f-0b34b3f51142.html" target="_blank">have been met with resistance from health insurance companies</a>. But this year&#8217;s bipartisan push to reform the practice — which can force patients to take medicines their doctors don&#8217;t think will be effective before they get clearance from insurers for pricier drugs — was unanimously approved by both chambers in the General Assembly.</p>
<p>Gov. Ralph Northam signed the new <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=191&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb2126&amp;submit=GO" target="_blank">legislation</a> Tuesday.</p>
<p>Step therapy, also known as <a href="https://failfirsthurts.org/" target="_blank">&#8220;fail first&#8221;</a> protocols, require patients to try and fail some medications before an insurance company will cover the drug originally prescribed by their doctor. Insurers say it helps rein in costs.</p>
<p>The legislation, sponsored by Del. Glenn Davis, R-Virginia Beach, creates several reforms to step therapy practice in Virginia, like requiring the protocols be developed and endorsed by a a multidisciplinary panel of experts and continually updated to reflect new evidence and research. It also requires the insurer to provide a &#8220;clear, readily accessible and convenient process to request a step-therapy exception&#8221; when a patient has been prescribed a drug subject to step therapy.</p>
<p>The new legislation makes Virginia the 20th state to reform step therapy, according to a news release from Fair Health Care VA, a chronic health advocacy group.</p>
<p>“This legislation will help patients receive appropriate therapies when their unique circumstances need personalized treatment and ensure that the patient-physician relationship remains at the center of care decisions,&#8221; Dr. Harry Gewanter, a pediatric rheumatologist in Richmond and advocacy chair of the Arthritis Foundation’s Virginia chapter, said in a statement.</p>
<p>Williamsburg resident <a href="https://www.wric.com/news/politics/capitol-connection/bill-proposes-more-transparency-when-insurance-companies-override-your-doctor/1710333147" target="_blank">Tom Ema</a> testified before the General Assembly in favor of the legislation, explaining that he was required to fail the same chemotherapy drug several times for his stage four lymphoma before he could get the medication he needed, which ultimately cured him.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a patient who has experienced step therapy, I know how important it is for patients to have access to the high-quality care they need, not just the treatment that happens to be cheapest,&#8221; he said in the release.</p>

<p>Those services ranged from ordering tests and images before low-risk surgeries to unnecessarily screening for vitamin D deficiencies.</p>
<p>&#8220;It delays care, because people have to have those procedures and wait for the results,&#8221; said Beth Bortz, president and CEO of the Virginia Center for Health Innovation, or VCHI. &#8220;Some of those services can be potentially harmful, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>The tests can take an unnecessary toll on the patients, who may anxiously wait for the results or even receive a false positive.</p>
<p>VCHI this month received a $2.2 million grant to tackle unnecessary medical spending in Virginia from Arnold Ventures, a private foundation that states it is &#8220;dedicated to improving lives through evidence-based solutions.&#8221;</p>
<p>The three-year grant will fund VCHI&#8217;s work with six participating health systems: Ballad Health, Carilion Clinic, HCA Virginia, Inova Health System, Sentara Healthcare and VCU Health System.</p>
<p>By using data from Virginia Health Information, which runs the state&#8217;s <a href="http://www.vhi.org/APCD/default.asp" target="_blank">All Payer Claims Database</a>, VCHI will look at the numbers for those six systems by clinician, run reports using a tool that calculates wasteful spending and send those reports to each of the systems so they can evaluate and address the problems.</p>
<p>&#8220;Part of what we&#8217;re hoping to learn is how they do it,&#8221; Bortz said. &#8220;Maybe VCU will do this differently than Sentara.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re the first to try to take data and do something meaningful with it,&#8221; she added. &#8220;We will be the ones, good or bad, learning the lessons about how hard this is.&#8221;</p>
<p>There are a variety of reasons why clinicians continue to order tests that are proven to be unnecessary — including misinformation and pure habit.</p>
<p>Take pap smears, for example. Ten years ago, Bortz said, the best practice was for a woman to receive a pap smear every year. Now, evidence shows they&#8217;re really only necessary once every three years for a healthy woman who has no risk factors.</p>
<p>&#8220;But you still have consumers coming in and asking for their annual pap, and you still have some providers who will just order an annual pap,&#8221; Bortz said.</p>
<p>The grant work will focus on seven measures that VCHI chose because they&#8217;re largely driven by providers — rather than a wasteful test that a patient might request.</p>
<p>The biggest thing they&#8217;ll be looking for, Bortz said, are unnecessary imaging tests, like if a doctor orders an electrocardiogram test before performing cataract surgery, even though the patient has no history of heart problems.</p>
<p>&#8220;All eyes are now on Virginia because, if successful, we could serve as a national model for improved value in health care spending,&#8221; Sen. Mark Warner said in a news release.</p>

<p>Medicare reduced payments to 800 hospitals across the country this year, penalizing them for high numbers of injuries and infections among patients, <a href="https://khn.org/news/medicare-trims-payments-to-800-hospitals-citing-patient-safety-incidents/?utm_campaign=KHN%3A%20First%20Edition&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=70379732&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--jVTYTEQbjLtSjZS24-NBlqf1PZSO0EtnHOyEJ0p0PaprvWjCjhmGnbwDk2SxUkdYdeqjeQgosIxO8BZQpuCie1_SGl9Vcwuz7ob2U_UhOiSuwy9Y&amp;_hsmi=70379732" target="_blank">according to Kaiser Health News</a>. Eighteen of those hospitals were in Virginia.</p>
<p>The penalties are part of a program set up under the Affordable Care Act designed to improve quality of care through pay-for-performance incentives. A quarter of hospitals with the highest rates of <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/07/18/virginias-health-care-acquired-infection-rates-mirror-national-averages-but-is-that-good-enough/" target="_blank">infections</a> or patient injuries lose 1 percent of their Medicare payments.</p>
<p>The sanctions come on top of more payments that Medicare docked hospitals for their <a href="https://khn.org/news/medicare-eases-readmissions-penalties-against-safety-net-hospitals/" target="_blank">high rates of readmission</a>. According to Kaiser Health News, 64 Virginia hospitals were penalized for having too many patients wind up back in their care within 30 days of leaving the hospital. <a href="https://khn.org/news/hospital-penalties/?penalty=hac" target="_blank">Kaiser Health News has the full list</a>.</p>
<p>The hospitals whose Medicare payments were reduced by 1 percent due to complications, like infections or patient injury, include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sentara RMH Medical Center in Harrisonburg</li>
<li>Sentara Norfolk General Hospital</li>
<li>University of Virginia Medical Center in Charlottesville</li>
<li>Carilion Roanoke Memorial Hospital in Roanoke</li>
<li>VCU Health System in Richmond</li>
<li>Novant Health UVA Prince William Medical Center in Manassas</li>
<li>Southside Regional Medical Center in Petersburg</li>
<li>Bedford Memorial Hospital</li>
<li>Carilion Franklin Memorial Hospital in Rocky Mount</li>
<li>Inova Fair Oaks Hospital in Fairfax</li>
<li>Hiram Davis Medical Center in Petersburg</li>
<li>Reston Hospital Center</li>
<li>Chippenham and Johnston-Willis hospitals in Richmond</li>
<li>Lewisgale Hospital Pulaski</li>
<li>Carilion Tazewell Community Hospital</li>
<li>Chesapeake General Hospital</li>
<li>Halquist Memorial Inpatient Center in Arlington</li>
<li>Spotsylvania Regional Medical Center in Fredericksburg</li>
</ul>
<p>Many of those hospitals had <a href="https://khn.org/news/hospital-penalties/?penalty=hac" target="_blank">received penalties in the past</a>, as well.</p>
<p>According to a statement from Julian Walker, spokesman for the Virginia Hospital &amp; Healthcare Association, the group has worked to reduce readmissions and healthcare-associated conditions with its 110 member hospitals through its Center for Excellence, founded in 2015.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we examine the condition-specific categories on which Medicare evaluates readmission rate changes, hospitals in Virginia have recorded marked improvement across several categories, including hip and knee replacement post-surgery readmission, and readmission for patients who have undergone coronary artery bypass grafting procedures,&#8221; he said in an emailed statement.</p>
<p>Walker said 35 participating hospitals prevented 1,851 &#8220;patient harm incidents&#8221; between Sept. 2015 and Sept. 2016 during the <a href="http://www.hret-hiin.org/resources/display/aha-hret-hen-20-final-report" target="_blank">Hospital Engagement Network 2.0</a> initiative, &#8220;yielding $16.5 million in health care cost savings.&#8221;</p>

(Image via Wikimedia) </p><p>A professional medical organization and the Virginia Board of Health are uneasy about language in the proposed budget that they say will essentially eviscerate a newly launched, two-year pilot program that provides low-income women with contraception.</p>
<p>The Virginia section of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, or ACOG, has written a letter to the governor asking him to veto or amend the language, and last week the state Board of Health unanimously voted to do the same.</p>
<p>The language spilled over from a debate last year in which anti-abortion groups vehemently opposed $6 million in the budget devoted to funding the program, claiming it would <a href="https://www.wric.com/news/politics/capitol-connection/groups-call-for-restrictions-on-proposed-contraception-pilot-program/1174375654" target="_blank">&#8220;create a multi-million dollar slush fund for Planned Parenthood.&#8221;</a></p>
<p>The pilot program pays for long-acting reversible contraception, or LARCs, a category that includes intrauterine devices and implants, for women who make 250 percent or less of the federal poverty level (about $51,950 for a family of three).</p>
<p>LARCs can last years and are <a href="https://www.acog.org/About-ACOG/News-Room/News-Releases/2015/ACOG-Strengthens-LARC-Recommendations?IsMobileSet=false" target="_blank">widely considered the safest and most effective form of birth control</a>. According to the Virginia Department of Health, expected outcomes of the program include reduced rates of unintended pregnancies and abortions.</p>
<p>Twelve providers were approved to participate in the program, including the Virginia League for Planned Parenthood, Planned Parenthood South Atlantic, Virginia Commonwealth University and the University of Virginia health systems, among others.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/amendment/2019/1/SB1100/Introduced/MR/292/1s/" target="_blank">amendment</a> added to this year&#8217;s proposed budget by Sen. Siobhan Dunnavant, R-Henrico, essentially changes the program&#8217;s funding to ensure the state is only paying for LARCs, she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The fact of the matter is, the commonwealth is split at least 50/50 pro-life and pro-choice,&#8221; Dunnavant said. &#8220;Pro-life people do not want their tax dollars going to something that will make it somehow easier for a company like Planned Parenthood to provide abortions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Victoria Cobb, president of <a href="http://www.familyfoundation.org/blog/urgent-action-needed-stop-tax-payer-funding-of-abortion-in-vas-budget?rq=larc" target="_blank">the Family Foundation</a>, which opposes abortion, said in a statement that Virginia&#8217;s anti-abortion movement is &#8220;grateful that the General Assembly corrected their error by working toward ensuring that Planned Parenthood is blocked from being the financial beneficiary of this misguided program.&#8221;</p>
<p>In an email, Paulette McElwain, CEO of Virginia League for Planned Parenthood, called the proposed amendment &#8220;a political ploy that would dismantle the LARC pilot program and block birth control access for Virginians with lower incomes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Access to reliable birth control empowers people to lead healthy lives,&#8221; she added. &#8220;For women who are uninsured, the idea of paying anywhere from $250 to $1,000 to have a device placed is just not feasible.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Virginia section of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has raised concerns that the changes will cause some of the providers to question their ability to stay involved, said Dr. Aaron Goldberg, the section&#8217;s chair.</p>
<p>A common misconception is that the program gives the medical groups one lump sum, Goldberg said. That&#8217;s not the case — rather, VDH reimburses them for services they&#8217;ve already provided.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some providers are more efficient and have better access to patients and have the ability to serve more people in need, but the program does not favor any one over the other,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>In its letter, the group raised concerns that the program will serve fewer women under the changes — a concern shared by state officials.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s ultimately likely going to mean we&#8217;re going to be able to serve fewer women because the administrative costs of the program will be higher,&#8221; said Dr. Vanessa Walker-Harris, director of the Office of Family Health Services with VDH.</p>
<p>Under the changes, VDH would have to purchase the LARCs outright and then distribute them to the participating groups. That requires the department to become a wholesale distributor, which means getting permission from the state Board of Pharmacy and making the necessary changes to its pharmacy.</p>
<p>In addition to those extra administrative costs, the department won&#8217;t be able to benefit from device discounts. Right now, providers can work directly with the manufacturers and use direct discount programs to get a competitive price on the LARCs, Walker-Harris said. But that option isn&#8217;t available to VDH because the agency is not permitted by law to extend the discounted prices it receives through federal programs to non-state agencies, according to the ACOG letter.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re basically putting up an extremely high number of barriers — letting the program look like it exists while eviscerating the function of it,&#8221; said Dr. Holly Puritz, a member of the state Board of Health. &#8220;I feel like we&#8217;re doing a huge disservice to the women of Virginia when we quietly allow this to happen.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alena Yarmosky, a spokeswoman for Gov. Ralph Northam&#8217;s office, said in an email that he is in the process of reviewing legislation passed by the General Assembly, including the budget conference report.</p>
<p>Though she did not say whether Northam intends to veto or amend the language around the pilot program, she added that he, &#8220;has long advocated for the commonwealth&#8217;s LARC pilot program, and he is committed to ensuring access to high-quality, comprehensive and affordable reproductive health care.&#8221;</p>
<p>The pilot program started in October and has so far served more than 300 women. Over the next two years, it is expected to serve 7,300 or so, Dr. Norman Oliver, the state health commissioner, told the Virginia Board of Health last week. As of the end of January, eight of the 12 providers had submitted invoices totaling about $225,000, he said.</p>
<p>Sixty-four percent of the women served so far were at 100 percent or below the federal poverty level, Oliver added.</p>
<p>The Virginia League for Planned Parenthood provides same-day insertion and removals of LARCs every day it has a clinician on site, according to the group&#8217;s data. In 2017, it provided 2,031 LARCs to Virginia patients, mostly in Richmond but also in Hampton and Virginia Beach.</p>
<p>Dunnavant said the final <a href="https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/amendment/2019/1/HB1700/Introduced/CR/292/1c/" target="_blank">budget amendment language</a> was altered from what she originally submitted, though she still agrees with the outcome.</p>
<p>&#8220;This was not designed for Planned Parenthood to get a big chunk of money from the state,&#8221; she said. &#8220;This was designed to get as many devices to women who would benefit from them as possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jeff Caruso, executive director of the Virginia Catholic Conference, which opposes abortion, said the amendment is a step in the right direction, though the group does not support the program in any form.</p>
<p>VDH has allocated $2.2 million to the Virginia League for Planned Parenthood and $445,000 to Planned Parenthood South Atlantic over the two-year program. Because it currently uses a reimbursement model, those entities — along with the 10 other providers — will invoice VDH and be reimbursed up to their allocated amount.</p>
<p>Dunnavant said that by having VDH distribute the devices itself, the state can be certain that every dollar is accounted for and being used solely to purchase the devices.</p>
<p>The state&#8217;s free clinics, she argued, should be getting the bulk of the $6 million to provide the devices to low-income women.</p>
<p>&#8220;To me, it did not meet our objective if you&#8217;re not getting it into the free clinics,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Pretty much all of that should be going to the free clinics.&#8221;</p>

<p>Virginia was late to the Medicaid expansion game, but its Senators in Washington, D.C., are trying to help it make up for lost time — and cash.</p>
<p>Sens. Mark Warner and Tim Kaine, along with Alabama Sen. Doug Jones, introduced <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/400655579/Same-Act-of-2019" target="_blank">legislation</a> last week that would give Virginia, and the 11 other states that expanded Medicaid after 2014, the same full federal match <a href="https://www.modernhealthcare.com/government/senate-bill-wants-sweeten-deal-states-expand-medicaid" target="_blank">as those that expanded the program earlier</a>.</p>
<p>Under the Affordable Care Act, the federal government picked up the entire expansion tab from 2014 to 2016, then its contribution started to decline. But because Virginia waited until last year to expand, the federal government is only picking up 90 percent of the bill.</p>
<p>Warner and Kaine&#8217;s legislation, dubbed the States Achieve Medicaid Expansion (or SAME) Act, would guarantee a new expansion state 3 years of full federal funding before phasing down to 95 percent in year four, 94 percent in year 5, then 93 percent in the sixth year and 90 percent for every year after.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s crazy that for so many years, Virginia taxpayers were footing the bill for states that had already expanded Medicaid,&#8221; Warner said in a <a href="https://www.warner.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/pressreleases?ID=C816CE94-663E-46D0-9647-C4A76AE4B817" target="_blank">news release</a>, adding that the proposed legislation &#8220;encourages the states that have yet to take the same step to expand Medicaid as Congress intended.&#8221;</p>
<p>The ACA had intended to expand Medicaid programs in every state to include those making up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level, or $25,100 a year for a family of four. But a 2012 Supreme Court decision made expansion optional.</p>
<p>Warner and Kaine&#8217;s proposal would save Virginia hospitals an estimated $300 million per year in the first three years, according to the Virginia Hospital &amp; Healthcare Association.</p>
<p>&#8220;By guaranteeing states the same federal Medicaid funding incentives regardless of when they expand, this bill will help Virginia with its expansion program and encourage states that have not yet expanded Medicaid to make the same smart move,&#8221; Kaine said in the release.</p>

<p>In the 2018 fiscal year, there were nearly 12,000 substantiated cases of abuse, neglect or exploitation of elderly or disabled adults. Since 2016, the number has jumped by about 1,000 each year, according to a new <a href="https://vadars.org/downloads/publications/SFY%202018Report_FinalVersion_011719.pdf" target="_blank">report</a> from the Department for Aging and Rehabilitative Services&#8217; Adult Protective Services Division.</p>
<p>The total number of reports that APS workers received grew by almost 16 percent between 2017 and 2018.</p>
<p>Paige McCleary, the division&#8217;s director, said she&#8217;s concerned about the rising numbers, worker burnout and ever-increasing caseloads.</p>
<p>&#8220;Those substantiated cases do require resources to address the issue in many circumstances,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Our funding has remained rather stagnant over the last several years, so our workers are quite creative in trying to address someone&#8217;s needs in the community.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her concerns are amplified by a growing elderly population. By 2035, people over age 65 are projected to outnumber children for the first time in U.S. history, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.</p>
<p>While APS works with both aged and disabled adults, 74 percent of the report subjects last year were over 60 years of age.</p>
<p>Funding for the services that abuse victims need — to cover a medical bill, for example, or to stay in a hotel to get away from an abuser — has remained level since at least 2014, McCleary said. Meanwhile, home-based funding, which helps adults stay in their homes and avoid going to a long-term care facility, has been cut by about $3 million since 2009.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have an ever-increasing aging population who want to remain in their homes,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We want to respect that decision, but we want people to be safe in their homes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Self-neglect is far and away the most common form of adult abuse that workers identify. Those are cases in which someone cannot, for example, recognize that they need medical care or help with activities of daily living, like washing or preparing meals.</p>
<p>But most commonly, self-neglect is identified through hoarding situations, whether it&#8217;s animal hoarding or items like magazines or certain types of boxes or paper, McCleary explained.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am concerned about worker burnout, and the difficult things that they do see in these homes, whether it&#8217;s a self-neglect case or a sexual abuse case or a physical abuse case,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Those are really difficult circumstances.&#8221;</p>
<p>Self-neglect accounted for 54 percent of substantiated reports. Other forms of abuse, though, are on the rise. Financial exploitation jumped by about 30 percent in the 2018 fiscal year compared to the previous year.</p>
<p>There is little data or research available on adult protective services to pinpoint specific problems like high caseloads, McCleary said. Because there aren&#8217;t any federal statutes or funding related directly to APS delivery, each state provides services differently and there isn&#8217;t much opportunity to do consistent research.</p>
<p>&#8220;We kind of look at child welfare stats and say &#8216;Yeah, that&#8217;s probably happening to us, as well,'&#8221; McCleary said.</p>
<p>APS was relocated from Virginia&#8217;s Department of Social Services to the Department of Aging and Rehabilitative Services in 2013. But APS workers, referred to as family services specialists, are integrated into <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/10/29/little-kingdoms-administration-of-social-services-in-virginia-rests-largely-in-the-hands-of-localities-what-happens-when-they-cant-fix-themselves/" target="_blank">local departments of social services</a>, and in some smaller departments those specialists cover both child and adult protective services.</p>
<p>As of August, about <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/08/27/long-hours-low-pay-and-constant-turnover-social-services-agencies-in-virginia-struggle-to-keep-staff/" target="_blank">20 percent of the family services specialist positions all over the state were vacant</a>, according to the Virginia League of Social Services Executives. The annual turnover for that position was 21 percent.</p>
<p>Andy Crawford, president of the League of Social Services Executives, pointed out that child welfare issues often get far more attention than adult services.</p>
<p>&#8220;The numbers are up, but there aren&#8217;t many advocacy groups to speak for them,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That&#8217;s something that we as a league have noticed: How are we going to advocate for adult services? Because there is a need there.&#8221;</p>

But next year, both tampons and diapers could at least be a little cheaper.</p>
<p>As a delegate, now-Sen. Jennifer Boysko, D-Loudoun, had tried twice to exempt menstrual products from the state&#8217;s sales and use tax, and this year her renewed effort was semi-successful.</p>
<p>Her <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+sum+SB1715" target="_blank">legislation</a> was adjusted to match a <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=191&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb2540&amp;submit=GO" target="_blank">bill</a> sponsored by Del. Kathy Byron, R-Bedford, that reduces the sales tax on personal hygiene products — including items ranging from tampons and sanitary napkins to diapers and disposable undergarments — to 1.5 percent, matching Virginia&#8217;s tax on food, starting in 2020.</p>
<p>Both the House and Senate passed the legislation, and it is now awaiting the Governor&#8217;s signature.</p>
<p>In an email, Byron said solely repealing the sales tax on menstrual products would be discriminatory and have a big impact on the state budget. She had researched other options, and said the proposal she settled on is &#8220;fair and equitable.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The items that would be covered under this bill are not optional luxuries, but absolute necessities to those who use them,&#8221; she said. &#8220;There are products on the list of covered items that are used by men, and products used by women. There are products that apply to the very young and those who are older.&#8221;</p>
<p>Boysko said she was happy with the bipartisan compromise, and particularly pleased that items like diapers will have a reduced tax.</p>
<p>&#8220;We talk a lot about having families with dignity and being able to afford to live in their communities,&#8221; Boysko said. &#8220;This is a really tangible way that can help people all over Virginia, especially those who have to count pennies every month.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://scholarship.richmond.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2513&amp;context=law-faculty-publications" target="_blank">According to a paper</a> published by Christopher Cotropia of the University of Richmond School of Law and Kyle Rozema of the University of Chicago Law School, repealing the tampon tax &#8220;removes an unequal tax burden and could make menstrual hygiene products more accessible for low-income consumers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pending the results of the November election, Boysko said she will likely continue to push to repeal the tampon tax entirely in the future. But she said this is a good first step.</p>
<p>She&#8217;s also intent on bringing back <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+ful+SB1646" target="_blank">legislation</a> that would require schools to make menstrual supplies available to students at all times and at no cost.</p>
<p>Boysko said that the successful legislation this year, even if it doesn&#8217;t eliminate the tax completely, could be due in part to simply increased awareness about women&#8217;s issues.</p>
<p>&#8220;Menstrual equity in general is an issue that I don&#8217;t think people thought about until more women took leadership positions in places of power,&#8221; she said. &#8220;This is a tangible example of how we need more voices from different points of view making policy decisions.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the most recent <a href="http://www.vdh.virginia.gov/content/uploads/sites/18/2019/01/Quarterly-Drug-Death-Report-FINAL-Q3-2018.pdf" target="_blank">report</a> for the third quarter of last year dashes those hopes.</p>
<p>According to data released in January, the state estimates that there were 1,229 opioid overdose fatalities in 2018, the exact same number that occurred in 2017. The true number won&#8217;t be available until the data is finalized in the spring.</p>
<p>In the first quarter of last year, the state estimated 62 fewer deaths for the year.</p>
<p>&#8220;Prior to the last publication, we actually thought we were going to see a decrease, but we had such a significant jump in the third quarter of 2018 that we had to recalculate,&#8221; said Rosie Hobron, statewide forensic epidemiologist with the Department of Health.</p>
<p>There were about 50 or 60 more drug-related deaths in the third quarter than the department expected, she added, particularly due to <a href="https://www.dea.gov/factsheets/fentanyl" target="_blank">fentanyl</a>, a dangerously powerful synthetic opioid that was developed as a pain management drug but has been used illicitly, often mixed with heroin.</p>
<p>Fentanyl, in both its prescription and illicit forms, caused or contributed to 50 percent of the fatal overdoses in 2017, according to the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner&#8217;s quarterly report. The state estimates that it caused even more fatalities in 2018, with 825 deaths compared to 770 in 2017.</p>
<p>Though Virginia likely won&#8217;t see the decrease it was expecting in the final report, there could be a silver lining: at least 2018 likely will not continue the upward trajectory of fatal opioid overdoses, Hobron pointed out.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we looked at the numbers in 2016 compared to 2015, it was astronomical and terrifying,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>There was a 38.9 percent increase in fatal overdoses from all drugs between 2016 and 2015, the largest jump the state has seen. Between 2017 and 2016, there was a 7.4 percent increase.</p>
<p>Other drug-related deaths, though, are on the rise as well, particularly methamphetamine- and cocaine-related fatalities. The state estimates that they caused 31 and 75 additional deaths in 2018 compared to the year before, respectively.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the issues is we need to look at this not as a drug crisis but an addiction crisis,&#8221; Hobron said.</p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury - Sept. 11, 2018)</p><p>In its changes to the state budget, the 2019 General Assembly inched closer to stabilizing  Virginia&#8217;s struggling mental health system.</p>
<p>The effort is in part driven by the ongoing crisis within the state&#8217;s psychiatric hospitals, which have seen an unprecedented uptick in admissions, resulting in <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/12/03/you-have-no-control-as-psychiatric-admissions-rise-virginia-grapples-with-a-hospital-crisis-that-threatens-care-and-safety/" target="_blank">dangerous overcrowding</a>.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, eight of the state&#8217;s 10 psychiatric facilities were operating at 95 percent capacity or above, according to data from the Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services. Hospitals are considered safest for patients and staff when operating at no more than 85 percent capacity.</p>
<p>Advocates and concerned lawmakers have pushed for a multifaceted approach to address the problems: increase resources to the hospitals to help current staff cope with the high numbers and simultaneously fund community services to prevent people from ending up in the mental hospital in the first place.</p>
<p>The 2018 biennium budget pumped $84.1 million into community-based mental health services, <a href="https://www.richmond.com/opinion/their-opinion/guest-columnists/creigh-deeds-column-state-budget-addresses-mental-health-reform-/article_04e171b3-7f8e-5e5b-9751-6a2ec66e7d17.html" target="_blank">according to Sen. Creigh Deeds,</a> D-Bath, who chairs the Joint Subcommittee to Study Mental Health Services in the Twenty-First Century, known as the Deeds Commission.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve made strides, for sure, over the last several years, but we still have a ways to go,&#8221; said Rhonda Thissen, executive director of the National Alliance of Mental Illness of Virginia. &#8220;Virginia still has a public mental health system that is overly weighted toward funding for hospitalization and crisis, and not community services, as compared to other states.&#8221;</p>
<p>This session, lawmakers added <a href="https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/amendment/2019/1/HB1700/Introduced/CR/312/5c/" target="_blank">$5 million</a> for <a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/virginia/a-place-to-sleep-many-of-virginia-s-mentally-ill/article_859274aa-6938-509d-bfe7-ef2050cc71fe.html" target="_blank">permanent supportive housing</a>, a model that allows residents to choose their own stable housing while receiving supportive services. That money could pay for about 400 more units, in addition to funding for around 900 units that has already been allocated to the behavioral health department for fiscal year 2020.</p>
<p>More units could make a big difference for the high hospital census, Thissen said, because it would help address the <a href="https://namivirginia.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/127/2016/03/DAP-Fact-Sheet.pdf" target="_blank">extraordinary barriers to discharge</a> list — those people who have been medically cleared to leave the hospital but remain there because they have nowhere else to go.</p>
<p>&#8220;For 75 percent of the people on the extraordinary barriers to discharge list, the barrier in the community for them is housing,&#8221; Thissen said. &#8220;There&#8217;s a continuum from the hospital into the community, and this funding to create additional units is going to really help to relieve some of the pressure in that continuum.&#8221;</p>
<p>DBHDS has cited <a href="https://rga.lis.virginia.gov/Published/2019/RD100/PDF" target="_blank">a need for 5,000 permanent supportive housing units</a>.</p>
<p>To help relieve the immediate crisis within state psychiatric hospitals, the General Assembly has set money aside to increase staff, including <a href="https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/amendment/2019/1/HB1700/Introduced/CR/316/1c/" target="_blank">$7.2 million</a> in their negotiated budget for additional nurses and psychiatrists.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hospital staffing is an often-overlooked issue just in the same way that people in the state hospitals are overlooked because they&#8217;re out of sight, out of mind,&#8221; said Bruce Cruser, executive director of Mental Health America of Virginia. &#8220;How can people get the care they need when you have vacant positions because staff are burned out with high turnover? So that&#8217;s huge.&#8221;</p>
<p>The budget also includes language directing DBHDS to form a <a href="https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/amendment/2019/1/HB1700/Introduced/CR/310/4c/" target="_blank">work group</a> to study the census problem and create an action plan to relieve the pressure.</p>
<p>&#8220;That work is so important in helping us get out of this crisis mode,&#8221; Cruser said.</p>
<p>To further address workforce issues, the legislature devoted <a href="https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/amendment/2019/1/HB1700/Introduced/CR/303/10c/" target="_blank">$2.6 million</a> from the state&#8217;s general fund — to be combined with $4.5 million in federal funds — to increase Medicaid reimbursement for psychiatric services by 21 percent.</p>
<p>Additionally, the legislature passed measures to address mental health challenges for <a href="https://vakids.org/our-news/blog/childrens-mental-health-2019-session-wrap-up" target="_blank">children</a> in particular, like helping to improve the integration of mental health services into primary care and allowing school counselors to <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+sum+HB1729" target="_blank">spend more time counseling</a> students rather than administrative activities.</p>
<p>Another successes for mental health advocates was the passage of legislation sponsored by Del. Rob Bell, R-Albermarle, which requires the Board of Corrections to <a href="https://www.dailyprogress.com/news/virginia_politics/bell-mental-health-jail-bill-inspired-by-jamycheal-mitchell-case/article_2399791e-389c-11e9-861b-8f05853434af.html" target="_blank">create standards for behavioral health treatment in jails</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;The momentum needs to continue,&#8221; Cruser said. &#8220;As a whole, the legislature certainly is better informed and more supportive of increasing funding and services than they were many years ago. But my fear is that they will feel, &#8216;We&#8217;ve already dealt with that,&#8217; and not continue to support it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sen. Bryce Reeves, R-Spotsylvania, sponsored the <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=191&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=sb1339&amp;submit=GO" target="_blank">legislation</a>, with 39 senators <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+mbr+SB1339" target="_blank">signing on to co-sponsor</a>. Sen. Janet Howell, D-Fairfax, carried the $2.8 million <a href="https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/amendment/2019/1/HB1700/Introduced/CR/339/1c/" target="_blank">budget amendment</a>, which both chambers also agreed to in their budget negotiations.</p>
<p>The money covers a slew of new positions within the Department of Social Services, including: 10 regional foster care staff, a regional project manager and five positions to monitor foster care services.</p>
<p>Carl Ayers, director of family services with DSS, said he hopes to get those positions filled on or around July 1 of this year.</p>
<p>The legislation also officially establish a director of foster care health and safety position; create a compliance dashboard and complaint hotline; and limits social workers&#8217; caseloads.</p>
<p>The effort to address deficiencies within the state&#8217;s foster care system since the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission&#8217;s December <a href="http://jlarc.virginia.gov/pdfs/reports/Rpt513-2.pdf" target="_blank">report</a> was applauded by <a href="https://vakids.org/our-news/blog/big-year-for-foster-care-reform-2019-legislative-wrap-up" target="_blank">advocates</a>, many of whom have been pushing for reform for years.</p>
<p>Department staff, too, welcomed the reform effort, though they noted that the state&#8217;s child welfare system needs consistent support from the legislature to create meaningful, lasting change. The department continues to struggle with <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/10/29/little-kingdoms-administration-of-social-services-in-virginia-rests-largely-in-the-hands-of-localities-what-happens-when-they-cant-fix-themselves/" target="_blank">training</a> and <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/08/27/long-hours-low-pay-and-constant-turnover-social-services-agencies-in-virginia-struggle-to-keep-staff/" target="_blank">retention</a>.</p>
<p>Other foster care reforms passed this session include legislation requiring DSS to freeze foster care children&#8217;s credit to <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/there-are-5-year-olds-that-have-five-year-credit-histories-cracking-down-on-foster-care-identity-theft/" target="_blank">prevent identity theft</a> and a bill that requires local departments to <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+sum+SB1720" target="_blank">notify relatives</a> when a child is about to enter foster care, and list all the resources available to them, such as becoming a licensed kinship foster home.</p>
<p>Kinship families — those who have not gone through the foster care system but have taken relatives&#8217; children — often rely solely on the Temporary Assistance for Need Families program as their only means of financial assistance.</p>
<p>The General Assembly included in its budget a 5 percent <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/02/20/senate-proposes-slight-increase-in-assistance-for-the-poorest-of-the-poor/" target="_blank">increase in TANF benefits</a>. The program provides cash benefits and other supports, like child care, for low-income families.</p>
<p>The increases costs the state $3.5 million and equals about $20 more for a family of three a month.</p>

																						<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-size:12px;"></p><p>Both the House and Senate have passed a <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=191&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=HB2546" target="_blank">bill</a> that would ramp up the state&#8217;s surveillance of maternal mortality.</p>
<p>The legislation, sponsored by Del. Roxann Robinson, R-Chesterfield, establishes the maternal mortality review team and tasks the Department of Health with reviewing the rate of pregnancy-related deaths in Virginia.</p>
<p>It also requires the team to identify factors that could contribute to maternal mortality and develop prevention and intervention recommendations.</p>
<p>The team will have to compile data on maternal deaths every three years and report it to the governor and General Assembly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Above all, this will go a long way to reducing our maternal mortality rate,&#8221; Robinson said in a news release.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/maternalinfanthealth/pregnancy-relatedmortality.htm" target="_blank">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>, about 700 women die in the U.S. due to pregnancy or delivery complications every year. Another <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/investigations/deadly-deliveries/2018/07/26/maternal-mortality-rates-preeclampsia-postpartum-hemorrhage-safety/546889002/" target="_blank">50,000 suffer severe injuries</a>.</p>
<p>Women in the United States are more likely to die from childbirth or pregnancy-related causes than other women in the developed world, the CDC says.</p>
<p>&#8220;Research suggests that half of these deaths are preventable,&#8221; the agency says.</p>
<p>And the risk of pregnancy-related deaths for black women is three to four times higher than those of white women.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sadly, too many mothers are dying from preventable childbirth complications and many more suffering severe injuries during childbirth,&#8221; Speaker Kirk Cox, R-Colonial Heights, said in a statement. &#8220;This legislation will strengthen our healthcare system and protect mothers.&#8221;</p>

																						<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-size:12px;"></p><p>During a series of meetings last year, lawmakers gave passionate speeches decrying the practice of balance billing.</p>
<p>They called it an unfair, <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/07/19/what-recourse-do-you-have-other-than-to-write-the-check-lawmakers-scrutinize-balance-billing/" target="_blank">serious problem</a> that could land someone in medical debt and ruin their credit, even if they have health insurance. Several lawmakers issued a warning to  feuding lobbyists representing health insurers, hospitals and doctors: If they didn&#8217;t <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/10/17/doctors-and-insurers-almost-reach-an-agreement-on-balance-billing-solutions-but-not-quite/" target="_blank">come up with a solution</a> themselves, then legislators would.</p>
<p>But they didn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Several bills were filed this session that would prohibit emergency room balance billing — when a patient goes to an in-network hospital but is assigned a doctor who is out-of-network, usually without the patient&#8217;s knowledge. He or she then gets a bill from the provider for the amount that the insurance company wouldn&#8217;t cover.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/02/05/691374149/bipartisan-support-builds-for-limits-on-surprise-medical-bills" target="_blank">national problem</a> that has gotten widespread attention as more people raise concerns about rising health care costs.</p>
<p>At the beginning of this session, the Virginia General Assembly seemed <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/01/11/lawmakers-are-poised-to-tackle-medical-balance-billing-this-session-but-the-central-question-of-payment-still-looms/" target="_blank">poised to end the practice</a>. But the <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/01/18/lawmakers-asked-insurers-and-doctors-to-find-a-solution-on-balance-billing-they-didnt-and-neither-have-lawmakers/" target="_blank">bickering</a> that prevented lobbyists from reaching a consensus spilled into the legislature, and though some less controversial <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+sum+HB2538" target="_blank">legislation</a> to end the practice around elective services succeeded, all the bills that would have ended emergency room balance billing died.</p>
<p>&#8220;What I hear is, &#8216;You&#8217;ve got to do something to reduce my health care costs,'&#8221; said Sen. Frank Wagner, R-Virginia Beach, who submitted one of the <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+sum+SB1360" target="_blank">bills</a> that health insurers supported. &#8220;It&#8217;s the number one issue. They pay us to come up here and analyze the situation and understand what&#8217;s going on and try to bend that curve.</p>
<p>&#8220;This was one method we could do to help protect the people we represent so we start to deal with the number one issue on my voters&#8217; minds. And we dropped the ball.&#8221;</p>
<p>Legislation sponsored by Sen. Glen Sturtevant, R-Richmond, that doctors&#8217; groups supported <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/02/06/following-hours-of-debate-one-piece-of-emergency-balance-billing-legislation-makes-it-through-cross-over/" target="_blank">made it furthest</a>, passing the Senate unanimously. But then it landed in the House Appropriations Committee and wasn&#8217;t placed on the docket. The same fate befell a similar House <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+sum+HB1714" target="_blank">bill</a>, sponsored by Del. R. Lee Ware, R-Powhatan.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is, I think, a story that tells a lot about the influence of various interest groups in Virginia government and the legislature,&#8221; Sturtevant said.</p>
<p>He lamented the fact that, without any successful legislation, Virginians will be susceptible to balance billing for another year — as did Jill Hanken, a health care attorney with the Virginia Poverty Law Center.</p>
<p>&#8220;Consumers will have yet another year to be hurt by the practice of balance billing,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It’s very much a consumer beware situation. Anytime people go to hospitals or even see their doctors they need to ask questions of the doctors and of their insurance plans to see whether or not the people actually giving the services are in network. But the burden should not be on consumers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Various health care groups said the lack of successful balance billing legislation is unfortunate and disappointing. They also continued to point fingers at each other, with providers suggesting that insurers were responsible for the bill&#8217;s ultimate downfall.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unfortunately, in order to protect record profits, the health insurance industry blocked attempts to pass a reasonable solution, despite overwhelming, bipartisan support from legislators,&#8221; Dr. Bruce Lo, president of the Virginia College of Emergency Physicians, said in a statement. &#8220;Ultimately, insurance industry profits prevailed over patients.&#8221;</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, health insurers blamed providers.</p>
<p>&#8220;The suggestion that we are profiting unreasonably from ER visits and that’s the reason this bill died is preposterous,&#8221; countered Doug Gray, executive director of the Virginia Association of Health Plans. &#8220;The people who are seeking profits unfairly from emergency room patients are doctors and hospitals and they’ve been doing it for 20 years. Every balance billing example is from an ER doc and from a hospital. The best way for them to stop balance billing is to stop doing it. Period.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wagner said he thinks more public awareness would help legislation get across the finish line in the future. If there was a stronger movement behind ending balance billing, he argued, the legislation would have had a better chance because more lawmakers would share his passion for ending the practice.</p>
<p>But because few people know about it until they&#8217;re victims of the practice themselves, it doesn&#8217;t get as much attention as it deserves.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s the outrage?&#8221; he said. &#8220;If they knew, they&#8217;d be outraged.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sturtevant and Wagner both referenced the power of lobbyist groups in explaining why none of the bills passed, Sturtevant pointing at the insurance lobby and Wagner at the hospital and doctor lobby.</p>
<p>But they both also acknowledge that lawmakers are ultimately responsible for cutting through the arguments and coming up with a solution.</p>
<p>&#8220;That’s the job of legislators, that’s why we are here, it’s to be able to see those issues that affect lots of individuals who don’t have their own interest group or lobby organization, that’s our job to represent them down here,&#8221; Sturtevant said. &#8220;Sadly, because one committee is able to refuse to hear a bill, we can’t find a solution.&#8221;</p>
<p>Both vowed to continue to pursue the issue, and Sturtevant said he plans to campaign on it before the November elections.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are a lot of issues in the General Assembly where it takes two, three, four sometimes more sessions to actually get the ball across the goal line and get it signed into law,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Typically, DSS issues the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program, or SNAP, benefits on a staggered basis, but in March it will release them to all clients on March 1, according to a news release.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This change is intended to help close the gap for clients who have been stretching benefits since mid-January as a result of the early release of February benefits during the partial federal government shutdown,” Toni Blue Washington, director of benefits program with DSS, said in the release. &#8220;We understand the challenges individuals and families have been facing, and want to ensure Virginians who rely on SNAP benefits are provided some relief.&#8221;</p>
<p>The department <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/virginia-snap-recipients-to-receive-february-benefits-early-due-to-government-shutdown/" target="_blank">released its February benefits in January</a> to ensure that clients received them despite the shutdown.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The uncertainty during and after the shutdown increased anxiety in low-income households,&#8221; said Salaam Bhatti, a public benefits attorney with the Virginia Poverty Law Center. &#8220;It’s great to see DSS provide this relief to low-income families following the early release of February benefits in mid-January. It is important for SNAP recipients to remember that SNAP benefits will not expire if not used by month’s end.&#8221;</p>

(Ned Oliver/ Virginia Mercury)</p><p>In 1985, a low-income family of three getting cash assistance from the state would receive an average of $291 a month. If that amount kept pace with inflation, it would be $676 today.</p>
<p>&#8220;However, a three-person Virginia family is only getting $314 a month on average,&#8221; said Salaam Bhatti, a public benefits attorney with the Virginia Poverty Law Center.</p>
<p>The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, or TANF, program provides cash assistance and other supports like child care to low-income families. This year, the Senate has <a href="https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/amendment/2019/1/SB1100/Introduced/CA/340/1s/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">proposed increasing TANF benefits</a> for families by five percent, which advocates are hailing as a step in the right direction, even if it is a modest increase compared to the rising cost of living.</p>
<p>TANF is funded by block grants from the federal government with matching state dollars, but Virginia can carry over the money it doesn&#8217;t spend every year.</p>
<p>At the end of the 2018 fiscal year in June, the state had a TANF surplus of $136 million. The last time the benefits increased was in 2017, when they went up by just 2.5 percent.</p>
<p>&#8220;The $136 million surplus is a slap in the face of needy families,&#8221; Bhatti said.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="http://thehalfsheet.org/post/182898245978/senate-proposes-improving-support-for-low-income" target="_blank">Commonwealth Institute</a>, in 2016 Virginia used just 61 percent of its TANF dollars for core benefits like child care, cash assistance and work support. The state has sent some of the funds toward other priorities, like nonprofit grants and tax credits.</p>
<p>Some hesitate spending the TANF surplus because they want it to be the state&#8217;s safety net, Bhatti explained, in case a national recession hits, for example, and the federal government doesn&#8217;t provide as much funding.</p>
<p>But there are some especially vulnerable populations who rely almost entirely on TANF. Allison Gilbreath, policy analyst with Voices for Virginia&#8217;s Children, a Henrico advocacy group, pointed to kinship care families, who have taken on their relatives&#8217; children but didn&#8217;t go through the state&#8217;s foster care system, so they don&#8217;t get access to the resources that foster care families do.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are families who truly need that little bit of support to keep them afloat,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We know that the greatest barrier they&#8217;re facing is financial insecurity.&#8221;</p>
<p>To compound the challenges for low-income families, TANF eligibility has become increasingly restrictive over the past 30 years. In 1985, a family of three was eligible for TANF if they made less than 48 percent of the federal poverty level, according to language in budget amendments. Today, their net income must be less than around <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/family-income-support/tanf-benefits-remain-low-despite-recent-increases-in-some-states" target="_blank">20 percent</a>, depending on where they live, meaning they can&#8217;t make more than about $346 a month.</p>
<p>&#8220;Only the poorest of the poor in Virginia are getting TANF,&#8221; Bhatti said.</p>
<p>In January, 17,359 families received TANF benefits, according to the Department of Social Services, equaling about $5.3 million in assistance for that month.</p>
<p>A five percent increase would cost the state an additional $3.5 million, and would equal about $20 more a month for a family of three.</p>
<p>Even that little bit, though, would be significant for families, advocates argue.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every single penny they have is so tightly budgeted that it&#8217;s going to do nothing but help them,&#8221; Bhatti said.</p>
<p>Matching budget amendments to increase TANF benefits by 10 percent were filed in the House and Senate by Del. <a href="https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/amendment/2019/1/HB1700/Introduced/MR/340/2h/" target="_blank">Lashrecse Aird</a>, D-Petersburg, and Sen. <a href="https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/amendment/2019/1/SB1100/Introduced/MR/340/2s/" target="_blank">Siobhan Dunnavant</a>, R-Henrico, but only half that amount has survived so far. As the House and Senate work to hammer out a final budget over the next few days, advocates say they&#8217;re hopeful that at least the five percent increase will find its way into the final spending plan.</p>
<p>The Senate budget also <a href="https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/amendment/2019/1/sb1100/introduced/fa/340/3s/" target="_blank">directs</a> the Department of Social Services to develop a comprehensive TANF plan,&#8221;and make recommendations to ensure the block grant is being used in the most effective manner to best support low-income families in achieving self-sufficiency.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We have to take a step back and think: Is this being used for the purpose that it was intended to be used right now?&#8221; Gilbreath said. &#8220;And that is to help families out of economic insecurity.&#8221;</p>

(Photo by Ryan M. Kelly)</p><p>After <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/01/25/after-three-years-of-legislative-wrangling-peace-in-the-valley-on-coal-ash/" target="_blank">years of effort</a> from advocates and lawmakers alike, along with <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/11/20/a-tale-of-two-reports-why-recycling-coal-ash-at-dominions-sites-appears-more-feasible-now-than-it-did-a-year-ago/" target="_blank">multiple studies</a> on how to do it and the cost, both the House and Senate passed legislation last week outlining how and when Dominion Energy will clean up about 30 million tons of coal ash at <a href="https://www.dominionenergy.com/about-us/electric-projects/coal-ash-pond-closure-management/power-stations" target="_blank">four sites</a> around the state.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a huge win for Virginia,&#8221; said Sen. Amanda Chase, R-Chesterfield. She and Sen. Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, have been working on the effort to clean up the coal ash ponds for more than three years.</p>
<p>On Friday, the House passed <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+bil+SB1355" target="_blank">legislation</a> sponsored by Sen. Frank Wagner, R-Virginia Beach, that mirrors a <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+sum+HB2786" target="_blank">bill</a> that the Senate passed on Thursday sponsored by Del. Riley Ingram, R-Hopewell.</p>
<p>The legislation, which is headed to the governor&#8217;s desk after he already <a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/all-releases/2019/january/headline-838073-en.html" target="_blank">announced his support</a> for the bipartisan agreement, requires Dominion to close its multiple coal ash ponds either by removing the ash for recycling or depositing it in a lined landfill.</p>
<p>Both Chase and Surovell signed on as co-patrons to Wagner&#8217;s bill.</p>
<p>Surovell said he&#8217;s happy the legislature was able to reach a bipartisan agreement, though it doesn&#8217;t go as far as he wanted. The bills require Dominion to recycle 2.8 million cubic yards of ash, which is about a quarter of the overall number, and Surovell says up to 75 percent could have been recycled.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think there are pretty smart people in Virginia that could figure out ways to develop products out of this,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>But he added that, as far as he knows, the legislation is the first time Virginia has adopted a policy that&#8217;s more protective of the environment than the minimum standards required by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s good to see Virginia stepping up to protect the environment,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The agreement between the two chambers — and the powerful utility itself — puts an end to the question of how the utility should close its ash ponds. Dominion had wanted to cap them in place with a synthetic top and a layer of turf, which environmental groups warned would allow the ash continue to <a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/local/chesterfield/evidence-very-clear-that-chesterfield-coal-ash-ponds-are-leaking/article_cf01fad8-4322-5f84-9fd3-c7624d62c0fc.html" target="_blank">leak</a> heavy metals and other contaminants into groundwater for years to come.</p>
<p>&#8220;Senator Surovell and I have worked in a bipartisan fashion for the past three and a half years to move this legislation forward, back when it wasn&#8217;t popular,&#8221; Chase said. &#8220;We have been able to successfully put aside the partisan politics and do what&#8217;s best for our constituents and what&#8217;s best for all Virginians.</p>
<p>&#8220;There were a lot of people that initially raised an eyebrow that a Republican and a Democrat are working together on this very important issue, but we got it done.&#8221;</p>
<p>Both versions of the legislation allow Dominion to recover all the costs associated with the closure through an additional charge on customers&#8217; bills called a rate adjustment clause, or rider, subject to approval by the State Corporation Commission.</p>
<p>“This means there is an end in sight to Dominion’s coal ash pollution in Virginia,” said Nate Benforado, an attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center.</p>
<p>“Today’s new law is the culmination of years of diligent work by legislators, conservationists, and citizens who made it their mission to ensure that Virginia address coal ash pollution head on and get done what the federal government has been unable to accomplish,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Other states who are struggling to find solutions to deal with coal ash should take a hard look at this sensible piece of legislation.”</p>

																						<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-size:12px;"></p><p><em>Like a school of fish in a sea of predators, many of the hundreds of bills filed during every General Assembly session fail to advance to even a floor vote, never mind the governor’s desk.</em></p>
<p><em>Every week, we’ll bring you a sampling of the legislation left on the cutting room floor, either failing to report or done in by other genteel euphemisms of the legislature: “gently laid on the table” or “passed by indefinitely.”</em></p>
<h2><strong>Should parents have to opt in to family life education? </strong></h2>
<p>Under Virginia&#8217;s regulations right now, school divisions can opt out of family life education if they want, and parents can individually opt their children out of the classes if they so choose, too. But Del. David LaRock, R-Loudoun, wants the state to go even further.</p>
<p>He proposed <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+sum+HB2570" target="_blank">legislation</a> that would entirely prohibit an elementary or secondary school student from participating in family life education classes without a parent&#8217;s prior written consent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Numerous studies show that at any income level, any background, when you involve parents, the outcomes are significantly improved,&#8221; LaRock told the Senate Education and Health committee Thursday. &#8220;If they&#8217;re not engaged, I think the effort would be well-placed to bring them into the process and cause them to be engaged.&#8221;</p>
<p>The bill had squeezed through the House on a 50-48 vote.</p>
<p>Some senators during Thursday&#8217;s committee meeting were on board with LaRock&#8217;s idea, including Sens. Dick Black, R-Loudoun, and Amanda Chase, R-Chesterfield.</p>
<p>Black said that, when his son was in seventh grade, he decided to opt him out of the class, a fact that Black said the teacher announced during a presentation.</p>
<p>&#8220;The teacher mocked my son, the entire class mocked my son, and I think this is not unusual,&#8221; he said, adding that he strongly supports the bill.</p>
<p>Chase added that her four children went through public schools and she never received any type of notification that they would be going through the program.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was done without my permission and therefore I think we need this option,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>But most weren&#8217;t convinced, and the bill — which had already failed to report in a Senate subcommittee — was passed by indefinitely.</p>
<p><em>Opposing: Saslaw, Lucas, Howell, Locke, Barker, Petersen, Lewis, Dunnavant, Suetterlein, Peake — 10</em></p>
<p><em>Supporting: Newman, Black, Carrico, Cosgrove, Chase — 5</em></p>
<h2><strong>LGBT housing protections and anti-NIMBY zoning fall into black hole</strong></h2>
<p>Two bills aimed at blocking housing discrimination failed this week when they were never given a committee hearing in the House of Delegates — a black hole many a piece of legislation get sucked into every year. Both had passed the Senate.</p>
<p>One <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/01/22/anti-nimby-legislation-aims-to-clear-path-for-affordable-housing-in-virginia/" target="_blank">aimed</a> to make it easier for affordable housing developments to be built over NIMBY objections by explicitly prohibiting local governments from denying permits because of the expected race or income levels of the residents.</p>
<p>It was sponsored by Sen. Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+sum+SB1062" target="_blank">in the Senate</a> and Del. Jeff Bourne, D-Richmond, in the <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+sum+HB1647" target="_blank">House,</a> who cited a case in Powhatan last year in which the Board of Supervisors rejected a proposal to build 300 apartments after residents worried it would “lay the groundwork for a ghetto.&#8221; (The Board of Supervisors contends its concerns were limited to traffic and zoning.)</p>
<p>A second anti-discrimination measure was intended to provide protections to gay, lesbian and transgender residents renting or buying property. It was patroned by McClellan <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+sum+SB1109" target="_blank">in the Senate</a> and Del. Roxann Robinson, R-Chesterfield <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+sum+HB2677" target="_blank">in the House</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m disappointed,&#8221; McClellan said. &#8220;I think all bills deserve a hearing on the merits and a vote on the merits and you shouldn’t use the subcommittee to bottle things up.&#8221;</p>
<p>The chair of the House General Laws committee that opted against hearing the measure, Del. Chris Peace, R-Hanover, said there just wasn&#8217;t time to hear all of the bills that were referred to his committee.</p>
<p>But he also raised concerns with both measures.</p>
<p>The anti-NIMBY legislation, he said, seemed targeted &#8220;at particular localities, and those localities might be against certain types of development, but never with discriminatory intent.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said he considered the House discrimination bill poorly written, &#8220;but it was sort of all or nothing, so as a result, we&#8217;re just not going to go there.&#8221; He also worried about the scope of the measure. &#8220;When we first started seeing these bills, it was just gay, lesbian and transgendered. Now it&#8217;s questioning, identifying as — all of these things that I think make the litigation questions more complex.&#8221;</p>
<h2><strong>&#8216;Speculative natural gas pipelines&#8217;</strong></h2>
<p>Del. Lee Ware, R-Powhatan, saw <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+sum+HB1718" target="_blank">his bill</a> aimed at shielding ratepayers from the costs of &#8220;speculative natural gas pipelines,&#8221; which had passed the House, go down in the Senate&#8217;s Commerce and Labor Committee, where utility interests hold much sway.</p>
<p>&#8220;I support the use of natural gas and the construction of the pipelines necessary to transport the fuel,&#8221; Ware said.</p>
<p>&#8220;What I don’t want to do is to have ratepayers paying for speculative natural gas pipelines. They should pay for what serves them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ware didn&#8217;t mention Dominion Energy&#8217;s Atlantic Coast Pipeline, which two sitting Federal Energy Regulatory Commissioners have said<a href="https://www.ferc.gov/media/statements-speeches/lafleur/2017/10-13-17-lafleur.asp#.XGnZHuhKiUk" target="_blank"> is not in the public interest</a> and which <a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/virginia/government-politics/dominion-fails-in-attempt-to-bar-testimony-on-pipeline-s/article_fd1b3914-fd12-569e-9c58-77c82a0ab032.html" target="_blank">testimony given to the Virginia State Corporation Commission</a> says could increase bills for  Dominion&#8217;s ratepayers by more than $2 billion.  The pipeline would connect to just two Virginia power plants, as a backup source.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know whether any of the utilities here have built speculative pipelines?&#8221; asked Sen. Dick Saslaw, D-Fairfax.</p>
<p>Ware, who compared the fight over Dominion&#8217;s utility regulatory overhaul last year <a href="https://bluevirginia.us/2018/02/video-del-lee-ware-r-quotes-gimli-from-lord-of-the-rings-calls-for-heroic-fight-against-dominion-bill-and-for-the-little-guy" target="_blank">to the battle against the dark forces of Mordor in &#8220;The Lord of the Rings&#8221;</a> in remarks on the House floor, said he did not.</p>
<p>Though Ware&#8217;s bill managed to unite a Tea Party group, the Virginia Poverty Law Center and the Virginia Attorney General&#8217;s Office of Consumer Counsel in support, it went down on a motion to pass by indefinitely.</p>
<p><em>Opposing — Wagner, Norment, Obenshain, Chafin, Dance, Lucas, McDougle, Black, Sturtevant, Spruill — 10.</em></p>
<p><em>Supporting — Saslaw, Newman, Cosgrove —3</em>.</p>
<h2><strong>Preventing death penalty for mentally ill, protecting student loan borrowers and making Election Day a school holiday</strong></h2>
<p>Other bills that went by the wayside:</p>
<ul>
<li>Protecting <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+sum+SB1137" target="_blank">defendants with severe mental</a> illness from the death penalty.</li>
<li>Requiring student loan servicing companies to be<a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+sum+SB1112" target="_blank"> licensed </a>by the State Corporation Commission.</li>
<li>Finding those who operate a motor vehicle in a careless manner and cause serious injury to a pedestrian or bicyclist <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+sum+SB1550" target="_blank">guilty of a traffic infraction.</a></li>
<li>Making Election Day a <a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/virginia/government-politics/senate-committee-kills-bill-to-make-election-day-a-school/article_c354af1c-38fc-5737-bdf9-fc59fb761eee.html?fbclid=IwAR3Gz-33gbCGNZefnJpU1cNIOWmERw3vq89CEMsiwDdXyJDNU-oxsK3v-Mk" target="_blank">school holiday.</a></li>
<li>Allowing those who claim innocence to argue that <a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/house-subcommittee-kills-junk-science-legislation/article_174292f1-8437-5c8e-b3fc-3e060aa9215d.html" target="_blank">developments in forensic science</a> could clear them of charges.</li>

Siobhan Dunnavant, R-Henrico. (Ned Oliver/ Virginia Mercury)</p><p>Every year, the refrain from Virginia lawmakers about health insurance is the same: It&#8217;s too expensive and prices in the <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/5/8/17330880/democrats-obamacare-premium-rate-increase-chuck-schumer-donald-trump-2018-midterms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">individual market</a> especially are out of control (though they might be <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/11/26/18113313/obamacare-mandate-tax" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stabilizing</a>).</p>
<p>The solutions that seem to gain the most traction are often partisan, like relying on <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+sum+SB1240" target="_blank" rel="noopener">short-term</a> and <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+sum+SB1027" target="_blank" rel="noopener">catastrophic</a> health plans, which are typically cheaper but offer less coverage.</p>
<p>Republicans often like them while Democrats tend to be opposed, though bills submitted this year were supported by both parties in the Senate. They only narrowly passed the House on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Last year, Gov. Ralph Northam vetoed similar legislation, and in an email a spokesperson for his office said he &#8220;remains strongly opposed&#8221; to the bills.</p>
<p>This year, Sen. Siobhan Dunnavant, R-Henrico, is trying something different. She has <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=191&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=sb1717&amp;submit=GO" target="_blank" rel="noopener">floated a big idea</a> that she hopes will garner bipartisan support, offering a solution for those who can&#8217;t afford individual market rates because they don&#8217;t get subsidies, and saving money on coverage for an otherwise expensive population in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>&#8220;This isn&#8217;t a Republican/Democrat conversation,&#8221; she told the Senate Commerce and Labor committee. &#8220;This is a Virginia conversation.&#8221;</p>
<p>The lawmaker and OB/GYN has proposed essentially overhauling Virginia&#8217;s individual market, removing the state from the federally-operated exchanges and creating a new market modeled after employer-sponsored health plans. It&#8217;s a novel idea that no other state has done, she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would like to see Virginia lead on this,&#8221; she said in an interview. &#8220;I think the whole country needs something different.&#8221;</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/8/24/12538934/is-obamacare-failing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Affordable Care Act</a>&#8216;s exchanges were intended to provide affordable coverage to lower-income Americans, but many thought they would be attractive to the middle class as well, possibly even eventually weaning the country off its dominant, employer-sponsored insurance model.</p>
<p>But the population that actually signed up for individual plans was sicker than anticipated, which drove up the costs for insurers and caused some to abandon the market altogether — reducing competition and further increasing costs.</p>
<p>The exchanges have achieved one goal: The uninsured rate nationwide has fallen significantly, from 18 percent before the ACA to 13.7 percent at the end of last year (though it has <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/246134/uninsured-rate-rises-four-year-high.aspx" target="_blank">inched up</a> over the last several years).</p>
<p>But for people who don&#8217;t receive the subsidies on the market, plans can be prohibitively expensive. That&#8217;s why lawmakers, including Dunnavant, have supported policies that would give those people more affordable options outside of the exchanges.</p>
<p>The downside to carving those who don&#8217;t get subsidies out of the market, though, is that they&#8217;re generally healthier and they&#8217;d leave behind people who are sicker and more expensive.</p>
<p>Dunnavant thinks she may have come up with a solution to the multifaceted problems facing the individual market. She submitted legislation that, in its original iteration, would have created the Commonwealth Care Division, which would oversee what she has dubbed the Commonwealth Care Health Benefits Program. The bill has been amended so it now orders the state to conduct a study on the idea.</p>
<p>The program would essentially function like the self-funded health plans that are operated by large employers, which, Dunnavant explained, negotiate separately for the four basic elements of insurance: physician networks, pharmacy benefit managers, reinsurance and third-party administrators.</p>
<p>It would retain the subsidies and cost-sharing reductions that people with low incomes currently get through the exchanges, but it would also include services that are often unique to employer-sponsored plans, like wellness or chronic disease management services.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not reinventing the wheel here,&#8221; Dunnavant said. &#8220;Big business has been doing this for a while. And where do we get our best innovations? Big business.&#8221;</p>
<p>Employer-sponsored plans often have programs that they use to get their members to make healthier choices, promising lower premiums if they participate.</p>
<p>&#8220;They reduce the cost of health care by making people healthier,&#8221; she said. &#8220;This is a way for me to lower the cost of health care because I drill down on making the patients better, and therefore less expensive, but I&#8217;m also improving the population, which is what I&#8217;ve been trying to get at at the same time.&#8221;</p>
<p>In 2018, <a href="https://www.kff.org/health-reform/state-indicator/marketplace-enrollment/?currentTimeframe=1&amp;selectedRows=%7B%22states%22:%7B%22virginia%22:%7B%7D%7D%7D&amp;sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D" target="_blank">400,000 people in Virginia</a> had enrolled in a marketplace plan.</p>
<p>Dunnavant said she doesn&#8217;t think of her legislation as political. She&#8217;s been seeking support from both Republicans and Democrats, speaking to not only fellow senators but the governor&#8217;s administration and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s enough of a spark where they say, &#8216;We have a lot of questions,&#8217; but it doesn&#8217;t start with a no,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Even the Bureau of Insurance, she noted, and the office of the secretary for health and human resource didn&#8217;t say it can&#8217;t be done.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a good starting point,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Marvin Figueroa, deputy secretary of health and human resources, said during a Senate Commerce and Labor Committee meeting that the administration doesn&#8217;t have a position on the legislation, but that it does have concerns about what the program would do to premiums and how it would keep subsidies for low-income Virginians.</p>
<p>A Bureau of Insurance representative added that, while the agency doesn&#8217;t have a position, it has concerns as well, particularly around how the program would operate.</p>
<p>The bill didn&#8217;t get bipartisan support initially, making it through the Committee on Commerce and Labor on a party-line vote. It was then amended to become a Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission study to review the program&#8217;s potential implications.</p>
<p>Dunnavant conceded that it&#8217;s hard to get consensus for a new, big idea, but said she&#8217;s still happy about where the legislation stands because a JLARC report will answer a lot of questions that even she still has about what the program could look like.</p>
<p>The second version of the legislation passed the Senate unanimously. It&#8217;s now waiting to be heard by the House Rules Committee.</p>

(Katie O'Connor/ Virginia Mercury)</p><p>Paulette Trimmer was excited when her 18-year-old son&#8217;s counselor asked her to sit in on a therapy session. She was proud. She thought it was a good sign.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t have a clue that I was going into a den of wolves,&#8221; she told the Virginia Board of Counseling on Friday.</p>
<p>Her son, Adam Trimmer, went through conversion therapy at age 18 after surviving a suicide attempt. His parents were with him in the hospital when his youth pastor — a man the family trusted — approached them and claimed to be able to help their son.</p>
<p>But help translated into conversion therapy and an attempt to change Adam&#8217;s sexual orientation, putting him through emotional and mental trauma that has taken him years to confront, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I grew to despise my parents, especially my mother, who I was being taught to see as an overbearing figure in my life that caused me to develop &#8216;unwanted same-sex attractions,'&#8221; he told the Board of Counseling.</p>
<p>On <a href="http://townhall.virginia.gov/L/GetFile.cfm?File=Meeting\25\28152\Agenda_DHP_28152_v2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Friday</a>, the board decided to issue a guidance document and create regulations prohibiting its licensees from practicing conversion therapy on minors, lest they risk &#8220;a finding of misconduct and disciplinary action&#8221; from the board.</p>
<p>In October, <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/10/08/the-general-assembly-has-consistently-stopped-efforts-to-outlaw-conversion-therapy-but-state-licensing-boards-might-be-able-to-do-it-themselves/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a work group</a> convened by the Department of Health Professions considered actions that its various boards could put in place to ban conversion therapy for those under 18 by a clinician licensed by the state, after several attempts to do so through legislation failed in the General Assembly.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://townhall.virginia.gov/L/GetFile.cfm?File=Meeting\31\28482\Minutes_DHP_28482_v1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Board of Psychology</a> was the first to start the process of banning the practice during a January meeting.</p>
<p>Both boards have decided to issue guidance documents because they typically become effective faster, whereas changing regulations can take 18 to 24 months, said Elaine Yeatts, senior policy analyst for the Department of Health Professions. The guidance documents still must go through a public comment period, though.</p>
<p>Only one member of the Board of Counseling voted against issuing the guidance document. During the meeting, board member Terry Tinsley said he is concerned about the &#8220;labeling&#8221; around the word &#8220;conversion,&#8221; and about &#8220;the impact on the faith community.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the rest of the board disagreed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel like it&#8217;s 30 years overdue,&#8221; said board member John Brendel. Conversion therapy has been <a href="https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2015/04/therapies-sexual-orientation" target="_blank">widely condemned</a> as ineffective and potentially harmful by nearly every medical professional organization.</p>
<p>Tinsley also voted against starting the regulatory process, along with board member Barry Alvarez, who suggested it would be more appropriate for the board to wait until after the guidance document&#8217;s public comment period concluded.</p>
<p>During the Board of Counseling&#8217;s meeting, no one spoke in favor of conversion therapy, while four people described its harmful effects.</p>

(Katie O&#8217;Connor/ Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p>Casey Pick, an Alexandria resident and senior fellow for advocacy and government affairs for The Trevor Project, a national nonprofit aimed at suicide prevention among LGBTQ youth, spoke about her own experiences. She found a conversion therapy website online when she was 14 and &#8220;distressed by the feelings&#8221; she was developing for a female friend.</p>
<p>&#8220;Based on what I found there, I wondered if my parents&#8217; divorce, my mother&#8217;s career or the sports that I played since I was 5 were to blame,&#8221; she said. &#8220;That&#8217;s the evil of conversion therapy: that it not only makes you afraid to love somebody of the same sex, it makes you unable to wholly love or trust anything — your family, your hobbies and most of all yourself.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t change what we never chose.&#8221;</p>
<p>In an emotional testimony, Paulette Trimmer told the board about her experience in that counseling session with her son. The counselor told her: &#8220;This is not about you, this is about what you caused,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>It took a decade for Adam Trimmer to talk to his mom about that experience. Only last year, after watching the film, &#8220;Love, Simon,&#8221; were they able to start the conversation and truly begin mending their relationship.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s always just been the big white elephant in the room for 10 years,&#8221; Adam Trimmer said. &#8220;I got out of conversion therapy and we never really talked about it again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, the two are very close and Paulette and Adam Trimmer are both vocal opponents of conversion therapy. Though the policy change wouldn&#8217;t have affected Trimmer&#8217;s case, since he was 18 at the time, both he and his mother see it as a blow against a dangerous practice.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m really proud of the state of Virginia,&#8221; Adam Trimmer said of the boards&#8217; decisions to ban the therapy among their licensed psychologists and counselors. &#8220;What happened to me has left a lot of scars and a lot of trauma, and I think it&#8217;s important that the mental health community keeps that from happening to the next generation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Definitely,&#8221; his mother added. &#8220;And families.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And families,&#8221; he agreed.</p>

(Katie O'Connor/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>In the middle of a packed committee room in late January, Kara Murdock sat patiently, resting her swollen arm on her leg.</p>
<p>She waited for over an hour while a House Commerce and Labor subcommittee rushed through its lengthy, late-in-the-day agenda so she could tell lawmakers about that arm: That she could lose it, but legislation they were considering might help.</p>
<p>Murdock, 28, is already an amputee. She lost her right hand and forearm when she was 23 due to a blood clot and she&#8217;s been trying, without success, to get a prosthetic. Her health plan turned her down when she was still covered by her parents&#8217; insurance, and she eagerly awaited Medicaid expansion so she could get covered.</p>
<p>Now she has Medicaid, and while she&#8217;s still waiting to select a health plan, she should be able to choose one that covers prosthetic devices. But she returned to the General Assembly this year to advocate for people like her, because if she doesn&#8217;t get a prosthetic she could lose both arms.</p>
<p>Del. Danica Roem, D-Prince William, re-introduced <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+sum+HB2669" target="_blank" rel="noopener">legislation</a> this session that would require all health plans operating in Virginia, including Medicaid plans, to cover prosthetic devices.</p>
<p>&#8220;The bill could not only save my arm, but it could save me a lot of emotional pain having to go through this amputation process all over again,&#8221; Murdock told the subcommittee.</p>
<p>Last year, a similar bill was left in House Commerce and Labor, but this year&#8217;s iteration had co-patrons from both chambers. It was sent to the Health Insurance Reform Commission, where all new mandates must go to be studied before the General Assembly can pass them.</p>
<p>For Roem and Murdock, that&#8217;s a win.</p>
<p>&#8220;The fact that it&#8217;s going to the Health Insurance Reform Commission keeps it alive,&#8221; Roem said. &#8220;That keeps it in better condition than we were in at this point last year. That is clearly a good thing, that is progress. This time, we have hope.&#8221;</p>
<p>When she comes back in 2020, pending the results of the November election (&#8220;I&#8217;ll be back,&#8221; Roem added), she intends to pick up the legislation again.</p>
<p>Since her amputation, Murdock has faced a slew of other health challenges. She&#8217;s been through over a dozen surgeries and suffered from an addiction to painkillers. And now she could lose her remaining arm, which is often painfully swollen.</p>
<p>&#8220;We went to my vascular surgeon and they basically told me: &#8216;You need to use that arm less, you&#8217;re overcompensating,'&#8221; she said. &#8220;But what am I supposed to do? A simple thing like taking a shower can make it that it&#8217;s so swollen that I can&#8217;t pull my socks on. Fine dexterity does not exist.&#8221;</p>
<p>Doug Gray, executive director with the Association of Health Plans, said that the Health Insurance Reform Commission needs to study the bill to determine &#8220;what&#8217;s appropriate and what&#8217;s not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The shortfall with the prosthetics bill is it requires every prosthetic device to be covered regardless of cost,&#8221; he said. &#8220;So if someone wants the $150,000 computer-run prosthetic when a $50,000 one would do — that&#8217;s something that needs to be managed, you can&#8217;t just say &#8216;we&#8217;ll cover anything.'&#8221;</p>
<p>Roem pointed out that the bill would only require health plans cover the devices when a doctor confirms they are medically necessary.</p>
<p>&#8220;This bill would in no way interfere with the doctor-patient relationship,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It would just simply say that if the doctor decides that they need a mechanical prosthetic device, that her health insurance provider would have to cover it. That&#8217;s the important part. It&#8217;s not mandating that every amputee is going to get one.&#8221;</p>
<p>Murdock, a Manassas resident and one of Roem&#8217;s constituents, said she is more hopeful than she was last year that the legislation could become law.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m surprised, and very happy,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>She talks about getting a prosthetic hand with relish, as though she cherishes just the idea of it.</p>
<p>&#8220;The prosthetic I&#8217;m looking for is a BeBionic 3,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You&#8217;ve got 33 pounds of grip force and you can bear 99 pounds on the fingertips.&#8221;</p>
<p>She called it &#8220;a proper hand.&#8221;</p>

Tommy Norment, R-James City.</p><p>Senate Majority Leader Tommy Norment, R-James City, issued a testy statement Thursday after The Virginian-Pilot reported that <a href="https://pilotonline.com/news/government/politics/virginia/article_d4ce7700-2ae3-11e9-ace9-ff7814740140.html" target="_blank">Norment oversaw production</a> of the 1968 Virginia Military Institute yearbook, &#8220;The Bomb,&#8221; which included blackface photos and racial slurs.</p>
<p>&#8220;With 114 editions of The Bomb available online dating back to 1885, I am not surprised that those wanting to engulf Republican leaders in the current situations involving the governor, lieutenant governor, and attorney general would highlight the yearbook from my graduation a half century ago,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Norment said he was one of seven editors working on the yearbook and that he was not in any of the racist photos, nor did he take any of them.</p>
<p class="m_-3799087823747634071m_8400912979205357483gmail-MsoBodyText">&#8220;The use of blackface is abhorrent in our society and I emphatically condemn it,&#8221; Norment said. &#8220;As one of seven working on a 359-page yearbook, I cannot endorse or associate myself with every photo, entry, or word on each page.&#8221;</p>
<p>Norment said supported the integration of VMI and, in 1997, &#8220;led the effort to have my alma mater include women for the first time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Following the revelation of a racist image on Gov. Ralph Northam&#8217;s medical school yearbook page last week, House Republicans <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/house-republicans-also-call-on-northam-to-step-down/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">called on the governor to resign</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;While we respect the governor’s lifetime of service, his ability to lead and govern is permanently impaired and the interests of the commonwealth necessitate his resignation,&#8221; House Speaker Kirk Cox, R-Colonial Heights, Majority Leader Todd Gilbert, R-Shenandoah, and other GOP leaders said in a statement.</p>
<p>Since then, Attorney General Mark Herring<a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/02/06/attorney-general-mark-herring-says-he-wore-blackface-in-college/" target="_blank"> has admitted</a> wearing blackface and <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/02/06/democrats-on-fairfax-allegation-facts-here-are-still-being-determined/" target="_blank">a sexual assault allegation</a> against Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax has surfaced, casting a cloud of uncertainty over the state&#8217;s top-three elected officials, all Democrats.</p>
<p>Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, was asked if Virginia&#8217;s political turmoil might hurt Democrats nationwide.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it does not,&#8221; she said. &#8220;The Virginians will resolve their issues that they have there. It&#8217;s sad because they have some very talented leaders there. But they have to have the confidence of the legislature that they have to work with. But I&#8217;ll leave that up to them. I have enough to do here without getting involved in the affairs of Virginia.&#8221;</p>

Lee,  director of the Virginia  Department of Medical Assistance Services. (Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>As the House of Delegates prepares to consider adding a brand new agency with oversight over Virginia&#8217;s Medicaid forecasting in response to an unexpected half-a-billion dollar bill, the department currently responsible for Medicaid expenses is trying to fix problems its own way.</p>
<p>The Department of Medical Assistance Services has hired Milliman, a Seattle-based actuarial and consulting firm, to &#8220;conduct a top-to-bottom review of the agency&#8217;s forecasting and rate-setting processes over 60 days,&#8221; according to a news release.</p>
<p>In November, DMAS told lawmakers that the state would have to pay an unexpected <a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/virginia/government-politics/virginia-s-medicaid-costs-soar-by-million---but/article_7049a3bf-4a9a-5a06-965f-17bb74e0076e.html" target="_blank">$462.5 million</a> in the biennium budget due, in part, to forecasting miscalculations.</p>
<p>The surprise bill frustrated some lawmakers, particularly Sen. Ryan McDougle, R-Hanover, who has submitted <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+sum+SB1352" target="_blank" rel="noopener">legislation</a> this session that would create an independent state agency responsible for overseeing Medicaid forecasting and expenditure. The bill <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/senate-votes-to-create-new-state-agency-to-oversee-medicaid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">squeezed through the Senate</a> earlier this week.</p>
<p>During committee hearings, some Democrats raised concerns over McDougle&#8217;s proposal, pointing to the plan DMAS already has in place to improve its forecasting.</p>
<p>Sen. Janet Howell, D-Fairfax, argued that the legislation is premature and that DMAS should have the opportunity to correct the errors first.</p>
<p>Hiring an auditor is one of the steps that DMAS&#8217; director, Dr. Jennifer Lee, has outlined to address the forecasting problems. Milliman has worked with 20 other state Medicaid agencies and will compare Virginia&#8217;s processes against those used in at least five other states, &#8220;as well as internationally recognized best practices,&#8221; the news release states.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our agency is taking swift and decisive action to ensure that we have a sound financial structure in place to guide budgetary decisions,&#8221; Lee said in the release.</p>
<p>Milliman is due to lead the &#8220;comprehensive review&#8221; in early April, with a final report due later that month. The auditor&#8217;s recommendations will then be implemented by a new &#8220;internal cross-agency financial review unit,&#8221; according to the release run by the department&#8217;s new chief financial officer, Chris Gordon, who formerly worked for the Department of Health.</p>
<p>The new unit will be &#8220;responsible for continuous monitoring of the agency&#8217;s forecasting and rate-setting procedures to provide real-time evaluations of each step in the decision-making process and advanced notion of necessary adjustments,&#8221; the release states.</p>

<p>Herring said that in 1980, when he was a 19-year-old undergraduate, he and his friends &#8220;dressed up and put on wigs and brown makeup&#8221; to impersonate rappers they listened to at the time.</p>
<p>&#8220;This was a onetime occurrence and I accept full responsibility for my conduct,&#8221; Herring states. &#8220;That I have contributed to the pain Virginians have felt this week is the greatest shame I have ever felt.&#8221;</p>
<p>Herring attended the University of Virginia for both his bachelor&#8217;s and master&#8217;s degrees.</p>
<p>Del. Joseph Lindsey, D-Norfolk, one of the members of the Legislative Black Caucus who met with Herring this morning, says Herring essentially just relayed what was in his statement. Lindsey&#8217;s reaction?</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m too old to react,&#8221; he said. He says he&#8217;s &#8220;taking a measured approach.&#8221;</p>
<p>The admission comes during a turbulent week for the state — just five days after Gov. Ralph Northam also admitted to <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/02/02/in-his-own-words-northam-describes-moonwalking-in-blackface-denies-appearing-in-kkk-photo/" target="_blank">dressing in blackface</a> to impersonate Michael Jackson in 1984 following a <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/02/02/northam-will-not-resign-dems-say-despite-losing-their-support-reports-he-thinks-racist-photo-isnt-of-him/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">public outcry for his resignation</a> due to a racist photo on his medical school yearbook page. Northam initially apologized for appearing in the photo but now says it wasn&#8217;t him.</p>
<p>Herring had called on Northam to resign<a href="https://www.oag.state.va.us/media-center/news-releases/1383-february-2-2019-statement-of-attorney-general-mark-r-herring" target="_blank"> just days ago</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the days ahead, honest conversations and discussions will make it clear whether I can or should continue to serve as attorney general, but no matter where we go from here, I will say that from the bottom of my heart, I am deeply, deeply sorry for the pain that I cause with this revelation,&#8221; Herring said.</p>
<p>And to deepen the turmoil further, earlier in the week Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax, who would take over as governor should Northam resign, <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/02/06/democrats-on-fairfax-allegation-facts-here-are-still-being-determined/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was accused of sexually assaulting a woman</a> in 2004.</p>

																						<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-size:12px;"></p><p>After hours of back-and-forth testimony in both House and Senate committees, in which lawmakers and lobbyists alike argued over four bills dealing with balance billing, only one clawed its way out of the chaos and passed a chamber on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Senate unanimously passed <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+sum+SB1763" target="_blank" rel="noopener">legislation</a> sponsored by Sen. Glen Sturtevant, R-Richmond, which would <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/01/18/lawmakers-asked-insurers-and-doctors-to-find-a-solution-on-balance-billing-they-didnt-and-neither-have-lawmakers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">end the practice of balance billing</a> — when a patient gets an unexpected bill because a doctor or other provider they thought was in their health plan&#8217;s network actually wasn&#8217;t covered.</p>
<p>Sturtevant&#8217;s was the only one aimed at emergency situations that survived. Each piece of legislation would do the same thing: take the patient out of the equation in cases of emergencies. But that seemed to be the only aspect of the problem everyone could agree on, as the hospitals and doctors&#8217; groups were left arguing over who would take the bigger financial hit.</p>
<p>The bills sponsored by Sturtevant and Del. R. Lee Ware, R-Powhatan, were backed by provider groups. Under those bills, the doctors would be paid based on the average of similar payments in their region.</p>
<p>Sean Connaughton, president and CEO of the Virginia Hospital and Healthcare Association, said in a statement that the health care community sought a solution &#8220;that protects patients from being caught in the middle when health insurers refuse to pay legitimate claims arising from out-of-network emergency medical care.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In an emergency department, we can&#8217;t say we won&#8217;t see these patients, and because of that there&#8217;s no incentive for the insurance companies to negotiate,&#8221; said Dr. Todd Parker, an emergency physician with Riverside Health System who sits on the Virginia College of Emergency Physicians board.</p>
<p>But health plans pushed back, contending that those bills would mean the doctors are paid more and give them an incentive to leave the networks.</p>
<p>They supported two other bills, filed by Del. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+sum+HB2543" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kathy Byron</a>, R-Bedford and Sen. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+sum+SB1360" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Frank Wagner</a>, R-Virginia Beach, which would have paid the doctors based on the average rate that the insurance company has already negotiated with other providers.</p>
<p>Lawmakers sided with the doctors, but Ware&#8217;s bill ended up in House Appropriations on Friday, and wasn&#8217;t added to the docket in time to reach the floor.</p>
<p>The Senate passed Sturtevant&#8217;s bill unanimously, but its future is not only dependent on action in the House, but on the budget as well. It has an <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+amd+SB1763AS" target="_blank" rel="noopener">amendment</a> requiring that funding for the legislation be included in the budget bill.</p>
<p>According to the bill&#8217;s <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+oth+SB1763F122+PDF" target="_blank" rel="noopener">impact statement</a>, it has an &#8220;indeterminate&#8221; financial impact, and it &#8220;could potentially have a substantial fiscal impact on the state employee health plan.&#8221;</p>
<p>Doug Gray, the executive director of the Virginia Association of Health Plans, argued that the amendment essentially means the bill isn&#8217;t going forward.</p>
<p>&#8220;The bottom line is that the providers asked for a payment that is higher than they would have received in network,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This would have caused the state to pay way more for their services, so clearly the bill is not ready to go at this point.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sen. John Cosgrove, R-Chesapeake, explained on the Senate floor that he and Sen. Lionell Spruill, D-Chesapeake, voted against sending the bill to the Senate Finance committee because they worried it would get that amendment.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a good bill, our &#8216;no&#8217; votes were directed to the sending of this bill to the dreaded Finance Committee,&#8221; Cosgrove said. &#8220;The clause is on the bill, so we anxiously await the final budget to see the language is in the budget so this bill can become law.&#8221;</p>

Ryan McDougle, R-Hanover. (Ned Oliver/ Virginia Mercury)</p><p>The unexpected half-a-billion dollar<a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/virginia/government-politics/virginia-s-medicaid-costs-soar-by-million---but/article_7049a3bf-4a9a-5a06-965f-17bb74e0076e.html" target="_blank"> bill</a> that landed on lawmakers&#8217; desks in November has inspired some senators to take a big step to stop it from happening again.</p>
<p>Sen. Ryan McDougle, R-Hanover, submitted <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+sum+SB1352" target="_blank" rel="noopener">legislation</a> this year that would <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/01/11/medicaid-will-cost-virginia-half-a-billion-dollars-more-than-expected-over-the-next-two-years-how-should-the-state-fix-its-forecasting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">create a brand new state agency</a> with the sole responsibility of overseeing the expenditures and forecasting of the state&#8217;s Medicaid program, which is run by the Department of Medical Assistance Services.</p>
<p>On Tuesday the bill squeezed through the Senate on a 22-18 vote and heads to the House of Delegates.</p>
<p>&#8220;This does not create new positions, this takes positions out of one agency, puts them in a new agency where they will be independent,&#8221; McDougle said on the Senate floor, adding that the agency will be required to report its findings and trends to the legislature and the public.</p>
<p>He noted that responsibility for the $462.5 million Medicaid shortfall — related to forecasting and not Medicaid expansion — does not rest with the current DMAS staff.</p>
<p>&#8220;The individuals currently in the department now are taking some tremendous steps forward,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But to ensure that systemically we don&#8217;t have this situation again we need to make sure we have an independent agency that is consistent and reliable.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sen. J. Chapman Petersen, D-Fairfax City, asked McDougle some pointed questions, including if McDougle is &#8220;a believer in small government?&#8221; and &#8220;Would you agree the growth of government is a problem?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t meant to tease my fellow member of the 2001 class in the House of Delegates,&#8221; Petersen said, adding that he acknowledges there were mistakes in the Medicaid forecast but questioning if a new agency is the solution.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is this how we solve problems, we create more state agencies? Or do we more efficiently utilize our existing agencies? I think we more efficiently utilize our existing agencies.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sen. William DeSteph, R-Virginia Beach, came to McDougle&#8217;s defense.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is what happens when you underestimate actuarial liabilities to overestimate savings,&#8221; he said. &#8220;When you mislead individuals, you have to have oversight, and I support this bill.&#8221;</p>

<p><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+sum+SB1402" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Legislation</a> sponsored by Sen. J. Chapman Petersen, D-Fairfax City, would require a vertically-integrated health carrier — health plans that also own hospitals — to allow public hospitals to participate in its network.</p>
<p>The bill addresses a problem raised by Chesapeake Regional Medical Center, which contends that it is unfair that the health plan Optima, which is owned by Sentara Healthcare, does not cover all the services Chesapeake offers as in-network. Optima argues that it does include Chesapeake in its network, just not services and entities for which  Chesapeake isn&#8217;t the primary owner.</p>
<p>Last year, similar legislation passed the Senate but was tabled in the House and sent to the Health Insurance Reform Commission to be studied. During a commission meeting in October, Reese Jackson, Chesapeake&#8217;s CEO, argued that, &#8220;Sentara Healthcare is creating a clear and present danger to public interests,&#8221; according to a <a href="http://leg5.state.va.us/User_db/frmView.aspx?ViewId=5330" target="_blank" rel="noopener">meeting summary</a>.</p>
<p>But Michael Gentry, Sentara&#8217;s senior vice-president and chief operating officer, claimed that vertically integrated systems are better able to improve the health of their community, and that forcing one group to accept another into its network doesn&#8217;t have a track record of working.</p>
<p>The argument found its way onto the Senate floor on Monday, with some claiming that the General Assembly needs to support the small players like Chesapeake, and others arguing that lawmakers would just be impeding on a health plan&#8217;s ability to negotiate its networks.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re saying Sentara can&#8217;t own everything,&#8221; said Sen. Lionell Spruill, D-Chesapeake. &#8220;I ask you to help this small hospital to stay alive and not allow the big fish to take it over.&#8221;</p>
<p>Others brought up the fact that Sentara and Chesapeake actually agreed to a four-year contract just before session started.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe that this bill addresses a significant issue and something we need to deal with in the commonwealth, but we need to deal with it more broadly than what this bill does,&#8221; said Sen. George Barker, D-Fairfax, as he spoke against the bill. &#8220;We have time to get it right and have it broadly apply across the health system.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Certificate of Public Need, or COPN, program, which has <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/01/08/the-story-behind-the-certificate-of-need-what-it-is-why-it-exists-and-why-it-has-been-a-thorn-in-virginias-side-for-decades/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">long haunted</a> the Virginia legislature, came up in the debate. COPN opponents hold that the program unfairly creates monopolies within Virginia&#8217;s health care landscape.</p>
<p>Petersen argued that in over a decade as a senator, every time he&#8217;s heard a bill on hospital reform, the response is that the legislature shouldn&#8217;t enact a single improvement because the state needs &#8220;comprehensive&#8221; reform.</p>
<p>&#8220;Progressives, don&#8217;t we like to say &#8216;think globally, act locally&#8217;?&#8221; he said. &#8220;Okay, well, this is our chance. We can do something locally while taking a stand and saying monopolies should not be encouraged in health care.&#8221;</p>
<p>The bill passed on a 24-14 vote, though it may be heading to the chopping block in the House, where not only did similar legislation die last year, but a <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+sum+HB2202" target="_blank" rel="noopener">similar bill</a> sponsored by Del. Terry Kilgore, R-Scott, was killed in committee earlier this session.</p>

<p><em>Every week, we’ll bring you a sampling of the legislation left on the cutting room floor, either failing to report or done in by other genteel euphemisms of the legislature: “gently laid on the table” or “passed by indefinitely.”</em></p>
<h2><strong>Regulating hemp </strong></h2>
<p>Sen. David Marsden, D-Fairfax, is concerned that there are few regulations over hemp products like oils, creams and additives that have found their way onto wellness store shelves.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are really no controls over what&#8217;s in the final product,&#8221; he told a Senate Education and Health subcommittee last week.</p>
<p>But his fellow senators didn&#8217;t agree after an outpouring of opposition from farmers and entrepreneurs. The committee voted down his proposed regulatory <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=191&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=sb1057" target="_blank" rel="noopener">legislation</a> on an <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+vot+S04V0149+SB1057" target="_blank" rel="noopener">11-4 vote</a>.</p>
<p>During a subcommittee meeting, farmers came out in force to argue that the bill would prohibit them from taking advantage of the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-hemp/u-s-farm-bill-opens-door-on-hemp-fda-to-consider-new-cannabis-policy-idUSKCN1OK08R" target="_blank" rel="noopener">federal changes</a> to growing hemp. And some entrepreneurs argued that hemp products have already improved their lives and those of their customers.</p>
<p>&#8220;What you&#8217;re doing is putting Virginia growers at a huge competitive disadvantage,&#8221; said Martha Moore, a Virginia Farm Bureau representative.</p>
<p><em>Opposing: Newman, Lucas, Barker, Black, Carrico, Petersen, Lewis, Dunnavant, Chase, Suetterlein, Peake. —11.</em></p>
<p><em>Supporting: Saslaw, Howell, Locke, Cosgrove — 4.</em></p>
<h2><strong>Definition of sweet treats not needed, lawmakers decide</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For at least one more year, the Alcoholic Beverage Control Authority won’t have clarity on what a “confectionery” is. </span><a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=191&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb2013" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Chris Peace, R-Hanover, wanted to add a definition to the Alcoholic Beverage Control Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which includes definitions of various places and alcoholic beverages.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Peace wanted to add a definition of confectionery to mean sweet foods, like baked goods, candies, jams, jellies, puddings, ice creams, sorbets and yogurts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A General Laws subcommittee agreed unanimously to lay it on the table.</span></p>
<p><em>Opposing: Knight, Gilbert, Leftwich, Morefield, Miyares, Torian, Aird, Jones, J.C. —8.</em></p>
<h2><strong>Campaign finance and election bills fall</strong></h2>
<p><a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=191&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=sb1281" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. George Barker, D-Alexandria, wanted to loosen some voter ID requirements</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and allow an expired driver’s license be considered an acceptable form of identification when voting. It was passed by indefinitely along party lines in the Senate Privileges and Elections committee.</span></p>
<p><em>Opposing: Vogel, Reeves, Chafin, DeSteph, Chase, Ruff, Cosgrove, Peake — 8.</em></p>
<p><em>Supporting: Howell, Deeds, Edwards, Ebbin, Dance, Spruill —6.</em></p>
<p>And in the realm of campaign finance, two proposals from Sen. Chap Peterson, D-Fairfax, failed in committee this week. <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=191&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=sb1114" target="_blank">One would have banned</a> politicians from accepting or soliciting donations from a public service corporation, like a utility, which comes as Dominion Energy&#8217;s <a href="https://wtop.com/virginia/2019/01/virginia-investor-bills-tries-to-curb-dominion-energys-influence/" target="_blank">influence on Virginia&#8217;s politics</a> is under mounting scrutiny.</p>
<p><em>Opposing: Vogel, Reeves, Chafin, DeSteph, Chase, Ruff, Cosgrove, Peake — 8.</em></p>
<p><em>Supporting: Howell, Deeds, Edwards, Ebbin, Dance, Spruill — 6.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=191&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=sb1146" target="_blank">Another would have capped campaign contributions at $10,000</a> per candidate over the course of a given primary and general election cycle. That one was endorsed by Gov. Ralph Northam and failed 11-3.</p>
<p><em>Supporting: Deeds, Edwards, Ebbin — 3.</em></p>
<p><em>Opposing: Vogel, Howell, Reeves, Chafin, DeSteph, Chase, Ruff, Cosgrove, Dance, Spruill, Peake —11.</em></p>
<h2><strong>Paid parental leave, children&#8217;s ombudsman and non-compete clauses</strong></h2>
<p>Other bills that went by the wayside:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?181+sum+HB710" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Funding the Office of the Children&#8217;s Ombudsman</a>, which was part of the <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/01/16/virginias-foster-care-system-has-needed-reform-for-decades-will-a-new-effort-last-long-enough-to-really-make-a-difference/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">massive foster care reform effort. </a></li>
<li>Creating a tax credit for <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=191&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=sb1376&amp;submit=GO" target="_blank">paid parental leave</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=191&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=HB1792" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Banning non-compete</a> clauses for low-wage workers.</li>

<p>She’s a transgender woman, but her plan lists her as a man. That’s because, as she gets older, she may need to access prostate health services that are only available to men. Yet she might also need breast health services — which wouldn’t be available to her if she remains listed as a man.</p>
<p>“Quite frankly, this is an issue that endangers my life, because I cannot have access to the necessary services,” she said.</p>
<p>She made her case to the Senate Commerce and Labor Committee Thursday, as legislators considered <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+sum+SB1287" target="_blank">a bill</a> by Sen. George L. Barker, D-Fairfax, that would prohibit a health plan from denying coverage that they’d otherwise provide because a person’s sex assigned at birth or gender identity is different from &#8220;the one to which such health services are ordinarily or exclusively available,&#8221; a summary of the legislation reads.</p>
<p>Afton Bradley, a clinical care coordinator for the Virginia League for Planned Parenthood, said there have been several barriers to transgender individuals accessing the health care they need. The Affordable Care Act addressed some — like transgender people not being able to get insurance in the first place — but not all.</p>
<p>“There are a lot of medical and mental health-related services that are medically necessary for transgender individuals who experience gender dysphoria but often health plans don’t provide coverage for medically necessary procedures,” Bradley said.</p>
<p>The same problems that Barwick is facing would affect transgender men who still need to access women&#8217;s health services like pap smears. If they&#8217;re listed as men, their insurance won&#8217;t cover it.</p>
<p>Advocates like Bradley and Barwick don’t think insurance decisions should be made based on the basis of sex. If someone needs prostate health services, Barwick argues, they should just be able to get them, as well as breast health services, regardless of their registered gender.</p>
<p>Bradley says many transgender individuals also face barriers in accessing mental health because some insurers won’t reimburse if a clinician is treating gender dysphoria.</p>
<p>The legislation, which was carried in the House by Del. Debra Rodman, D-Henrico, would also prohibit health plans from discriminating in general against transgender individuals.</p>
<p>This week, both Rodman and Barker asked for their bills to be struck because, as Rodman told the House Commerce and Labor Committee, there is “peace in the valley,” and the state health plans agreed to create a work group and come to a solution between General Assembly sessions.</p>
<p>Barwick said she wished the bills had gone further, but that she’s not surprised by the decision.</p>
<p>“We have to count this as a win,” she said.</p>

Kathy Tran, D-Fairfax, looks on during the House floor session on Wednesday. (Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>A partisan debate fueled by election-year ferocity reared up in Virginia&#8217;s House of Delegates on Wednesday over legislation related to late-term abortions when a mother&#8217;s life or health is in danger — a practice that is already legal in Virginia under certain circumstances.</p>
<p>A video of Del. Kathy Tran, D-Fairfax, responding to a line of questioning from Del. Todd Gilbert, R-Shenandoah, during a subcommittee hearing on Monday has gone viral on social media and was picked up by some conservative media outlets, including Breitbart and the<a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/virginia-bill-would-legalize-abortion-up-to-birth/" target="_blank"> National Review</a>, which claimed, &#8220;Virginia Bill Would Legalize Abortions Up to Birth.&#8221;</p>
<p>The furor grew so intense that on Wednesday afternoon Tran was accompanied by security detail because she&#8217;s received &#8220;some intense, intense feedback,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Joseph Macenka, a Capitol Police spokesman, said officers &#8220;respond any time a member of the General Assembly expresses safety concerns, as is the case with Delegate Tran.&#8221;</p>
<p>Macenka wouldn&#8217;t comment on any specific threats.</p>
<p>&#8220;We won&#8217;t get into that other than to say abortion is a very emotional issue,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>In the video, Tran acknowledges that <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+sum+HB2491" target="_blank">her bill</a>, which was killed on a 5-3 vote, would allow a woman to receive an abortion even up to the point when she is about to give birth. The Virginia House GOP <a href="https://twitter.com/vahousegop/status/1090346857925144576" target="_blank">tweeted </a>that the legislation would &#8220;provide abortions up to just seconds before that precious child takes their first breath.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title18.2/chapter4/section18.2-74/" target="_blank">Virginia state code</a> already allows third-trimester abortions in certain instances.</p>
<p>Right now, a doctor can terminate a pregnancy after the second trimester if three doctors certify that &#8220;the continuation of the pregnancy is likely to result in the death of the woman or substantially and irremediably impair the mental or physical health of the woman.&#8221;</p>
<p>State code also requires that there be life support for the &#8220;product&#8221; of the abortion in case &#8220;there is clearly visible evidence of viability.&#8221;</p>
<p>Those provisions have survived despite Republicans being the most recent party to hold both the governor&#8217;s office and a majority in both chambers of the General Assembly.</p>
<p>Tran&#8217;s bill sought to change the requirement that a woman receive certification from three doctors to just one and<a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+ful+HB2491+pdf" target="_blank"> removes the &#8220;substantially and irremediably&#8221; language</a> from the state code.</p>
<p>When a woman is on the brink of labor, the pregnancy would not be aborted, she would simply be allowed to deliver, said Dr. Sara Imershein, an OB/GYN in Falls Church who sits on the board of NARAL Pro-Choice American Foundation.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know of any situation like that, where there&#8217;s a viable pregnancy and a woman&#8217;s in labor and asking for her pregnancy to be stopped at that point,&#8221; she said. &#8220;At that point, she would just be allowed to deliver.&#8221;</p>
<p>She pointed out that 91 percent of abortions occur at 12 weeks or earlier, and most of the remaining nine percent occur in the second trimester.</p>
<p>Before the line of questioning from Gilbert began, Tran had <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX6VLZWogVo&amp;list=PL1nKff77-MZ0Dc81JnpNd1XY378sGNpaO&amp;index=93&amp;t=0s" target="_blank">expanded on her legislation and explained</a> why she wanted to remove the requirement that a woman get certification from three doctors, though that explanation did not make it into the viral clip.</p>
<p>&#8220;At this point in the pregnancy, the majority of these women are — they desire this pregnancy, they’re looking forward to completing it, but there’s usually a medical condition that has arisen for the women or for the pregnancy itself,&#8221; she told the committee. &#8220;So this is a conversation that she would have with her doctor about this. We don’t believe that additional doctors are required to say that this would be necessary.&#8221;</p>
<p>Virginia has seen <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?171+sum+HB1473" target="_blank">legislation</a> in the past — most recently in 2017 — that would outlaw abortions after 20 weeks, except in cases when the mother&#8217;s life is at risk, but it failed to make it to the floor.</p>
<p>But the fact that third-trimester abortions are already legal in Virginia if the mother&#8217;s life is in danger didn&#8217;t stop delegates from taking to the floor of House Wednesday to emotionally declare their positions on the debate.</p>
<p>Speaker of the House Kirk Cox, R-Colonial Heights, said the number of abortions that have taken place since the Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision (more than 61 million, he claimed) keeps him up at night.</p>
<p>Del. Scott Garrett, R-Lynchburg, who is also a physician, teared up as he talked about the seemingly minuscule medical complications that could have made abortion feasible before his son was born, adding, &#8220;I&#8217;m not going to let anyone take the life of my son.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Del. Eileen Filler-Corn, D-Fairfax, said the Republicans have led an &#8220;orchestrated ambush,&#8221; and have been deliberately mischaracterizing the legislation on social media, as well as what the current law in Virginia is.</p>
<p>&#8220;What was the result? Ongoing harassment, intimidation against the patron, several members of this body, their families and their children,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Kathryn Gilley, a spokeswoman for Virginia House Democrats, said Tran wasn&#8217;t prepared &#8220;to respond to the mischaracterizations of her bill,&#8221; during the subcommittee meeting. Rather, Tran was only prepared to talk about what her legislation would actually do.</p>
<p>&#8220;But they haven’t turned it into that, they turned it into this partisan attack,&#8221; Gilley said. &#8220;It’s basically a campaign tactic that they are pulling in the middle of the GA session.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gilbert spoke during the House floor session on Wednesday and called Tran&#8217;s comments during the subcommittee, &#8220;a moment of unbridled honesty,&#8221; about the Democratic agenda.</p>
<p>&#8220;What this bill did was remove any meaningful limitations on the right to an abortion up until the moment of birth,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s not just the legislation, it’s the idea of how they view human life,&#8221; said John Findlay, executive director of the Republican Party of Virginia.</p>
<p>Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam, a pediatric neurologist, was also pulled into the maelstrom, with prominent conservative politicians blasting comments he made in <a href="https://wtop.com/" target="_blank">WTOP&#8217;s &#8220;Ask the Governor&#8221; segment</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s done in cases where there may be severe deformities, there may be a fetus that&#8217;s nonviable,&#8221; Northam said. &#8220;The infant would be delivered, the infant would be kept comfortable, the infant would be resuscitated if that&#8217;s what the mother and the family desired and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother.&#8221;</p>
<p>Northam added that Tran&#8217;s bill was &#8220;really blown out of proportion&#8221; and added that he thought multiple doctors should be consulted instead of just one.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want the government not be to involved in these types of decisions,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We want the decision to be made by the mothers and their providers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Northam&#8217;s spokeswoman, Ofirah Yheskel, told <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/va-gov-northam-faces-backlash-over-no-limits-abortion-bill/2019/01/30/c5e13cd8-24c0-11e9-90cd-dedb0c92dc17_story.html?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.1d6316dcf17d" target="_blank">The Washington Post</a> that Republicans were twisting his words.</p>
<p>&#8220;No woman seeks a third trimester abortion except in the case of tragic or difficult circumstances, such as a nonviable pregnancy or in the event of severe fetal abnormalities, and the governor’s comments were limited to the actions physicians would take in the event that a woman in those circumstances went into labor,” she said.</p>

<p><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+sum+HB1730" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A bill</a> sponsored by Del. Emily Brewer, R-Suffolk, is aiming to eliminate that problem by freezing the youths&#8217; credit report or record once they&#8217;ve been in foster care for at least six months to prevent identity theft.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unfortunately, there are 5-year-olds that have five-year credit histories,&#8221; Brewer told the House Appropriations Health and Human Resources subcommittee on Monday. &#8220;They&#8217;re aging out of foster care and their credit&#8217;s destroyed before they get a chance to kind of get moving.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nationally, about 10 percent of kids in foster care are affected, Carl Ayers, director of family services with the Department of Social Services, told the subcommittee. Virginia&#8217;s rates are about the same, meaning about 300 kids in the state annually have their credit information compromised.</p>
<p>The subcommittee voted unanimously to pass the bill on Monday, after it had already received the stamp of approval from the Committee on Commerce and Labor. Now it must get past the full Appropriations committee before it lands on the House floor.</p>
<p>The bill is part of the package of legislation aimed at <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/01/16/virginias-foster-care-system-has-needed-reform-for-decades-will-a-new-effort-last-long-enough-to-really-make-a-difference/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">improving Virginia&#8217;s foster care system</a>.</p>

<p><em>Every week, we&#8217;ll bring you a sampling of the legislation left on the cutting room floor, either failing to report or done in by other genteel euphemisms of the legislature: &#8220;gently laid on the table&#8221; or &#8220;passed by indefinitely.&#8221;</em></p>
<h2><strong>&#8216;It never squealed:&#8217; Delegate seeks truth in meat labeling</strong></h2>
<p>Lab-grown meat is getting closer and closer to store shelves, and Del. Michael Webert, a cattle-farmer from Fauquier County, is not here for it.</p>
<p>With the support of the Virginia Cattlemen’s Association, the Farm Bureau and pretty much every other farm-group in the state, he proposed <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+sum+HB2274" target="_blank">legislation</a> that would require such products to be prominently labeled as imitations of the real thing.</p>
<p>“You’ve got, for lack of a better term, a laboratory piece of protein that they then want to label as meat, a steak, prime rib,” he said.</p>
<p>His colleagues on a House of Delegates subcommittee dealing with agriculture sounded sympathetic to the issues that might arise — “It is a pork product because it is made from pork cells, but it never squealed,” mused Del. Robert Orrock, R-Caroline, — but the measure was unanimously rejected following an outpouring of opposition from the veggie burger industry, including Impossible Foods, which makes a high-tech veggie burger with <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-impossible-burger/" target="_blank">lab-grown blood flavoring</a>.</p>
<p>Webert said it was not his intent to regulate those products. “A Boca Burger is kind of easy to see it ain’t a real burger,” he said, arguing that veggie-based products generally advertise themselves as such.</p>
<p>But in the end, everyone seemed a little confused about what the changes would mean for the portion of state code that defines “meat food products.”</p>
<p>The committee voted the bill down unanimously.</p>
<p><em>Supporting—0; Opposing—Knight, Poindexter, Orrock, Morefield, Bloxom, Keam, Rodman —7.</em></p>
<h2><strong>Regulating Facebook like a utility</strong></h2>
<p>Citing concerns that conservative and religious groups are facing unfair censorship on major social media platforms like Facebook, Del. Mark Cole, R-Spotsylvania, proposed regulating them like a major utility under the auspices of the State Corporation Commission.</p>
<p>Specifically, his proposed <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+sum+HB2635" target="_blank">rules</a> would have prohibited sites with more than 75 million subscribers from deleting religious or political post and prohibit them from classifying certain content as &#8220;hate speech.&#8221;</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, lobbyists representing Facebook were among those opposed and Cole seemed aware it wasn&#8217;t going anywhere. Members of the House Commerce and Labor subcommittee hearing the bill moved on without saying a word or voting, leaving the bill in General Assembly purgatory.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope this gets the attention of some of these sites and hopefully take it as a warning and perhaps start treating people more fair,&#8221; Cole said before walking away from the lectern.</p>
<h2><b>Net neutrality, but just for Virginia</b></h2>
<p>With net neutrality repealed at the federal level, Del. Lee Carter, D-Manassas, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+sum+HB1755" target="_blank">proposed</a> bringing guarantees to Virginia residents that their access to the internet wouldn&#8217;t be throttled or otherwise blocked by service providers based on content.</p>
<p>&#8220;The idea is once you have access to the whole internet, you don&#8217;t have to pay extra to get access to certain parts,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Cable, internet and phone companies came out of the woodwork in opposition, with Verizon&#8217;s lobbyist arguing the bill &#8220;is a hammer in search of a nail.&#8221;</p>
<p>Members of the House Commerce and Labor subcommittee hearing the bill agreed, saying that while there were lots of concerns about what the repeal of net neutrality might do, none had come to pass as far as they were aware.</p>
<p>&#8220;There haven&#8217;t been any horror stories,&#8221; said Del. Tim Hugo, R-Fairfax. &#8220;Nobody said, &#8216;Hey, I couldn&#8217;t get on the internet.'&#8221;</p>
<p><em>Supporting—Kory, 1. Opposing—O&#8217;Quinn, Hugo, Marshall, Ransone, Wilt, Heretick, Kilgore, 7. Abstaining—Keam, 1. </em></p>
<h2><strong>Stormwater equipment on private property won&#8217;t be reported</strong></h2>
<p><a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+sum+HB1879" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that would have required real estate agents to tell buyers about stormwater management facilities — like ponds or ditches — on property failed in a House subcommittee this week.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If it seems specific, it’s because it is. Del. Kelly Fowler, D-Virginia Beach, introduced the bill because of persistent and worsening flooding in the city partially because of unmaintained drains, ditches and runoff storage ponds, some of which are on private property.</span></p>
<p><em>Supporting — Hope, Murphy, 2. Opposing — Hodges, H. Fowler, Miyares, Leftwich, Davis, Carr, 6.</em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of Fowler’s other flooding-related bills fared better and made it through subcommittees.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Want a landfill in your county? You still don&#8217;t need permission from neighboring localities</strong></h2>
<p>A bill by Sen. Glen Sturtevant, R-Richmond, would have <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+sum+SB1761" target="_blank">required</a> that applications for permits for new or expanded landfills include &#8220;a certification from the governing body for each locality within a five-mile radius of the facility.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some Powhatan County residents have <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/07/24/cumberland-landfill-fiercely-opposed-by-locals-would-be-states-first-new-mega-dump-in-two-decades/" target="_blank">been up in arms about a mega landfill</a> being developed just over the county line in Cumberland.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a good neighbor bill,&#8221; Sturtevant said. &#8220;Virginia is one of the top importers of out of state trash in the entire country. &#8230; That is something that I don&#8217;t think we should be real proud of.&#8221;</p>
<p>Republican or Democrat, though, Sturtevant was unable to get anyone on the committee to support the bill. Lawmakers were wary of giving one county authority over a project within another&#8217;s jurisdiction.</p>
<p><em>Supporting: 0. Opposing: Stuart, Hanger, Ruff, Obenshain, Petersen, Marsden, Stanley, Black, Lewis, Chafin, Dance, Suetterlein, Mason, McClellan —14.</em></p>
<h2><strong>Taxing state parks shot down</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Rob Bloxom, R-Accomac, never thought it was fair that two privately owned campgrounds on the Eastern Shore had to compete with the state-owned Kiptopeke Park for campers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All three campgrounds have made investments in better camping accommodations and it didn’t seem fair that the state parks were exempt from charging one kind of tax: the local transient tax, Bloxom said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He proposed </span><a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+sum+HB1778" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a bill that would require state parks with lodging to charge that tax on rentals,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which privately owned campgrounds already do (as do many property owners who rent their homes through sites like Airbnb).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His proposal, which made it out of the House Finance Committee, was defeated 78-19 on the floor.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Let nonprofit clinics dispense contraception, STD treatments</strong></h2>
<p>A House Health, Welfare and Institutions subcommittee tossed a <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=191&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb2636&amp;submit=GO" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bill</a> sponsored by Del. Marcus Simon, D-Fairfax, that would have allowed nonprofit health groups to receive limited prescribing licenses at a discounted rate to dispense contraception or treatment for sexually transmitted diseases.</p>
<p>Simon presented it as a straightforward bill that would allow nonprofit clinics to do what the state already does in its Department of Health clinics. But other groups, like the Family Foundation, saw it as a carve out for clinics that perform abortions.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re just not sure why one would need to create a special carve out,&#8221; said Jeff Caruso with the Virginia Catholic Conference. &#8220;Why wouldn&#8217;t this be treated the same across the board?&#8221;</p>
<p>Simon argued that the state creates carve outs for other areas in health care, and that making it easier for nonprofit subscribers to dispense contraception will likely reduce abortion rates. But he didn&#8217;t convince the subcommittee, and the bill was passed by indefinitely.</p>
<p><em>Opponents — Bell, Robert B., Pogge, Stolle, Hodges, Edmunds, Head — 6</em></p>
<p><em>Supporters — Hope, Aird, Rasoul, Rodman — 4</em></p>
<h2><strong>Resurrection </strong></h2>
<p>One bill, sponsored by Del. Alfonso Lopez, D-Arlington, returned from the dead. It would allow those with <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/01/23/subcommittee-allows-bill-to-expand-snap-access-for-past-drug-offenders-to-squeeze-by-but-tosses-another-aimed-at-the-tanf-program/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">past felony drug convictions to receive TANF benefits</a>. It failed to get by a House Health, Welfare and Institutions subcommittee early in the week, but on Thursday they instead decided to<a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+sum+HB2397" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> refer it to House Appropriations</a>.</p>
<p><em>Supporters — Stolle, Edmunds, Head, Hope, Aird, Rasoul, Rodman — 7</em></p>
<p><em>Opponents — Bell, Robert B., Pogge — 2</em></p>
<h2><strong>Foster care, Tannerite, temporary licenses for immigrants</strong></h2>
<p>Other bills that went by the wayside:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allowing local departments of social services to put a child in <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=191&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=HB2407" target="_blank" rel="noopener">permanent foster care</a> at age 14.</li>

Through their health plans, they can shop for procedures like X-rays or mammograms, and if they choose a cheaper option, they pocket some of the savings.</p>
<p>During the 2018 General Assembly session, the attempt to bring that option to the rest of the state failed, but the push was revived this year and, with a few adjustments, now seems more palatable to some of Virginia&#8217;s lawmakers.</p>
<p><a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+sum+HB2639" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A bill</a>, sponsored by Del. Kathy Byron, R-Bedford, unanimously passed the House Commerce and Labor Committee and has landed on the floor. It would require health plans in Virginia to create a tool on their websites so members can shop between providers, and then develop a program, approved by the state commissioner of insurance, that would allow patients to share in the savings if they choose a less expensive option.</p>
<p>Sen. Siobhan Dunnavant, R-Henrico, has a <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+sum+SB1611" target="_blank" rel="noopener">similar bill</a> in the Senate.</p>
<p>&#8220;This legislation protects the right of a patient to receive care where they choose in consultation with their doctor,&#8221; Byron told a Commerce and Labor subcommittee. &#8220;If they choose a provider who charges less than the average cost in their network, the insurer shares in these savings with the patient. This gives everyone skin in the game.&#8221;</p>
<p>This year&#8217;s version of the bill differs in a few ways.</p>
<p>It applies to four service categories, including physical and occupational therapy; radiology and imaging; laboratory; and infusion therapy services. It also exempts plans that have narrower provider networks, like Kaiser Permanente, and has a delayed start date so the plans have to develop their transparency tools by 2020 and the shared-savings program by 2021.</p>

<p>Southwest Virginia especially has been seeing cases where doctors require patients to pay cash for both prescription opioid painkillers and drugs like methadone, which is used to treat addiction, according to Medicaid officials.</p>
<p>In 2017, the state&#8217;s Medicaid program initiated the <a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/virginia/medicaid-program-expands-access-for-addiction-treatment-but-the-death/article_ca0ad5f9-7b95-5b10-8521-800cd12b9614.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Addiction and Recovery Treatment Services</a>, or ARTS, program, which significantly expanded access to what officials refer to as &#8220;high-quality&#8221; treatment services. But some Medicaid patients are still going to cash clinics for services, unaware that better treatment options are covered, said Kate Neuhausen, chief medical officer with the Virginia Department of Medical Assistance Services.</p>
<p>&#8220;They may be like the pregnant woman who came up to me at an event and said, &#8216;I&#8217;ve been paying $100 a week for methadone, I had no idea Medicaid would pay for it, I couldn&#8217;t make the mortgage payment on my house because of my methadone, and I&#8217;m losing my house,&#8221; Neuhausen said.</p>
<p><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=191&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb2558&amp;submit=GO" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Legislation</a> to prohibit physicians from taking cash from Medicaid patients for opioid pain management or medication-assisted-treatment, which refers to the practice of prescribing patients drugs like methadone to treat their addictions, passed its first committee unanimously on Thursday.</p>
<p>&#8220;This bill addresses the bad actors who could participate in Medicaid, but they opt out,&#8221; the bill&#8217;s sponsor, Del. Todd Pillion, R-Washington County, told the House Health, Welfare and Institutions committee.</p>
<p>Neuhausen said Medicaid&#8217;s ARTS program has a very strong network of opioid-use disorder treatment providers that will cover those who are currently going to cash clinics. The bill would require that those offering treatment be an in-network provider, meaning they have to be credentialed by one of the state&#8217;s six Medicaid health plans.</p>
<p>Doug Gray, executive director of the Virginia Association of Health Plans, said his group supports the bill &#8220;wholeheartedly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This has been a problem for many years and we&#8217;ve been trying to figure out how to get to it,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Opioid addiction treatments work best when they&#8217;re offered in conjunction with counseling and trauma-informed care, Neuhausen said in an interview. People aren&#8217;t turned away for refusing counseling, she added, but the best providers are those that offer both counseling and medication treatment, unlike cash clinics.</p>
<p>Some of these cash clinics might give a patient a months-long supply of suboxone, another drug used in medication-assisted-treatment, and also co-prescribe a potentially dangerous medication like benzodiazepines or Adderall, Neuhausen said.</p>
<p>&#8220;So then the member would go get the prescription and sell part of it to have enough cash to come back and pay the physician,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It really can fuel the black market and just lead to low-quality outcomes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Medicaid expansion means that thousands more Virginians will have access to the ARTS program and a new avenue for treatment. But that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s all the more important, Neuhausen said, to educate members about their coverage options and deter them from going to these &#8220;bad actors.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really great to have built the foundation of services first and now to be able to give all these people, many of whom have had nothing, to really have access to high quality treatment,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But that&#8217;s why this bill is so important to make sure they come into our ARTS network.&#8221;</p>

CCO Creative Commons via Pixabay. https://ecigarettereviewed.com/</p><p>The sudden swell of support in Virginia&#8217;s legislature to raise the minimum age for purchasing tobacco and nicotine vapor products from 18 to 21 achieved lift off Wednesday, with two bills comfortably passing their respective committees in the House and Senate.</p>
<p>The legislation received support from not only Altria, the Richmond-based tobacco giant, but also from a lineup of medical groups, including the Medical Society of Virginia, the Virginia chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Virginia Nurses Association. Gov. Ralph Northam, a pediatrician, <a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/virginia/government-politics/general-assembly/northam-says-he-supports-raising-virginia-s-smoking-and-vaping/article_84b70ac6-aa86-5d91-a66a-16880f1ebb8d.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has also endorsed raising the age</a>.</p>
<p>In December, Altria bought a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/20/health/juul-reaches-deal-with-tobacco-giant-altria.html" target="_blank">major stake in Juul Labs</a>, a popular electronic cigarette manufacturer, and the federal Food and Drug Administration has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/04/health/fda-juul-altria-youth-vaping.html" target="_blank">scrutinized the union</a> between the old tobacco giant and the startup, particularly whether they are living up to promises to try to keep the devices away from minors as vaping <a href="https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm620184.htm" target="_blank">skyrockets among teens</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tobacco harm reduction for adults cannot succeed without effective measures to reduce underage use of all tobacco products,&#8221; David Sutton, an Altria spokesman, said in an emailed statement. &#8220;The best approach to achieving this goal is simple: raise the minimum age for purchasing tobacco products to 21.&#8221;</p>
<p>But not all health advocacy organizations are happy with the proposed legislation. The American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network and the American Heart Association have expressed concerns about the bills and oppose them in their current forms.</p>
<p>Representatives for both organizations said they support the idea of raising the minimum age to 21, but contend the process is being rushed in Virginia.</p>
<p>&#8220;The devil is in the details,&#8221; said Brian Donohue, the Virginia government relations director for the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network. &#8220;It&#8217;s a great goal, but it&#8217;s backwards.&#8221;</p>
<p>They point to problems that already exist and which must be sorted out first before the state can successfully raise the minimum age. For one, the legislation as it is currently drafted continues a focus on penalizing youth rather than penalizing retailers, they claim.</p>
<p>&#8220;The youth access laws, the way they exist in Virginia now, are not strong enough to support the enforcement of raising the age, from our perspective,&#8221; said Ashley Bell, vice president for field advocacy for the American Heart Association. &#8220;They may not be strong enough to support the current age.&#8221;</p>
<p>The groups would propose that those penalties be removed altogether and replaced with a tobacco cessation or education program for those instances when someone under the age of 21 is caught for an infraction.</p>
<p>And they also think retailers should be subject to more oversight, particularly by requiring that all businesses wishing to sell tobacco products receive licenses to do so.</p>
<p>&#8220;It would have to be displayed at all times and it would require training for the employees,&#8221; she said. &#8220;They could have somebody who looked young go in and confirm they are actually checking IDs like they&#8217;re supposed to, and designating an enforcement agency that would be responsible for carrying this out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bell also pointed to the fact that there are various definitions in Virginia&#8217;s code for tobacco, nicotine vapor and alternative products. Ideally the state would have one consistent definition for all the products before expanding the minimum age, she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have been reviewing bills from other states and one of the bills that I received for review was 35 pages because they&#8217;re trying to tackle it all in one,&#8221; Bell said. &#8220;I realize that does make a much heavier lift, it does, that&#8217;s why we didn&#8217;t come to the legislature with this idea. But we know the sponsors are well-intentioned, we certainly support what they&#8217;re trying to do, but we need a little bit more time to figure out the right way to do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>In an opinion piece <a href="https://www.richmond.com/opinion/their-opinion/guest-columnists/brian-donohue-column-tobacco-addressing-the-right-problem-the-wrong/article_79f3191e-0b24-5244-9b60-dd8a43d5f752.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in the Richmond Times-Dispatch</a>, Donohue noted that similar legislation in other states has proven more effective when they have strict enforcement through retail licensing and when the focus is not on punishing youth but on educating them about tobacco use.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve watched this across the states for years, we know what works and what doesn&#8217;t work,&#8221; he said, calling the bills proposed in Virginia &#8220;feel-good legislation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Each of the bills — <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+sum+SB1727" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one sponsored</a> by Sen. Tommy Norment, R-James City and <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=191&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=HB2748" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the other</a> by Del. Chris Stolle, R-Virginia Beach — passed their respective committees on Wednesday.</p>
<p>In an interview after his bill was heard, Norment said he understands the concerns raised by the two groups in that the legislation doesn&#8217;t go far enough.</p>
<p>But their requests would be tough to incorporate in this session, and he noted that he has supported <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/bill-would-require-a-license-to-sell-cigarettes-in-virginia/2015/02/16/5694063c-b60e-11e4-aa05-1ce812b3fdd2_story.html?utm_term=.e1ad0cfd2b05" target="_blank" rel="noopener">efforts to require that tobacco retailers be licensed in the past</a>, but they&#8217;ve failed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Virginia is not the most receptive state to government regulation,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I think this is an incremental step and it&#8217;s pretty significant but I don&#8217;t think the discussion is over.&#8221;</p>
<h2><strong>Vending tobacco</strong></h2>
<p>The legislation will also allow nicotine vapor products and &#8220;alternative nicotine products,&#8221; meaning &#8220;noncombustible&#8221; products like chewing or dipping tobacco that is &#8220;intended for human consumption, whether chewed, absorbed, dissolved, or ingested by any other means&#8221; to be sold from a vending machine.</p>
<p>The machine must have a notice stating that the purchase or possession of tobacco products by &#8220;persons under 21 years of age is unlawful&#8221; and be &#8220;located in a place that is not open to the general public and is not generally accessible to persons under 21 years of age.&#8221;</p>
<p>Under current law, tobacco products — but not vapor products —  may be sold from a vending machine if there is posted notice of the minimum age requirements and the machine is located in a place that is not open to the general public and not generally accessible to minors, a summary of the legislation says.</p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>A House subcommittee took up two bills Tuesday that would expand access to benefits for those with past drug convictions, voting one down and allowing another to squeeze by with a major amendment.</p>
<p>One piece of legislation, proposed by Del. Alfonso Lopez, D-Arlington, would have lifted the federally-imposed ban on TANF, or Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, for those convicted of a felony drug possession offense. The federal government enacted the ban in 1996 but states are able to opt out through legislation, though Virginia never has.</p>
<p>&#8220;Through this process we&#8217;re going to be helping families, helping to stabilize communities,&#8221; Lopez told the House Health, Welfare, and Institutions subcommittee. &#8220;We&#8217;re not going to be continuing to punish people with a lifetime punishment who have served their time and by extension we&#8217;re going to be helping the children and family members of these people.&#8221;</p>
<figure id="attachment_5530" class="wp-caption alignright" style="max-width:100%;width:203px;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-5530" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Lopez-203x300.jpg" alt="" width="203" height="300" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Lopez-203x300.jpg 203w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Lopez-285x420.jpg 285w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Lopez.jpg 413w" sizes="(max-width: 203px) 100vw, 203px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Del. Alfonso Lopez, D-Arlington</p></figure>
<p>There have been numerous attempts to lift the ban in Virginia for more than a decade, sponsored by both Republicans and Democrats, but it has never been successful. The subcommittee continued that trend on Tuesday,<a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+vot+H1202V0004+HB2397" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> with the bill failing to advance on a party-line vote</a>.</p>
<p>It was surprising even for advocates, because in the past the legislation usually at least made it to a money committee before it was killed due to its fiscal impact, said Salaam Bhatti, a public benefits attorney with the Virginia Poverty Law Center.</p>
<p>&#8220;This isn’t a bill that will erase their record,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This isn’t a bill that says they don’t have to serve any time. This is a bill saying they have served their time and want to access benefits.&#8221;</p>
<p>Del. Matthew James, D-Portsmouth, had a bit more luck with his legislation, which has a similar purpose but applies to SNAP, or the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as food stamps. Virginia has already lifted the ban on SNAP for those with felony convictions of possession, but not for other convictions like distribution.</p>
<p>Under James&#8217;s <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+sum+HB1891" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bill</a>, which passed the subcommittee and was referred to House Appropriations, the ban would be lifted for all drug-related felony convictions.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can have a felony as serious as homicide and be eligible for SNAP benefits. There is something incredibly wrong with that,&#8221; Pamela Little-Hill, director of the Portsmouth Department of Social Services, told the subcommittee. &#8220;When we are working with citizens who are looking to re-enter the community, their basic needs are food, employment, shelter. I don&#8217;t think that we should be living in a society today where I&#8217;m given a lifelong sentence in terms of being ineligible for food for an intent to distribute.&#8221;</p>
<figure id="attachment_5529" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:214px;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-5529" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/James-214x300.jpg" alt="" width="214" height="300" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/James-214x300.jpg 214w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/James-300x420.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/James.jpg 457w" sizes="(max-width: 214px) 100vw, 214px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Del. Matthew James, D-Portsmouth</p></figure>
<p>The bill&#8217;s original language was broader. Virginia code currently lifts the ban so long as the individual is complying with Department of Social Services or court-ordered obligations, has completed a substance abuse treatment program and participates in periodic drug screening.</p>
<p>Initially, James&#8217;s bill eliminated that condition, but the subcommittee&#8217;s chair, Del. Robert Bell, R-Albermarle, said he didn&#8217;t understand why that should be removed from state code. The legislation was due for a vote just after Lopez&#8217;s bill had been killed, and Del. Sam Rasoul, D-Roanoke, swiftly proposed removing that language to give it a better chance of passing.</p>
<p>Advocates argued that those requirements are unfair and don&#8217;t apply to offenders with far more serious offenses, such as murder or child molestation.</p>
<p>&#8220;This isn&#8217;t equitable,&#8221; Sherri Neil, intergovernmental affairs manager for the City of Portsmouth, told the subcommittee. &#8220;Why do we single out one particular group of felons and put certain conditions on that one particular group of felons that you&#8217;re not putting on any other felon?&#8221;</p>
<p>But James accepted Rasoul&#8217;s proposed amendment, and the bill passed on a 6-4 vote, with Dels. Chris Stolle, R-Virginia Beach, and James Edmunds, R-Halifax, breaking ranks to vote in favor of the bill.</p>
<p>In an interview after the vote, James said that he&#8217;s glad the bill is at least moving in the right direction, even with the amendment.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the first time since I&#8217;ve been here that we&#8217;ve been able to get it even referred up to a full committee,&#8221; he said, adding that the bill attempts to address &#8220;something that is truly unfair.&#8221;</p>

<p>Every week, we&#8217;ll bring you a sampling of the legislation left on the cutting room floor, either failing to report or done in by those other genteel euphemisms of the legislature: &#8220;gently laid on the table&#8221; or &#8220;passed by indefinitely.&#8221;</p>
<h2><strong>“Airbnb for jail beds?”</strong></h2>
<p>A tied vote in the Senate Rehabilitation and Social Services Committee on Friday meant the death of a bill aimed at improving oversight of youth detained in Virginia under federal contracts — particularly at <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/08/15/watchdog-group-says-more-investigation-needed-at-staunton-area-jail-where-immigrant-teens-allege-abuse/" target="_blank">Shenandoah Valley Juvenile Center</a>.</p>
<p>Sen. Adam Ebbin, D-Alexandria, said his <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=191&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=sb1498&amp;submit=GO" target="_blank">proposed legislation</a> would have required the Department of Juvenile Justice to set forth regulations aimed at implementing “best practices,” to care for the kids brought to Virginia by the U.S. Office of Refugee Resettlement. A representative with the department noted that it is currently in the process of <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/09/06/state-officials-say-they-no-longer-use-restraint-chairs-detailed-in-immigrant-abuse-allegations/" target="_blank">expanding its oversight</a>.</p>
<p>Some lawmakers on the committee expressed dismay when Ebbin said the youth in question haven’t been convicted of a crime, but are housed in a detention facility.</p>
<p>“Is this like Airbnb for jail beds?” asked Sen. William DeSteph, R-Virginia Beach.</p>
<p>Sen. Barbara Favola, D-Arlington, tried to clarify that the localities are contracting with the federal government, a practice the state has not prohibited, and that Ebbin’s bill is simply trying to improve the situation within the current framework.</p>
<p>But lawmakers still had concerns that the bill wouldn’t rectify the root of the problem, and the legislation went down on a tied vote.</p>
<p><em>YEAS — Reeves, Locke, Favola, Surovell, McPike, Spruill, Mason — 7.</em></p>
<p><em>NAYS —Hanger, Wagner, McDougle, Black, Chafin, Cosgrove, DeSteph— 7.</em></p>
<h2><strong>No legal marijuana this year</strong></h2>
<p>Three proposals that would have decriminalized marijuana and two that would have explicitly legalized its recreational use never made it out of subcommittee in the House of Delegates. It was not an unexpected outcome.</p>
<p>Groups including the ACLU of Virginia and NORML argued marijuana convictions ruin lives for no good reason. Groups representing law enforcement and state prosecutors said no good could come from reducing penalties and, in any case, no one is actually being jailed for simple possession charges, even though the punishment is an option under state code.</p>
<p>Republicans on the committee were unanimous in their opposition to both bills. Two of the Democrats on the committee, Charniele L. Herring and Michael P. Mullin, supported both the legalization and decriminalization bills. A third, Vivian Watts, voted against legalization but in favor of decriminalization.</p>
<p>The final tally on legalization (a yes vote was a vote against the bill):</p>
<p><em>YEAS— Gilbert, Bell, Robert B., Adams, L.R., Collins, Ransone, Watts— 6.</em></p>
<p><em>NAYS —Herring, Mullin—2.</em></p>
<p>Decriminalization:</p>
<p><em>YEAS—Gilbert, Bell, Robert B., Adams, L.R., Collins, Ransone—5.</em></p>
<p><em>NAYS—Watts, Herring, Mullin—3.</em></p>
<h2><strong>Eliminating Lee-Jackson Day</strong></h2>
<p>Every year, Virginia gives state employees the day off to celebrate two Confederate generals, Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson. Established by a relative of Lee in 1889, it&#8217;s become increasingly controversial, with Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax, the only black state-wide elected official, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/virginias-lone-black-statewide-official-sits-out-robert-e-lee-tribute/2019/01/18/7b721ba4-1b4c-11e9-88fe-f9f77a3bcb6c_story.html?utm_term=.aefc44af5f97" target="_blank">opting to sit out </a>annual tributes in the state Senate.</p>
<p>Bills to nix that holiday going forward and instead make Election Day a state holiday failed on party line votes in committees in both the <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+sum+HB1984" target="_blank">House</a> and <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+sum+SB1291" target="_blank">Senate</a>. Sen. Dick Black, R-Loudoun, said it amounted to &#8220;erasing history.&#8221; Proponents note we manage to remember all kinds of things we don&#8217;t celebrate with a holiday.</p>
<p><em>Senate: </em><em>YEAS — Locke, Barker, Ebbin, Surovell, McPike —5. </em><em>NAYS —Ruff, Vogel, Black, Reeves, DeSteph, Suetterlein, Dunnavant —7.</em></p>
<p><em>House: YEAS —Lindsey, Turpin —2. NAYS —Leftwich, Landes, Adams, L.R., McGuire —4.</em></p>
<h2 style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Unsuccessful abortion bills</strong></h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In news of the not-especially-surprising, three abortion-related bills died on party-line votes in the Senate Education and Health Committee Thursday morning:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond, had a <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+sum+SB1451" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191%2Bsum%2BSB1451&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1547858939832000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFpROVoCRpDFm2pR6s2xh4QtSBOyA" target="_blank">bill</a> that would have eliminated several rules surrounding abortions, including the requirement that third trimester abortions take place in hospitals and that women must first get ultrasounds. (In this case a &#8220;yea&#8221; vote was a vote to &#8220;pass by indefinitely&#8221; or kill the bill)  <em>YEAS —Newman, Black, Carrico, Cosgrove, Dunnavant, Chase, Suetterlein, Peake—8. NAYS — Saslaw, Lucas, Howell, Locke, Barker, Petersen, Lewis— 7.</em></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+sum+SB1054" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191%2Bsum%2BSB1054&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1547858939832000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGsEdz4L4-K1zCG0CHGX51c4saxpA" target="_blank">Another bill</a> sponsored by Sen. Mamie Locke, D-Hampton, would simply have removed the requirement that women first get an ultrasound before the requirement. (This bill was incorporated into McClellan&#8217;s and dispatched on the same vote)</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">And Sen. Jennifer Boysko, D-Fairfax, <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+sum+SB1637" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191%2Bsum%2BSB1637&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1547858939832000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEP2WCAYhw6kShtqmb8WKvYWYgLHQ" target="_blank">proposed the Virginia Human Rights Act</a>, which would have codified reproductive rights into Virginia state law. (Again, a yes vote here was a vote against the bill)             <em>YEAS — Newman, Black, Carrico, Cosgrove, Dunnavant, Chase, Suetterlein, Peake —8.  </em><em>NAYS — Saslaw, Lucas, Howell, Locke, Barker, Petersen, Lewis —7.</em></li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>More expansive voting deemed too expensive</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several measures that would have expanded voting options failed to escape a House subcommittee, mostly due to concerns about the cost of implementing them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Ralph Northam made an announcement before the General Assembly convened that he wanted to make voting accessibility a priority. </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/01/07/northam-proposes-extensive-campaign-finance-and-voting-reform-limiting-campaign-donations-and-repealing-voter-id-law/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">His to-do list included</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> no-excuse absentee voting and getting rid of Virginia’s photo ID requirement at the polls.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bills addressing those topics are still waiting to be considered by lawmakers, but other attempts to change the voting registration process have failed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Alfonso Lopez, D-Arlington, wanted to implement </span><a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+sum+HB2390" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an automatic voter registration bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that would require people opt out of personal information being sent from the Department of Motor Vehicles to the Department of Elections. Currently, it’s an opt-in process which requires people to say &#8220;yes&#8221; to sending their information. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clara Belle Wheeler, vice-chair of the state Board of Election, told a House subcommittee this week there are still too many problems with the current process of applying to register to vote through the DMV. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The subcommittee laid it on the table, a vote split down party lines.</span></p>

<p><em>NAYS— Sickles, VanValkenburg— 2.</em></p>
<h2><strong>Teachers, strippers and guns:</strong></h2>
<p>Other bills that went by the wayside.</p>
<ul>
<li>Requiring teachers to learn <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/senate-committees-hear-several-mental-health-bills-with-varying-outcomes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mental health first aid.</a></li>
<li>Requiring <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+sum+HB1825" target="_blank">strippers be at least 21</a>. The measure&#8217;s patron, Del.

<p>The most far-reaching is the <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+sum+SB1339" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">omnibus bill</a> carried by Sen. Bryce Reeves, R-Spotsylvania, for which Sen. Janet Howell, D-Fairfax, is carrying the $3 million budget amendment.</p>
<p>It passed the Senate Rehabilitation and Social Services committee, which Reeves chairs, swiftly and unanimously.</p>
<p>&#8220;To say Virginia&#8217;s system is broken is probably less accurate than to say it&#8217;s full of holes like Swiss cheese,&#8221; Janet Kelly, president of Virginia&#8217;s Kids Belong, told the committee as she spoke in favor of the bill. &#8220;It&#8217;s really great in some places, really bad in other places, and this bill will significantly help with those holes.&#8221;</p>
<p>The bill was referred to Senate Finance Committee.</p>
<p>The committee also unanimously sent two bills carried by Sen. Monty Mason, D-Williamsburg, to Senate Finance that are meant to align Virginia&#8217;s Department of Social Services with the <a href="https://vakids.org/our-news/blog/families-first-prevention-act-will-change-child-welfare-for-the-better" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Family First Prevention Services Act</a>, which was signed into federal law last year.</p>
<p>The act adjusts funding streams so that the necessary services can get to families before something drastic happens, like kids needing to be separated from their parents. The idea is to focus on preventing child abuse and neglect rather than reacting to it.</p>
<p>Mason&#8217;s two <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+sum+SB1679" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bills</a> will ensure that Virginia can take advantage of those new funding mechanisms.</p>
<p>&#8220;Heretofore you had to have a CPS [child protective services] report and then you can start in with treatments and work and the efforts that need to be made,&#8221; Mason told the committee. &#8220;But the social services professionals will tell you that almost every situation is known to them in advance. Now we can put money toward prevention.&#8221;</p>

Emmett Hanger, R-Augusta.</p><p>Two bills aimed at addressing both the state&#8217;s psychiatric hospital crisis and mental health in schools passed easily through their respective committees Thursday, while a subcommittee punted on another designed to expand teachers&#8217; ability to recognize mental illness.</p>
<p>Virginia&#8217;s psychiatric hospitals <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/12/03/you-have-no-control-as-psychiatric-admissions-rise-virginia-grapples-with-a-hospital-crisis-that-threatens-care-and-safety/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have been overwhelmed with patients under temporary detention orders</a>, often operating near 100 percent capacity, and the Joint Subcommittee to Study Mental Health in the Commonwealth in the 21st Century, known as the Deeds Commission after Sen. Creigh Deeds, D-Bath, has been following the issue closely.</p>
<p>Sen. Emmett Hanger, R-Augusta, carried one of the committee&#8217;s bills, which would allow the state to study the crisis further, focusing in particular on those individuals who are not only suffering from severe mental health challenges, but have complicated medical problems, as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re struggling to deal with people with complex medical needs, in addition to being in mental health crisis,&#8221; Hanger told the Committee on Education and Health on Thursday.</p>
<p><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=191&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=sb1488&amp;submit=GO" target="_blank">The bill</a> passed the Senate committee unanimously.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are people showing up in the state hospitals that have complex medical needs that the state hospitals really don&#8217;t have the capacity to address,&#8221; said Rhonda Thissen, executive director of the National Alliance on Mental Illness of Virginia. &#8220;This study will help us learn more about what those folks need and how we can address their needs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Soon after, the committee also unanimously <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=191&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=sb1440&amp;submit=GO" target="_blank" rel="noopener">approved a bill</a> sponsored by Sen. Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond, that will expand mental health education in public schools.</p>
<p>Last year the General Assembly passed legislation to add mental health to the ninth and 10th grade health curriculum, McClellan told the committee. Her bill expands that throughout all grades &#8220;in an age-appropriate way,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>She shared Centers for Disease Control and Prevention statistics on mental health, including that 7.4 percent of children age 3 to 17 have been diagnosed with behavioral problems, 7.1 percent have been diagnosed with anxiety and 3.2 percent have been diagnosed with depression.</p>
<p>&#8220;If these diagnoses are occurring as early as age 3, waiting until eighth grade to begin to incorporate discussions on mental health really leaves a lot of these kids behind,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Later on in the day, however, a Senate Education and Health subcommittee on public education killed a <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+sum+SB1472" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bill</a> that Deeds sponsored. It would have required all teachers receive mental health first aid. The idea is that the training works for mental health crises in the same way that CPR helps someone having a heart attack. It would give teachers the tools to recognize mental illness and help students when going through a crisis.</p>
<p>The bill was supported by Voices for Virginia&#8217;s Children and the Legal Aid Justice Center, and some high school students spoke in favor of the bill. But education advocates, including the Virginia School Boards Association and the Virginia Education Association, spoke against it, acknowledging the benefits of the bill but calling it an unfunded mandate that would require teachers receive eight hours of training without any pay.</p>

And they didn&#8217;t get far.</p>
<p>Balance billing occurs when patients, usually unknowingly, gets a bill from a provider that they thought was in-network and covered by their health plan. The most egregious occurrence is in the emergency room, when patients are rarely in a position to make sure their doctor is in-network, even if the hospital is.</p>
<p>Insurance company representatives and doctors&#8217; groups were told by the Health Insurance Reform Commission to come up with a solution, or lawmakers would. They didn&#8217;t, and lawmakers haven&#8217;t seem to have had much luck coming up with a solution, either.</p>
<p>The insurers and doctors agreed that the patient shouldn&#8217;t be balance billed, but couldn&#8217;t agree on how doctors should ultimately be paid when they provide services to an out-of-network patient. Two bills presented to the House Commerce and Labor subcommittee on Thursday, sponsored by Dels. Kathy Byron, R-Bedford, and R. Lee Ware, R-Powhatan, offer two conflicting options.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everyone has really been trying to come together with a reasonable solution,&#8221; Byron said. &#8220;But of course when it deals with money, that&#8217;s always difficult to do because no one wants to let go too much. However, there have been some solutions that have come to the table. The question is: How much is it going to cost everyone?&#8221;</p>
<p>Ware is carrying the physicians&#8217; bill, and several medical groups expressed their support for it. Under the terms of his bill, the doctors would be paid the average of similar payments in their region, according to information gathered from <a href="http://www.vhi.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Virginia Health Information</a>, which has data on how much services cost.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were trying to find something that&#8217;s more transparent when we were developing the language in our bill, something that was verified and less opaque,&#8221; said Dr. Trisha Anest, an emergency room physician and member of the Virginia College of Emergency Physicians. &#8220;This bill makes sure that physicians are still getting fair and adequate payment so our emergency rooms stay staffed.&#8221;</p>
<p>The insurance companies were adamantly opposed to that option, though. Doug Gray, executive director of the Virginia Association of Health Plans, argued that doctors would be paid more under the calculation in Ware&#8217;s bill because, by using the regional average, the calculation would include networks that are paid more by the insurance companies because they offer more volume.</p>
<p>&#8220;Del. Ware&#8217;s bill basically gives providers a raise and an incentive to leave the network and stay out,&#8221; Gray said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know why you&#8217;d ever join a network if you got paid more for being out of it than for being in it.&#8221;</p>
<p>He argued that the patient would ultimately bear the cost of paying physicians more because insurance companies would offset those charges in premiums.</p>
<p>By contrast, Byron&#8217;s bill would pay the doctors based on the average rate that the insurance company has already negotiated with other providers. It&#8217;s supported by the Virginia Association of Health Plans and several other groups representing insurance companies, who say the bill allows them to continue to create viable networks.</p>
<p>That payment option, though, doesn&#8217;t sit well with doctors&#8217; groups.</p>
<p>&#8220;You leave all the determination of payment in the hands, largely, of the insurance company,&#8221; said Scott Johnson, a representative of the Medical Society of Virginia. &#8220;The ability of the providers to negotiate a fair in-network rate is going to be tilted in favor of the insurance company.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ultimately, lawmakers on the committee hit the same roadblocks that insurers and providers couldn&#8217;t overcome. They didn&#8217;t sift through the arguments and make their own decision on how the payments should be negotiated.  Instead, Del. Terry Kilgore, R-Scott, suggested moving the bills to the full Commerce and Labor Committee and, in the meantime, giving the relevant parties more time to try and come to an agreement on their own.</p>
<p>Byron urged against that option.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don’t want to be disingenuous by you thinking there’s going to be some great compromise here,&#8221; she said. &#8220;There&#8217;s two different solutions. I find it hard, after six months, to think that there’s going to be something where we all of a sudden have a &#8216;Kumbaya&#8217; moment. Now, if you want more lobbyists to come out and visit you, that will happen.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the subcommittee ultimately agreed to move both bills to the full committee.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+sum+HB1810" target="_blank">bill</a>, sponsored by Del. Wendy Gooditis, D-Loudoun, would have required the Department of Social Services to keep records of investigations that were deemed unfounded for three years, rather than just one. Unfounded means there wasn&#8217;t enough evidence to suggest that the alleged abuse or neglect occurred.</p>
<figure id="attachment_5322" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:150px;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-5322 size-thumbnail" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/wendygooditis-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/wendygooditis-150x150.jpg 150w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/wendygooditis.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Del. Wendy Gooditis, D-Clarke.</p></figure>
<p>The point was to give social workers more information when they&#8217;re looking into cases about a family&#8217;s past investigations so that the workers can make better, more informed decisions.</p>
<p>&#8220;The single biggest predictor of the fatality of a child is a call — not an investigation, not an intervention — but a call to social services,&#8221; Gooditis told the House Health, Welfare and Institutions subcommittee. &#8220;If we have records of these calls, and if there are more than one over a period of more than a year, then perhaps there is a need for an intervention.&#8221;</p>
<p>She noted the high turnover rates within local departments across the state, meaning those agencies frequently lose institutional knowledge about a family.</p>
<p>&#8220;The more information we have about a family when we receive the call, the better,&#8221; Rebecca Morgan, director of the Middlesex Department of Social Services and legislative chair of the Virginia League of Social Services Executives, told the committee. &#8220;Three years protects kids. If they get older, they&#8217;re able to talk, they&#8217;re able to get stronger, they&#8217;re able to recount these tragic traumatic events with language that we can understand.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the subcommittee&#8217;s four Republicans voted against <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=191&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb1810&amp;submit=GO" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the bill</a>, outnumbering the two Democrats. Del. Robert Orrock, R-Caroline, noted that the measure had come before the General Assembly in 2014 as a recommendation of the Crime Commission. At that time, the legislature voted to keep the records for just one year, thinking that was a reasonable amount of time.</p>

<p>&#8220;The fact that it&#8217;s unfounded means you&#8217;re not guilty, and you&#8217;ve been through the investigative process and you&#8217;ve found no abuse,&#8221; he said. &#8220;People being people, if I know there was a whiff of smoke at your house before, and I&#8217;ve gotten another whiff, I&#8217;m somewhat predisposed to think there&#8217;s a problem.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gooditis pointed out that the information is never public record, but kept confidential within DSS so that it is only available to caseworkers.</p>
<p>Other records are kept for three years, such as family assessments. Those are done when social workers, rather than determining a case as founded or unfounded, instead assess what services a family needs. It&#8217;s meant to prevent cases of child abuse or neglect from occurring in the first place.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the field, there is discussion sometimes when we&#8217;re assessing the family assessment versus the investigation track,&#8221; Morgan told the subcommittee. &#8220;Sometimes we say: That&#8217;s going to be really hard to prove, let&#8217;s take it as a family assessment because we know we can keep it for three years. Is that right? No. But do those discussions happen in our everyday life in the field? Yes they absolutely do.&#8221;</p>

																						<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-size:12px;"></p><p>Environmental advocates tried <a href="https://wtop.com/virginia/2017/01/va-senate-committee-kills-proposed-bag-tax/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">again</a> to staunch the flow of plastic bags into Virginia&#8217;s waterways Wednesday, but to no avail.</p>
<p>Sens. J. Chapman Petersen, D-Fairfax City, and Adam Ebbin, D-Alexandria, proposed allowing localities to add a 5-cent tax to plastic bags. Petersen&#8217;s bill would have limited the range of the bill to localities in the Chesapeake Bay watershed, and Ebbin&#8217;s would have applied statewide.</p>
<p>Both bills died in the Senate Finance Committee on a party-line vote, but some Republican senators suggested that, while they aren&#8217;t in favor of a tax, their plastic bag politics may be changing.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t support a tax, but I&#8217;m getting really close to the point where I&#8217;d support a ban on plastic bags because they&#8217;ve gotten really onerous,&#8221; said Sen. Richard Stuart, R-Stafford, after sharing a story of picking up five truckloads of plastic bags over the summer.</p>
<p>Another similar bill sponsored by Del. Betsy Carr, D-Richmond, on the House side died in the Committee on Finance earlier this week, also on a party-line vote.</p>
<p>In that committee, too, Del. Robert Bloxom, R-Accomack, noted that he doesn&#8217;t &#8220;disagree with the underlying premise of the bill,&#8221; and Del. R. Lee Ware, R-Powhatan, said that, while he doesn&#8217;t support the tax, he does think action should be taken to address plastic litter on the landscape.</p>
<p>Petersen described his proposed bill as user friendly, explaining that other states haven&#8217;t run into issues with their taxes. He recalled visiting Colorado, which has a plastic bag tax, and making a purchase without any problems.</p>
<p>&#8220;There was no infringement on my freedom as an American,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The citizens of Colorado decided to pass this, or their legislature did, and I didn&#8217;t see anyone in revolt.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ebbin added that plastic bags are the second-most commonly found litter pollution source in the state.</p>
<p>Several environmental groups expressed their support for the tax, citing statistics about the damage that plastic bags cause, like the fact that, by 2050, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/plastic-in-ocean-outweighs-fish-evidence-report-2017-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plastic will outnumber fish</a> by mass in the world&#8217;s oceans.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a locality option,&#8221; said Steven Carter-Lovejoy with the Virginia Sierra Club. &#8220;It gives us a chance to experiment across the state and make sure it works well.&#8221;</p>
<p>Opponents, including the Virginia Retail Federation, the Virginia Retail Merchants Association, and the American Progressive Bag Alliance, claimed the tax would be a burden on retailers.</p>
<p>Sen. Frank Wagner, R-Virginia Beach, noted that food stamps wouldn&#8217;t cover the tax.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re gonna take those with the least amount of money and charge them some more,&#8221; he said.</p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>Virginia&#8217;s foster care system is in dire straits. It is struggling to care for some of the state&#8217;s most vulnerable children, whose basic health and safety needs sometimes go unmet by local departments. And the state, which has oversight of the whole system, has taken a hands-off approach to supervision.</p>
<p>A <a href="http://jlarc.virginia.gov/pdfs/reports/Rpt513-2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a> released in December by the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission described the severe challenges facing social services, which Sen. Janet Howell, D-Fairfax, called, &#8220;<a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/12/11/its-very-unfortunate-for-these-children-state-report-highlights-health-and-safety-problems-in-virginias-foster-care-system/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">devastating</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>But for many advocates working directly within foster care and children&#8217;s services, the report was merely an affirmation of what they&#8217;ve known for a long time: That the system is chronically underfunded, it lacks oversight and it needs serious reforms now.</p>
<p>&#8220;All the things that are in the JLARC report are things that we&#8217;ve known about for a long time,&#8221; said Valerie L&#8217;Herrou, an attorney with the Virginia Poverty Law Center. &#8220;It&#8217;s not like any of those things were a revelation to anyone.&#8221;</p>
<p>The report — combined with new laws at the federal level that will encourage Virginia to change how its child welfare programs operate — has sparked a bipartisan movement within the General Assembly spearheaded by Howell and Sen. Bryce Reeves, R-Spotsylvania. Advocates and Department of Social Services officials think it could lead to significant investment in a system that has needed support for a long time.</p>
<p>But they&#8217;re hoping this is just the beginning of a long-lasting effort.</p>
<p>Reeves, the chair of the Senate Rehabilitation and Social Services committee, has submitted a far-reaching bill on foster care for which Howell, a ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee, is carrying a budget amendment. During a press conference Tuesday, Reeves said <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+sum+SB1339" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the bill</a> has the support of all 40 senators. Lawmakers have aslo created a new Foster Care Caucus, chaired by Del. Emily Brewer, R-Suffolk, and Sen. Monty Mason, D-Williamsburg, aimed at sustaining the reforming effort and focus on the needs of children within the foster care system.</p>
<p>&#8220;The majority of our folks who work in this arena do a phenomenal job,&#8221; Reeves said in an interview last week. &#8220;But I think what the JLARC report did was highlight deficiencies in the program and the agency itself.</p>
<p>&#8220;The legislation that we put together — I think it&#8217;s reasonable, I think it&#8217;s prudent, and I think it&#8217;s in a timely fashion,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;It&#8217;s due. And that&#8217;s why you&#8217;re seeing huge bipartisan support. This isn&#8217;t a Republican or Democrat issue, this is a human issue that has to do with our children.&#8221;</p>
<h2><strong>Is it enough? </strong></h2>
<p>Though Reeves&#8217;s bill does not address every recommendation within the JLARC report, it does cover several of them, including: allowing the Commissioner of Social Services to assume control over a local Board of Social Services if the board fails to protect the children under its care; creating a foster care health and safety director position; and requiring the state to limit the number of cases assigned to each social worker. Howell has submitted a $3 million budget amendment to cover the costs.</p>
<p>Oversight, Reeves noted, is a major need. Families at risk of losing their children rarely have the means of paying for a lawyer to represent them, and they have to rely, instead, on the appeals process. But if there is limited oversight at the state level to ensure that local departments — <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/10/29/little-kingdoms-administration-of-social-services-in-virginia-rests-largely-in-the-hands-of-localities-what-happens-when-they-cant-fix-themselves/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">which are autonomous</a> — are following the appropriate guidelines, those families have little recourse.</p>
<p>Advocates, such as L&#8217;Herrou and Allison Gilbreath, a policy analyst with Voices for Virginia&#8217;s Children, say they&#8217;re hopeful that the proposed reforms stand a chance this year.</p>
<p>&#8220;The foster care omnibus bill has many changes that we&#8217;ve wanted for a long time, and so much bipartisan support,&#8221; Gilbreath said. &#8220;To me, that&#8217;s as hopeful as I can get.&#8221;</p>
<p>Officials with the state Department of Social Services have also expressed support for the lawmakers&#8217; proposals. Carl Ayers, director of family services with the department, said he thinks the combined effort &#8220;is a wonderful first step.&#8221; But, he added, it has to be the first of multi-stage process if it&#8217;s going to create lasting change.</p>
<p>He said it&#8217;s sort of like making a down payment on a new house: It&#8217;s a necessary and meaningful start, but will still requirement significant investment.</p>
<p>&#8220;We didn’t get here overnight with our child welfare system, we’re not going to reform it in one session,&#8221; Ayers said. &#8220;We have to support our local agencies to get staff to do this really challenging and traumatizing job.&#8221;</p>
<p>The slew of bills that have been filed this session don&#8217;t address the major, systemic problems that DSS officials like Ayers and Commissioner Duke Storen have been pointing to: that the workforce is underpaid, <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/08/27/long-hours-low-pay-and-constant-turnover-social-services-agencies-in-virginia-struggle-to-keep-staff/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leading to low retention and recruitment rates across nearly every local department</a>, and that the department currently relies on a years-old training system that does not fully support a 21st-century workforce.</p>
<p>It takes two years to fully train a social worker in Virginia, meaning that many are working in the field before they&#8217;ve even completed their training.</p>
<p>But Reeves said he plans to champion a long-lasting reform effort, assuming he is re-elected to his office in November. The bill he&#8217;s presenting this year, he said, is meant to address critical issues that are directly impacting the care, custody and oversight of Virginia&#8217;s children right now.</p>
<p>&#8220;And then over the next probably two sessions, if I&#8217;m lucky enough to come back, we&#8217;ll address the rest of those issues,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;We&#8217;ve worked very hard to get the right bill. There&#8217;s going to be some tweaks, I&#8217;m sure, to this. There will be some localities that have concerns, and we&#8217;re going to try to address those. No one likes to have change, but this is definitely change that is needed.&#8221;</p>
<figure id="attachment_5275" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:150px;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-5275" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/JanetHowell-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  State Sen. Janet Howell, D-Fairfax.</p></figure>
<p>During the press conference, Howell said the JLARC report outlined problems she has been aware of for 30 years. She and Reeves (she called them the &#8220;odd couple&#8221;) looked at each after they read the report, she said, and immediately committed themselves to addressing the problems.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you take children from the families that God put them in, you have a huge moral responsibility to those children,&#8221; she said. &#8220;And frankly, for as long as I&#8217;ve been involved with foster care, we&#8217;ve been failing.&#8221;</p>
<h2><strong>A multi-faceted effort </strong></h2>
<p>While Reeves and Howell have the most comprehensive bill, several lawmakers have put forward proposals this year to address other problems within the foster care system.</p>
<p>Some of those bills:</p>
<ul>
<li>Del. Emily Brewer, R-Suffolk, has <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=191&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb1730" target="_blank">submitted a bill</a> that would freeze the credit report and records of a child in foster care to protect them from identity theft.</li>
<li>After the state&#8217;s Commission on Youth recommended the change, Sen. Barbara Favola, D-Arlington, is sponsoring a budget amendment to make it easier for teens in foster care to <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/10/03/most-teens-who-age-out-of-foster-care-have-trouble-getting-a-drivers-license-and-it-affects-everything-they-do/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">get driver&#8217;s licenses</a>.</li>
<li>Del. Jennifer Carroll-Foy, D-Stafford, <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=191&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb2162" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has a bill</a> that would require local departments to notify relatives about the possibility of becoming a foster home, which was a problem that JLARC identified in its report.</li>
</ul>
<p>Del. Chris Hurst, D-Giles, <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?181+sum+HB710" target="_blank" rel="noopener">also has a bill</a> that is meant to improve oversight of local departments. It identifies a way to pay for a new office, dubbed the Office of the Children&#8217;s Ombudsman, which the General Assembly actually passed over a decade ago, but hasn&#8217;t funded the office.</p>
<figure id="attachment_5274" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:150px;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-5274" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/chris_hurst-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/chris_hurst-150x150.jpg 150w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/chris_hurst-300x300.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/chris_hurst-420x420.jpg 420w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/chris_hurst.jpg 512w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  State Del. Chris Hurst, D-Roanoke.</p></figure>
<p>The idea for the bill stems from his time as a television news anchor, when he was talking with families about the challenges they faced with their local departments.</p>
<p>&#8220;Before I left I was in the process of gathering interviews with foster care parents who felt that there were some situations where local Departments of Social Services were acting with prejudice and making actions and decisions that weren&#8217;t with merit,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Once he started his career as a lawmaker, he turned his attention to making the Office of the Children&#8217;s Ombudsman a reality. Last year his bill died in committee because it didn&#8217;t include a way to pay for it. This year&#8217;s iteration identifies a funding source in 30 felonies and misdemeanors related to sex crimes against children. Under the bill, people convicted of those crimes would pay an additional $250 fee that would fund the position.</p>
<p>The ombudsman would be able to investigate claims and complaints regarding children&#8217;s services. That&#8217;s especially needed at DSS where, because Virginia has a locally-administered, state-supervised system, the buck stops at the local level when it comes to investigating incidents, Hurst said.</p>
<p>But the office would have a broader reach, as well, not just overseeing complaints related to DSS, but also agencies like the Department of Juvenile Justice and the Department of Education.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe, fundamentally, that we need to have somebody independent of those agencies who can really be that objective third party to give a thorough evaluation of people&#8217;s claims and complaints,&#8221; he said.</p>
<h2><strong>&#8220;What they needed was a champion&#8221;</strong></h2>
<p>Foster care reform has been a long time coming, advocates agree.</p>
<p>Reeves was aware of problems within DSS well before the JLARC report because constituents in his district came forward asking for help. DSS, too, has been asking for help for a long time, he noted.</p>
<figure id="attachment_5273" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:150px;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-5273" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Bryce_Reeves-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  State Sen. Bryce Reeves, R-Spotsylvania.</p></figure>
<p>&#8220;I think what they needed was a champion to get behind them, and I&#8217;m glad I&#8217;m that champion,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>He acknowledged that it&#8217;s probably not the norm that a Republican will step forward to take charge of a topic that is typically &#8220;deemed as a left-wing issue,&#8221; he said. His party is typically seen as focused on things like taxes or defending law enforcement.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I think you see those like myself, that have been in law enforcement, that are all about justice reform, that look at things not only from a humanitarian aspect, but from a fiscal aspect,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&#8217;re wasting dollars and we&#8217;re not making gains? We&#8217;ve got a problem.&#8221;</p>
