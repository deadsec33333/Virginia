<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin is pitching a tax cut, and cites a hefty state budgetary surplus as justification. But surpluses can evaporate in a Mar-a-Largo minute, and the prospects of declining revenue flowing to Virginia because of cutbacks in federal employment and reductions in Medicaid reimbursements are making Virginia budget makers skittish about the future. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">We have seen the &#8216;Swamp&#8217;– and &#8216;they&#8217; is us</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump has stated his desire to fundamentally change the federal bureaucracy by eliminating civil servants either deemed expendable or who do not exhibit sufficient loyalty to the president. He could start by reinstituting</span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/15/us/politics/trump-biden-schedule-f.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Schedule F</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an executive order issued late in his first term (and rescinded by President Joe Biden) to strip job protections from many career federal employees and make them more like political appointees who can be fired at will. This would devastate the Commonwealth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More </span><a href="https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/data-analysis-documentation/federal-employment-reports/reports-publications/federal-civilian-employment/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">federal workers live here than in any other state</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">; 85,000 live in Northern Virginia and another </span><a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/SMU51472609091000001SA" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">60,000 make Hampton Roads</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> their home. Many earn a good salary and cuts in their positions would mean losing state revenue that comes both from their income taxes and the sales taxes generated from their purchases. Remember sequestration, when Virginia took a disproportionate hit from cuts in federal spending? Or the various government shutdowns? When the federal government sneezes, Virginia catches a cold.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Substantial cuts in federal employment might not dramatically affect the state budget until Youngkin has left office, but budget writers are justifiably concerned about future revenue shortfalls, thereby making any major tax cut problematic. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The Medicaid dilemma</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Trump’s attack on federal employees may garner the largest headlines, his plans for cutting Medicaid pose more serious fiscal challenges for the states. Since 1965, Medicaid has been the largest source of medical and health care funding for poor and disabled Americans, providing free health insurance to over 80 million people, many of whom are children. It is administered by the states, but major program funding is provided by the federal government. For every dollar a state spends on Medicaid, Washington provides a match to cover the costs. The </span><a href="https://www.kff.org/medicaid/state-indicator/federal-matching-rate-and-multiplier/?currentTimeframe=0&amp;sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">match rate differs by state</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In states with higher per capita incomes such as Virginia and New York, the federal match equals 50% of costs. For poorer states like Mississippi and Alabama, the match is over 70%. Yearly federal spending on Medicaid exceeds $880 billion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Big changes in the program have occurred since passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010, which initially required states to expand Medicaid to people with incomes of up to 138% of the federal poverty level (which today equals </span><a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/documents/7240229f28375f54435c5b83a3764cd1/detailed-guidelines-2024.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">about $35,600 for a family of 3</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). In 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court </span><a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/10.1377/hlthaff.2012.0766" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">made this optional</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but since the ACA required the federal government to pick up 100% of the state costs for the expansion population (gradually declining to 90%), many states concluded that expansion was a great way to provide insurance to those who could not afford it. </span><a href="https://www.kff.org/status-of-state-medicaid-expansion-decisions/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forty-one states plus D.C.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> eventually embraced the plan. Virginia joined in 2019, and its expansion population now numbers 758,000 of the 1,872,000 state residents in the program. Today, </span><a href="https://ihodvirginiageneralassembly.s3.amazonaws.com/agenda_block_docs/attaches/000/001/025/original/FINAL__Medicaid_Forecast_Presentation_11-19-24.pdf?1732028008" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Medicaid covers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> almost 13% of the state’s population, and it is the second largest expenditure in the state budget.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia budget writers were recently informed that there is a $632 million Medicaid shortfall that will require addressing in the next Assembly session. While that may be enough to throw a monkey wrench into the Governor’s plan for a tax cut, it is potentially only the tip of the iceberg.  Reducing Medicaid funding has been the target of conservatives for decades, and, with Republicans in control of the presidency and both chambers of Congress, a serious effort likely will be made to make cuts. The Heritage Foundation’s</span><a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24088042-project-2025s-mandate-for-leadership-the-conservative-promise" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Project 2025 report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the Republican Study Committee’s</span><a href="https://hern.house.gov/uploadedfiles/final_budget_including_letter_word_doc-final_as_of_march_25.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> budget plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the FY 2025 House budget</span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/congressional-report/118th-congress/house-report/568/1?outputFormat=pdf&amp;s=1&amp;r=4&amp;q=%7B%22search%22%3A%22HCR+117%22%7D" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> resolution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> all propose Medicaid cuts, including the reduction of the federal match for the expansion population. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican proposals to reduce the match rate would be a budgetary disaster for all states, including Virginia.  Ironically, many of the states who voted for Trump would take the largest hit because their federal match is so high.  In Virginia, a reduction in the match for the expansion population to 50% reimbursement would mean </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">$3 billion</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> less per year for our budget, making the present shortfall mild by comparison. The commonwealth would either need to find additional funds to fill the gap, or dramatically cut services to those most in need.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="INl8ozxXyw"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/12/11/9-states-including-virginia-poised-to-end-coverage-for-millions-if-trump-cuts-medicaid-funding/">9 states, including Virginia, poised to end coverage for millions if Trump cuts Medicaid funding</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;9 states, including Virginia, poised to end coverage for millions if Trump cuts Medicaid funding&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/12/11/9-states-including-virginia-poised-to-end-coverage-for-millions-if-trump-cuts-medicaid-funding/embed/#?secret=dWE8qgV4U0#?secret=INl8ozxXyw" data-secret="INl8ozxXyw" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it gets worse. Buried in the 2018 Virginia Medicaid expansion authorization is language that requires the state to</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/12/11/9-states-including-virginia-poised-to-end-coverage-for-millions-if-trump-cuts-medicaid-funding/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> unwind expansion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> if the federal match falls below 90%. Eight other states  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Arizona, Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Montana, New Hampshire, North Carolina, and Utah) have similar </span><a href="https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/medicaid-expansion-is-a-red-and-blue-state-issue/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">laws</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that require termination of expansion if the share of federal funding drops.  This would create a bureaucratic nightmare and remove 758,000 recipients.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This places Youngkin in a serious quandary.  Many of the people in the reddest counties in Virginia who voted for both him and Trump would likely be seriously harmed if they no longer qualified for Medicaid or their benefits were reduced. The Governor, could, of course, propose new language in his budget to eliminate the requirement that the commonwealth abandon expansion if the match declines. Or he could speak out against any proposed cuts. To do either would likely draw the ire of the MAGA faithful, a group the governor is attempting to court as he contemplates a run for higher office.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most likely, he does nothing, in hopes the U.S. Senate has enough spine to prevent anything serious from happening.  It isn’t exactly leadership, but it preserves his options for another day.</span></p>

(Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s legislature and governor are embroiled in a “two scorpions in a bottle” fight over the new biennial budget, which must be passed by June 30, 2024, to fund the government. On Wednesday, both sides return to Richmond for the “reconvened” or “veto” session.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Budget battles in the commonwealth are not unusual, but this one is unique, both in the number of changes Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin proposed to the bipartisan spending plan and the rhetoric that has accompanied the process. Youngkin called the bill a “backward budget” and traveled the state on this theme. Legislators fired back, did their own tour and likened Youngkin’s actions to </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/03/26/this-is-what-spoiled-brats-do-democrats-blast-youngkin-on-budget/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“ what spoiled brats do when they don’t get what they want.”</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The governor has vetoed a record number of bills, including measures to protect reproductive rights and enhance gun safety. Since overriding a veto requires a two-thirds vote, expect the governor to win most of these contests.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="q5bzeOq3NY"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/02/20/the-politics-of-gotcha/">The politics of &#8216;gotcha&#8217;</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;The politics of &#8216;gotcha&#8217;&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/02/20/the-politics-of-gotcha/embed/#?secret=LkltpIUtiT#?secret=q5bzeOq3NY" data-secret="q5bzeOq3NY" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fight over the budget bill will be different. Youngkin was initially expected to use the power of the “line-item veto,” by striking specific provisions in the budget and then challenging the legislature to produce a two-thirds vote to override them. His targets were thought to be a tax on digital services he originally proposed and language that requires the commonwealth to rejoin the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI). But he abandoned this approach when legislators shrewdly drafted these provisions to make a line-item veto legally problematic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin instead proposed a record number of 233 separate amendments to the budget bill. Expect few of substance to pass. Each requires a simple majority vote to be included in the budget, and Democrats are still fuming over Youngkin’s rhetoric and vetoes over the last month. Youngkin will then face a difficult choice: He can sign the budget “as presented,” or veto the entire plan, demand a special session and a new budget. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The July 1 deadline for a new budget will then loom large. Fearing a government shutdown, agencies and local governments would scramble to construct contingency plans. Such uncertainty might even prompt a revisiting of Virginia’s celebrated Triple A bond rating, a fixture for more than 50 years. A lot is at stake. Ultimately, the legislature will get most of what it wants, even if it takes a special session to do so.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The legislature is the most powerful branch of government</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin is now learning what his predecessors discovered a long time ago — that the legislature is the strongest branch of government, and the commonwealth’s legislature is perhaps the strongest of all the states.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia General Assembly&#8217;s power over governors is a function of history, strong leadership and most importantly, the Virginia Constitution. Leery of executive power that evidenced itself in dictatorial colonial governors, our founders wrote the state constitutions to favor governance that is closest to the people — the legislature. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This legislative advantage is found in the Virginia Constitution. Virginia is the only state where the chief executive cannot serve consecutive terms, making it difficult for governors to extract concessions from legislators who will serve much longer. In their first year, they are learning the system. By their third year, they are viewed as “lame ducks.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This dynamic is now playing out in the budget bill. When Virginia governors take office, they are dealing with a two-year budget prepared by the previous chief executive. In most states, </span><a href="https://higherlogicdownload.s3.amazonaws.com/NASBO/9d2d2db1-c943-4f1b-b750-0fca152d64c2/UploadedImages/Budget%20Processess/NASBO_2021_Budget_Processes_in_the_States_S.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">newly elected governors submit a budget</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the beginning of their term. Not so in Virginia!  Newly sworn governors can propose budget amendments, but they are painting on a canvas that has been provided by their predecessor. The only budget plan that is uniquely theirs is created at the end of their second year in office. In their final year, they prepare another two-year budget, but they leave office before the legislature debates it in a new session with a new governor. This gives the legislature an edge in budget deliberations, and further fuels the adage frequently heard in Richmond that “governors come and go; the legislature is forever.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The commonwealth is now considering the only budget that is Youngkin’s alone. His best chance to leave a legacy is this budget; but his relationship with the legislature is putting this at severe risk.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Virginia’s legislature is uniquely powerful</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The power of the Virginia legislature extends beyond appropriations. The body has greater appointment powers than most state legislatures and can derail key nominees that the governor desires. Virginia’s State Corporation Commission (SCC) is a good example. Almost its own branch of government, its decisions affect everything from utility rates to insurance regulation. SCC judges are solely appointed by the legislature. In other states, not only do similar bodies have less power, but the regulators are either elected by citizens or appointed by governors.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, our legislature appoints the entire judiciary. Judges in most states  — including state supreme court members — are either appointed by the governor or elected by the citizenry. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is not the case in Virginia. The commonwealth and South Carolina are the only states where the legislature has total control of these selections. A Virginia governor cannot dispense political perks through judicial appointments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The system appears almost quaint by comparison to the rough and tumble statewide political campaigns for state supreme court positions recently witnessed in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. As more fundamental rights are litigated in the state courts, greater attention will be paid to the legislature’s choice of judges. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week, Richmond is focused on the budget, and my bet is that the legislature eventually will get most of what it wants. And it will then continue to exercise powers that its colleagues in other states cannot, and that arguably makes it the most powerful legislature in the country. </span></p>

Last Monday, the Democrats decided to play political hardball with an issue that is increasingly toxic to the GOP, especially in suburban districts: abortion. Conservative Republican Del. Tim Griffin from Bedford had introduced a bill would have denied public funding to clinics and hospitals that perform abortions, even if women had been victims of rape or incest, or their lives were endangered. And the Democrats pounced.</span></p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;‘A slap in the face’: Va. House GOP forced to reject own member’s anti-abortion bill&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/02/12/a-slap-in-the-face-va-house-gop-forced-to-reject-own-members-anti-abortion-bill/embed/#?secret=si5GsJZWWE#?secret=1uFGAkEOtr" data-secret="1uFGAkEOtr" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since Democrats are now in the majority in the Virginia legislature, they easily had the votes to kill the bill quietly in committee. But they had other plans in mind, and chose instead to utilize a rarely used parliamentary rule to force the measure directly to the House floor. They didn’t just want to embarrass the newly-elected patron, whose bill was so draconian in its prohibitions on abortion that it appeared to be a “messaging bill,” a measure typically introduced by a member to placate a base constituency even though it has little chance to pass. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More importantly, putting the bill on the floor would place Republicans in a dilemma. They could vote against the bill and draw a primary challenge from the right, or support the measure and have it used against them in the next general election. </span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Republicans created the rule</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans were incensed by this tactic, which they claimed to be unfair and inconsistent with the traditions of the oldest democratic body in the western world. What the public did not know, however, is that  Republicans were the source of the rule in the first place. Democratic protestations notwithstanding, the rule was adopted in 2008 and never rescinded during the next twelve years, when the GOP controlled the House.  And only Republicans had ever used the rule.  If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, Republicans should have been honored by the tactic. They were not.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The similarities between last week’s debate and the last time this rule was used are unmistakable. In 2008, Republicans forced</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?081+sum+HB852." target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">a bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> onto the floor that they defined as pro-union. They knew they could defeat the measure but wanted a floor vote to force Democrats to either reject their labor allies or, as former Republican Majority Leader Morgan Griffith proclaimed at the time,  “vote with the unions” and face the impacts at the polls. During floor debate, Republicans broke with the traditional deference accorded patrons to “strike” or remove the bill from consideration, arguing that once any measure is introduced, it is no longer  controlled by the patron but instead becomes the property of the entire House, which can then determine how best to handle it. Democrats valiantly fought the GOP tactics on the floor, but after receiving signals from organized labor that no retribution would come from opposing the measure, most ultimately voted “no” and Republicans never obtained their “pro-union” vote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, took the same position last week as his predecessor did fifteen years ago. He denied Del. Griffin’s motion to strike his bill. He ruled every motion made by the minority as “out of order.” This prompted Gilbert to attempt the unthinkable by challenging the ruling of the Chair.  He lost that vote too.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All that remained were the ironic warnings spoken by longtime </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Bobby Orrock, R-Caroline, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to “understand the consequences that may come home to roost for all the rest of us.”  And just as Republicans joined Democrats in defeating the 2008 proposal, the anti-abortion bill this year was dispatched as well. </span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Gotcha moments may be overrated</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each state legislative session has them – the moment when one party thinks they have the other party on the ropes and one single vote will make all the difference in the next election and whether they gain or lose the majority.  It almost never ends that way. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rarely does a state election turn on a vote on one bill, especially in today’s environment where all elections are increasingly nationalized. It is useful to draw contrasts and test the accountability of elected officials by having them vote on the significant issues of the day. And in Virginia, plenty of these contrasts will soon be drawn, as Democrats will send to the governor’s desk numerous bills on gun safety, minimum wage increases and reproductive rights that will likely prompt vetoes by Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin. But there are many instances where the only thing that survives so-called “gotcha moments” is the enmity that partisans feel toward each other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Democrats in 2008 and Republicans in 2024 both argued, some political actions are not easily forgotten, and today’s victory may easily become tomorrow’s defeat.</span></p>
