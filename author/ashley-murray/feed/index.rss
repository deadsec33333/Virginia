Biden on Monday commuted the sentences of 37 federal death row inmates. (Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)</p><p dir="ltr">President Joe Biden commuted the sentences on Monday of 37 death row inmates, citing his conscience as a force behind the decision. He also left the death sentences unchanged for three men charged with hate-motivated mass shootings and terrorism.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Biden, who imposed a moratorium on federal executions during his administration, commuted the death sentences to life sentences without the possibility of parole, saying in a statement that he’s dedicated his career “to reducing violent crime and ensuring a fair and effective justice system.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Make no mistake: I condemn these murderers, grieve for the victims of their despicable acts, and ache for all the families who have suffered unimaginable and irreparable loss,” Biden said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“But guided by my conscience and my experience as a public defender, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Vice President, and now President, I am more convinced than ever that we must stop the use of the death penalty at the federal level. In good conscience, I cannot stand back and let a new administration resume executions that I halted.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The three men Biden left on death row Monday include Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, sentenced in 2015 of bombing the Boston Marathon in 2013; Dylann Roof, sentenced in 2017 of fatally shooting nine members of Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in 2015 in Charleston, South Carolina; and Robert Bowers, sentenced in 2023 for the deadly shooting in 2018 that killed 11 worshippers at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The president’s commutations Monday come after he <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/biden-commutes-sentences-nearly-1500-people-pardons-39-historic-clemency-action" target="_blank" rel="noopener">commuted the sentences</a> on Dec. 12 of 1,500 people who were placed in home confinement during the coronavirus pandemic. He also granted pardons for 39 individuals convicted of nonviolent crimes.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Biden received <a href="https://penncapital-star.com/criminal-justice/shapiro-conahan-says-biden-commuting-kids-for-cash-judges-sentence-absolutely-wrong/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">criticism</a> from Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and others for including among the mass commutations a Pennsylvania judge convicted in 2011 of sending children to prison in exchange for millions of dollars in kickbacks from a private jail — a crime that became known in the commonwealth as the “<a href="https://penncapital-star.com/criminal-justice/shapiro-conahan-says-biden-commuting-kids-for-cash-judges-sentence-absolutely-wrong/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cash for Kids</a>” scheme.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Advocates for abolishing the death penalty and some U.S. House Democrats had <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-dem-quartet-calls-biden-spare-lives-federal-death-row-inmates" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pressured Biden</a> to commute death penalty sentences ahead of President-elect Donald Trump’s return to the White House. Trump expedited some executions during his first term.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In a statement, Trump transition spokesman Steven Cheung blasted the commutations.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“These are among the worst killers in the world and this abhorrent decision by Joe Biden is a slap in the face to the victims, their families, and their loved ones,” Cheung wrote. “President Trump stands for the rule of law, which will return when he is back in the White House after he was elected with a massive mandate from the American people.”</p>

Matt Gaetz, a Florida Republican, speaks at the Republican National Convention at the Fiserv Forum on July 17, 2024 in Milwaukee. The U.S. House Ethics Committee released a report Monday finding "substantial evidence" of misconduct by Gaetz. (Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)</p><p dir="ltr">President-elect Donald Trump’s first choice for attorney general in his second presidency, former Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz, paid for sex, including with a minor, used illegal drugs and sought to obstruct investigators, according to a U.S. House Committee on Ethics report released Monday.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://ethics.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Committee-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">42-page report</a>, the culmination of a years-long committee investigation, found that Gaetz, who denies the allegations, “regularly paid women for engaging in sexual activity with him,” used cocaine and ecstasy on multiple occasions between 2017 and 2019, accepted gifts including a 2018 trip to the Bahamas, and lied to the Department of State to obtain a passport for a woman he was sexually involved with and who he falsely claimed was his constituent.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Representative Gaetz took advantage of the economic vulnerability of young women to lure them into sexual activity for which they received an average of a few hundred dollars after each encounter. Such behavior is not ‘generosity to ex-girlfriends,’ and it does not reflect creditably upon the House,” the report stated, noting the former congressman violated Florida prostitution and statutory rape laws.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Gaetz has not been criminally charged.</p>
<p dir="ltr">But the <a href="https://ethics.house.gov/press-releases/statement-of-the-committee-on-ethics-regarding-representative-matt-gaetz-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">panel</a> cited “substantial evidence” that Gaetz had sex with a 17-year-old girl whom they refer to as “Victim A.” Evidence included “credible testimony from Victim A herself, as well as multiple individuals corroborating the allegation.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Several of those witnesses have also testified under oath before a federal grand jury and in a civil litigation,” the report continued.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Representative Gaetz denied the allegation but refused to testify under oath. He has publicly stated that Victim A ‘doesn’t exist’ and that he has not ‘had sex with a 17-year-old since I was 17.’ The Committee found that to be untrue and determined that there is substantial evidence that Representative Gaetz had sex with Victim A in July 2017, when she was 17 years old, and he was 35. Representative Gaetz’s actions were in violation of Florida’s statutory rape law,” according to the report.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Gaetz was chosen by Trump in November as his nominee to run the U.S. Department of Justice, even though Gaetz was previously the target of a department sex trafficking investigation that <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/doj-wont-charge-matt-gaetz-with-crimes-sex-trafficking-probe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">never</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/14/us/politics/matt-gaetz-investigations-explainer.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">yielded</a> <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/matt-gaetz-was-once-under-investigation-for-sex-trafficking-now-he-could-lead-the-justice-department" target="_blank" rel="noopener">charges</a>. Gaetz resigned from the House hours after Trump named him for the position.</p>
<p dir="ltr">After criticism from lawmakers and a spotlight on the House Ethics Committee’s probe, ongoing since April 2021, Gaetz <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/matt-gaetz-bows-out-trumps-pick-attorney-general" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bowed out</a> of the running for attorney general.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Gaetz continues to deny the allegations outlined in the committee report and sued the panel Monday. In the <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.275994/gov.uscourts.dcd.275994.1.0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">complaint</a>, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, Gaetz calls the committee’s decision to release the report “unconstitutional” because it does not have jurisdiction over a private citizen.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“There is a reason they did this to me in a Christmas Eve-Eve report and not in a courtroom of any kind where I could present evidence and challenge witnesses,” Gaetz <a href="https://x.com/mattgaetz/status/1871207714665197718" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> on X Monday.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Gaetz declined an opportunity to present his version of events to the committee, refusing an invitation to sit for a voluntary interview, the report said.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Debate over release</h4>
<p dir="ltr">The committee wrestled with the decision to release the report, <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-ethics-panel-republicans-vote-against-disclosure-gaetz-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blocking</a> the decision after meeting on Nov. 20 before reversing course in a Dec. 10 vote.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Committee Chair Michael Guest said in a statement Monday that he opposed the report’s release.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I believe, have publicly stated, and remain steadfast in the position that the House Committee on Ethics lost jurisdiction to release to the public any substantive work product regarding Mr. Gaetz after his resignation from the House on November 14, 2024,” Guest, a Mississippi Republican, said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“While I do not challenge the Committee’s findings, I did not vote to support the release of the report and I take great exception that the majority deviated from the Committee’s well-established standards and voted to release a report on an individual no longer under the Committee’s jurisdiction, an action the Committee has not taken since 2006,” Guest’s statement continued.</p>

Matt Gaetz is photographed inside the Rayburn House Office Building Feb. 27, 2019. &nbsp;(Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)</p><p dir="ltr">WASHINGTON — President-elect Donald Trump announced Wednesday that he intends to nominate U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz as the next attorney general of the United States, an unexpected pick as the Florida Republican remains the subject of a congressional ethics investigation for alleged sexual misconduct, illicit drug use and accepting improper gifts.</p>
<p dir="ltr">House Speaker Mike Johnson announced on Wednesday night at a GOP press conference following leadership elections that Gaetz has already submitted a letter of resignation from the House.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I think out of deference to us, he issued his resignation letter effective immediately of Congress,” Johnson said. “That caught us by surprise a little bit, but I asked him what the reasoning was, and he said, ‘Well, you can&#8217;t have too many absences.’”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Florida state law, Johnson said, provides an eight-week time frame for the governor to fill a vacancy. He’s already placed a call to Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is in Italy, to ask him to begin that timeline.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“And if we start the clock now, if you do the math, we may be able to fill that seat as early as January 3, when we take the new oath of office for the new Congress,” Johnson said.&nbsp; “So Matt would have done us a great service by making that decision, as he did on the fly. And so we&#8217;re grateful for that.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The position of attorney general requires U.S. Senate approval, and if confirmed, the four-term congressman and Trump ally would lead the massive U.S. Justice Department that oversees more than 40 component organizations and 115,000 employees, according to the department.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The announcement comes as U.S. special counsel Jack Smith&nbsp;<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/federal-prosecutors-move-wind-down-trump-jan-6-case-after-win-presidential-race" target="_blank">winds down</a> two federal investigations of Trump — one, alleging Trump improperly stored classified government documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate after leaving office, and the other stemming from his alleged scheme to subvert the 2020 presidential election. Justice Department memos from 1973 and 2000 concluded that criminally prosecuting a sitting president would impair the leader’s capacity to carry out the office’s functions.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump first announced his decision to choose Gaetz on social media, describing the congressman as “a deeply gifted and tenacious attorney, trained at the William &amp; Mary College of Law, who has distinguished himself in Congress through his focus on achieving desperately needed reform at the Department of Justice.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Revealing the information on Truth Social roughly 10 minutes before his transition team sent an official statement, the president-elect wrote that Gaetz “will root out the systemic corruption at DOJ, and return the Department to its true mission of fighting Crime, and upholding our Democracy and Constitution. We must have Honesty, Integrity, and Transparency at DOJ. Under Matt’s leadership, all Americans will be proud of the Department of Justice once again.” Trump routinely writes on social media in mixed capitalization.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Gaetz quickly published on the social media platform X that, “It will be an honor to serve as President Trump’s Attorney General!”</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Ethics probe</h4>
<p dir="ltr">The House Committee on Ethics&nbsp;<a href="https://ethics.house.gov/press-releases/statement-regarding-matter-representative-matt-gaetz" target="_blank">revealed</a> in June that it would continue pursuing allegations in its ongoing investigation of Gaetz, including the possibility the lawmaker may have “engaged in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, accepted improper gifts, dispensed special privileges and favors to individuals with whom he had a personal relationship, and sought to obstruct government investigations of his conduct.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Gaetz has “categorically denied all of the allegations before the Committee,” according to the committee’s June update on the matter.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The committee’s probe began in April 2021 and originally included allegations that the lawmaker “shared inappropriate images or videos on the House floor, misused state identification records, converted campaign funds to personal use, and/or accepted a bribe or improper gratuity.” The committee announced in June that it was no longer pursuing those specific accusations.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As of June, the panel had&nbsp;spoken with more than a dozen witnesses, issued 25 subpoenas, and reviewed thousands of pages of documents regarding the Gaetz probe.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Rep. Michael Guest, chair of the House Ethics Committee, told reporters Wednesday that if Gaetz is confirmed by the Senate as attorney general, his committee will no longer have jurisdiction over the probe.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Once we lose jurisdiction, there would not be a report that would be issued,” said Guest, a Mississippi Republican elected to Congress in 2019. “That&#8217;s not unique to this case, we have that every new Congress, where there are members who are under ethics investigation, who either choose not to run again, in some instances, or they resign or they lose reelection.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We&#8217;re not going to rush this investigation because of the appointment. And so we&#8217;re going to again follow the rules and the procedures that we set in place.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The ethics investigation is expected to wrap up following Gaetz’s resignation, though Punchbowl News&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/JakeSherman/status/1856859774211563535" target="_blank">reported</a> that the panel was set to release a “highly damaging” report in the days ahead</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Lawmakers taken aback</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Senators on Capitol Hill, who will have to vet and possibly vote to confirm Gaetz, expressed surprise at Trump’s announcement.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski said that she expected to consider another option at some point.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;s a serious nomination for the attorney general,” Murkowski said. “We need to have a serious attorney general and I&#8217;m looking forward to the opportunity to consider somebody that is serious.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Sen. Susan Collins of Maine said she was shocked when she heard the news. She said that she and her colleagues will want to question Gaetz.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Obviously, the president has the right to nominate whomever he wishes. But I&#8217;m certain that there will be a lot of questions,” Collins, a Republican, said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Texas Republican Sen. John Cornyn said he doesn’t know Gaetz “other than his public persona,” but said Gaetz will face questions and possibly challenges getting the votes needed for Senate confirmation.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll have a lot of questions, and I&#8217;m sure all that stuff will come out,” Cornyn said. “And then it&#8217;s a question of, can he get 51 votes?”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., said that Republicans were the ones to question about whether they’d support Gaetz’s nomination, since Democrats were unlikely to do so.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Talk to my colleagues, like, to see who&#8217;s gonna vote for, like, a jerk-off like that,” Fetterman said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Iowa Republican Sen. Joni Ernst said Gaetz “has his work cut out for him,” and that it will be up to the Judiciary Committee to decide whether to confirm him to the post.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Florida GOP Sen. Marco Rubio, who Trump on Wednesday nominated as secretary of State, said that he was supportive of the president-elect’s pick.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I’ve known Matt for a long time, I think he would do a good job,” Rubio said, adding that he wouldn’t comment further about the recent ethics complaints against Gaetz.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Democrats who sit on the Judiciary Committee that would be tasked with holding a nomination hearing for Gaetz, such as Cory Booker of New Jersey and Jon Ossoff of Georgia, declined to comment on the news.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I’m literally just walking out of a meeting and hearing this,” Booker said. “Give me a minute.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Wisconsin GOP Sen. Ron Johnson said he honestly doesn’t “know (Gaetz) that well or know his professional qualifications.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I know of his skill in questioning witnesses in the House,” Johnson said. “I really don&#8217;t know his legal background that much. I&#8217;ve never really spent much time with him, other than a couple times in different meetings, so I just don’t know him that well.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Rep. Jim Himes, ranking member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, issued a strong rebuke of Trump’s choice of Gaetz for the position.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The Attorney General of the United States must have strong judgement, moral character, and a deep respect for the law. As almost all members of Congress know, Matt Gaetz has none of those things. What he does have is unconditional loyalty to Donald Trump and a willingness to weaponize the government against his political allies— an affinity that he and the president-elect share,” Himes, a Connecticut Democrat, said in a statement.</p>

Biden continued the tradition of inviting the newly elected president to meet at the White House after Trump won the presidential election on Nov. 5. (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)</p><p dir="ltr">WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden welcomed President-elect Donald Trump to the White House Wednesday, a tradition between incoming and outgoing American leaders, though the courtesy was not extended to Biden after he won the 2020 election.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The pair met behind closed doors in the Oval Office for most of the meeting that lasted just under two hours. Biden’s Chief of Staff Jeff Zients and Trump’s incoming counterpart, Susie Wiles, joined the president and president-elect.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Biden had been seeking reelection against Trump until late July, when Biden dropped his bid. Vice President Kamala Harris lost the race to Trump after just over 100 days of campaigning as the Democratic nominee.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Harris did not attend the meeting, according to the White House.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In brief remarks before cameras, Biden congratulated his predecessor who will again take the oath of office in January as the nation’s 47th president.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Well, Mr. President-elect, former president, Donald, congratulations,” Biden said, as Trump interjected with “Thank you very much, Joe.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“And looking forward to having a, like I said, smooth transition, do everything we can to make sure you’re accommodated, what you need,” Biden continued. “And we’re gonna get a chance to talk about some of that today.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump again thanked Biden and responded “And politics is tough. And it’s, many cases, not a very nice world, but it is a nice world today. And I appreciate it very much, a transition that’s so smooth, it’ll be as smooth as it can get. I very much appreciate that, Joe,” Trump said.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">A ‘substantive’ conversation</h4>
<p dir="ltr">First lady Jill Biden joined the president in greeting Trump and presented a handwritten letter of congratulations and offer for transition assistance addressed to incoming first lady Melania Trump, according to the White House.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The meeting got underway just after 11 a.m. Eastern, and the press was ushered out after the brief welcoming remarks and photo opportunity. Biden and Trump finished their private discussion at roughly 1 p.m. Eastern.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Neither addressed a large gathering of reporters and photographers outside afterward.</p>
<p dir="ltr">White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Biden and Trump had “a very good back and forth.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“(Biden) wants you all to know that the president-elect was gracious, came with a detailed set of questions, it was, again, substantive” Jean-Pierre said at the daily press briefing.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Jean-Pierre declined to provide the meeting’s specifics but said “the length of the meeting tells you they had an in-depth conversation on an array of issues.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump did <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/biden-has-invited-trump-to-the-white-house-trump-shunned-that-tradition-when-biden-won" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not</a> invite Biden to the White House following his 2020 presidential election win, nor did he attend his successor’s inauguration that occurred just 14 days after a mob of his supporters violently tried to stop Congress’ certification of Biden’s victory.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The president-elect’s transition team did not immediately respond to States Newsroom’s inquiries on why Trump did not invite Biden to the White House in 2020.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Musk, Ramaswamy to head new initiative</h4>
<p dir="ltr">The president-elect continues to announce numerous Cabinet and staff positions, <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-names-floridas-rep-mike-waltz-national-security-adviser" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stacking</a> his administration with staunch loyalists.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Late Tuesday, Trump announced he named billionaire Elon Musk and former presidential hopeful Vivek Ramaswamy to what he describes as a new “Department of Government Efficiency,” or shortened to “DOGE,” also the name for a popular internet dog meme and cryptocurrency in the last decade.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump said the new entity would function outside of government.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“To drive this kind of drastic change, the Department of Government Efficiency will provide advice and guidance from outside of Government, and will partner with the White House and Office of Management &#038; Budget to drive large scale structural reform, and create an entrepreneurial approach to Government never seen before,” Trump said in a statement.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Musk was also present, sitting in the front row during Trump’s visit with House Republicans earlier Wednesday.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Also on Tuesday night, Trump announced Fox News host Pete Hegseth as his pick for secretary of Defense, a position that requires managing hundreds of billions in Pentagon spending.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Trump endorses Johnson</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Trump joined House Republicans Wednesday morning before his meeting with Biden at the White House. At a hotel near the U.S. Capitol, Trump received a standing ovation from GOP lawmakers, according to congressional pool reports.</p>
<p dir="ltr">House Speaker Mike Johnson, Republican of Louisiana, introduced Trump, calling him a “singular figure in American history,” according to congressional pool reports. </p>
<p dir="ltr">House Republicans are also planning to have their leadership elections late Wednesday, but it’s expected that Johnson will be selected to continue the role, although an official vote for the speaker’s gavel will take place in January.</p>
<p dir="ltr">At the meeting, Trump threw his support behind Johnson to continue in his role as House speaker, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/house-republicans-meet-triumphant-trump-elect-leadership-team-rcna179669" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to NBC News.</a></p>
<p dir="ltr">During the meeting, Trump touted GOP wins in keeping control of the lower chamber. Although Republicans are on track to hold their slim majority, The Associated Press, the news organization that States Newsroom relies upon for race calls based on <a href="https://www.ap.org/elections/our-role/how-we-call-races/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decades of experience</a>, has not called the House for Republicans though it might happen soon.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://apnews.com/live/election-house-trump-updates-11-13-24?tab=00000193-238b-dd90-adb7-bf9b31be0000" target="_blank" rel="noopener">As of Wednesday</a> afternoon, Republicans have 216 seats, just two short of the 218 seats needed for control. Democrats have 207 seats, with 12 races still to be called.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump also joked about wanting to run for another term in office — <a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-22/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">something that the U.S. Constitution prohibits</a>, as presidents are limited to only serving two terms. </p>
<p dir="ltr">“I suspect I won’t be running again unless you do something,” Trump told members, who laughed, according to pool reports.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Democrats ready to push back</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Chair of the House Democratic Caucus Pete Aguilar said Wednesday that Democrats are ready to work with the incoming administration in a bipartisan manner, but are also prepared to push back on efforts to further restrict reproductive rights, such as a national abortion ban, and any changes to the Affordable Care Act.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We’re clear-eyed about the challenge ahead of us,” Aguilar, Democrat of California, said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">He acknowledged the failure of Democrats to regain control of the House.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I think it’s appropriate for the current caucus to reflect on what happened, to listen to listen to our constituents, to listen to American people, to listen to our members, to gather data, and then to chart a path forward,” he said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Aguilar added that Democrats plan to look at voter data to understand the issues important to their voting bloc.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I don’t want to have broad generalizations of any group or geographic or otherwise, without that data in front of me,” he said. “I think it’s very clear to us that for people with two jobs, the economy is, gas and groceries and rent. We’ll need to speak to those issues if we’re going to be the party that speaks to our community members and people working, everyday Americans, then we need to speak to those issues, and … that’s on us to communicate.”</p>

(Photo by Steven Hirsch-Pool/Getty Images)</p><p dir="ltr">WASHINGTON — All court proceedings for President-elect Donald Trump’s guilty conviction in New York are now paused, as the prosecution examines moving forward with the case against the man who will be sworn in as the 47th president of the United States.</p>
<p dir="ltr">New York Judge Juan Merchan stayed all actions Monday in the People of New York v. Donald J. Trump until Nov. 19, according to email correspondence between all parties that was <a href="https://www.nycourts.gov/LegacyPDFS/press/PDFs/People-v-DJT-App4Adjournment11-12-24.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> by the court.</p>
<p dir="ltr">U.S. special counsel Jack Smith has similarly <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/federal-prosecutors-move-wind-down-trump-jan-6-case-after-win-presidential-race" target="_blank" rel="noopener">requested</a> a federal judge to delay proceedings in Trump’s 2020 election interference case.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump, who was found guilty by a jury in late May of 34 felonies in falsifying business, is scheduled to be sentenced on Nov. 26.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Merchan has yet to rule on Trump’s motion to dismiss the case based on the U.S. Supreme Court’s July presidential immunity ruling that triggered questions over what evidence against a former president can or cannot be admitted to a court of law.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Delay sought</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Merchan granted the delay in response to a joint application from both the District Attorney of New York’s office and Trump’s defense team, which wants the case altogether dismissed.</p>
<p dir="ltr">New York prosecutor Matthew Colangelo informed Merchan in an email Sunday that Trump’s team requested on Friday the state delay the case “to provide time to review and consider a number of arguments based on the impact on this proceeding from the results of the Presidential election.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Colangelo agreed the “unprecedented circumstances” presented by Trump’s election victory “require careful consideration to ensure that any further steps in this proceeding appropriately balance the competing interests of (1) a jury verdict of guilt following trial that has the presumption of regularity; and (2) the Office of the President.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Colangelo asked Merchan to give him until Nov. 19 to decide how and whether the prosecution will move forward.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Later Sunday morning, Trump attorney Emil Bove followed with an email to Merchan agreeing with the prosecution’s deadline request.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The stay, and dismissal, are necessary to avoid unconstitutional impediments to President Trump’s ability to govern, which is the broader argument that we made to DANY on Friday,” Bove wrote.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">34 felony charges</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Trump made history as the first former president to become a convicted felon when the New York jury on May 30 found him guilty on all 34 felony charges for covering up hush money payments to adult film actress Stormy Daniels just ahead of the 2016 presidential election.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The trial that stretched throughout the spring featured witness <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/porn-star-stormy-daniels-nyc-hush-money-trial-alleges-sexual-encounter-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">testimony</a> from Daniels about a sexual encounter with Trump in 2006 at a Lake Tahoe golf resort.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Former Trump attorney Michael Cohen was also called by the prosecution to <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/star-witness-trump-trial-tells-plot-conceal-porn-star-hush-money-payments" target="_blank" rel="noopener">give an account</a> of Trump’s concealment of 11 invoices, 11 checks and 12 ledger entries to repay Cohen for the $130,000 in hush money he paid to Daniels.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/angry-trump-pledges-appeal-scam-conviction-republicans-vow-resistance-24" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slammed</a> the trial and conviction as a “scam,” and Republicans showed resounding support for the former president during and after the proceedings, with House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, calling the verdict a “shameful day in American history.”</p>

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)</p><p dir="ltr">WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden on Thursday reassured the nation that democracy won despite his party’s resounding election losses, and promised his accomplishments will live on, in brief remarks from the White House.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I know for some people, it&#8217;s a time for victory, to state the obvious. For others, it&#8217;s a time of loss. Campaigns are contests of competing visions. The country chooses one or the other. We accept the choice the country made,” Biden said in just over six minutes of remarks to his staff and administration officials gathered in the Rose Garden just after 11 a.m. Eastern.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Former Republican President Donald Trump, now president-elect,&nbsp;<a href="https://apnews.com/live/trump-harris-election-updates-11-5-2024#00000193-0229-dcda-ab93-b2e9ada10000" target="_blank">handily won</a> the 2024 presidential contest Tuesday against Vice President Kamala Harris, earning victories in closely watched swing states, including Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump as of early Thursday afternoon had 295 Electoral College votes, to 226 for Harris, with 270 needed for victory. He also led in the popular vote.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Republicans also secured a Senate majority, gaining at least 52 seats while Democrats have 45. Control of the U.S. House&nbsp;<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/it-was-hell-good-day-us-senate-gop-takes-election-victory-lap" target="_blank">remained unclear</a>, though a trend toward GOP victory was emerging as ballots were still being counted.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Biden ran against Trump for the majority of the 2024 presidential race but dropped his reelection bid weeks after a disastrous presidential debate performance sparked a pressure campaign for him to step aside.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Biden phoned Trump Wednesday to congratulate him and arranged an in-person meeting to discuss the White House transition — a step that Trump did not take following his loss to Biden in 2020.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I assured him I’d direct my entire administration to work with his team to ensure a peaceful and orderly transition. That&#8217;s what the American people deserve,” Biden said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Biden also talked about his phone call Wednesday with Democratic nominee Harris, whom he described as a “partner and public servant.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“She ran an inspiring campaign, and everyone got to see something that I learned early on to respect so much: her character. She has a backbone like a ramrod,” Biden said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The president said he told his team that “together, we’ve changed America for the better.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Much of the work we&#8217;ve done is already being felt by the American people, with the vast majority of it will not be felt, will be felt over the next 10 years,” Biden said, specifically citing the bipartisan infrastructure legislation he signed into&nbsp;<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3684" target="_blank">law</a> in November 2021.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Harris&nbsp;<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/vp-harris-concedes-presidential-race-phone-call-donald-trump" target="_blank">conceded</a> the race Wednesday in a phone call to Trump.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?539843-1/vice-president-kamala-harris-concession-speech" target="_blank">speech</a> to somber supporters at her alma mater Howard University in Washington, D.C., the same day, Harris told the crowd “I get it” when it comes to feeling a range of emotions following the outcome.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“But we must accept the results of this election. … A fundamental principle of American democracy is that when we lose an election we accept the results,” Harris said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Following the 2020 presidential election, Trump and his allies challenged the results in dozens of ultimately unsuccessful lawsuits. Following his losses in court, Trump and a team of private lawyers continued to deny the election outcome and pressure state officials to manipulate slates of electors.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump’s repeated denials of his loss — including a speech on Jan. 6, 2021 where he told his supporters he would never concede — culminated in a violent attack on the U.S. Capitol as Congress met that day to certify the election results.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">Trump led with 267 Electoral College votes overall nationally, eclipsing Democratic nominee Vice President Harris’ 224, just before 3 a.m. Eastern, according to the AP. A total of 270 votes are needed to win.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Associated Press had not yet projected results for the other battleground states of Arizona, Michigan, Nevada and Wisconsin. Trump, however, held leads in all four. Alaska’s three electoral votes are reliably Republican and were expected in the morning hours.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Decision Desk HQ and Fox News also called Wisconsin for Trump, which would give him an Electoral College victory. The AP and other media that project election winners, including NBC News, CNN and The New York Times, had not called the race by 3 a.m. Eastern.</p>
<p dir="ltr">All results are unofficial until local election officials across the country <a class="ext" title="(opens in a new window)" href="https://www.eac.gov/election-officials/election-results-canvass-and-certification" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-extlink="">verify and certify</a> the outcome in the <a class="ext" title="(opens in a new window)" href="https://www.ncsl.org/elections-and-campaigns/election-certification-deadlines" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-extlink="">coming days and weeks</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump declared victory at his election night party just before 3 a.m. Wednesday.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Though votes in key swing states were still being counted, the speech signaled the end of an extraordinary presidential contest defined by Trump’s <a class="ext" title="(opens in a new window)" href="https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2024/11/04/trump-more-than-ever-mixes-anger-fear-and-insults-to-stir-supporters-say-researchers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-extlink="">divisive</a> rhetoric, his <a class="ext" title="(opens in a new window)" href="https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/CRIMINAL-INDICTMENT.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-extlink="">numerous</a> <a class="ext" title="(opens in a new window)" href="https://missouriindependent.com/2024/07/15/federal-judge-dismisses-trump-classified-documents-criminal-case/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-extlink="">criminal</a> <a class="ext" title="(opens in a new window)" href="https://missouriindependent.com/2024/09/05/judge-in-trumps-jan-6-case-says-it-wont-be-delayed-by-upcoming-presidential-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-extlink="">cases</a> and <a class="ext" title="(opens in a new window)" href="https://penncapital-star.com/campaigns-elections/fbi-identifies-shooter-in-assassination-attempt-on-trump-at-butler-rally/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-extlink="">two</a> <a class="ext" title="(opens in a new window)" href="https://washingtonstatestandard.com/2024/09/16/man-arrested-after-poking-rifle-onto-trump-golf-course-charged-with-federal-gun-crimes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-extlink="">attempts</a> on his life.

<h4 dir="ltr">    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Trump promises to ‘heal’</h4>

	</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Trump amassed electoral votes shortly after polls closed in states forecast in his favor, and picked up critical wins in key battlegrounds when the AP projected victories for him in <a class="ext" title="(opens in a new window)" href="https://ncnewsline.com/2024/11/05/ap-trump-wins-north-carolina/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-extlink="">North Carolina</a> just before midnight, <a class="ext" title="(opens in a new window)" href="https://georgiarecorder.com/2024/11/06/after-bitter-defeat-in-2020-trump-comes-back-to-win-georgia-in-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-extlink="">Georgia</a> at about 1 a.m., and <a class="ext" title="(opens in a new window)" href="https://penncapital-star.com/election-2024/donald-trump-projected-to-win-pennsylvanias-19-electoral-votes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-extlink="">Pennsylvania</a> just before 2:30 a.m. Trump won the key states in his successful 2016 campaign but lost them in his failed reelection bid in 2020.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Speaking to his supporters in West Palm Beach, Florida, Trump thanked “thousands of friends in this incredible movement like nobody’s ever seen before.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Frankly, this was, I believe, the greatest political movement of all time. There&#8217;s never been anything like this in this country,” Trump said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump promised to “heal” the country and that his second presidency “will truly be the golden age of America.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;We overcame obstacles that nobody thought possible,” Trump said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">During his roughly 25-minute speech, Trump thanked his family and campaign staff, and invited his running mate, Sen. J.D. Vance of Ohio, and Dana White, CEO of Ultimate Fighting Championship, to speak on stage.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Vance, poised to become Trump’s vice president, said a new administration would usher in an economic “comeback” for the U.S.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I think we just witnessed the greatest political comeback in the history of the United States of America,” Vance said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">White thanked popular podcast host Joe Rogan for his election eve endorsement of Trump.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“This is what happens when the machine comes after you,” White said. “This is karma, ladies and gentlemen.”</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Harris to speak Wednesday</h4>

	</h4>
<p dir="ltr">As election night turned into early Wednesday, the previously energetic crowd at Howard <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/harris-watch-party-dc-hope-gives-way-anxiety" target="_blank">started to dwindle</a>. Once campaign co-chair Cedric Richmond announced Harris would not be speaking at the party, the last stragglers left in waves, the mood quickly souring.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Richmond said that Harris would address supporters and the nation later Wednesday, and tried to give a small pep talk.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We still have votes to count,” he said. “We still have states that have not been called yet.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">In reference to reports that Harris’ watch party had begun to wind down, Trump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt commented on X “sounds like joy has left the building…” The word “joy” was a rallying cry among the Harris camp and supporters during her whirlwind campaign.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Billionaire Elon Musk, a major funder and surrogate for the Trump campaign, posted on his platform X a photo of a launching rocket ship along with the words, “The future is gonna be fantastic.” Shortly before that he posted a photoshopped image of himself hauling a sink into the Oval Office with the message, “Let that sink in.”</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘I don’t feel as hopeful’</h4>

	</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Harris had planned to spend election night at her alma mater, Howard University in Washington, D.C., where her supporters gathered, but she never left from the vice president’s residence at the Naval Observatory, according to press pool reports.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Early in the evening, Lalika Gerald, a Howard graduate from 2005, remembers studying TV production in the library that is now overlooking an election night rally for potentially the first Black woman to lead the country.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It’s a very exciting time just to be here and to know that a Bison like myself is about to be our president,” she said, referring to the university’s mascot.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The 41-year-old from Prince George’s County, Maryland, said she has felt a roller coaster of emotions throughout the day.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“As excited and as hopeful as I am, you know you never know what might happen,” she said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a moment for us to be really seen.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">By the time the event ended around 1 a.m., Harris supporters’ said the hope they felt at the start of the evening had left.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I don’t know what’s happening, but it’s very stressful right now,” Liane Crosey said as she left the watch party. “Seeing the numbers coming in, I don’t feel as hopeful.”</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">A convicted felon in the Oval Office</h4>

<p dir="ltr">Trump is positioned to make history as the first-ever <a class="ext" title="(opens in a new window)" href="https://idahocapitalsun.com/2024/05/30/breaking-trump-found-guilty-on-34-felony-counts-in-ny-hush-money-trial/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-extlink="">convicted</a> felon elected to the presidency. His long presidential campaign tangled with a busy legal calendar that included two federal cases, still <a class="ext" title="(opens in a new window)" href="https://missouriindependent.com/2024/10/03/special-counsel-jack-smith-reveals-new-evidence-against-trump-in-2020-election-case/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-extlink="">ongoing</a>, and cases in Georgia and New York. The former president was convicted in New York in May on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records related to hush money paid to a porn star ahead of the 2016 election. His sentencing is scheduled for Nov. 26.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump ascended on the campaign trail despite facing federal felony charges for scheming to overturn the 2020 presidential election.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Four years ago, Trump refused to concede to Biden in 2020 and lost dozens of court cases challenging the results.</p>
<p dir="ltr">His repetition of the lie that the 2020 was “stolen” from him became a main feature of his campaign rallies in 2024.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The major policy area he focused on during the campaign was curtailing immigration, and he promised to conduct mass deportations of immigrants in the country illegally. Trump and Vance also targeted legal immigrants, including by amplifying the debunked rumor that Haitians with Temporary Protected Status in Springfield, Ohio, were eating pets.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump also pledged to ramp up tariffs, taxes on goods produced overseas, in an effort to boost U.S. manufacturing.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump and campaign officials tried to distance the candidate from a comprehensive conservative policy blueprint written by the Heritage Foundation, a Washington think tank. The plan calls for restructuring the federal government to empower the president, further restricting abortion access and limiting immigration, among other proposals.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump would likely enjoy friendly lawmakers in Washington over the next two years, as Republicans were <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/republicans-take-majority-control-us-senate-after-ohio-west-virginia-victories" target="_blank">projected to win</a> control of the U.S. Senate. Control of the House remained unknown early Wednesday,</p>
<p dir="ltr">Despite several U.S. House races remaining too close to call, Republican Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana issued a written statement declaring “There is hope and morning in America again!”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Donald Trump is now our President-elect, chosen by the American people for such a time as this. The citizens of our great country used their voices to decisively reject four more years of Harris’ open borders, high crime, increased cost of living, weaponized government, dangerous radical woke ideology, and weakness on the world stage &#8211; demanding instead, a return to common sense, peace, and prosperity,” Johnson said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump is not officially president-elect until election results are certified.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">In the states</h4>

	</h4>
<p dir="ltr">States Newsroom journalists fanned out across the country Tuesday, talking to voters outside churches, community centers, schools and courthouses, where the presidential race not only weighed on their minds, but congressional contests and ballot initiatives as well.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Voter Stephanie Capps in Raleigh, <a class="ext" title="(opens in a new window)" href="https://ncnewsline.com/briefs/election-day-in-battleground-nc-voters-reflect-on-history-and-the-future-theyd-like-to-see/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-extlink="">North Carolina</a>, said she brought her 9-year-old daughter to the polls to show her democracy in action.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Because a little over 100 years ago, women couldn’t vote,” Capps told NC Newsline. “And so, we talked about how it’s really important for her to learn to vote.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The presidential campaigns continued to hit swing states, speak to the press and issue statements reminding voters of their rights.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Harris stayed in Washington, D.C, where she called in to several radio shows in battleground states. According to her campaign, she was a guest on Power 99 in Philadelphia with Cappuchino and KDKA NewsRadio in Pittsburgh with Larry Richert, the Big Tigger Morning Show in Atlanta, Georgia and Foxy 107.2 with Karen Clark in Raleigh, North Carolina.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I’m proud to have a lot of support out of Pittsburgh, it’s a historic city,” Harris <a class="ext" title="(opens in a new window)" href="https://x.com/KDKARadio/status/1853814481379266648" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-extlink="">told</a> Richert, who asked about her 10 campaign visits to the western Pennsylvania city.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Harris’ running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, stopped in Harrisburg, <a class="ext" title="(opens in a new window)" href="https://penncapital-star.com/election-2024/election-day-2024-live/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-extlink="">Pennsylvania</a>, Tuesday where he spoke to supporters and volunteers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Walz told reporters after the event “I think the choice couldn’t be starker.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump <a class="ext" title="(opens in a new window)" href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/113432133120615756" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-extlink="">posted</a> video messages on his platform Truth Social throughout Tuesday reminding voters to remain in line if they arrive before polls close.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Republicans, we’re doing very well. Stay on line, don’t get off line, and vote. Make sure you get through and vote. We’re gonna have a big victory tonight,” Trump said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Biden, who was the presumed Democratic nominee until he dropped his reelection bid and endorsed Harris just over 100 days ago, did not make any public appearances Tuesday.</p>

																						<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="1024" height="662" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/EarlyVotingNC-scaled-1-1024x662.jpg" class="attachment-large size-large wp-post-image" alt="" style="margin-bottom: 10px;" decoding="async" loading="lazy" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/EarlyVotingNC-scaled-1-1024x662.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/EarlyVotingNC-scaled-1-300x194.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/EarlyVotingNC-scaled-1-768x497.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/EarlyVotingNC-scaled-1-1536x993.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/EarlyVotingNC-scaled-1-2048x1324.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p style="font-size:12px;">Voters make selections at their voting booths inside an early voting site on Oct. 17, 2024 in Hendersonville, North Carolina. (Photo by Melissa Sue Gerrits/Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON — As an exceedingly bitter, tight and dark campaign for the presidency moves into its last moments, apprehensive election officials and experts warn Election Day is only the first step.</p>
<p>The closing of the polls and end of mail-in voting kick off a nearly three-month process before the next president of the United States is sworn in on Inauguration Day in January. New guardrails were enacted by Congress in 2022 to more fully protect the presidential transition, following the Jan. 6, 2021 mob attack on the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters and a failed scheme to install fake electors.</p>
<p>But even before that shift to a new chief executive begins, a presidential victor is unlikely to be announced election night or even the following day.</p>
<p>It’s a result that will possibly take days to determine, given tight margins expected in seven swing states. Officials needed four days to count all the votes to determine President Joe Biden the victor of the 2020 presidential election.</p>
<p>In states like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, the law does not allow that process to begin for millions of mail-in ballots until Election Day. Other states allow pre-processing of ballots.</p>
<p>Trey Grayson, Kentucky’s former Republican secretary of state, said ballot authentication could be on different timelines across the country after voting ends on Election Day.</p>
<p>“We have 50 states, plus D.C., that pretty much all do it differently,” Grayson, who served as president of the National Association of Secretaries of State, told reporters Friday on a call of bipartisan former state election officials who are working to explain the process to the public.</p>
<p>It could mean “in a very close election that we don’t know on election night who the president is or who controls the House or the Senate, but we should feel confident over the next couple of days, as we work through that, that we’re going to get there,” he said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Lawsuits and potential recounts </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Those delays, which former President Donald Trump seized on to spread the baseless lie that the election was stolen from him, are expected again in November, especially as all eyes will be on the battleground states — Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.</p>
<p>Additionally, there already are hundreds of pre-election lawsuits, mainly filed by Republicans, ranging from election integrity challenges to accusations of noncitizens allowed to vote in federal elections — something that rarely happens and is already illegal. The legal challenges could further spark delays.</p>
<p>“We will not have a winner on election night most likely and so we need to be able to prepare the public for this,” said Virginia Kase Solomón, the president and CEO of the democracy watchdog group Common Cause, during a Tuesday briefing.</p>
<p>She added that her organization will focus on combating misinformation and disinformation on election night and beyond.</p>
<p>“There is the potential that somebody could claim the win before … all of the votes have been counted,” she said.</p>
<p>In the early morning hours after Election Day in 2020, before results from key states were determined, Trump falsely claimed he won in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duE8tnrSmNc&amp;t=3s" target="_blank">an address at the White House.  </a></p>
<p>On top of that, experts say this year could see election denial erupting in countless courtrooms and meeting rooms in localities and the states, as well as across social media, if doubts are sown about the results.</p>
<p>Recounts could also delay an official election result, and the laws vary from state to state.</p>
<p>For example, in Pennsylvania, if a candidate demands a recount, three voters from each of the over 9,000 precincts have to petition for a recount.</p>
<p>“We’ve never seen that happen actually in Pennsylvania,” Kathy Boockvar, the commonwealth’s former Democratic secretary of state, said on Friday’s call with reporters.</p>
<p>An automatic statewide recount is triggered in Pennsylvania if there’s a difference of a half percent of all votes cast for the winner and loser. The final recount results, by law, are due to the secretary of state by Nov. 26, and results would be announced on Nov. 27, Boockvar said.</p>
<p>The margin in Pennsylvania’s 2020 results for the presidential election was between 1.1% and 1.2%, not enough to trigger the automatic recount, Boockvar said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Taking out the shrubs</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>State election officials have been preparing for the past year to train poll workers to not only run the voting booths but for possible violence — a precaution put in place after the 2020 election — and have beefed up security around polling locations.</p>
<p>On Friday, Trump posted on X that the election “will be under the closest professional scrutiny and, WHEN I WIN, those people that CHEATED will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the Law, which will include long term prison sentences so that this Depravity of Justice does not happen again.”</p>
<p>A reporter asked Grayson about the possibility of aggression from poll watchers. The Republican National Committee <a href="https://gop.com/press-release/trump-campaign-and-rnc-unveil-historic-100000-person-strong-election-integrity-program/" target="_blank">announced</a> in April a “historic move to safeguard the integrity of the electoral process,” establishing party-led trainings for poll watchers.</p>
<p>Poll watchers are not a new concept, and Grayson said clear “safeguards” are in place.</p>
<p>“If you’re intimidating, you’re gone. There’s clear laws in every state on that,” he said.</p>

<p>Celestine Jeffreys, the city clerk in Green Bay, Wisconsin, said during a Wednesday roundtable with election workers that the city has an Election Day protocol in place that includes everything from blocking off streets to City Hall to getting rid of shrubbery.</p>
<p>“We have actually removed bushes in front of City Hall” to ensure no one can be concealed behind them, she said. In the second assassination attempt on Trump earlier this year, a gunman hid in bushes outside Trump’s private golf course.</p>
<p>New Mexico Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver said during a Tuesday briefing she is focused on the physical safety of election officials.</p>
<p>During the event with the National Association of Secretaries of State, she said such safety is not only a priority during voting but when officials move to certify the state’s election results in December.</p>
<p>“We have all been spending a lot more time on physical security and making sure that our election officials at all levels are more physically secure this year,” Toulouse Oliver said. “And of course, you know when our electors meet in our states, you know, ensuring for the physical security of that process and those individuals as well.”</p>
<p>On Dec. 17, each state’s electors will meet to vote for the president and vice president. Congress will vote to certify the results on Jan. 6.</p>
<p>“We are thinking a lot more about this in 2024 than we did in 2020, but I think that each one of us… have a playbook in mind for how to handle any unanticipated eventualities in the certification process,” she said.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/law-enforcement-officials-prepare-possible-post-election-violence-dc" target="_blank">It’s a security precaution</a> that the U.S. Secret Service is also taking.</p>
<p>For the first time, Congress’ certification of the Electoral College on Jan. 6 has been designated a National Special Security Event, something that is usually reserved for Inauguration Day on Jan. 20.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The 2020 experience</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>In 2020, The Associated Press did not call the presidential election for Biden <a href="https://blog.ap.org/behind-the-news/calling-the-2020-presidential-race-state-by-state" target="_blank">until</a> 11:26 a.m. Saturday, Nov. 7 — roughly three-and-a-half days after polls closed. The AP, as well as other media organizations, project election winners after local officials make initial tabulations public.</p>
<p>Those tallies are then <a href="https://www.eac.gov/election-officials/election-results-canvass-and-certification" target="_blank">canvassed, audited and certified</a>, according to each state’s legal timeline. Recounts may also extend the timeline before final certification.</p>
<p>The vote totals reported in Pennsylvania — a state that carried 20 Electoral College votes in 2020 — put Biden over the top for the 270 needed to win the presidency.</p>
<p>Trump refused to concede the race, and instead promised to take his fight to court.</p>
<p>For the next two months, Trump and his surrogates filed <a href="https://electioncases.osu.edu/case-tracker/?sortby=filing_date_desc&amp;keywords=&amp;status=all&amp;state=all&amp;topic=25" target="_blank">just over 60 lawsuits</a> challenging the results in numerous states. Ultimately none of the judges found evidence of widespread voter fraud.</p>
<p>The next step was for Congress to <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2014-title3/html/USCODE-2014-title3-chap1-sec15.htm" target="_blank">count</a> each state’s certified slate of electors, which by law, it must do on the Jan. 6 following a presidential election.</p>
<p>However, in the weeks leading up to Jan. 6, Trump and his private lawyers worked to replace legitimate slates of electors with fake ones, according to <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/collection/january-6th-committee-final-report?path=/GPO/January%206th%20Committee%20Final%20Report%20and%20Supporting%20Materials%20Collection" target="_blank">hundreds</a> of <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/67656604/266/2/united-states-v-trump/" target="_blank">pages</a> of records compiled by a special congressional investigation, and by the U.S. Department of Justice.</p>
<p>Trump pressured then-Vice President Mike Pence to block ratification of the Electoral College’s vote at the Jan. 6 joint session of Congress, because the vice president’s role in the certification of electoral votes was not exactly clear in the Electoral Count Act of 1887.</p>
<p>Pence ultimately refused.</p>
<p>Thousands of Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 following a “Stop the Steal” rally at The Ellipse park, south of the White House, where Trump told the crowd “We will never concede.”</p>
<p>The mob assaulted police officers, broke windows to climb inside and hurled violent threats aimed at elected officials, including the desire to “hang” Pence. More than 1,500 defendants <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/44-months-jan-6-attack-us-capitol" target="_blank">have been charged</a> by the Department of Justice.</p>
<p>Congress stopped its process of reviewing the state electors in the 2 p.m. Eastern hour as police ushered the lawmakers to safety. The joint session resumed at roughly 11:30 p.m., and Pence called the majority of electoral votes for Biden at nearly 4 a.m. on Jan. 7.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">New law on presidential transition</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>To deter another Jan. 6 insurrection, Congress <a href="https://missouriindependent.com/2022/09/28/key-u-s-senate-panel-advances-bill-aimed-at-preventing-another-jan-6/" target="_blank">passed</a> the <a href="https://www.appropriations.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/JRQ121922.PDF" target="_blank">Electoral Count Reform and Presidential Transitional Improvement Act of 2022</a> as part of a massive appropriations bill.</p>
<p>The Electoral Count Reform Act codifies into law that the vice president, who also serves as the president of the U.S. Senate, only ceremoniously reads aloud a roll call of the votes.</p>
<p>Most notably, the provision raises the threshold for lawmakers to make an objection to electors. Previously, only one U.S. House representative and one U.S. senator would need to make an objection to an elector or slate of electors.</p>
<p>But under the new law, it would take one-fifth of members to lodge an objection and under very specific standards — 87 House members and 20 senators.</p>
<p>The Electoral Count Reform Act also identifies that each state’s governor is the official responsible for submitting the state’s official document that identifies the state’s appointed electors, and says that Congress cannot accept that document from any official besides the governor, unless otherwise specified by the state’s law.</p>
<p>Trump and his allies tried to replace legitimate slates of electors in several states with fake electors who would cast ballots for Trump.</p>
<p>The Presidential Transitional Improvement Act provides candidates with funding and resources for transitional planning, even if a candidate has not conceded after the election.</p>
<p>There are already issues with the transition of power. The top Democrat on the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability, Maryland Rep. Jamie Raskin, <a href="https://oversightdemocrats.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/democrats-oversight.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/2024-10-23.JBR%20to%20Trump%20and%20Vance%20re%20transition%20MOUs.pdf" target="_blank">sent a Wednesday letter</a> to Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, urging them to sign documents to ensure a peaceful transition of power.</p>
<p>“With fewer than three weeks left until an election in which the American people will select a new President of the United States, I urge you to put the public’s interest in maintaining a properly functioning government above any personal financial or political interests you may perceive in boycotting the official transition law and process,” Raskin wrote.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Denial expected at all levels of government</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Experts warn the effort to delay certification of the vote is largely being fought at the local and state levels, and that several groups are gearing up to sow doubt in the election outcome.</p>
<p>Devin Burghart, president of the Institute for Research and Education on Human Rights, said on a press call Wednesday that since 2020, “election denial has shifted away from the capital to county election commission meetings, courtrooms, cyber symposiums and countless conspiracies in preparation for a repeat this November.”</p>
<p>“This time, the baseless claim that undocumented immigrants are somehow swamping the polls has fueled the ‘big lie’ machine,” Burghart said.</p>
<p>Boockvar said the noncitizen topic is not new.</p>
<p>“I’d like to level set and remind everyone that it’s been illegal at the federal level since 1996 and you know, when you think back on 2002 the <a href="https://www.eac.gov/about/help_america_vote_act.aspx" target="_blank">Help America Vote Act</a> basically required voters to provide ID when they register, which is usually a driver’s license or a Social Security number, and states are checking that data against the DMV database. And these protections are enormously successful,” Boockvar said.</p>
<p>In two high-profile cases, the U.S. Department of Justice sued Republican-led efforts in <a href="https://alabamareflector.com/2024/10/16/federal-judge-blocks-alabama-secretary-of-states-voter-removal-plan/" target="_blank">Alabama</a> and <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/judge-orders-people-removed-from-voter-rolls-to-be-reinstated-gov-youngkin-to-seek-appeal/">Virginia</a> to purge voter rolls after alleging thousands of noncitizens were registered to vote. Both states were ordered to stop the programs and reinstate voters – though Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin promised Friday to appeal and even escalate to the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>More than 165 electoral process lawsuits across 37 states have been filed by both parties since 2023 leading up to the 2024 presidential election, according to a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2024-election-court-lawsuits-influence-voting/" target="_blank">survey</a> by Bloomberg of pre-election cases. The journalists found that more than half the cases have been filed in swing states, and challenge almost every facet of the voting process, from absentee voting, to voter roll management, voter eligibility and vote certification.</p>
<p>Republican and conservative groups have filed roughly 55% of the lawsuits, mostly aimed at narrowing who can vote, and overall most of the cases were filed in August and September, according to the analysis.</p>
<p>Courts threw out dozens of lawsuits claiming voter fraud in 2020.</p>
<p>Mai Ratakonda, senior counsel at States United Democracy Center, said anti-democracy groups have used litigation “to legitimize their efforts to sow doubt in our election system.”</p>
<p>“We’ve unfortunately continued to see this trend of filing lawsuits to bolster and legitimize narratives that our elections are insecure and laying the groundwork to contest results later,” Ratakonda told reporters on a press call Wednesday hosted by the organization, whose stated mission is to protect nonpartisan election administration.</p>

J.D. Vance squared off Tuesday night in a vice presidential debate that marked the last scheduled in-person meeting for the campaigns as Americans decide the country’s next chapter.</p>
<p>Meeting for the first time, Walz and Vance engaged in a policy-heavy, nearly two-hour back-and-forth hosted by CBS News at its studios in New York City. The debate was moderated by Norah O’Donnell, host of the “CBS Evening News,” and Margaret Brennan, who anchors the network’s Sunday political show “Face the Nation.”</p>
<p>The vice presidential candidates emphasized their modest upbringings and laid out their visions to lower high living costs, address charged issues like reproductive rights, immigration and gun violence, and navigate a quickly worsening conflict in the Middle East.</p>
<p>And, with the presidential contest marking the first since the violent aftermath of the 2020 election, and Trump’s continued false claims that he won, the moderators pressed the men on whether voters would see a peaceful transfer of power, no matter the winner. Vance would not provide a direct answer whether he would have certified the 2020 vote.</p>
<p>Walz is a second-term governor who previously served six terms in the U.S. House. Prior to his election, Walz worked as a public school teacher and football coach while also enlisted in the Minnesota Army National Guard for 24 years.</p>
<p>Vance served in the U.S. Marines for four years before earning his Yale law degree and becoming a venture capitalist and bestselling memoirist. He was first elected to public office in late 2022 to serve as Ohio’s junior U.S. senator.</p>
<p>The mostly amicable debate, with some moments of tension, was a noticeable departure from the bitter polarization on display daily during the presidential campaign. Walz and Vance shook hands and lingered onstage afterward chatting and introducing each other to their wives.</p>
<p>The presidential nominees, former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, met on the debate stage <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/harris-tears-trump-over-abortion-rights-and-race-tense-presidential-debate" target="_blank">last month</a> in a more acrimonious exchange during which the former president falsely claimed immigrants were eating pets in Ohio and Harris ripped into him for his remarks on race and abortion.</p>
<p>Trump has <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/harris-presses-trump-debate-again-and-democrats-launch-chicken-billboards" target="_blank">refused</a> to debate again. Following the Vance-Walz exchange, the Harris campaign renewed its offer for another presidential meetup offered by CNN in Atlanta later this month.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Growing Middle East conflict</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Answering the first question from the moderators Tuesday night, Walz and Vance sparred over which administration, if elected, would best quell signs of a widening war in the Middle East.</p>
<p>Tensions in the region escalated earlier Tuesday when Iran fired nearly 200 ballistic missiles at Israel, according to the Pentagon.</p>
<p>Walz accused Trump of being “fickle” on foreign policy and said the world is worse off since Trump <a href="https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/president-donald-j-trump-ending-united-states-participation-unacceptable-iran-deal/" target="_blank">pulled</a> the United States out of the Iran nuclear deal. Walz argued for “steady leadership.”</p>
<p>“You saw it experienced today where, along with our Israeli partners and our coalition, (we were) able to stop the incoming attack,” Walz said.</p>
<p>“It’s clear, and the world saw it on that debate stage a few weeks ago, a nearly 80-year-old Donald Trump talking about crowd sizes is not what we need in this moment,” the governor continued.</p>
<p>Vance maintained that Trump headed off heated global conflict by invoking fear.</p>
<p>“We have to remember that as much as Governor Waltz just accused Donald Trump of being an agent of chaos, Donald Trump actually delivered stability in the world, and he did it by establishing effective deterrence,” Vance said. “People were afraid of stepping out of line.”</p>
<p>The barrage in the Middle East followed Israel’s ground <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/01/israel-order-evacuation-southern-lebanon-border-villages-incursion" target="_blank">incursion</a> into Southern Lebanon and its recent <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/09/29/g-s1-25322/biden-nasrallah-hezbollah-israel" target="_blank">assassination</a> in Beirut of Hassan Nasrallah, leader of the Iranian proxy militant group Hezbollah.</p>
<p>While Israel intercepted the majority of the rockets Tuesday, U.S. Navy destroyers in the Middle East fired roughly a dozen interceptors at incoming Iranian missiles, Pentagon spokesman Maj. Gen. Patrick Ryder said.</p>
<p>The Biden administration promised “severe consequences,” though it has not provided details. Harris said late Tuesday that Iran poses a “destabilizing, dangerous force in the Middle East” and her commitment to Israel is “unwavering.”</p>
<p>Despite a <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/zelenskyy-washington-meets-us-leaders-beef-support-ukraine" target="_blank">visit</a> to Washington less than a week ago from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the CBS moderators did not ask about the ongoing war in Ukraine, and neither candidate brought up the costly and ongoing fight against Russia’s continued invasion.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">2020 election</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Vance and Walz sparred over how Trump handled his loss in the 2020 presidential election and his actions leading up to Jan. 6, 2021, when a mob of his supporters attacked the U.S. Capitol following a rally that Trump hosted.</p>
<p>Walz said while he and Vance found some areas of common ground at other points during the debate, the two were “miles apart” on Trump’s actions following the 2020 election.</p>
<p>“This was a threat to our democracy in a way that we had not seen, and it manifested itself because of Donald Trump’s inability to say – he is still saying he didn’t lose the election,” Walz said.</p>
<p>Vance didn’t directly answer whether he would have certified the electoral count for President Joe Biden had he been a member of Congress at the time, to Walz’s dismay.</p>
<p>“I’m pretty shocked by this,” Walz said. “He lost the election. This is not a debate.”</p>
<p>Walz said he was concerned that Vance wouldn’t follow the example set by former Vice President Mike Pence, who refused to go along with a scheme to recognize fake slates of electors and deny Biden the presidency.</p>
<p>Vance tried to pivot to Harris’ actions following the COVID-19 pandemic and whether she “censored Americans from speaking their mind” before saying that both he and Trump “think that there were problems in 2020.”</p>
<p>There was no evidence of widespread voter fraud during the last presidential election, during which Trump lost both the popular vote and the Electoral College.</p>
<p>Walz also criticized Trump and Vance for using the same narrative ahead of this November’s elections, saying they were “already laying the groundwork for people not accepting” the results should Trump lose.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Taxes and tariffs</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Both Harris and Trump have <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/taxes-where-do-trump-and-harris-stand" target="_blank">released</a> economic plans that would add trillions to the national deficit — though analysis after analysis shows Trump’s proposals <a href="https://budgetmodel.wharton.upenn.edu/issues/2024/8/26/trump-campaign-policy-proposals-2024?te=1&amp;nl=the-morning&amp;emc=edit_nn_20240903" target="_blank">outpacing</a> Harris’ by at least a few trillion.</p>
<p>Harris and Walz are <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/harris-unveils-plan-curb-price-gouging-boost-child-tax-credit-tackle-rent-hikes" target="_blank">running on</a> an “opportunity economy” theme that would permanently expand the Child Tax Credit, including giving $6,000 to new parents, and provide tax credits and deductions to first-time homebuyers and entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>Harris, following Biden’s earlier budget proposal, has said she would impose a minimum tax on high-wealth individuals, but vowed steeper levies on long-term capital gains.</p>
<p>Trump has promised to fund the Treasury’s coffers with money raised by taxing imported goods. Largely he wants to extend his signature 2017 tax law and permanently lower the corporate tax rate.</p>
<p>When asked by the moderators how the candidates could accomplish those goals without ballooning the national debt, both Vance and Walz sidestepped directly answering the question. Rather they touted Trump and Biden administration policies and then went on the attack.</p>
<p>“Donald Trump made a promise, and I’ll give you this: He kept it. He took folks to Mar-a-Lago (and) said, ‘You’re rich as hell. I’m gonna give you a tax cut,’” Walz said, adding that Trump’s tariff plan would be “destabilizing” for the economy.</p>
<p>Economists <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/taxes-where-do-trump-and-harris-stand" target="_blank">warn</a> that Trump’s plan to slap tariffs on imports across the board —  as high as 60% on Chinese imports and 100% to 200% on cars and John Deere tractors manufactured in Mexico — could cause consumer prices to increase and invite retaliation.</p>
<p>But Vance said he wanted to “defend my running mate” on the issue.</p>
<p>“We’re going to be taking in a lot of money by penalizing companies for shipping jobs overseas and penalizing countries who employ slave laborers and then ship their products back into our country and undercut the wages of American workers. It’s the heart of the Donald Trump economic plan,” the senator said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">High costs and housing</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Both candidates spent significant time addressing housing and child care costs.</p>
<p>Walz touted Harris’ “bold forward plan” that calls for construction of 3 million new homes and “down payment assistance on the front end to get you in a house.”</p>
<p>“A house is much more than just an asset to be traded somewhere. It’s foundational to where you’re at,” Walz said.</p>
<p>Vance said some of Walz’s ideas on housing were “halfway decent.”</p>
<p>One of the central pillars of Trump and Vance’s housing plans is to turn over federal lands to private hands for development.</p>
<p>“We have a lot of federal lands that aren’t being used for anything. They’re not being used for national parks. They’re not being used, and they could be places where we build a lot of housing,” Vance said.</p>
<p>On child care, Walz pledged a paid federal family and medical leave mandate as a priority for the Harris campaign, and advocated a parallel workforce development program for the care professions.</p>
<p>“We have to make it easier for folks to be able to get into that business, and then to make sure that folks are able to pay for that,” Walz said.</p>
<p>The dual goals, he said, “will enhance our workforce, enhance our families, and make it easier to have the children that you want.”</p>
<p>Vance said he sees an opportunity for a “bipartisan solution” to the high cost of child care, though he stopped short of agreeing with a federal paid leave law.</p>
<p>Instead he proposed expanding the potential recipients for federal child care grants.</p>
<p>“These programs only go to one kind of child care model. Let’s say you’d like your church maybe to help you out with child care. Maybe you live in a rural area or an urban area, and you’d like to get together with families in your neighborhood to provide child care and the way that makes the most sense. You don’t get access to any of these federal monies,” Vance said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Immigration, again</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Vance also repeatedly connected the housing shortage and high costs to immigration — the central issue for Trump’s campaign and a common answer from him for several of the nation’s woes.</p>
<p>The Ohio senator said housing is “totally unaffordable because we brought in millions of illegal immigrants to compete with Americans for scarce homes.”</p>
<p>“The people that I’m most worried about in Springfield, Ohio, are the American citizens who have had their lives destroyed by Kamala Harris’ open border,” Vance said, referring to the town where he and Trump falsely claimed over and over that Haitian migrants were stealing and eating pets.</p>
<p>Debate moderator Brennan pressed Vance on his claim: “Senator on that point, I’d like for you to clarify. There are many contributing factors to high housing costs. What evidence do you have that migrants are part of this problem?”</p>
<p>Vance said he would share on social media following the debate a Federal Reserve study that supported his claim.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Reproductive rights </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Access to abortion and fertility treatments was one of the more contentious areas of disagreement, though neither candidate trod new ground for their party.</p>
<p>Vance maintained the Trump stance that abortion laws should be set by voters or state lawmakers, while Walz said women and their doctors are best suited to make those decisions.</p>
<p>Vance told a story about a woman he grew up with having an abortion, then telling him a few years ago that “she felt like if she hadn’t had that abortion, that it would have destroyed her life because she was in an abusive relationship.”</p>
<p>“And I think that what I take from that, as a Republican who proudly wants to protect innocent life in this country, who proudly wants to protect the vulnerable, is that my party, we’ve got to do so much better of a job at earning the American people’s trust back on this issue, where they frankly, just don’t trust us,” Vance said. “And I think that’s one of the things that Donald Trump, and I are endeavoring to do.”</p>
<p>Walz rejected Vance’s position that state lawmakers should determine women’s access to the full slate of reproductive decisions, including fertility treatments.</p>
<p>Walz referenced some of the stories women have told in the last two years about being denied medical care for miscarriages or other dangerous pregnancy complications because of vaguely written state laws that banned or significantly restricted access to abortion.</p>
<p>“This is a very simple proposition: These are women’s decisions to make about their health care,” Walz said, later adding that people should “just mind their own business on this.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Gun violence</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The two vice presidential candidates had one of the more genuine exchanges of the debate after the moderators asked them about solutions for gun violence.</p>
<p>Vance conceded that he and Walz both want to reduce the number of people killed by guns every year, but said the solution should center around addressing illegal guns, including those used in drug trafficking, and through changing how schools are designed.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, I think that we have to increase security in our schools. We have to make the doors lock better. We have to make the door stronger. We’ve got to make the windows stronger,” Vance said. “And of course, we’ve got to increase school resource officers, because the idea that we can magically wave a wand and take guns out of the hands of bad guys, it just doesn’t fit with recent experience.”</p>
<p>Walz said school shootings are every parent’s “worst nightmare” before telling a story about how his son witnessed a shooting at a community center while playing volleyball.</p>
<p>“Those things don’t leave you,” Walz said, before talking about meeting with parents of the children killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut, when he was a member of Congress.</p>
<p>“We understand that the Second Amendment is there, but our first responsibility is to our kids to figure this out,” Walz said. “In Minnesota, we’ve enacted enhanced red flag laws, enhanced background checks.”</p>
<p>Walz said he absolutely believes Vance hates it when children die from gun violence, but added that’s “not far enough when we know they’re things that work.”</p>
<p>“No one’s trying to scaremonger and say, ‘We’re taking your guns,” Walz said. “But I ask all of you out there, ‘Do you want your schools hardened to look like a fort?’ … when we know there’s countries around the world that their children aren’t practicing these types of drills.”</p>
<p>Vance expressed sympathy that Walz’s son had witnessed a shooting and thanked him for bringing up Finland as an example of a country with a high rate of gun ownership that doesn’t have school shootings.</p>
<p>“I do think it illustrates some of the, frankly, weird differences between our own country’s gun violence problem and Finland,” Vance said, before mentioning higher rates of substance abuse and mental health issues within the United States.</p>
<p>“I don’t think it’s the whole reason why we have such a bad gun violence problem, but I do think it’s a big piece of it,” Vance said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Hurricane Helene response, climate change </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The two candidates expressed dismay about the destruction stemming from Hurricane Helene in states in the Southeast, but disagreed about how best to address climate change.</p>
<p>Vance said “a lot of people are justifiably worried about all these crazy weather patterns,” before criticizing how Democrats have drafted climate change laws.</p>
<p>“This idea that carbon emissions drive all the climate change; well let’s just say that’s true, just for the sake of arguments,” Vance said. “Well, if you believe that, what would you want to do? The answer is that you’d want to restore as much American manufacturing as possible, and you’d want to produce as much energy as possible in the United States of America, because we’re the cleanest economy in the entire world.”</p>
<p>Walz said that Biden and Harris have worked with Congress to enact legislation addressing climate change that also created jobs.</p>
<p>“We are producing more natural gas and more oil at any time than we ever have. We’re also producing more clean energy,” Walz said. “Reducing our impact is absolutely critical, but this is not a false choice. You can do that at the same time you’re creating the jobs that we’re seeing all across the country.”</p>
<p>Walz also said that farmers in Minnesota know climate change is real because some years they experience significant drought and other years they’re inundated with too much rain for their crops to handle.</p>
<p>“They’ve seen 500-year droughts, 500-year floods back-to-back,” Walz said. “But what they’re doing is adapting, and this has allowed them to tell me, ‘Look, I harvest corn, I harvest soybeans, and I harvest wind.’”</p>

Vance and Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz will face off Tuesday night for a vice presidential debate, the final scheduled in-person exchange between the campaigns as polls continue to show a tight race just over five weeks out from November’s election.</p>
<p>The debate, hosted by CBS News, is scheduled to begin at 9 p.m. Eastern and last for 90 minutes. The event will air live on local CBS affiliate stations and stream on the CBS News app, CBSNews.com, YouTube and Paramount+.</p>
<p>The matchup between the running mates of former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris brings together two men who both claim congressional records and previous service in the U.S. armed forces.</p>
<p>The debate also comes as the southeastern U.S. <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/biden-pledges-federal-help-states-southeast-stricken-catastrophic-storm" target="_blank">reels</a> from the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, which barreled inland as a tropical storm that brought record-breaking flooding and claimed more than 100 lives — a third of them in North Carolina, a swing state in the 2024 presidential election.</p>
<p>Republican National Committee and Trump campaign officials said Monday that Vance, Ohio’s junior senator, plans to attack Walz during the debate on several fronts, including tying Walz to the Biden administration.</p>
<p>“No amount of Minnesota nice is going to make up for the fact that Walz embodies the same disastrous economic, open-border and soft-on-crime (record) Harris has inflicted on our country over the last four years,” said Minnesota GOP Congressman Tom Emmer, who has been standing in as Walz during Vance’s debate prep.</p>
<p>“J.D. Vance is prepared to wipe the floor with Tim Walz and expose him for the radical liberal he is,” Emmer told reporters on a Monday morning call.</p>
<p>But Jason Miller, senior adviser for the Trump campaign, warned “Walz is very good at debates. I want to repeat that Tim Walz is very good in debates, really good. He’s been a politician for nearly 20 years.”</p>
<p>Trump <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/113227471530921481" target="_blank">posted</a> Monday on his Truth Social platform that he will be doing a “personal play by play” of the debate.</p>
<p>The Harris campaign has not revealed details about Walz’s debate preparation. CNN <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/28/politics/tim-walz-vice-president-debate/index.html" target="_blank">reported</a> that Walz is nervous and has been practicing with Department of Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg as a stand-in for Vance.</p>
<p>Walz spent Saturday in Ann Arbor at the University of Michigan Wolverines vs. University of Minnesota Golden Gophers football game, where he was greeted by local elected officials and rallied students about the importance of the youth vote, according to the campaign.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Military service, China</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Trump campaign surrogates said debate watchers are guaranteed to see Vance attack Walz on his military service.</p>
<p>Vance touts his own four years in the U.S. Marine Corps from 2003 to 2007, during which he was <a href="https://www.armytimes.com/news/your-military/2024/08/06/jd-vance-represents-veterans-on-ballot-but-some-ask-at-what-cost/" target="_blank">deployed</a> to Iraq in 2005 as a military journalist.</p>
<p>The Trump campaign maintains Walz retired to avoid being deployed to Iraq. Trump campaign officials featured two veterans on Monday’s call who slammed Walz for being a “turncoat.”</p>
<p>“He deserted his post and his unit after 24 years of military service,” said Tom Behrends, a retired Command Sergeant Major for the Minnesota National Guard.</p>
<p>Walz, a former six-term congressman who represented the state’s 1st Congressional District, served in the Army National Guard for 24 years prior to running for office. He deployed to Italy between 2003 and 2004 to support Operation Enduring Freedom, a non-combat post.</p>
<p>A fact check by PolitiFact <a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/aug/09/jd-vance/jd-vance-attacked-tim-walz-on-military-record-his/" target="_blank">found</a> he filed his candidacy paperwork in February 2005, a month before the Walz battalion was notified of possible deployment within two years. Walz filed retirement paperwork five to seven months before the deployment notification, according to the fact check.</p>
<p>Walz led a U.S. House resolution in 2007 to honor the Minnesota service members for their deployment to Iraq, <a href="https://www.nationalguard.mil/News/Article/573070/guard-unit-recognized-for-record-deployment/" target="_blank">according</a> to the National Guard.</p>
<p>Walz carries the distinction of being the highest-ranking enlisted soldier to ever serve in Congress, <a href="https://www.congress.gov/115/meeting/house/105558/witnesses/HHRG-115-HA00-Bio-WalzT-20170215.pdf" target="_blank">according</a> to his congressional biography published in 2017.</p>
<p>Walz suffered hearing loss and tinnitus after specializing in heavy artillery for two decades, according to Department of Veterans Affairs records he shared with journalists when running for governor in 2018.</p>
<p>He wrote in a 2013 benefits application that blasts “would knock us down and after firing I had ringing in my ears,” <a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2018/10/03/tim-walz-national-guard-career-minnesota-governor-race" target="_blank">according</a> to the records reviewed by Minnesota Public Radio. Eventually Walz underwent surgery to improve his hearing loss.</p>
<p>Retired Sgt. 1st Class Tom Schilling, who joined the RNC call Monday, also attacked Walz’s trips to China and how the governor handled “the George Floyd thing,” referring to protests that rocked Minneapolis following the murder of Floyd, a Black man, by police.</p>
<p>“He had 30 trips to China that really haven’t been answered. As a governor, he let Minneapolis burn,” said Schilling, who served in the Minnesota National Guard.</p>
<p>Walz has said he’s proud of the way local, state and federal officials handled the protests in Minneapolis and St. Paul. Walz ordered full National Guard mobilization roughly three days into the protests. However, Democratic Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and state Republican officials both criticized parts of the response by Walz, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/walz-george-floyd-riots-minnesota-national-guard-2b9b0bf883828e0429c379843f16005d" target="_blank">according</a> to a review by The Associated Press.</p>
<p>Walz taught for a year in the southern China city of Foshan. As a public school teacher in Minnesota he then took students on annual trips to China. In the past he said he visited China <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXqY0Eb_QAI&amp;t=415s" target="_blank">30 times</a>. When pressed for documentation of the trips by <a href="https://www.apmreports.org/story/2024/09/30/tim-walz-experience-in-china" target="_blank">APM Reports</a>, the Harris campaign said his visits totaled “closer to 15.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Trump visits Helene’s destruction in Georgia</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Trump <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?538811-1/fmr-pres-trump-remarks-georgia-hurricane-helene" target="_blank">delivered</a> remarks Monday in front of a damaged furniture store in Valdosta, Georgia, wearing his signature red “Make America Great Again” hat.</p>
<p>“We’re here today to stand in complete solidarity with the people of Georgia, with all of those suffering in the terrible aftermath of Hurricane Helene,” Trump said, standing alongside American evangelist Franklin Graham, who was coordinating the delivery of supplies.</p>
<p>Trump also said the presidential campaigns should take a backseat to the storm response. “We’re not talking about politics now, we have to all get together and get this solved.”</p>
<p>Moments later he stated falsely that Biden had not taken calls from Georgia’s Republican Gov. Brian Kemp. Biden had spoken with Kemp by phone Sunday.</p>
<p>Journalists traveling with Harris in Las Vegas, Nevada, reported in the wee hours of Monday that the vice president was canceling her campaign events to return to Washington. D.C., to be briefed on the response to Helene.</p>
<p>Harris issued a statement Saturday saying that her “heart goes out to everyone impacted by the devastation unleashed by Hurricane Helene.</p>
<p>“Doug and I are thinking of those who tragically lost their lives and we are keeping all those who loved them in our prayers during the difficult days ahead. President Biden and I remain committed to ensuring that no community or state has to respond to this disaster alone,” she continued.</p>
<p>At his campaign rally Sunday in Erie, Pennsylvania, Trump criticized Harris for being in San Francisco “at fundraising events with her Radical Left lunatic donors, when big parts of our country have been devastated by that massive hurricane and are underwater, with many, many people dead.”</p>

<p>President Joe Biden <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/biden-pledges-federal-help-states-southeast-stricken-catastrophic-storm" target="_blank">delivered</a> remarks from the White House early Monday and pledged federal support to the affected areas. Biden has already issued <a href="https://www.fema.gov/disaster/declarations?page=0" target="_blank">emergency declarations</a> for Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia. He also said he would visit the storm-ravaged areas as soon as his motorcade would not get in the way of response efforts.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Republicans for Harris</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The Harris campaign continues to tout its growing endorsements from Republicans.</p>
<p>Former conservative Sen. Jeff Flake, of Arizona, announced his endorsement of Harris over the weekend.</p>
<p>“I’ve served with Kamala in the U.S. Senate. I’ve also served with Tim in the House of Representatives. I know them. I know first hand of their fine character and love of country,” Flake <a href="https://x.com/JeffFlake/status/1840347576823902338" target="_blank">wrote</a> on X Sunday.</p>
<p>Republican Voters Against Trump also announced on Sunday a new multi-million-dollar ad blitz in swing states.</p>
<p>The group launched a $5.8 million ad campaign in Pennsylvania’s Philadelphia, Harrisburg and Pittsburgh media markets. The ad launch is part of a $15 million campaign that will also reach <a href="https://azmirror.com/briefs/anti-trump-gop-group-hopes-to-convince-arizona-republicans-to-back-harris/" target="_blank">Arizona</a>, Michigan and Wisconsin, according to a press release.</p>
<p>“Many swing voters are going to be making up their minds in the coming weeks, and it’s critical that we let them know what’s at stake,” Sarah Longwell, the political action committee’s executive director, said in a statement.</p>
<p>“You can repudiate him without renouncing your deeply held conservative values. We’re here to help establish a permission structure for right-leaning swing voters to do the right thing and vote their conscience,” the statement continued.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Ahead on the campaign trail</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Trump is scheduled Saturday to <a href="https://penncapital-star.com/election-2024/trump-to-hold-rally-at-pennsylvania-site-where-he-survived-assassination-attempt/" target="_blank">return</a> to Butler, Pennsylvania — the location of the first attempt on his life, during which he suffered a non-life-threatening ear injury and one spectator was killed by gunfire while two others were severely injured.</p>
<p>Trump also plans to hold a town hall Thursday in Fayetteville, North Carolina, well east of the devastation caused by Helene.</p>

<p>The debate at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia hosted by ABC News just 56 days before the election was also notable as the first exchange between the candidates since President Joe Biden <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/president-joe-biden-bows-out-reelection-campaign-harris-vows-win-nomination-8" target="_blank">exited</a> the race weeks after his botched debate performance in late June.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="3n2bUmc54v"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/new-polling-finds-harris-ahead-of-trump-by-a-comfortable-margin-in-virginia/">New polling finds Harris ahead of Trump by a comfortable margin in Virginia</a></p></blockquote>

<p>It is the only debate the campaigns have agreed to before the November election, although the Harris camp afterward suggested they’re ready for another and Fox News offered to host it in October.</p>
<p>The night began with Democratic nominee Harris crossing the stage to initiate a handshake and introducing herself to Trump, the GOP candidate. The two had never before met.</p>
<p>But the back-and-forth quickly grew contentious, as Trump blasted Harris’ record as vice president under President Joe Biden, and Harris said Trump was unfit to be president for myriad reasons. The two did not shake hands at the close.</p>
<p>Harris portrayed herself as a champion of the middle class. She presented a hopeful vision of the country that she sought to contrast with what she described as Trump’s self-centered vision that included attacks on the country’s democratic traditions and people of color.</p>
<p>“I am actually the only person on this stage who has a plan that is about lifting up the middle class and working people of America,” she said. “I believe in the ambition, the aspirations, the dreams of the American people.”</p>
<p>The vice president lambasted Trump as “extreme” and sought to tie him to the ultraconservative Project 2025, with which he denied an association. Harris also underscored the numerous legal cases Trump <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trumps-jan-6-case-extend-beyond-election-day-under-timeline-laid-out-judge%C2%A0-2" target="_blank">continues</a> to face. Trump is the first former president to become a <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-found-guilty-34-felony-counts-ny-hush-money-trial-10" target="_blank">convicted</a> felon.</p>
<p>“Donald Trump actually has no plan for you,” she said. “Because he is more interested in defending himself than he is in looking out for you.”</p>
<p>Trump repeated unverified claims about migrants eating dogs in Ohio, returned time and again to complaints about immigration, defended his plan to raise tariffs and boasted about campaign rally crowd sizes — after Harris taunted him about his events, saying people left.</p>
<p>“In Springfield, they’re eating the dogs, the people that came in, they’re eating the cats. They’re eating, they’re eating the pets of the people that live there,” Trump said in one of the more jarring moments of the debate, when he repeated <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/misinformation/jd-vance-ohio-police-no-reports-haitian-immigrants-harming-pets-rcna170271" target="_blank">baseless</a> claims about Haitian migrants. The rumors have circulated on social media in recent days, and have been <a href="https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/GXC9L0aXQAAjeIm.jpeg" target="_blank">amplified</a> by Trump’s running mate, Ohio U.S. Sen. J.D. Vance.</p>
<p>Trump challenged Harris to use her position in the administration to address inflation and immigration, suggesting that she was not actually able to follow through on her promises.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="LvYR73wQrF"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/08/15/im-entitled-to-personal-attacks-against-harris-trump-asserts/"> ‘I’m entitled to personal attacks’ against Harris, Trump asserts</a></p></blockquote>

<p>“She doesn’t have a plan,” he said. “She copied Biden’s plan, and it’s like four sentences like, ‘Run, Spot, run,’ four sentences that are just, ‘Oh, we’ll try and lower taxes.’ She doesn’t have a plan.”</p>
<p>Polls show the race is <a href="https://scri.siena.edu/category/political/nyt/" target="_blank">virtually tied</a> nationally and in seven key states that will decide the Electoral College margin: Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia, North Carolina, Arizona and Nevada. Harris enjoyed a polling bump soon after she became a candidate, but her numbers have dropped in the weeks since and recent polls showed her roughly even with Trump.</p>
<p>Among the top moments of the night touching on policy and politics:</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Election integrity</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The 2024 presidential election marks a test for the peaceful transfer of power after political violence marred the nation’s tradition when Trump’s refusal to accept his loss sparked a Jan. 6, 2021 riot at the U.S. Capitol.</p>
<p>Trump repeated false claims during Tuesday’s debate that he won the 2020 presidential election, even walking back recent public statements that seemed to accept defeat.</p>
<p>Asked by moderator David Muir if recent statements that he “lost by a whisker” and similar sentiments were acknowledgements he’d lost, Trump said the comments were sarcastic.</p>
<p>“I don’t acknowledge that at all,” he said. “That was said sarcastically.”</p>
<p>Harris called Trump’s answer “deeply troubling.”</p>
<p>“You did, in fact, lose that election,” she told him. She added that his continued denial “leads one to believe that perhaps we do not have, in the candidate to my right, the temperament or the ability to not be confused about fact. That’s deeply troubling, and the American people deserve better.</p>
<p>When asked if he regretted any of his actions when the U.S. Capitol was violently overrun by his supporters, Trump defended himself and returned to the topic of immigration.</p>
<p>“I had nothing to do with that, other than they asked me to make a speech,” Trump said.</p>
<p>Harris responded: “For everyone watching who remembers what January 6 was, I say ‘We don’t have to go back.’”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Race</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Moderators asked Trump about his <a href="https://georgiarecorder.com/2024/07/31/trump-insults-harris-makes-false-claims-quarrels-with-black-journalists-at-conference/" target="_blank">disparaging comments</a> about Harris’ biracial identity to the National Association of Black Journalists last month. Muir questioned if it was appropriate for Trump to weigh in on his opponent’s race.</p>
<p>Trump said it was not appropriate, but seemed to defend the comment that Harris had “turned Black” to promote her political career.</p>
<p>“I don’t care what she is,” he said. “Whatever she wants to be is OK with me. All I can say is that I read where she was not Black, that she put out, and I’ll say that, and then I read that she was Black, and that’s okay. Either one was okay with me. That’s up to her.”</p>
<p>Harris called it “a tragedy” that Trump continued “to use race to divide the American people.”</p>
<p>She invoked allegations that he refused to rent his residential properties to Black families, spread conspiracy theories that the first Black president, Barack Obama, was not born in the United States and supported the execution of Black and Latino boys accused of murder in New York’s Central Park. The suspects were later exonerated.</p>
<p>“The American people want better than that, want better than this,” she said, adding that voters wanted a conversation about how candidates could improve their lives. “Regardless of people’s color or the language their grandmother speaks, we all have the same dreams and aspirations, and want a president who invests in those, not in hate and division.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Abortion and IVF</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The 2024 presidential election is the first since the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in a 6-3 decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.</p>
<p>While Trump told debate moderators that he would not sign a nationwide abortion bill into law, he refused to give a yes or no answer when asked if he would veto one.</p>
<p>Moderator Linsey Davis corrected Trump after he claimed that some states allow abortion “in the ninth month,” but he continued to repeat it throughout the debate.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="qw37QWvj2i"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/08/13/virginia-democrats-do-not-support-infanticide-but-heres-why-trump-keeps-saying-they-do/">Virginia Democrats do not support infanticide, but here’s why Trump keeps saying they do</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Virginia Democrats do not support infanticide, but here’s why Trump keeps saying they do&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/08/13/virginia-democrats-do-not-support-infanticide-but-heres-why-trump-keeps-saying-they-do/embed/#?secret=O8snATNWbx#?secret=qw37QWvj2i" data-secret="qw37QWvj2i" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p>Trump hailed the Supreme Court justices — three of whom he appointed — for giving full control of abortion laws to state governments.</p>
<p>“What I did is something, for 52 years, they have been trying to get Roe v. Wade into the states, and through the genius and heart and strength of six Supreme Court justices, we were able to do that,” Trump said, adding that he “strongly” believes in exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother.</p>
<p>Harris said she would “proudly” sign a bill into law that restored the federal right to an abortion.</p>
<p>“One does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government and Donald Trump certainly should not be telling a woman what to do with her body,” Harris said.</p>
<p>She attacked what she dubbed “Donald Trump’s abortion bans” and said his actions resulted in a reality where couples “who pray and dream of having a family are being denied IVF treatments.”</p>
<p>In vitro fertilization, or IVF, has become a <a href="https://kansasreflector.com/2024/02/28/u-s-senate-republican-blocks-legislation-protecting-in-vitro-fertilization/" target="_blank">lightning rod for debate</a> on the right after an Alabama court ruled in early 2024 that frozen embryos counted as children. Legislators in the state have since passed a law to restore IVF access.</p>
<p>Trump said Harris was telling “another lie.”</p>
<p>“I have been a leader on IVF, with which is fertilization, the IVF. I have been a leader,” he said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Taxes, the economy, health care</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>With Trump’s signature 2017 tax law expiring at the end of 2025, tax policy has been front and center of the 2024 presidential race.</p>
<p>Harris trumpeted her plans for an “opportunity economy” and panned Trump’s proposal to raise tariffs and “provide a tax cut for billionaires and big corporations.”</p>
<p>“Donald Trump has no plan for you, and when you look at his economic plan, it’s all about tax breaks for the richest people,” Harris said on the debate stage.</p>
<p>Harris’ proposals include increasing the corporate tax rate to 28%, permanently expanding the child tax credit to pandemic levels and extending up to $6,000 to new parents, <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/harris-roll-out-new-plan-tax-relief-small-businesses" target="_blank">providing</a> up to $50,000 in tax relief for business start-up costs, and offering new homebuyers a $25,000 tax credit.</p>
<p>A large part of Trump’s economic plan is to impose universal tariffs of at</p>
<p>least 10% on all U.S. imports, with tariffs on Chinese goods at 60%. When asked by Muir if the approach could cause consumer prices to increase, Trump denied the possibility.</p>
<p>“We’re not going to have higher prices. What’s going to happen, who’s going to have higher prices is China, and all of the countries that have been ripping us off for years,” Trump said.</p>
<p>Trump has promised, at minimum, to extend his tax policies, which cut individual income tax rates, lowered the corporate tax rate to 21%, loosened business expensing and deductions, and doubled the child tax credit to $2,000.</p>
<p>Economists warn that if extended, the Trump-era tax cuts would add trillions to the deficit. That total could reach between $4 trillion and $5.8 trillion over the next decade, <a href="https://budgetmodel.wharton.upenn.edu/issues/2024/8/26/trump-campaign-policy-proposals-2024?te=1&amp;nl=the-morning&amp;emc=edit_nn_20240903" target="_blank">according</a> to the University of Pennsylvania’s Penn Wharton Budget Model. In a separate model, the Tax Foundation <a href="https://taxfoundation.org/research/all/federal/donald-trump-tax-plan-2024/" target="_blank">estimated</a> the policies could reduce federal revenue up to $6.1 trillion over a 10-year window.</p>
<p>The Penn Wharton model <a href="https://budgetmodel.wharton.upenn.edu/issues/2024/8/26/harris-campaign-policy-proposals-2024?te=1&amp;nl=the-morning&amp;emc=edit_nn_20240903" target="_blank">estimates</a> Harris’ proposals would increase the deficit by up to $2 trillion over ten years. Modeling from the Tax Foundation released Tuesday <a href="https://taxfoundation.org/research/all/federal/kamala-harris-tax-plan-2024/" target="_blank">predicts</a> the vice president’s plan would increase taxes by $4.1 trillion over the next decade, but after accounting for various tax cuts and credits, the projected revenue drops to $1.7 trillion, and even further if slowed economic growth is considered.</p>
<p>On health care, Trump said he had “concepts of a plan” to overhaul the law signed by President Barack Obama in 2010.</p>
<p>“I would only change it if we come up with something that’s better and less expensive,” he said. “And there are concepts and options we have to do that, and you’ll be hearing about it in the not too distant future.”</p>
<p>Harris defended the law known as “Obamacare.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Immigration and border security</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Trump tried several times to steer the conversation to immigration, his signature issue since he began his first White House run in 2015.</p>
<p>He referenced viral — but unverified — stories of sensational disruptions caused by immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, and Aurora, Colorado, and blamed Harris and Biden for the supposed episodes.</p>
<p>“These are the people that she and Biden let into our country,” he said.</p>
<p>Continuing Biden’s immigration policies would turn the country into “Venezuela on steroids,” he said.</p>
<p>Harris laughed after Trump pressed unverified claims about immigration. “Talk about extreme,” she said.</p>
<p>Harris promoted a bipartisan immigration and border security bill this year that included measures Republicans sought to strengthen enforcement. But the bill fell apart, she said, under opposition from Trump, who preferred campaigning on the issue to solving the problem.</p>
<p>When moderators then asked Trump about the bill, he began his answer by bragging about crowds at his campaign rallies, responding to a comment Harris had made.</p>
<p>Rally attendance remained high, he said, “because people want to take their country back.”</p>
<p>“Our country is being lost,” he said. “We’re a failing nation, and it happened three-and-a-half years ago. And what? What’s going on here? … What they have done to our country by allowing these millions and millions of people to come into our country and look at what’s happening to the towns all over the United States.”</p>
<p>He did not answer the question about the bill.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Energy and climate</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Moderators asked Harris about her position on hydraulic fracturing, a technique for extracting natural gas better known as fracking.</p>
<p>The process is controversial among environmentalists, but a major industry in gas-rich Pennsylvania. During her unsuccessful bid for the Democratic nomination in 2020, Harris told a climate activist during a televised town hall that she favored banning fracking, but has said this year that is not her position.</p>
<p>Asked by Davis to explain the change Tuesday night, she said she’s also made clear in 2020 that she did not want to ban fracking.</p>
<p>She also noted her tie-breaking vote in the Senate to pass the Inflation Reduction Act, a massive energy, taxes and domestic policy law Democrats passed along party lines in 2022 that included expanded leases for natural gas production.</p>
<p>Trump urged voters not to believe Harris.</p>
<p>“If she becomes president, fracking in Pennsylvania will end on day one,” he said.</p>
<p>The last question before closing statements was on climate change.</p>
<p>Harris called it a threat and touted the Biden administration’s work to expand the clean energy industry, while preserving natural gas jobs.</p>
<p>Trump declined to answer the question, instead focusing on the work of Hunter Biden, the president’s son, with a Ukrainian energy company. Trump called the Biden administration “corrupt.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Foreign policy</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>As the humanitarian crisis continues in the Gaza Strip with deaths mounting 40,000, according to Gaza health officials, Davis asked Harris how she could break through a stalemate on a proposed cease-fire deal between Israel and Hamas militants.</p>
<p>The vice president offered little detail on how to finally broker a deal, but said, “What we know is this war must end.”</p>
<p>“It must end immediately, and the way it will end is we need a cease-fire deal, and we need the hostages out, and so we will continue to work around the clock on that — work around the clock — also understanding that we must chart a course for a two-state solution,” she said.</p>
<p>Harris added that she will “always give Israel the ability to defend itself, in particular as it relates to Iran.”</p>
<p>Trump lashed back with accusations that Harris “hates” Israel and the “Arab population,” and repeated his refrain that “if I were president, (the war) would have never started.”</p>
<p>“I will get that settled and fast, and I’ll get the war with Ukraine and Russia ended. If I’m president-elect, I’ll get it done before even becoming president,” Trump said.</p>
<p>He did not directly answer if he wanted Ukraine to win the war.</p>
<p>“I think it’s in the U.S. best interest to get this war finished and just get it done, negotiate a deal, because we have to stop all of these human lives from being destroyed,” Trump said when asked if a Ukraine victory is in the U.S.’s best interest.</p>
<p>Harris said she would continue to stand with NATO allies on defending Ukraine.</p>
<p>“I believe the reason that Donald Trump says that this war would be over within 24 hours is because he would just give it up. And that’s not who we are as Americans,” she rebutted.</p>
<p>Another foreign policy topic was on display at the U.S. Capitol hours before the debate when congressional leaders held a <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?537990-1/house-speaker-mike-johnson-holds-congressional-medal-ceremony" target="_blank">ceremony</a> honoring 13 service members who were killed during the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Trump and Republican lawmakers have ratcheted up criticism of Harris — implicating her hundreds of times in a damning <a href="https://foreignaffairs.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/WILLFULL-BLINDNESS-An-Assessment-of-the-Biden-Harris%20Administrations-Withdrawal-from-Afghanistan-and-the-Chaos-that-Followed.pdf" target="_blank">report</a> released Monday — for the Biden administration’s handling of the August 2021 exit from Afghanistan after two decades of war.</p>
<p>“I will tell you I agreed with President Biden’s decision to pull out of Afghanistan. Four presidents said they would, and Joe Biden did,” Harris told Muir when asked if she bears any responsibility for the deadly withdrawal.</p>
<p>Harris criticized Trump for “negotiating directly with a terrorist organization” when he struck a deal with the Taliban before he left office.</p>
<p>Trump defended himself saying “I got involved with the Taliban because the Taliban was doing the killing” and said he achieved a “very good agreement.”</p>
<p>Trump made waves on the recent third anniversary of the 13 service members’ deaths when his staffers pushed an Arlington National Cemetery official aside to take photos in a restricted area, according to the U.S. Army and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/08/27/nx-s1-5091154/trump-arlington-cemetery" target="_blank">reporting</a> by NPR.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Swift endorsement</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Shortly after the debate’s close, mega star Taylor Swift said in an Instagram post she would vote for Harris.</p>
<p>Part of Swift’s exuberant fan base had called on her to endorse Harris, following her support for Biden and Harris four years ago.</p>

(Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)</p><p>WASHINGTON — The 2024 battle for control of Congress centers on just a handful of Senate races and about two dozen House seats, putting considerable pressure on those candidates to win over voters as party leaders and super PACs funnel millions of dollars into their campaigns.</p>
<p>The incumbents representing those states and congressional districts will spend nearly all of their time campaigning between now and Election Day, with Congress in session just three weeks ahead of Nov. 5. They’ll be fighting off challengers who will be on the home front the entire time.</p>
<p>Republicans aim to increase their slim majority in the House of Representatives and flip the Senate, while Democrats are hoping to hang onto their majority in the upper chamber and regain control of the House.</p>
<p>Experts interviewed by States Newsroom said the outcome will be determined by multiple factors, including turnout, ticket splitting and the trajectory of the presidential campaign, which underwent an abrupt change with the exit of President Joe Biden and the nomination of Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic candidate.</p>
<p>At stake is whether Harris or Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, faces a Congress friendly to their ambitions or another two years of a deeply divided government in the nation’s capital. Biden has <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/congress-limps-toward-end-disappointing-session-just-78-laws-show" target="_blank">struggled with</a> a GOP House and a Senate narrowly controlled by Democrats during the past two years.</p>
<p>“There’s a lot of energy on both sides for these congressional races, because of just how close the margins are going to be in the House and Senate,” said Casey Burgat, assistant professor and legislative affairs program director at George Washington University.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Senate GOP control?</h4>

	
<p>The Senate is trending toward a Republican majority, though that will be determined by voters in Michigan, Montana, Nevada and Ohio, all of which are considered toss-ups by the Cook Political Report with Amy Walter, a respected non-partisan publication.</p>
<p>If the GOP picks up any one of those four seats, that would give Republicans at least a 51-seat majority in the chamber after winning the West Virginia seat that’s currently held by Joe Manchin III, thought to be nearly certain in the GOP-dominated state.</p>
<figure id="attachment_39057" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:383px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/img_2188/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-39057 " src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_2188-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="383" height="255" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_2188-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_2188-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_2188-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_2188-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_2188-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 383px) 100vw, 383px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger&#8217;s decision to run for governor leaves her 7th Congressional seat open but the district leans blue, political forecasters say. (Charlotte Rene Woods / Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p>Democrats maintaining those four seats as well as three others classified as “lean Democrat” by the Cook Political Report would leave control of a 50-50 Senate to the results of the presidential election, since the vice president casts tie-breaking votes in that chamber.</p>
<p>The Senate map is highly favorable to Republicans, who are defending 11 seats in safely red states, while Democrats are trying to hold on to 23 seats, with seven of those in purple states.</p>
<p>While the entire 435-member House of Representatives is up for reelection every two years, senators are elected to six-year terms, leaving about one-third of the chamber up for reelection in evenly numbered years.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Eyes on Montana</h4>

	
<p>Robert Saldin, professor of political science at the University of Montana, said during an interview that Democratic Sen. Jon Tester will need to get voters in the state who support Trump to split their tickets if Tester is going to secure reelection.</p>
<p>“One of the secrets to Tester’s success over the years is that he has been able to distinguish himself from stereotypes of the national Democratic Party,” Saldin said. “And that’s going to be really important again, obviously, because Trump is on the ticket, and is certainly going to carry the state by a very wide margin.”</p>
<p>Republican challenger Tim Sheehy could potentially have a bit of an easier time getting elected this November in the deeply Republican state, he said.</p>
<p>“All he has to do is get people who are voting for Trump to also vote for him. And in fact, he can probably lose some tens of thousands of voters and still be okay,” Saldin said.</p>
<p>Sheehy, however, is somewhat disadvantaged by not having run in a competitive GOP primary, leaving him to move directly into a high-stakes general election.</p>
<p>“He is a political novice,” Saldin said. “He didn’t have a practice run in the primary. And here he is fresh out of the gate in one of the most expensive, most watched, most hyped Senate elections in the country. And so he’s having to learn as he goes.”</p>
<p>One factor that could benefit Tester over Sheehy is <a href="https://dailymontanan.com/2024/08/02/gianforte-revives-debunked-abortion-claim-for-ballot-initiative/" target="_blank">a ballot question addressing abortion access</a> in the state that is likely to go before voters in November, Saldin said.</p>
<p>“That should give at least a little nudge in the direction of the Democrats,” Saldin said.</p>
<p>A dozen other states have approved or could approve <a href="https://www.kff.org/womens-health-policy/dashboard/ballot-tracker-status-of-abortion-related-state-constitutional-amendment-measures/" target="_blank">abortion ballot questions</a>, including Arizona, Florida, Maryland and Nevada.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">In Ohio, edging away from national politics</h4>

	
<p>Paul A. Beck, academy professor of political science at The Ohio State University, said Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown has sought to separate himself from national political figures throughout this reelection bid.</p>
<p>“I think he really wants to make this a local contest, a statewide contest, not a national contest,” Beck said. “And so he’s going to do everything he can to not appear on the stage with the Democratic nominees for president, and everything he can to try to define himself as somebody who is above partisan politics.”</p>
<p>Brown was elected to the House in 1992 before winning election to the Senate in 2006. He secured reelection in 2012 and 2018, though Republican candidate Bernie Moreno is looking to end that streak this year.</p>
<p>Beck said <a href="https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2024/08/05/who-is-funding-ohios-redistricting-amendment/" target="_blank">a ballot question about redistricting</a> could help boost turnout, potentially increasing Brown’s chances.</p>
<p>“It’s going to energize voters and is going to produce higher turnout on the left than it will on the right, and that could be a factor in 2024,” Beck said.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Incumbent clout</h4>

	
<p>Sitting members of Congress have historically held an advantage that may help the party that holds more members seeking to return to Capitol Hill for the 119th Congress.</p>
<p>“Reelection rates in the House have never dropped below 85%, and have recently stretched to highs of 98% in 2004 and 97% in 2016,” according to <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2023/10/incumbent-politicians-enjoy-record-reelection-in-aging-congress/" target="_blank">analysis</a> from Miro Hall-Jones at OpenSecrets, a nonpartisan organization that reports on the role of money in U.S. politics. “While the Senate is more susceptible to shifts in public opinion — reelection rates dropped as low as 50% in 1980 at the dawn of the Reagan Revolution — incumbent senators have retained their seats in 88% of races since 1990.”</p>
<p>Every single one of the 28 senators seeking reelection two years ago was able to convince voters in their home states to give them another term, marking the first time that has happened in American history, according to the analysis.</p>
<p>Michigan and Arizona Senate races could then present a bigger challenge for Democrats, since both those seats are open due to the upcoming retirements of Michigan Sen. Debbie Stabenow and Arizona independent Sen. Kyrsten Sinema.</p>
<p>Michigan is currently rated as a toss-up by the Cook Political Report while Arizona is rated as “lean Democrat.”</p>
<p>In the House, the 11 seats held by Republicans and considered by the Cook Political Report <a href="https://www.cookpolitical.com/ratings/house-race-ratings" target="_blank">to be toss-ups</a> all are held by an incumbent seeking reelection, while two of the Democrats’ 11 toss-up seats are open.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">House majority</h4>

	
<p>The contest for who controls the House after November is “razor thin,” said Burgat from George Washington University. With Republicans holding on by a slim margin, Democrats only need a net gain of four seats to capture the majority.</p>
<p>“Whether it goes Democratic or Republican, it’s not going to be by much,” Burgat said.</p>
<p>While Democrats and Republicans will focus much of their attention on the 22 toss-up races, they’ll also be funneling resources toward the campaigns that are rated as only leaning in their direction, as opposed to being likely or solid seats.</p>
<p>The Cook Political Report has eight seats held by GOP lawmakers as leaning in Republicans’ favor while 14 races, all Democratic-held seats except one, are in districts that “lean Democrat.”</p>
<p>That makes a total of about 44 competitive House races, according to the Cook Political Report’s analysis.</p>
<p>Among the closely watched congressional districts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Both parties are eyeing open seats in California, Colorado, Michigan and Virginia.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Michigan’s 7th and 8th districts, now held, respectively, by Democrats Elissa Slotkin, who is seeking the state’s open Senate seat, and the retiring Dan Kildee, are rated by the Cook Political Report as toss-ups.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Virginia’s 7th Congressional District, being vacated by Democrat Abigail Spanberger, who will focus on a run for governor, is expected to lean blue.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>California Democratic Rep. Katie Porter’s district also leans towards Democrats. Porter decided to leave the seat for an unsuccessful Senate run.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Colorado’s 3rd, abandoned by Republican Lauren Boebert, who shifted to a friendlier district, leans Republican, according to the Cook Political Report.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>One open seat each in Maryland and New Hampshire is rated as likely Democrat by the prognosticator.</li>
</ul>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">DCCC ads</h4>

	
<p>The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is throwing big money where races are competitive, zeroing in on 15 media markets including those in Arizona, Colorado, Michigan, North Carolina and Pennsylvania. The official campaign arm of House Democrats <a href="https://dccc.org/dccc-ie-reserves-28-million-in-first-round-of-tv-and-digital-ads-for-2024-cycle/" target="_blank">announced</a> a $28 million initial ad buy in June, spending double on digital ads compared to 2022, according to the organization.</p>
<p>The DCCC maintains that House Democrats “have always had multiple paths to reclaim the majority in November — including our 27 Red to Blue candidates in districts across the country working to defeat extreme Republicans who are out-of-touch with their communities,” spokesperson Viet Shelton told States Newsroom in a written statement.</p>
<p>Shelton said voters are “fed up with these politicians who are more interested in obeying Trump, voting for abortion bans, and giving tax breaks to billionaires and big corporations, while ignoring the needs of the middle class.”</p>
<p>The DCCC sees pickup opportunities in the 16 districts Biden won in 2020 that are currently held by Republicans.</p>
<p>Among them are five seats in California, four in New York, two in Arizona, and one each in New Jersey, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Virginia. Nebraska also saw incumbent GOP Rep. Don Bacon’s district go to Biden.</p>
<p>The switch to Harris at the top of the Democratic ticket could boost challengers in heavily college-educated districts, according to the Cook Political Report’s latest analysis of the field.</p>
<p>Those include Arizona’s 1st Congressional District held by GOP Rep. David Schweikert, New Jersey’s 7th occupied by freshman Thomas Kean Jr., and New York’s 17th held by Mike Lawler, also in his first term. All are rated as Republican toss-ups by the Cook Political Report.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Frontline candidates</h4>

	
<p>But the DCCC campaign has vulnerable Democratic incumbents to worry about as well. The organization has identified 31 as “frontline” members, meaning their purple districts are what campaigners describe as “in play.”</p>
<p>Among them is 40-year Democrat Marcy Kaptur, who has held Ohio’s 9th Congressional District, in the state’s northwest region, since 1983.</p>
<p>Other vulnerable Democrats include Reps. Yadira Caraveo in Colorado’s 8th, Jared Golden in Maine’s 2nd, Don Davis in North Carolina’s 1st, Gabe Vasquez in New Mexico’s 2nd, Emilia Sykes in Ohio’s 13th, Susan Wild and Matt Cartwright in Pennsylvania’s 7th and 8th districts, and Marie Gluesenkamp Perez in Washington’s 3rd.</p>
<p>The National Republican Congressional Committee did not respond to requests for comment, but the House GOP campaign arm <a href="https://www.nrcc.org/2024/06/27/nrcc-ie-reserves-45-7-million-in-first-round-of-ad-reservations-to-grow-the-house-majority/" target="_blank">announced</a> in late June a $45.7 million initial ad buy across 29 media markets, with large chunks going to metro areas in Los Angeles; New York City; Albuquerque, New Mexico; Anchorage, Alaska; Denver, Colorado; Detroit, Michigan; Portland, Oregon; and Omaha, Nebraska.</p>
<p>The ad buy — an offensive “to grow our majority,” NRCC Chair Richard Hudson said in a press release — will specifically target 13 districts currently held by Democrats.</p>

(Photo by Jemal Countess/Getty Images for Community Change)</p><p>WASHINGTON — Senate Republicans and two independents blocked a bipartisan tax package Thursday that would have temporarily expanded the child tax credit and revived tax breaks for some business activities.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_votes/vote1182/vote_118_2_00230.htm" target="_blank">48-44</a> procedural vote to advance the package was largely viewed as a messaging exercise by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer ahead of the August recess and continued ramp up to the general election in November, when the presidency and control of Congress are on the line. Virginia Democratic U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine cast a &#8220;yea&#8217; vote to advance the measure, while Virginia&#8217;s U.S. Sen. Mark Warner, also a Democrat, did not vote.</p>
<p>The vote on the tax bill was the Senate’s last until it returns in September. The House left for August recess a full week ahead of the Senate.</p>
<p>During a post-vote press conference, Schumer said, “American families lost.”</p>
<p>“Today, Senate Republicans boldly told the American people we refuse to help you in 2024, and we want to be frank, Republicans voted no because of partisanship, not policy,” the New York Democrat said.</p>
<p>Not all Senate Republicans voted against the bill. Those who voted yes included: Sens. Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma, Josh Hawley of Missouri and Rick Scott of Florida.</p>
<p>Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, independents who generally caucus with the Democrats, voted no.</p>
<p>Schumer switched his vote from yes to no as a way to enter a motion to reconsider, a routine maneuver.</p>
<p>Eight senators did not vote Thursday, including Democrat John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, and Republicans Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, John Hoeven of North Dakota, Mitt Romney of Utah, Tim Scott of South Carolina, Warner, and Republican vice presidential candidate and Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance. <a href="https://newjerseymonitor.com/2024/07/16/sen-menendez-convicted-of-bribery-other-charges-in-corruption-trial/#:~:text=Bob%20Menendez%20was%20convicted%20Tuesday,%E2%80%9Cshocking%20levels%20of%20corruption.%E2%80%9D" target="_blank">Convicted felon</a> and soon-to-be <a href="https://newjerseymonitor.com/2024/07/23/sen-menendez-to-resign-ending-storied-career-capped-by-bribery-conviction/#:~:text=Gray%2FGetty%20Images)-,Sen.,was%20convicted%20on%20corruption%20charges." target="_blank">former</a> Democrat Sen. Robert Menendez of New Jersey also did not vote.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘Show vote,’ Republicans say</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>A large swath of Senate Republicans, including their top tax writer, Mike Crapo of Idaho, the ranking member of the Senate Committee on Finance, has remained opposed to the legislation, which needed 60 votes to advance in the closely divided upper chamber.</p>
<p>Crapo panned the cloture vote on the floor ahead of time as a “doomed-to-fail show vote” that is “focused on election year messaging.”</p>
<p>“If the Democrats are serious about helping these working families, I’m ready to push for an extension of those changes beyond 2025. I’ve maintained a willingness to negotiate a bill that provides meaningful relief to Americans now,” Crapo said.</p>
<p>Taxation has risen on the list of campaign issues as the Trump-era tax law is set to expire at the end of 2025, teeing up a major debate for the next administration and Congress.</p>
<p>“I offered to make changes,” Sen. Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat and chair of the Senate Finance Committee, said on the floor ahead of the vote. “I met with a significant number of Senate Republicans personally.”</p>
<p>“This is a thoroughly bipartisan bill — 357 votes in the House of Representatives. Every Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee voted for this bill.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Child tax credit and the campaigns</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>In a recent interview with news personality Megyn Kelly, Vance accused the likely Democratic presidential nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris, of being opposed to the child tax credit, a statement that has been <a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/jul/30/jd-vance/kamala-harris-has-worked-to-expand-the-child-tax-c/" target="_blank">debunked</a>.</p>
<p>Democrats, including Harris, are <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/06/21/remarks-by-vice-president-harris-at-child-tax-credit-event/" target="_blank">on</a> <a href="https://x.com/VP/status/1767697362334400984" target="_blank">the</a> <a href="https://x.com/VP/status/1634690668164677633" target="_blank">record</a> advocating for a permanent expanded child tax credit similar to the pandemic-era version — a poverty reducer, according to census <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/working-papers/2022/demo/SEHSD-wp2022-24.html" target="_blank">data</a> — that eliminated the income requirement, raised the amount per child and provided the refund in monthly installments.</p>
<p>The Democratic Party immediately pounced on the absence of Vance from Thursday’s vote.</p>
<p>“When the American people vote in November, they’ll remember that when Vance had a chance to show up for working families, he was nowhere to be found,” Democratic National Committee spokesperson Aida Ross said in a statement after the vote.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Temporary tax cuts for families, businesses</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/7024" target="_blank">bicameral, bipartisan package</a> brokered by Wyden and Missouri’s Rep. Jason Smith, chair of the GOP-led House Committee on Ways and Means, received overwhelming approval in the House in January in a  <a href="https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/202430" target="_blank">357-70</a> vote.</p>
<p>The lawmakers hailed their formula to pay for the bill by clawing back a fraud-ridden <a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/blog/understanding-the-employee-retention-credit-offset-in-the-bipartisan-tax-bill/" target="_blank">pandemic tax break</a>. However, the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget <a href="https://www.crfb.org/blogs/how-much-would-wyden-smith-tax-deal-cost" target="_blank">warned</a> that the policies “would add significantly to the already massive federal debt” if extended beyond their 2025 expiration dates.</p>
<p>The legislation would have <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/congress-looking-expanding-child-tax-credit-again-who-would-benefit" target="_blank">increased</a> the current $2,000 child tax credit through 2025 by adjusting it for inflation to $2,100 and raising the refundability limit — the actual amount families could see in their tax refunds — to $1,800 for tax year 2023, $1,900 for 2024 and $2,000 for 2025, up from the current $1,600 cap.</p>
<p>Additionally the bill includes a provision that would allow families to claim a previous year’s income, if higher than the current year, when calculating the tax credit — a measure that <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/expanded-child-tax-credit-stranded-us-senate-gop-comparisons-welfare" target="_blank">drew fierce opposition</a> from Senate Republicans who likened it to welfare.</p>
<p>The bill also would have temporarily restored business’ ability to fully expense domestic research and development as well as immediately deducting 100% of equipment purchases and other investments the same year of the transaction  — both <a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/tax-cuts-and-jobs-act-a-comparison-for-businesses" target="_blank">incentives</a> under the 2017 Trump tax law that have phased out or are phasing out incrementally.</p>
<p>Business owners, CEOs and a union official <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/business-owners-union-leader-urge-us-senate-move-ahead-soon-stalled-tax-package" target="_blank">urged</a> the Senate Finance Committee in March to move forward on the bill.</p>
<p>Also included in the legislation: increasing the amount of low-income housing tax credits, relieving double taxation for residents of Taiwan, and <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/one-year-after-ohio-train-derailment-congress-mulling-tax-break-relief-payments" target="_blank">tax exemption for relief payments</a> to victims of the massive 2023 train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio — though the IRS largely took care of this <a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-many-payments-to-individuals-affected-by-east-palestine-train-disaster-are-tax-free-new-guidance-could-help-those-in-ohio-pennsylvania-west-virginia#:~:text=WASHINGTON%20%E2%80%94%20The%20Internal%20Revenue%20Service,%2C%20Ohio%2C%20are%20not%20taxable." target="_blank">in June</a>.</p>
<p>Supporters of the legislation range from the Business Roundtable, which represents American CEOs, to the Economic Security Project, an organization that advocates for increased tax credits and guaranteed basic income initiatives.</p>
<p>Anna Aurilio, senior campaign director for Economic Security Project Action, said in a statement following the vote that Republican senators were “selfishly picking politics over parents and brazenly disregarding this important opportunity to help families succeed right now.”</p>
<p>“The expanded Child Tax Credit was a critical tool for millions of parents who were struggling to afford the necessities and should be made permanent in the 2025 tax reform fight,” Aurilio said.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON — Legislation aimed at protecting children online sailed through the U.S. Senate Tuesday, marking what could be the first update since the late 1990s for companies who interact with minors on the internet.</p>
<p>Senators approved the package of two bills in <a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_votes/vote1182/vote_118_2_00221.htm" target="_blank">a 91-3 vote</a>, a rare bipartisan landslide in the tightly divided body, despite loud and fervent opposition from civil liberties and LGBTQ organizations that say the measures would hand the government power to subjectively censor content.</p>
<p>The three no votes were cast by Republicans Mike Lee of Utah and Rand Paul of Kentucky and Democrat Ron Wyden of Oregon.</p>
<p>If passed by the House, the <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/protection-kids-social-media-platforms-advances-us-senate" target="_blank">legislative package would require</a> producers of platforms popular among children and teens to follow new rules governing advertising, algorithms and collection of personal data.</p>
<p>House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has expressed interest in “working to find consensus in the House.”</p>
<p>President Joe Biden released a statement Tuesday calling the Senate vote a “crucial bipartisan step forward” and said the bill dovetails with measures he advocated for in his first State of the Union Address.</p>
<p>“There is undeniable evidence that social media and other online platforms contribute to our youth mental health crisis. Today our children are subjected to a wild west online and our current laws and regulations are insufficient to prevent this. It is past time to act,” Biden said, adding that tech companies need to be “accountable for the national experiment they are running on our children for profit.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Families asked for federal help</h4>

	
<p>The package contains two bills moving together: the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/1628/cosponsors?s=1&amp;r=1&amp;q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22children+and+teens+online+privacy+protection+act%22%2C%22children%22%2C%22and%22%2C%22teens%22%2C%22online%22%2C%22privacy%22%2C%22protection%22%2C%22act%22%5D%7D" target="_blank">Children and Teens Online Privacy Protection Act</a>, which is mainly targeted at regulating the collection of personal data, and the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/1409/cosponsors" target="_blank">Kids Online Safety Act</a>, a bill that has been a lightning rod of criticism from outside groups.</p>
<p>A bipartisan group of senators points to <a href="https://www.congress.gov/event/117th-congress/senate-event/330808/text" target="_blank">years</a> <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-gop-takes-aim-fake-pills-containing-deadly-fentanyl-sold-social-media" target="_blank">of</a> <a href="https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/committee-activity/hearings/big-tech-and-the-online-child-sexual-exploitation-crisis" target="_blank">hearings</a> and meetings with tragedy-struck families — including those whose children struggled with eating disorders and died by suicide — as the motivation behind the proposals.</p>
<p>Sen. Marsha Blackburn, of Tennessee, one of the Kids Online Safety Act’s original sponsors, said the legislation is a “safety by design bill, a duty of care bill that gives kids and parents a toolbox so that they can protect themselves.”</p>
<p>“A message that we’re sending to big tech: kids are not your product, kids are not your profit source, and we are going to protect them in the virtual space,” Blackburn, a Republican, said at a press conference following the vote.</p>
<p>Blackburn co-led the bill dubbed the Kids Online Safety Act with Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut.</p>
<p>Sen. Ed Markey, who championed the last protections passed by Congress in late 1990s, said “back in 1998 only birds tweeted, a gram was a measurement of weight, and so we need to update the law.”</p>
<p>The Massachusetts Democrat joined Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana in co-sponsoring the Children and Teens’ Online Privacy Protection Act.</p>
<p>Markey likened addictive social media products to those of the tobacco industry in previous decades, and cited public health warnings attributing increasing childhood mental health issues to the platforms.</p>
<p>“So we have to give the tools to parents and to teenagers and children to be able to protect themselves, and that would be my message to my colleagues in the House. We cannot avoid this historic moment,” Markey said at the press conference.</p>
<p>Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer praised the legislation’s passage in the Senate and said the parents of affected teens are “the reason we succeeded today.”</p>
<p>“I’ve heard the terrible stories: children, teenagers, perfectly normal, then some algorithm captures them online by accident, and they end up committing suicide shortly thereafter,” the New York Democrat said in a statement. “You imagine being a parent and living with that.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">New rules for platforms</h4>

	
<p>The original two bills, rolled into one legislative vehicle, respectively outline “duty of care” rules requiring platform creators to consider broad mental health categories when designing and operating their products as well as a prohibition of the use of personal data for targeted marketing.</p>
<p>The legislation would also mandate that platforms create an “easy-to-understand privacy dashboard” detailing how a minor’s personal information is collected, used and protected.</p>
<p>Other measures would include a prohibition on hidden algorithms, mechanisms for minors or parents to remove data, parental controls to restrict financial transactions and annual public reports from the platforms on “reasonably foreseeable” harms to children and teens and efforts underway to prevent them.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Enforcement</h4>

	
<p>The new policies, if enacted, would be enforced by the Federal Trade Commission and any civil actions would be prosecuted by states in U.S. district court with advance notice to the FTC.</p>
<p>The legislation defines the online platforms as public-facing websites, social media applications, video games, messaging applications or video streaming services that are “used, or reasonably likely to be used, by a minor.”</p>
<p>Snap, the company behind the popular platform Snapchat, issued a statement specifically praising the Senate’s passage of the Kids Online Safety Act.</p>
<p>“The safety and well-being of young people on Snapchat is a top priority,” a Snap spokesperson said in a statement provided to States Newsroom. “That’s why Snap has been a long-time supporter of the Kids Online Safety Act. We applaud Senators Blackburn, Blumenthal and the roughly 70 other co-sponsors of this critical legislation for their leadership and commitment to the privacy and safety of young people.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Opponents see ‘dangerous’ measure</h4>

	
<p>A coalition of organizations advocating for First Amendment rights, privacy and the interests of LGBTQ minors urged the House to vote no on the legislation, criticizing it as “blatantly unconstitutional.”</p>
<p>Evan Greer, director of the tech policy group Fight For the Future, also lambasted the bill as “dangerous and misguided” and “wildly broad.”</p>
<p>The coalition largely takes issue with the Kids Online Safety Act’s “duty of care” provision that requires companies to “prevent and mitigate” harms associated with anxiety, depression, eating disorders, substance use disorders and suicidal behaviors.</p>
<p>During a joint virtual press conference hosted by the groups during the Senate vote, Greer described the provision as “a blank check for censorship of any piece of content that an administration could claim is harmful to kids.”</p>
<p>“What that means in practice, is that for example, a Trump administration FTC would get to dictate what types of content platforms can recommend or even show to younger users,” Greer said, referring to Republican presidential nominee and former President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Jenna Leventoff, senior policy counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union, said the Kids Online Safety Act is “nothing more than a thinly veiled effort to censor information that some consider objectionable”</p>
<p>“If enacted, KOSA could lead to information about health care, gender, identity, politics and more being removed from social media. And kids note that censorship will make them less and not more safe,” Leventoff said. “As one student recently told me, they don’t get sex education in school, and if information about sex is removed from the internet because platforms fear liability for hosting it, how else can they learn about sex?”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Teens in opposition</h4>

	
<p>The ACLU brought roughly 300 teens to Capitol Hill Thursday to lobby against the legislation.</p>
<p>Dara Adkinson, of the organization TransOhio, said the legislation is “truly terrifying.”</p>
<p>Adkinson questioned whether state and federal authorities could argue that content about climate change or the nation’s history of slavery causes anxiety and should therefore be regulated.</p>
<p>Regarding content about transgender youth, Adkinson said: “We know there (are) people out there that would like us to not exist and having the lack of visibility of the kinds of resources found on the internet is the first step for many of these folks.”</p>
<p>Greer said the coalition is concerned about the role of “big tech” in society. Advocates would support a “heavily modified” version of the Kids Online Safety Act that focuses on regulating business practices, including targeted advertising or videos that automatically play and encourage continuous, addictive scrolling habits.</p>
<p>Greer said their organization is neutral on the legislation targeted at protecting children’s privacy, but that they would like to see comprehensive legislation that protects minors and adults alike.</p>
<p>“Censorship and privacy do not go together, and these should not be moving together,” Greer said.</p>

<p>Biden announced the “Not Above the Law Amendment” Monday along with endorsing other changes for the nation’s highest bench, potentially setting the tone and focus for the Democrat’s final months in office after he exited the 2024 race in favor of Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>
<p>The proposal, released by the White House without text and detailed by Biden in a Washington Post <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/07/29/joe-biden-reform-supreme-court-presidential-immunity-plan-announcement/" target="_blank">op-ed</a>, comes as public trust in the high court flags after recent ethics scandals and the overturning of Roe v. Wade that bucked popular opinion on abortion.</p>
<p>Biden is urging Congress to pass 18-year term limits for justices, with a president appointing a new justice every two years, and to approve enforceable conduct and ethics rules that would require disclosure of gifts, bar public political activity and ensure recusal from cases where a justice or their spouse has a financial or political stake.</p>
<p>Biden’s plan to “restore faith” in the nation’s highest court will likely hit a roadblock in the Republican-led U.S. House and in the Senate, where Democrats hold a slim edge and any reforms could struggle to gain the necessary 60 votes. A constitutional amendment would also require passage in three-fourths of the states.</p>
<p>U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson called Biden’s proposal “dead on arrival.”</p>
<p>Writing in the Washington Post <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/07/29/joe-biden-reform-supreme-court-presidential-immunity-plan-announcement/?pwapi_token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJyZWFzb24iOiJnaWZ0IiwibmJmIjoxNzIyMjI1NjAwLCJpc3MiOiJzdWJzY3JpcHRpb25zIiwiZXhwIjoxNzIzNjA3OTk5LCJpYXQiOjE3MjIyMjU2MDAsImp0aSI6IjI5ODkwY2VjLTYwZTItNDZmZi1hOWZkLWQwOTJjZmI5MGNjMSIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9vcGluaW9ucy8yMDI0LzA3LzI5L2pvZS1iaWRlbi1yZWZvcm0tc3VwcmVtZS1jb3VydC1wcmVzaWRlbnRpYWwtaW1tdW5pdHktcGxhbi1hbm5vdW5jZW1lbnQvIn0.ZjQ4R9u8pwlIKd0l230VD0f20mb0V140Kw3gTFopyfM" target="_blank">op-ed</a>, Biden said a lack of legal repercussions for former President Donald Trump’s role in the violent Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, intended to stop the peaceful transfer of power from one elected administration to another, is “only the beginning.”</p>
<p>“The only limits will be those that are self-imposed by the person occupying the Oval Office,” he wrote.</p>
<p>He also referenced recent behavior from the court <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/clarence-thomas-scotus-undisclosed-luxury-travel-gifts-crow" target="_blank">uncovered</a> by ProPublica’s investigative journalists — including gifts and luxury travel given to the justices from political donors — as cause for alarm.</p>
<p>“What is happening now is not normal, and it undermines the public’s confidence in the court’s decisions, including those impacting personal freedoms. We now stand in a breach,” Biden wrote.</p>
<p>Biden is expected to speak on his plan Monday afternoon when he commemorates the 60th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act at the Lyndon B. Johnson Library in Texas.</p>
<p>Public Citizen, a group that advocates for changes at the Supreme Court, issued a statement Monday praising Biden’s proposal.</p>
<p>“The dramatic drop in public confidence in the Supreme Court both undercuts the Court’s legitimacy and endangers the legitimacy of the judicial branch as a whole,” wrote Lisa Gilbert, the organization’s co-president. “It is also critical that we undo the damage caused by the overreaching SCOTUS decision in the presidential immunity case and ensure that no person — including the president — is above the law.”</p>
<p>Johnson panned Biden’s announcement as a “radical overhaul” and “logical conclusion to the Biden-Harris Administration and Congressional Democrats’ ongoing efforts to delegitimize the Supreme Court.”</p>
<p>“It is telling that Democrats want to change the system that has guided our nation since its founding simply because they disagree with some of the Court’s recent decisions,” the Louisiana Republican said in a statement Monday.</p>
<p>But various acts of Congress have changed the court since the nation’s founding, including the number of seats on the bench, which have ranged from five to 10. The number of seats on the court was fixed at nine shortly after the Civil War, <a href="https://www.uscourts.gov/about-federal-courts/educational-resources/about-educational-outreach/activity-resources/about#:~:text=Over%20the%20years%2C%20various%20Acts,the%20United%20States%20Supreme%20Court." target="_blank">according</a> to the court’s historical information that details the changes. In 1925, an act granted the justices the power to decide whether to hear a case, also known as certiorari.</p>
<p>The Republican National Committee issued a statement accusing Biden’s plan of being “Kamala’s scheme to pack the Supreme Court with far-left, radical judges who will render decisions based on politics, not the law — and insulate her dangerously liberal policy positions from scrutiny if she’s elected.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Democrats decry the court</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Efforts to pass an enforceable code of conduct at the Supreme Court are already underway among Democratic lawmakers.</p>
<p>Reps. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, the top Democrat on the GOP-led House Committee on Oversight and Accountability, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, another Democratic committee member, introduced legislation last month that would prohibit justices from receiving gifts valued over $50, according to their offices.</p>
<p>The two lawmakers <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/pair-us-house-dems-add-chorus-calling-alito-thomas-recusals%C2%A0" target="_blank">hosted</a> a roundtable in early June excoriating the court after Chief Justice John Roberts refused to take action when the New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/16/us/justice-alito-upside-down-flag.html" target="_blank">revealed</a> that an upside-down U.S. flag — a sign of protest — flew outside Justice Samuel Alito’s Virginia home shortly after the Jan. 6 riot.</p>
<p>House progressives unsuccessfully <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/progressives-urge-alito-recusal-jan-6-cases-us-supreme-court" target="_blank">urged</a> Alito to recuse himself from two cases related to Jan. 6, including Trump’s appeal for immunity from federal election subversion charges.</p>
<p>A Supreme Court ethics <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/359/text?s=1&amp;r=4&amp;q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22supreme+court+ethics%22%5D%7D" target="_blank">bill</a> sponsored by Rhode Island’s Democratic Sen.

(Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden dropped out of the 2024 presidential race Sunday, he said in <a href="https://x.com/JoeBiden/status/1815080881981190320" target="_blank">a letter posted to social media</a>, creating an unprecedented vacancy atop the Democratic ticket one month before he was scheduled to officially accept his party’s nomination.</p>
<p>In a followup <a href="https://x.com/JoeBiden/status/1815087772216303933" target="_blank">post</a> less than 30 minutes later, Biden endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to take his place as the Democratic nominee.</p>
<p>Biden’s withdrawal came after a weeks-long pressure campaign from party insiders following a <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/democrats-reel-terrible-biden-debate-performance-he-defends-candidacy%C2%A0" target="_blank">disastrous</a> June 27 debate performance against GOP candidate former President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>The move throws an already-unusual presidential race into further chaos, and it was not immediately clear Sunday how Democrats would choose a replacement for Biden in November’s election, though Harris would have a strong claim to lead the ticket.</p>
<p>Biden praised Harris as “an extraordinary partner” in the administration’s accomplishments.</p>
<p>Biden, who has been fighting a COVID-19 infection at home in Delaware since last week, was not specific about his reasons for stepping aside, but said he believed it was in the country’s best interest.</p>
<p>“It has been the great honor of my life to serve as your President,” he wrote in the one-page letter. “And while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term.”</p>
<p>Biden, 81, appeared frail and confused at several points throughout the debate, leading to worries among elected Democrats and the party’s voters that he was no longer up to the task of governing or contesting Trump’s bid to win back the White House.</p>
<p>As several congressional Democrats called for him to quit the race, others asked that he ramp up his public schedule and include more unrehearsed appearances that could demonstrate his fitness.</p>
<p>But a more robust schedule of news interviews, press conferences and campaign rallies did not sufficiently quiet the Democratic voices saying Biden’s candidacy was likely to throw the presidential race to Trump – whom Biden and others have described as an existential threat to U.S. democracy – and deeply handicap Democrats in other races up and down November’s ballot.</p>
<p>On Friday, Sens. Sherrod Brown of Ohio and <a href="https://sourcenm.com/2024/07/19/sen-heinrich-calls-on-biden-to-drop-out/" target="_blank">Martin Heinrich of New Mexico</a> brought the number of senators calling on Biden to drop out to four. A day earlier, Montana Sen. Jon Tester <a href="https://dailymontanan.com/2024/07/18/sen-tester-calls-on-biden-not-to-seek-another-term/" target="_blank">said</a> Biden should drop his reelection campaign and that Democrats should hold an open nomination process at their Chicago convention next month.</p>
<p>In the U.S. House, 29 Democrats had called for Biden to withdraw from the race by the end of the day July 19.</p>
<p>In a post following the announcement to his social media site, Truth Social, Trump said Biden was “never” fit to serve as president.</p>
<p>“Crooked Joe Biden was not fit to run for President, and is certainly not fit to serve – And never was!” Trump wrote. “He only attained the position of President by lies, Fake News, and not leaving his Basement. All those around him, including his Doctor and the Media, knew that he wasn’t capable of being President, and he wasn’t – And now, look what he’s done to our Country.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">More details of announcement</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>In the letter, Biden praised his administration’s accomplishments over three-and-a-half years, saying he’d worked to make “historic investments” in the country, lowered prescription drug costs, nominated the first Black woman to the U.S. Supreme Court and “passed the most significant climate legislation in the history of the world.”</p>
<p>“Together we overcame a once in a century pandemic and the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression,”  Biden wrote. “We’ve protected and preserved our Democracy. And we’ve revitalized and strengthened our alliances around the world.”</p>
<p>Biden said he would “speak to the Nation later this week” about the decision.</p>
<p>He praised Harris and other supporters.</p>
<p>“For now, let me express my deepest gratitude to all those who have worked so hard to see me reelected,” he wrote. “I want to thank Vice President Kamala Harris for being an extraordinary partner in all this work. And let me express my heartfelt appreciation to the American people for the faith and trust you have placed in me.”</p>
<p>In follow-up posts, Biden said he was endorsing Harris and added a fundraising link.</p>
<p>“My very first decision as the party nominee in 2020 was to pick Kamala Harris as my Vice President,” he said. “And it’s been the best decision I’ve made. Today I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year. Democrats — it’s time to come together and beat Trump. Let’s do this.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Trump gains in polls</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The about face in what was to be a 2020 presidential election rematch leaves Democrats searching for a new candidate as Trump, who promises authoritarian-style leadership, has gained support in recent polls.</p>
<p>With just 107 days until Election Day, Biden’s move marks the latest date in modern presidential history that a candidate has withdrawn from the race.</p>
<p>President Lyndon Johnson announced in March 1968 that he would not seek reelection that year, leaving Democratic delegates to decide on a replacement – ultimately Vice President Hubert Humphrey – at the party’s convention that summer in Chicago.</p>
<p>Harris appears to be in a strong position to replace Biden as the party’s standard bearer, though questions remain about how the process will play out and <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/pa-gov-josh-shapiro-would-bring-battleground-state-and-political-acumen-national-ticket" target="_blank">who</a> would become the vice presidential nominee.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Democrats praise decision</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Reaction poured in shortly after the Sunday afternoon announcement, with Democrats largely praising Biden’s record and calling his decision courageous.</p>
<p>Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement that he understood Biden’s decision to step out of the race was “not easy, but he once again put his country, his party, and our future first.”</p>
<p>“Joe Biden has not only been a great president and a great legislative leader but he is a truly amazing human being,” the New York Democrat said.</p>
<p>Several Republicans called for Biden to resign his office.</p>
<p>“If Joe Biden is not fit to run for President, he is not fit to serve as President,” House Speaker Mike Johnson wrote on X. “He must resign the office immediately. November 5 cannot arrive soon enough.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">A crescendoing chorus to step down</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Biden faced calls for him to abandon his reelection bid from congressional Democrats, even as he tried to stabilize the debate aftershock by holding a series of campaign rallies, <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/biden-first-tv-interview-debate-denies-medical-condition-it-was-bad-episode" target="_blank">sitting down</a> for <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/biden-says-bulls-eye-remark-about-trump-was-mistake-defends-criticism" target="_blank">interviews</a> and holding a press conference at<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/biden-nato-press-conference-rebuts-doubters-im-best-qualified-govern" target="_blank"> the annual NATO conference</a>.</p>
<p>Democratic lawmakers <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/congressional-dems-urge-more-robust-biden-campaign-trail-few-openly-revolt" target="_blank">largely</a> <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/united-their-objections-trump-congressional-dems-largely-close-ranks-behind-biden" target="_blank">presented</a> a public front of support for Biden in statements and passing interviews in the U.S. Capitol hallways with reporters.</p>
<p>What began as a trickle of dissent from rank-and-file Democrats — <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/texas-us-house-member-calls-biden-withdraw-amid-debate-fallout" target="_blank">beginning</a> with Rep. Lloyd Doggett of Texas and a handful of doubtful senior House Democrats — steadily grew to a torrent by Friday.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">50-year career in Washington</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Biden’s exit marks the closure of a long, storied career in Washington, including 38 years in the U.S. Senate, featuring stints leading the Foreign Affairs and Judiciary committees, and eight years as vice president under President Barack Obama.</p>
<p>Biden’s presidency was punctuated with major economic wins for Democrats, beginning with nearly $2 trillion to combat the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>His leadership with a Democratic majority in Congress resulted in substantial nationwide infrastructure investments, drove financial incentives to tackle climate change and revive the U.S. global role in semiconductor manufacturing, and strengthened flagging tax enforcement.</p>
<p>However, low approval ratings followed Biden throughout his presidency as Americans aimed their frustrations over inflation at the White House and assigned blame for record numbers of border crossings as a divided Congress – after Democrats lost their House majority in the 2022 midterms – failed to pass immigration restrictions negotiated with the administration.</p>
<p>Biden’s handling of the Israel-Hamas war also hurt his support among young and progressive voters as Israel’s continued offensive against Hamas militants in the Palestinian territory of the Gaza Strip killed tens of thousands of civilians. Protesters against the U.S. supply of weapons to Israel interrupted dozens of Biden’s reelection campaign events through 2024.</p>

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)</p><p>MILWAUKEE — Donald Trump in an unusual speech accepting the GOP presidential nomination Thursday at the fourth and final night of the Republican National Convention gave a detailed account about the attempt on his life last weekend when a gunman shot at him during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>“I will tell you exactly what happened. And you’ll never hear it from me a second time because it’s actually too painful to tell,” Trump said in his first public remarks about the shooting that killed one rally goer and injured two others. The gunman was killed by law enforcement at the scene.</p>
<p>Turning his head to look at a chart, which was later displayed on multiple screens inside the Fiserv Forum, is what saved his life, Trump said.</p>
<p>“I heard a loud whizzing sound and felt something hit me really, really hard on my right ear,” Trump recalled. “I said to myself, ‘Wow, what was that? It can only be a bullet.’ I moved my hand to my right ear, brought it down, and my hand was covered with blood.”</p>
<p>Trump said he knew immediately that he was “under attack” and praised the Secret Service agents for rushing on stage to shield him with their own bodies, calling them “great people” who took “great risk,” to applause from the crowd.</p>
<p>He thanked the supporters in attendance last weekend for not panicking and stampeding, which can cause injuries and deaths during a mass shooting.</p>
<p>Trump in his 90-minute remarks appeared to seriously reflect on how close he came to being killed at one point, commenting that he wasn’t sure he was meant to survive the attack.</p>
<p>“I’m not supposed to be here tonight,” Trump said, before the crowd began chanting, “Yes, you are!”</p>
<p>“I stand before you in this arena only by the grace of Almighty God,” he added.</p>
<p>Republicans’ bestowal of the nomination on Trump at the finale of their convention is significant in that he becomes the first convicted felon to accept a major political party’s presidential nod. Trump still faces charges in multiple criminal cases after one of the cases was dropped earlier this week.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Divine intervention seen</h4>

	
<p>Trump’s comments about being saved by God followed days of politicians from throughout the country claiming the bullet only grazing his ear was an act of divine intervention.</p>
<p>Pastor Lorenzo Sewell, from Detroit, said earlier in the night that people “can’t deny the power of God” in Trump’s life.</p>
<p>“You can’t deny that God protected him, you cannot deny that it was a millimeter miracle that was able to save this man’s life,” Sewell said. “Could it be that Jesus Christ preserved him for such a time as this?”</p>
<p>“Could it be that the King of Glory, the Lord God, strong and mighty, the God who is mighty in battle, protected Donald Trump, because he wants to use him for such a time as this?” Sewell added.</p>
<p>Tucker Carlson, former Fox News television personality and conservative pundit, said that “a lot of people” are wondering what’s going on following the shooting on Saturday.</p>
<p>“Something bigger is going on here. I think people who don’t even believe in God are starting to think, ‘Well, maybe there’s something to this,’” Carlson said. “And I’m starting to think it’s going to be okay, actually.”</p>
<p>Trump wore a white bandage on his right ear concealing the wound he received <a href="https://penncapital-star.com/campaigns-elections/trump-campaigns-in-western-pennsylvania-with-rally-in-butler-county/" target="_blank">last Saturday before Secret Service agents rushed to shield him</a> from bullets.</p>
<p>Trump spoke about Corey Comperatore, a former fire chief attending the rally with his family, who was <a href="https://penncapital-star.com/campaigns-elections/fbi-identifies-shooter-in-assassination-attempt-on-trump-at-butler-rally/" target="_blank">killed in the shooting</a> as well as the two people who were injured.</p>
<p>Trump called Comperatore a “highly respected” fire chief before walking over to his fire jacket and helmet, which had been placed on the stage, and kissing the helmet in a solemn moment.</p>
<p>Trump said he spoke with Comperatore’s wife as well as the two injured people earlier in the day, who were doing “very well” in recovering from their injuries. The convention then observed a moment of silence for Comperatore.</p>

    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">GOP seeks unity as Democrats debate Biden’s fate</h4>

	
<p>The Republican National Convention and Trump’s acceptance speech provided a prime opportunity for the GOP to show unity as Democrats <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/california-rep-schiff-latest-democrat-call-biden-drop-out" target="_blank">increasingly questioned</a> whether President Joe Biden should formally become their nominee in the weeks ahead.</p>
<p>Trump repeatedly criticized Democrats’ policies and said they were a threat to the country’s future, though he only mentioned Biden once, saying the damage the current president could inflict on the country is “unthinkable.”</p>
<p>“If you took the 10 worst presidents in the history of the United States… and added them up, they will not have done the damage that Biden has done,” Trump said.</p>
<p>Voters, he said, must “rescue our nation from failed and even incompetent leadership” by voting for him and Republicans during November’s election.</p>
<p>“This will be the most important election in the history of our country,” Trump said.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘The stakes have never been higher,’ Biden campaign says</h4>

	
<p>Biden-Harris Campaign Chair Jen O’Malley Dillon released a written statement rebuking Trump’s speech, saying he “rambled on for well over an hour.”</p>
<p>“He failed to mention how he had inflicted pain and cruelty on the women of America by overturning Roe v Wade. He failed to mention his plan to take over the civil service and to pardon the January 6th insurrectionists,” Dillon wrote.</p>
<p>Biden, on the other hand, is “running for an America where we defend democracy, not diminish it,” she wrote.</p>
<p>“The stakes have never been higher,” Dillon wrote. “The choice has never been more clear. President Biden is more determined than ever to defeat Donald Trump and his Project 2025 agenda in November.”</p>
<p>DNC Chair Jaime Harrison said in a written statement that in “Trump’s Republican Party, there’s only space for unquestioning loyalists who will put him above our democracy, above our freedoms, and above working families.”</p>
<p>“Over the past four days, we’ve seen speakers endorse a far-right, dangerous vision that would see Americans’ basic liberties stripped away and replace the rule of law with the rule of Trump,” Harrison wrote. “No amount of desperate spin can change how unpopular and out of touch their disastrous plans are for the American people.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">No stain left by Jan. 6</h4>

	
<p>Trump’s speech solidified a significant turnaround for the former president, who earned rebukes from many of the party’s leaders following the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.</p>
<p>The events of that day, which led to the deaths of police officers and ended the country’s centuries-long peaceful transition of power, would traditionally have been viewed as a black spot by the party that lauds itself as supporting “law and order” as well as the country’s founding principles.</p>
<p>Instead, Trump has succeeded in convincing his supporters that the people convicted for violent acts should be pardoned as “political prisoners” and the several court cases against him are about his politics and not his actions.</p>
<p>Top Trump campaign official Chris LaCivita <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/top-trump-adviser-says-2024-election-not-over-until-inauguration-day" target="_blank">refused</a> to say earlier Thursday during an event near the RNC whether Trump would continue to campaign on the promise to pardon Jan. 6 defendants, or “hostages” as he has described them numerous times.</p>
<p>Trump said Thursday night that nothing would prevent him from becoming president following November’s election.</p>
<p>“Our resolve is unbroken and our purpose is unchanged — to deliver a government that serves the American people better than ever before,” Trump said.</p>
<p>“Nothing will stop me to this vision, because our vision is righteous and our cause is pure,” Trump added. “No matter what obstacle comes our way, we will not break, we will not bend, we will not back down and I will never stop fighting for you.”</p>
<p>Trump’s loss of the popular vote and the Electoral College four years ago led him to make false claims about election fraud, which never bore fruit. Judges threw out numerous court challenges.</p>
<p>Trump <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/fueled-lies-trump-charged-seeking-overturn-2020-election-6" target="_blank">faces federal felony charges</a> that he conspired to create false slates of electors in seven states and attempted to obstruct the certification of the 2020 presidential election results.</p>
<p>That, however, hasn’t stopped Trump from repeating the claim and making it a hallmark of his third run for the Oval Office.</p>
<p>Trump reiterated many of those incorrect claims during his speech to applause and cheers from the crowd gathered inside Fiserv Forum.</p>
<p>“They used COVID to cheat,” he said.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Trump: ‘We must not criminalize dissent’</h4>

	
<p>Despite his incessant encouragement of rally chants during the 2016 campaign to lock up former Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton, and a  <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-floats-imprisoning-political-opponents-rcna155543" target="_blank">willingness</a> to explore jailing his rivals if he wins in November, Trump said “we must not criminalize dissent or demonize political disagreement.”</p>
<p>In addition to the federal 2020 election subversion charges, Trump faces racketeering charges in Georgia, sentencing over a guilty verdict in New York, and federal charges over allegedly stealing and hiding classified government documents after leaving the Oval Office.</p>
<p>Federal District Judge Aileen Cannon on Monday <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/federal-judge-dismisses-trump-classified-documents-criminal-case" target="_blank">dropped</a> the classified documents case on the grounds that the government illegally appointed a special counsel to prosecute it. The Department of Justice has since appealed.</p>
<p>The former president reminded the crowd of the “major ruling that was handed down from a highly respected federal judge.”</p>
<p>“If the Democrats want to unify our country, they should drop these partisan witch hunts,” Trump said.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘Stop wars with a telephone call’</h4>

	
<p>Trump said the “planet is teetering on the edge of World War Three” and he will “end every single international crisis that the current administration has created.”</p>
<p>Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 “would have never happened if I was president,” he said, repeating the same claim about the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas on Israel.</p>
<p>“I tell you this, we want our hostages back and they better be back,” Trump said later in the speech about Israeli-American hostages still in Hamas captivity.</p>
<p>Trump praised Victor Orbán — the Hungarian prime minister known for his authoritarian streak — which the crowd cheered. He also touted his friendship with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un.</p>
<p>He said the press criticized him for his congeniality with Kim, but “it’s nice to get along with someone who has a lot of nuclear weapons,” Trump said.</p>
<p>“I could stop wars with a telephone call,” Trump said, but immediately followed with a promise to “build an Iron Dome missile defense system to ensure that no enemy can strike our homeland.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Trump’s ‘only crime’ is ‘loving America’</h4>

	
<p>Speakers rallying the crowd before Trump’s appearance on Thursday exalted his golf game and business management style, and defended the former president, who they say supports them through long-established ties.</p>
<p>“To me, he is my friend,” Trump’s attorney Alina Habba said tearfully.</p>
<p>“Sham indictments and baseless allegations will not deter us, because the only crime President Trump has committed is loving America,” she said.</p>
<p>Trump’s 2020 election subversion case has sat in a holding pattern for months while he appealed his claim of presidential immunity to the U.S. Supreme Court. The justices returned the case to the trial court after <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/presidential-immunity-covers-some-official-acts-supreme-court-rules-trump-case" target="_blank">issuing</a> a 6-3 majority opinion in early July that grants broad immunity for former presidents’ official acts.</p>
<p>Trump was <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-found-guilty-34-felony-counts-ny-hush-money-trial-10" target="_blank">convicted</a> of 34 felonies in New York state court for falsifying business records related to a hush money payment by his personal lawyer to a porn star ahead of the 2016 election.</p>
<p>However, the New York judge handling the case has <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-ny-sentencing-delayed-after-us-supreme-court-presidential-immunity-ruling-3" target="_blank">delayed</a> Trump’s sentencing while his lawyers challenge the case, arguing the Supreme Court’s immunity ruling opens questions about what evidence against a former sitting president can be admitted to court.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Pompeo says no Putin in Ukraine under Trump</h4>

	
<p>Mike Pompeo, Trump’s former CIA director and secretary of State, blamed Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine and deaths of its civilians on “weakness” of the Biden administration.</p>
<p>“Last week, we saw what it meant — that Children’s Hospital bombed, innocents killed — it did not have to be,” Pompeo said, referring to the July 8 Russian <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/07/08/nx-s1-5033075/russia-ukraine-war-missile-strike-childrens-hospital-kyiv" target="_blank">strike</a> on the medical facility in Kyiv.</p>
<p>World leaders from NATO etched a path for Ukraine to join the alliance at the July summit in Washington, D.C, and pledged more resources for the nation that Russia further invaded in February 2022.</p>
<p>Trump has long criticized NATO, dismissing the post-WWII alliance’s core tenet that an attack against one is an attack against all and threatening to withdraw over funding.</p>
<p>In February he <a href="https://apnews.com/article/nato-trump-delinquent-defense-allies-c1f7de696ff6ca06e4088f49b93122e1" target="_blank">told</a> a rally crowd in South Carolina that he would “encourage (Russia) to do whatever the hell they want” to “delinquent” member countries that do not pay 2% of their GDP on defense.</p>
<p>All members agreed to a 2% commitment in 2014, and 23 are <a href="https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_49198.htm" target="_blank">on track</a> to meet the target this year, according to the alliance.</p>
<p>On Wednesday night at the RNC, Trump’s running mate, Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/ohios-jd-vance-pitches-swing-state-votes-accepting-nod-trump-vp-0" target="_blank">echoed</a> Trump’s words and declared “no more free rides for nations that betray the generosity of the American taxpayer.”</p>

(Photo by Steven Hirsch-Pool/Getty Images)</p><p>MILWAUKEE —The federal classified documents case against former President Donald Trump was dismissed Monday by a Florida judge on the grounds that the Department of Justice unlawfully appointed special counsel Jack Smith.</p>
<p>The order, while likely to be appealed, makes the possibility even more remote that Trump will be tried before the election on any of the federal charges pending against him. The order came on the first day of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, during which Trump will be officially nominated as the 2024 GOP presidential candidate.</p>
<p>Trump, who on Saturday <a href="https://penncapital-star.com/campaigns-elections/trump-campaigns-in-western-pennsylvania-with-rally-in-butler-county/" target="_blank">was injured</a> at a Pennsylvania rally in what is being investigated as an attempted assassination, has also been <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/fueled-lies-trump-charged-seeking-overturn-2020-election-6" target="_blank">federally charged</a> in Washington, D.C., for his alleged attempts to subvert the 2020 presidential election results. The case is pending as a result of the U.S. Supreme Court’s <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/presidential-immunity-covers-some-official-acts-supreme-court-rules-trump-case" target="_blank">presidential immunity decision</a>.</p>
<p>In May, Trump was <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-found-guilty-34-felony-counts-ny-hush-money-trial-10" target="_blank">convicted</a> of 34 felonies in New York state court for falsifying business records related to a hush money payment ahead of the 2016 presidential election. Trump’s sentencing has been <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-ny-sentencing-delayed-after-us-supreme-court-presidential-immunity-ruling-3" target="_blank">delayed</a> until September while the court reviews the federal immunity decision.</p>
<p>Trump has also been indicted in Georgia on racketeering charges — though the case is bogged down in personnel matters — and has been ordered to pay hundreds of millions in penalties following multiple civil suits.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Trump reaction: Dismiss all ‘witch hunts’</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Trump, who arrived in Milwaukee Sunday, wrote on his social media platform Monday that all cases against him should be dropped following the attempt on his life by the 20-year-old gunman identified by law enforcement as the shooter. The gunman was killed at the scene.</p>
<p>“As we move forward in Uniting our Nation after the horrific events on Saturday, this dismissal of the Lawless Indictment in Florida should be just the first step, followed quickly by the dismissal of ALL the Witch Hunts — The January 6th Hoax in Washington, D.C., the Manhattan D.A.’s Zombie Case, the New York A.G. Scam, Fake Claims about a woman I never met (a decades old photo in a line with her then husband does not count), and the Georgia ‘Perfect’ Phone Call charges,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.</p>
<p>House Speaker Mike Johnson declared the ruling “good news for America and for the rule of law” and a “critically important step” in unifying the country after Saturday’s shooting in Western Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>In a statement issued from Milwaukee, the Louisiana Republican said</p>
<p>“House Republicans repeatedly argued that Special Counsel Jack Smith abused his office’s authority in pursuit of President Trump, and now a federal judge has ruled Smith never possessed the authority in the first place.”</p>
<p>“As we work to unify this country following the failed assassination attempt of President Trump, we must also work to end the lawfare and political witch hunts that have unfairly targeted President Trump and destroyed the American people’s faith in our system of justice,” Johnson continued.</p>
<p>Republican lawmakers largely echoed Johnson.</p>
<p>House Republican Conference Chair Elise Stefanik of New York said in a statement that she applauds District Judge Aileen Cannon’s “courage and wisdom” to dismiss the case brought by the “corrupt” special counsel.</p>
<p>“Case Dismissed! Big win for the rule of law,” South Carolina Congressman Ralph Norman wrote on X.</p>
<p>The GOP’s Rep. Clay Higgins of Louisiana also posted on the platform: “Winning. More to come. MAGA.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The dismissal order</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>In Monday’s 93-page <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24807240-trumpdocumentscase" target="_blank">order</a>, Cannon wrote Smith’s appointment violates two clauses of the U.S. Constitution that govern how presidential administrations and Congress appoint and approve “Officers of the United States” and how taxpayer money can be used to pay their salaries and other expenses.</p>
<p>“Upon careful study of the foundational challenges raised in the Motion, the Court is convinced that Special Counsel’s Smith’s prosecution of this action breaches two structural cornerstones of our constitutional scheme—the role of Congress in the appointment of constitutional officers, and the role of Congress in authorizing expenditures by law,” wrote Cannon, who sits on the bench in the Southern District of Florida.</p>
<p>She was nominated by Trump in 2020 and <a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_votes/vote1162/vote_116_2_00228.htm" target="_blank">confirmed</a> by the U.S. Senate later that year.</p>
<p>In February, Trump’s team filed the <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.flsd.648653/gov.uscourts.flsd.648653.326.0.pdf" target="_blank">motion</a> to dismiss the <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/67490070/united-states-v-trump/?order_by=desc&amp;page=2" target="_blank">case</a>, accusing Smith of being unlawfully appointed and paid.</p>
<p>The classified documents case against Trump presented a historic first for the United States — a former sitting president had never been charged with federal crimes.</p>
<p>A federal grand jury handed up a 37-count indictment in June 2023 charging the former president and his aide Walt Nauta with felonies related to mishandling classified documents after his term in office, including storing them at his Florida Mar-a-Lago estate.</p>
<p>A little over a month later a new indictment was handed up, adding new charges against the former president and also adding Trump’s Mar-a-Lago property manager Carlos De Oliveira as a co-defendant.</p>
<p>Cannon’s order dismisses the July 2023 <a href="https://www.justice.gov/storage/US-v-Trump-Nauta-De-Oliveira-23-80101.pdf" target="_blank">superseding indictment</a>.</p>
<p>The court will now close the case and cancel any scheduled hearings. Any pending motions are considered moot, according to Cannon’s order.</p>
<p>The Department of Justice did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Democrats slam ‘misguided ruling’</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Cannon’s dismissal of the case was met with shock from Democrats, who view Trump’s alleged mishandling of classified documents as a serious, prosecutable offense.</p>
<p>The indictment against Trump detailed how U.S. government documents marked “secret” and “confidential” were stored at Mar-a-Lago, an active social club in Palm Beach, in a ballroom, bathroom and shower, bedroom, office space and storage area.</p>
<p>Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement Monday that the “breathtakingly misguided ruling flies in the face of long-accepted practice and repetitive judicial precedence.”</p>
<p>“It is wrong on the law and must be appealed immediately. This is further evidence that Judge Cannon cannot handle this case impartially and must be reassigned,” the New York Democrat said.</p>
<p>Conor Lamb, a former congressman from Pennsylvania, wrote on X that Saturday’s failed assassination on Trump does not exonerate him from taking and keeping classified records as he left the Oval Office.</p>
<p>“In the same way that the Secret Service’s failure to protect Trump was unacceptable, it was unacceptable for Trump to fail to protect our country’s secrets.  Trump is a victim of the 1st but that doesn’t change that he is the perpetrator of the 2nd.  Accountability for both,” Lamb wrote.</p>
<p>Not Above the Law, a coalition of 150 organizations, issued a statement calling the ruling “flatly wrong.”</p>
<p>“The special counsel statute is clear. Its constitutionality has been upheld by multiple courts in the past, and Judge Cannon has no grounds to reject such a well-settled principle,” read the statement signed by the organization’s four co-chairs.</p>
<p>“Accountability, protecting the rule of law, and justice cannot be further delayed. We expect Judge Cannon’s ruling not only to be swiftly appealed, but also promptly reversed,” continued the statement from Lisa Gilbert, co-president of Public Citizen; Praveen Fernandes, vice president of the Constitutional Accountability Center; David Sievers, interim organizing director at MoveOn; and Brett Edkins, managing director for policy and political affairs at Stand Up America.</p>

<p>Local authorities confirmed the shooter was killed, according to The Associated Press.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://penncapital-star.com/campaigns-elections/trump-campaigns-in-western-pennsylvania-with-rally-in-butler-county/" target="_blank">shooting at a crowded outdoor rally</a> in Butler, just an hour outside Pittsburgh, occurred less than 48 hours before the Republican National Convention is set to begin in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Trump is expected to become the party’s official presidential nominee on Thursday.</p>
<p>Video <a href="https://x.com/cspan/status/1812252484804751635" target="_blank">footage of the rally</a> shows Trump bringing his hand to the right side of his face and ducking down behind the podium just after several gunshots and screams were heard. U.S. Secret Service agents huddled around the former president and raced him off the stage as he reached out to pump his fist in the air toward the crowd.</p>
<p>Trump campaign spokesman Steve Cheung issued a statement shortly after that the former president is “fine” and that he thanked law enforcement.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘Praying for President Trump’</h4>

	
<p>Members of Congress from both political parties uniformly condemned violence in a wave of social media posts and official statements.</p>
<p>House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, posted on social media that he was “Praying for President Trump.”</p>
<p>“Kelly and I are praying for President Trump and all the attendees of the campaign rally today in Pennsylvania, and we send our gratitude to the law enforcement who responded at the scene,” Johnson wrote.</p>
<p>“I have been briefed by law enforcement and am continuing to monitor the developments,” Johnson added. “This horrific act of political violence at a peaceful campaign rally has no place in this country and should be unanimously and forcefully condemned.”</p>
<p>Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, released a written statement saying that he was “horrified by what happened at the Trump rally in Pennsylvania and relieved that former President Trump is safe.”</p>
<p>“Political violence has no place in our country,” Schumer wrote.</p>
<p>Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, of Kentucky, wrote on social media that “all Americans are grateful that President Trump appears to be fine after a despicable attack on a peaceful rally.”</p>
<p>“Violence has no place in our politics,” McConnell wrote. “We appreciate the swift work of the Secret Service and other law enforcement.”</p>
<p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat, wrote on social media that his “thoughts and prayers are with former President Trump.”</p>
<p>“I am thankful for the decisive law enforcement response,” Jeffries wrote. “America is a democracy. Political violence of any kind is never acceptable.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Members of Congress react with horror</h4>

	
<p>Democratic Sen. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania issued a statement that he was monitoring the situation that unfolded in Western Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>“(A)nd I’ve reached out (to) the State Police to offer support. Political violence is never acceptable and I am hoping former president Trump &amp; all attendees are safe. Everyone in Butler should listen to law enforcement,” Casey wrote on social media.</p>
<p>Arizona Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly, whose wife Gabby Giffords, a former congresswoman, was shot in 2011 at an event, posted that they were both “horrified.”</p>
<p>“Gabby and I are horrified by the incident in Pennsylvania,” Kelly wrote. “No one should ever have to experience political violence — we know that firsthand. We’re keeping former President Trump, his family, and everyone involved in our thoughts.”</p>
<p>Giffords wrote on her own social media feed that “Political violence is terrifying. I know.”</p>
<p>“I’m holding former President Trump, and all those affected by today’s indefensible act of violence in my heart. Political violence is un-American and is never acceptable — never,” Giffords wrote.</p>
<p>Michigan Sen. Gary Peters, chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, wrote on social media that “(p)olitical violence is despicable, and there is no place for it in America.”</p>
<p>“I’m grateful that former President Trump is safe, and to the law enforcement officials who risked their lives to take action” Peters wrote. “I will continue to closely monitor this developing situation.”</p>
<p>Maine Republican Sen. Susan Collins wrote on social media that she was “very relieved that President Trump appears to be OK; however, this violence is absolutely appalling.”</p>
<p>“Thank God for the Secret Service and first responders who hurried President Trump out of harm’s way,” Collins wrote.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Quick response</h4>

	
<p>Rep. Rosa DeLauro, a Connecticut Democrat, commended the quick response of Secret Service agents and other authorities on the scene.</p>
<p>“My thoughts and prayers are with former President Donald Trump and his family after hearing news of a shooting at his campaign rally today,” DeLauro of Connecticut posted on social media.</p>
<p>House Republican Mike Turner of Ohio, chair of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, issued a statement saying “As the situation unfolds in Butler, Pennsylvania, I urge everyone to join me in praying for President Trump and our country.”</p>
<p>House Republican Conference Chair Elise Stefanik of New York wrote on social media that “AMERICA IS PRAYING! GOD BLESS PRESIDENT TRUMP!<a href="https://x.com/hashtag/SAVEAMERICA?src=hashtag_click" target="_blank"> #SAVEAMERICA</a>,”</p>
<p>“I’m praying for President Trump. I hope everyone will join me,” former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy wrote on X.</p>
<p>“Jacquie and I are praying for President Trump and all of the attendees at today’s rally. President Trump is a proven warrior who has overcome adversity time and time again. He will rise above this horrifying situation stronger than ever,” House Republican Whip Tom Emmer of Minnesota posted.</p>
<p>Former Republican Congresswoman Liz Cheney, an outspoken critic of Trump and ranking member of the House committee that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, said news of the shooting was “horrifying.”</p>
<p>“Violence of any kind has no place in American politics. We are grateful for the reaction of Secret Service and other law enforcement and pray for the former president and all those injured,” Cheney wrote on social media.</p>
<p>Israeli President Benjamin Netanyahu issued a statement on social media saying he was “shocked by the apparent attack on President Trump.”</p>
<p>“We pray for his safety and speedy recovery,” the leader of the U.S. ally said.</p>

NATO leaders convened in Washington this week for the annual summit to discuss future strategies and commitments and mark the 75th anniversary of the alliance’s founding. (Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden dug in on his 2024 reelection bid Thursday at a solo press conference following the NATO summit in Washington, despite a growing list of rank-and-file Democrats and high-profile supporters urging him to abandon his campaign over suspected health concerns.</p>
<p>The highly anticipated press conference followed weeks of speculation about Biden’s ability to hold office and whether he should remain in the 2024 presidential election against former President Donald Trump. His performance, while markedly stronger than his <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/biden-and-trump-trade-insults-accusations-lying-acrimonious-presidential-debate" target="_blank">devastating debate performance</a>, still included a notable gaffe and could leave questions open.</p>
<p>In response to the first question, about if Vice President Kamala Harris would be an able candidate against Trump, Biden mixed up their names.</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t have picked Vice President Trump to be vice president if I didn’t think she was not qualified to be president,” he said.</p>
<p>Biden fielded a wide range of questions from reporters from both the U.S. and overseas for just less than an hour. The meeting with the press came exactly two weeks after the June 27 debate, during which Biden stumbled repeatedly, spoke in a hoarse voice and appeared unable to finish some sentences.</p>
<p>Biden and the White House have repeatedly attributed the debate as a “bad night” and pointed to clean results from his last three annual physical examinations.</p>
<p>Asked directly about congressional Democrats’ <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/biden-camp-works-stem-growing-democratic-unease-over-reelection-prospects" target="_blank">unease</a> about his candidacy, Biden said he had made a final decision to remain in the race, but was working to show doubters he was up to the task and responding to criticism that he could not handle impromptu questioning.</p>
<p>“I’m determined on running,” he said. “But I think it’s important that I allay fears by seeing — let them see me out there.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Not stepping aside</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>He added that delegates pledged to him through the Democratic nominating process should be free to vote their conscience, but that no one had a better alternative to his candidacy against Trump, the presumed Republican candidate.</p>
<p>“I believe I’m the best qualified to govern and I think I’m the best qualified to win,” Biden said. “But there are other people who could beat Trump, too, but it’s awful hard to start from scratch.”</p>
<p>Asked if he would step aside if his polling data showed Harris could beat Trump, Biden said he would not, unless it also showed he could not win.</p>
<p>“No one’s saying that,” he added in a whisper. “No poll says that.”</p>
<p>Harris is seen as the likeliest replacement for Biden if he were to leave the race.</p>
<p>A trickle of congressional Democrats calling for him to leave the race <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/texas-us-house-member-calls-biden-withdraw-amid-debate-fallout" target="_blank">since</a> July 2 <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/biden-camp-works-stem-growing-democratic-unease-over-reelection-prospects" target="_blank">turned</a> to a stream this week — with some reports indicating a poor performance Thursday night could give way to a flood.</p>
<p>Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a decades-long friend of Biden’s, <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/watch/nancy-pelosi-it-s-up-to-biden-to-decide-if-he-s-going-to-run-214554181531" target="_blank">urged</a> colleagues in an MSNBC interview Wednesday to “let (Biden) deal with this NATO conference, this is a very big deal.”</p>
<p>At the time Biden began his Thursday press conference, 14 Democrats in Congress had explicitly called for him to leave the race, with others suggesting it.</p>
<p>Shortly after the press conference concluded, two more, Connecticut’s Jim Himes and California’s Scott Peters, called on Biden to step aside.</p>
<p>Biden should “make room for a new generation of leaders,” Himes, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, wrote in a statement <a href="https://x.com/jahimes/status/1811558379661185359" target="_blank">posted to X</a>.</p>
<p>Peters’ statement was <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/07/11/congress/how-dem-lawmakers-viewed-bidens-performance-00167743" target="_blank">provided to Politico</a>.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Emphasis on foreign policy</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Biden, who has rarely held press conferences, consulted a list of reporters and took questions that ranged from his fitness to serve as president to his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.</p>
<p>He lauded his accomplishments in office and said his job performance showed he was still up for the job.</p>
<p>“If I slow down, I can’t get the job done, that’s a sign that I shouldn’t be doing it,” he said. “But there’s no indication of that yet. None.”</p>
<p>Biden — a former chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee — appeared more comfortable on foreign policy questions than he was discussing his political future, providing in-depth answers on the Israel-Hamas war, China’s growing influence on the world stage and Ukraine’s war with Russia.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Trump mocks Biden</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>While Biden’s voice and grasp on the issues appeared stronger than he was at the debate, he still made several speaking mistakes, including the confusion between his vice president and Trump.</p>
<p>Trump mocked the mix-up on his social media platform Truth Social with a post saying “Great job, Joe!”</p>
<p>Later, Biden said Harris was qualified to be president and that is why he picked her as a running mate. His comments were worthy of attention given Harris would likely become the nominee if Biden were to step down.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Biden attacks Trump on NATO</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Biden declared the summit a “great success” and underlined the U.S. commitment to the alliance and to Ukraine’s war against Russia.</p>
<p>“For those who thought NATO’s time had passed, they got a rude awakening when Putin invaded Ukraine. Some of the oldest and deepest fears in Europe roared back to life because once again a murderous madman was on the march. This time, no one cowered in appeasement, especially the United States,” Biden said.</p>
<p>Prior to taking questions, he attacked Trump’s record of disparaging NATO and its foundational commitment to defend fellow member nations. The former president has threatened to withdraw from NATO and accused allies of shortchanging the organization’s defense coffers.</p>
<p>“A strong NATO is essential to American security, and I believe the obligation of Article Five is sacred. And I remind all Americans, Article Five was invoked only once in NATO’s long history, and that was to defend America after 9/11,” Biden said.</p>
<p>The three-day summit largely centered on Russia’s ongoing bombardment and occupation of parts of Ukraine. World leaders promised a path for Ukraine to join the alliance, and the event culminated with the U.S. joining two dozen allies in signing the Ukraine Compact to “(a)ffirm that the security of Ukraine is integral to the security of the Euro-Atlantic region and beyond.”</p>
<p>Biden <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?536945-1/president-biden-meets-ukrainian-president-zelensky" target="_blank">sat down</a> with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy earlier Thursday to underscore military assistance including “working with our NATO allies to ensure Ukraine is flying F-16s this summer.”</p>
<p>Zelenskyy thanked Biden for his “support and personal statement” following Russia’s strike on a children’s hospital in Kyiv Monday. Biden shook his head and responded the attack was “sick.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Another flub</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Between his meeting with Zelenskyy and the press conference, Biden introduced the Ukrainian president at a separate event to sign the compact, but mistakenly called him President Putin — the Russian leader at war with Zelenskyy’s country — before correcting himself.</p>
<p>When asked about the blunder, Biden acknowledged that he made the mistake but said that he corrected it immediately.</p>
<p>“I thought it was the most successful conference I’ve attended in a long time and find me a world leader who didn’t think it was,” he replied.</p>
<p>Biden did not stumble earlier in the week <a href="https://kansasreflector.com/2024/07/09/biden-commends-nato-strength-pledges-more-aid-for-ukraine-against-russia/" target="_blank">when he delivered remarks</a> at NATO’s 75th anniversary event; rather, his voice remained steady and firm as he opened the ceremony for leaders from the 32 member nations.</p>

Jon Tester (D-MT) departs the Capitol on July 8, 2024 in Washington, DC. Several Democratic members of Congress have urged President Joe Biden to withdraw from the presidential race after his June 27 debate against presumed Republican nominee Donald Trump. Concerns about Biden's age and perceived slowing down have intensified, with critics fearing these issues could undermine his ability to effectively challenge Trump in the upcoming election. (Kent Nishimura/Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON — Democrats in Congress called on President Joe Biden to prove to voters that he is up for another four years in the Oval Office, though many in interviews pledged to stick with him as the presumptive nominee as they returned to the Capitol on Monday following the Fourth of July recess.</p>
<p>Questions over Biden’s ability to continue with his reelection campaign dominated the nation’s capital throughout the day. Biden shipped a defiant letter to Hill Democrats and unexpectedly called in to a popular morning MSNBC show to make his case. At the White House, reporters engaged in a tense back-and-forth with Biden press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre over the president’s mental fitness.</p>
<p>Most significantly, the comments about Biden’s future from more than 20 lawmakers came just ahead of crucial meetings Tuesday, when Senate and House Democrats will huddle separately to work out the path ahead for Biden’s reelection bid.</p>
<p>The decision about whether to back Biden is especially tough for vulnerable senators, who are seeking to hold the chamber against long odds, and House members from swing districts full of Republican voters.</p>
<p>Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware, a close confidant to Biden, defended the president when asked by States Newsroom whether Biden can steer the narrative back to policy issues and away from questions about his cognitive function, following his shaky debate performance on June 27.</p>
<p>“I’m really struck no one’s asked me a question about should Donald Trump drop out, should Donald Trump have a neurological exam, should Donald Trump be facing Republicans calling for him to step aside given his demonstrably immoral, unhinged conduct? He’s a convict,” Coons said, referring to the former president and presumptive GOP nominee. “In my view, Joe Biden has won our primaries, has won our confidence and deserves our support.”</p>
<p>Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet said Democrats must be level-headed about whether to encourage Biden to withdraw as their presumptive nominee, arguing that it is now more of a moral question than a political one.</p>
<p>“I think it is really important for us, as Democrats, to have an open discussion and to have an open debate to ensure that we are on a path to winning the White House, to winning the Senate, to winning the House,” Bennet said. “And I think that’s an act, not of disloyalty, but an act of loyalty.”</p>
<p>This year’s election is especially critical for Democrats in swing districts and purple states, and party leaders need to ensure the top of the ticket can help those people, not hinder them, said Bennet, who is not up for reelection.</p>
<p>Rep. Melanie Stansbury of New Mexico said she wants House Democrats to unify at Tuesday morning’s party meeting.</p>
<p>“My hope is that Democrats come to a reasonable consensus about the path forward, which is that we have to defeat Donald Trump,” Stansbury said.</p>
<p>“And right now we’ve got to work like hell to make sure that people understand the consequences of reelecting Donald Trump. He is a convicted felon, he is a perpetrator in the January 6th (attack), he is all the things that we know he is. And so while I understand the media focus on the current moment, we really need to shift back to the real danger,” Stansbury said.</p>
<p>The unease among congressional Democrats came after a handful of senior House Democrats on Sunday said Biden should step down on a private phone call with Democratic leaders, according to media reports. Rep. Adam Smith of Washington publicly called on Biden to exit the race Monday.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The Biden defenders</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin said his confidence in Biden is “high,” but he understands “the reality of the challenges that he faces and we face since the debate.”</p>
<p>“It’s raised a national discussion about his competence and the ability to finish the campaign,” Durbin said.</p>
<p>The Illinois lawmaker said he has been discussing alternatives to Biden with colleagues, but so far hasn’t heard a name he’s willing to endorse publicly.</p>
<p>Durbin said he does worry that if Biden remains the nominee, the focus will stay on his health and not on the issues that Democrats want to be front and center in the campaign.</p>

		<p style="font-size:13px"><b>– Virginia U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine</b></p>
	</div>
	</div>

	
<p>Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine said he told voters in his home state over the Fourth of July week that he respects Biden and “never had reason to question his ability to be a patriot, put the country first. And I’m sure he’ll make a decision that does that.”</p>
<p>“And that decision is going to be one that I support,” he said.</p>
<p>Kaine said that Biden often does better talking to smaller groups of voters and suggested his campaign get him in that setting more often, if they want to alleviate concerns.</p>
<p>“Okay, he had a bad debate performance. But when he interacts with everyday folks who are going through challenges, talking about their aspirations and how to achieve them, that’s his strong suit,” Kaine said. “And I’ve seen him do that again and again and again. And I hope the campaign will find ways for him to do that because he does it better than anybody.”</p>
<p>California Rep. Ami Bera said Biden has a pretty good chance to outrun his debate performance, especially considering all the bad headlines that came out during the 2016 Trump campaign.</p>
<p>“Donald Trump came back from ‘Access Hollywood,’ right?” Bera said. “So there’s a long time in this campaign cycle. It was always going to be a close race, but it’s going to be hard if we’re not on the same page.”</p>
<p>Bera called on Biden to meet with Democrats in Congress and for the party to be honest about polling and fundraising.</p>
<p>“I think that the debate was not a good debate. It was one that gave a lot of folks pause,” Bera said. “But the president has said he’s committed to running. At this juncture, having a divided house doesn’t make sense. That’s why my advice is, he ought to come to the Democrats or ought to invite us to meet with him somewhere else. And we all ought to get on the same page.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Congressional Black Caucus chair supportive of Biden</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Nevada Democratic Rep. Steven Horsford, who also chairs the Congressional Black Caucus, said he decided to support Biden’s ongoing candidacy after talking with voters in his district.</p>
<p>“I’m a frontline member in a battleground state. I have as tough of a district as anyone here in the House and I’ve been a frontliner for the last three cycles,” Horsford said. “What my constituents have said is they voted for President Joe Biden, and they expect their representative to honor their vote and the will of the people. And there’s a process and that process should not be overturned by a few select members in Congress.”</p>
<p>Sen. Alex Padilla of California said he remains steadfast in his support for Biden.</p>
<p>“I would encourage my colleagues to take all the time and energy that we’re spending on this topic and put it into voter outreach and organizing for November,” he said.</p>
<p>New Mexico Sen. Ben Ray Luján said he continues to back Biden and is confident that he will win reelection in November.</p>
<p>“What I want to see is President Biden out and about, like we saw this weekend, talking to more people at rallies and areas and just being himself,” Luján said. “I think that he’s the best when he’s just himself and chatting with people.”</p>
<p>Congressional Hispanic Caucus Chair Nanette Barragán said she supports Biden and isn’t focused on what the risk could be if voters don’t gain more confidence in his health.</p>
<p>“I think he can win. He has won. He has ideas. He’s got plans,” Barragán said. “When I talk to people, even people who’ve been undecided have said ‘The president has ideas and he has a track record. The other person is just going up there and telling lies.’”</p>
<p>Nevada Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto said that she continues to back Biden because of his record while in the White House.</p>
<p>“He’s been there every step of the way supporting Nevadans as we came through the pandemic, as we fight for a woman’s right to choose, as we lower costs for families, and fighting for affordable housing,” Cortez Masto said. “He’s been on the picket lines with so many in my state. So at the end of the day, I know he’s good for Nevada, and so I stand with him.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">More defenders</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden said Democrats have “a lot of work to do” to get Biden reelected in November, but said “that’s always the case.”</p>
<p>And while the debate was a “rough night,” he said, there will be many more of those if Trump is reelected president in November.</p>
<p>“You want a lot of rough nights? You’re gonna get four years of them if you elect Donald Trump,” Wyden said.</p>
<p>Michigan Sen. Gary Peters, who is also chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said he will continue to back Biden.</p>
<p>“I support Joe Biden. He is our nominee,” Peters said. “I’m confident he will win and we’re going to be able to hold the Senate as well.”</p>
<p>New Jersey Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman said Democrats need to unify “to protect this democracy” and brushed aside a question about whether Biden is being honest with himself about his health.</p>
<p>“I don’t believe that he’s ever done anything that suggests to me that he’s a liar, like his opponent,” Watson Coleman said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘Conversations are healthy’</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen said she has confidence in Biden to do the right thing, but didn’t say what exactly she believes that is.</p>
<p>“I think the conversations are healthy,” Shaheen said. “I expect him to do what’s in the best interest of the country.”</p>
<p>Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey said, “the most important thing right now is to beat Donald Trump. Talking to you all is not gonna necessarily help that.”</p>
<p>Sen. Tammy Baldwin, who is up for reelection in Wisconsin, would not answer reporters directly when asked if she supports Biden.</p>
<p>“I support the Democratic ticket,” she said.</p>
<p>Rep. Jared Huffman of California said the Democratic Caucus meeting Tuesday, which will be private, will be “important” and that he wasn’t ready to comment further on Biden’s reelection bid.</p>
<p>“I support continuing this conversation and winning the election,” Huffman said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Not answering questions</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Rhode Island Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse refused to answer repeated questions from reporters on Capitol Hill, saying he wanted to wait to hear what his colleagues say during the Tuesday closed-door lunch.</p>
<p>Several senators, including Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Angus King of Maine, quickly bypassed reporters or pointed them to written statements they’ve issued.</p>
<p>Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland declined to comment “because we’re still in the middle of the whole thing.”</p>
<p>“We’re all working for the best solution,” he said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Senators with tough races</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Vulnerable U.S. senators, who have so far been quiet, issued statements Monday addressing Biden’s ability to remain in the presidential campaign.</p>
<p>Sen. Jon Tester of Montana said in a written statement Biden “has got to prove to the American people—including me—that he’s up to the job for another four years,” according to media <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/4760277-tester-says-biden-must-prove-hes-up-to-the-job/" target="_blank">reports</a>.</p>
<p>“Meanwhile, I’ll continue to do what I’ve always done: Stand up to President Biden when he’s wrong and protect our Montana way of life,” Tester said in his statement.</p>
<p>Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio said on the campaign trail Monday that he’s heard concerns from voters regarding Biden moving forward in the race, according to an NBC News <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/live-blog/trump-biden-election-2024-live-updates-rcna160227" target="_blank">report</a>.</p>
<p>“I’m not a pundit. I’ve talked to people across Ohio. They have legitimate questions about whether the president should continue his campaign, and I’ll keep listening to people,” Brown said.</p>
<p>Washington Sen. Patty Murray, the president pro tempore and chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee, issued a written statement highly critical of Biden remaining the nominee.</p>
<p>“I have a deep appreciation and strong respect for Joe, who has led a historic first term as President,” Murray wrote.</p>
<p>“Still, we need to see a much more forceful and energetic candidate on the campaign trail in the very near future in order for him to convince voters he is up to the job,” she said. “At this critical time for our country, President Biden must seriously consider the best way to preserve his incredible legacy and secure it for the future.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Parkinson’s disease specialist</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Administration officials defended Biden on Monday during a 75-minute, and at times tense, press briefing where reporters largely questioned Biden’s capacity to continue his reelection bid.</p>
<p>Jean-Pierre told reporters the president has cleared detailed neurological exams during each of his three annual physicals, the last one being in February.</p>
<p>The exams “have been detailed, they have been extensive,” she said, refusing to confirm names of medical specialists, for security reasons in a lengthy back-and-forth with reporters.</p>
<p>Journalists pressed Jean-Pierre about a Monday <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/08/us/politics/parkinsons-expert-white-house.html" target="_blank">report</a> in the New York Times that a Parkinson’s disease specialist from Walter Reed National Military Medical Center visited the White House eight times from July 2023 to March. Parkinson’s is a “progressive disorder that affects the nervous system and the parts of the body controlled by the nerves,” <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/parkinsons-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20376055" target="_blank">according to</a> the Mayo Clinic.</p>
<p>Jean-Pierre said “thousands” of military personnel come to the White House.</p>
<p>“Has the president been treated for Parkinson’s? No. Is he being treated for Parkinson’s? No, he’s not. Is he taking medication for Parkinson’s? No. So those are the things I can give you full-blown answers on, but I’m not going to confirm a specialist, or any specialist, that comes to the White House,” Jean-Pierre said.</p>
<p>Jean-Pierre repeatedly stated that Biden receives regular “verbal check-ins” with his doctor, usually while he is exercising.</p>
<p>The White House released a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Letter7.8.24.pdf" target="_blank">two-page memo </a>much later Monday that Dr. Kevin Cannard “was the neurological specialist that examined President Biden for each of his annual physicals.”</p>
<p>“His findings have been made public each time that I have released the results of the President’s annual physical,” wrote Dr. Kevin O’Connor, physician to the president. “President Biden has not seen a neurologist outside of his annual physical.”</p>
<p>Cannard has been the Neurology Consultant to the White House Medical Unit for 12 years and has held regular clinics for “active-duty members” at the White House, according to the letter.</p>
<p>The president is scheduled to spend most of the week with NATO leaders at the summit in Washington, D.C., and will give a solo press conference Thursday evening.</p>
<p>National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said during the press briefing “we’re not picking up any signs of (concerns) from our allies at all.”</p>
<p>Kirby dismissed questions that Biden’s debate performance could be illustrative of his communications with his international counterparts.</p>
<p>“What I saw in that debate is not reflective of the man and the leader and the commander-in-chief that I have spent many, many hours with over the last two-and-a-half years, in terms of the specificity of the way he probes, the questions he asks,” Kirby said. “Heck, just this morning he was asking me questions about a situation on the European continent that I couldn’t answer, and I told him I’d have to get back to him.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Biden pushes back with letter, calls in to ‘Morning Joe’</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24794331-bidenletterjuly8" target="_blank">letter</a> to congressional Democrats, Biden <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/biden-tells-congressional-dems-he-staying-race-urges-end-speculation" target="_blank">wrote</a> Monday that he is “firmly committed to staying in this race, to running this race to the end, and to beating Donald Trump.”</p>
<p>He then called into MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” for a live phone <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe" target="_blank">interview</a> during which he criticized Democrats urging him to exit the race as “elites.”</p>
<p>“I’m getting so frustrated by the elites — now I’m not talking about you guys — the elites in the party, ‘Oh, they know so much more.’ Any of these guys that don’t think I should run, run against me. Announce for president, challenge me at the convention,” he said to hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski.</p>
<p>When asked by Brzezinski whether he can assure Americans that he won’t have another performance like the June 27 debate, Biden responded, “Look at my career, I’ve not had many of those nights.”</p>
<p>The live interview came one day after Biden held a rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, where he was joined by U.S. Sen. John Fetterman, Rep. Madeleine Dean and Pennsylvania Lt. Gov. Austin Davis.</p>
<p>Biden began the weekend with a 22-minute <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/biden-first-tv-interview-debate-denies-medical-condition-it-was-bad-episode" target="_blank">interview</a> Friday night with ABC’s George Stephanopoulos during which he attributed his debate performance to a “bad episode.”</p>
<p>The first sign of waning Democratic support appeared July 2 when Rep. Lloyd Doggett of Texas became the first sitting congressional Democrat <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/texas-us-house-member-calls-biden-withdraw-amid-debate-fallout" target="_blank">to call on Biden to withdraw</a> from the 2024 race.</p>

(Photo by Brendan McDermid-Pool/Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON — U.S. presidents enjoy full immunity from criminal charges for their official “core constitutional” acts, but no immunity for unofficial acts, the Supreme Court ruled Monday, sending former President Donald Trump’s case back to the lower courts.</p>
<p>The justices left open the question of how far official acts can reach, possibly reshaping the contours of the American presidency.</p>
<p>Trump escalated his immunity claim to the nation’s highest bench after two lower courts <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-claim-presidential-immunity-turned-down-federal-appeals-court-dc" target="_blank">denied</a> his request for protection from federal criminal charges alleging he schemed to overturn the 2020 presidential results.</p>
<p>The decision about the presumptive Republican presidential nominee’s actions while in office likely <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/delayed-supreme-court-ruling-makes-trump-trial-2020-charges-unlikely-election" target="_blank">closes the door</a> to any chance that Trump’s election subversion case could go to trial before Election Day.</p>
<p>The justices took up the case in February but did not hear <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-supreme-court-floats-return-trial-court-trump-presidential-immunity-case" target="_blank">oral arguments</a> until April 25.</p>
<p>The trial court must now grapple with whether Trump’s alleged conduct to spread false information about the 2020 election results and conspiring to overturn them qualified as official presidential action.</p>
<p>In a 6-3 <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf" target="_blank">opinion</a>, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. wrote that the president is subject to criminal prosecution for unofficial acts, “like everyone else.”</p>
<p>“But unlike anyone else, the President is a branch of government, and the Constitution vests in him sweeping powers and duties,” Roberts wrote. “Accounting for that reality—and ensuring that the President may exercise those powers forcefully, as the Framers anticipated he would—does not place him above the law; it preserves the basic structure of the Constitution.”</p>
<p>The Supreme Court held that Trump’s conversations with Department of Justice officials regarding the election results were official but left unanswered questions about other conduct named in Department of Justice special counsel Jack’s Smith <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.258149/gov.uscourts.dcd.258149.1.0_2.pdf" target="_blank">indictment</a> of Trump.</p>
<p>“​​Certain allegations—such as those involving Trump’s discussions with the Acting Attorney General—are readily categorized in light of the nature of the President’s official relationship to the office held by that individual,” the opinion reads. “Other allegations— such as those involving Trump’s interactions with the Vice President, state officials, and certain private parties, and his comments to the general public—present more difficult questions.”</p>
<p>In a dissenting opinion, Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote the decision makes the president “immune from criminal prosecution if he used the trappings of his office to violate criminal law.”</p>
<p>“If the occupant of that office misuses official power for personal gain, the criminal law that the rest of us must abide will not provide a backstop,” Sotomayor wrote. “With fear for our democracy, I dissent.”</p>
<p>Trump <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-makes-one-last-presidential-immunity-argument-us-supreme-court" target="_blank">claimed</a> in court filings that he could not be prosecuted for actions he took while still in office. His legal team also argues that former presidents cannot be tried in the court of law unless they are first impeached by the U.S. House and convicted by the Senate.</p>
<p>The indictment, which a federal grand jury handed up in August 2023, <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/fueled-lies-trump-charged-seeking-overturn-2020-election-6" target="_blank">alleges</a> Trump knowingly spread falsehoods to his supporters, plotting with co-conspirators to overturn results in seven states and eventually working his base into a frenzy that culminated in a violent attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, the day Congress was to certify electoral votes.</p>
<p>DOJ’s Smith <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.258149/gov.uscourts.dcd.258149.1.0_2.pdf" target="_blank">charged</a> the former president with conspiracy to defraud the United States; conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding; obstruction of, and attempt to obstruct, an official proceeding; and conspiracy against rights.</p>

(U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Theoplis Stewart II)</p><p>WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden will pardon U.S. military veterans who were discharged or convicted under military law for consensual same-sex relations, the administration announced Wednesday.</p>
<p>The White House could not provide an exact number of veterans who will be pardoned, but the administration estimates thousands were convicted over several decades and may be eligible.</p>
<p>The convictions were enforced under a military law that prohibited certain types of sex from May 1951 to December 2013.</p>
<p>When asked why Biden chose now to pardon the veterans, senior administration officials told reporters on a call Tuesday that Biden is “committed to doing everything he can to ensure that the culture of the armed forces reflect the values that make us an exceptional nation and to maintaining the finest fighting force in the world.”</p>
<p>The officials continued that Biden is “taking this historic step to ensure that we live up to our sacred obligation to care for all service members, veterans and their families.”</p>
<p>Biden said in a statement Wednesday that he is “righting an historic wrong by using my clemency authority to pardon many former service members who were convicted simply for being themselves.”</p>
<p>“Our Nation’s service members stand on the frontlines of freedom, and risk their lives in order to defend our country,” Biden said in the written statement.</p>
<p>“Despite their courage and great sacrifice, thousands of LGBTQI+ service members were forced out of the military because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. Some of these patriotic Americans were subject to court-martial, and have carried the burden of this great injustice for decades.”</p>
<p>Administration officials said guidance will be posted on the Department of Defense website for veterans to apply for proof they are eligible for pardon under the proclamation.</p>
<p>Veterans can then use the certificate of proof to apply to their respective military branch for a discharge upgrade.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Military law and consensual sex</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Biden’s Wednesday proclamation effectuates the pardons for any veterans, alive or deceased, who were discharged or convicted in military court under <a href="https://www.sapr.mil/public/docs/ucmj/UCMJ_Article125_Sodomy.pdf" target="_blank">Article 125</a> of the Uniform Code of Military Justice for consensual sexual relationships.</p>
<p>While the law prohibited forceful sex acts with minors and animals, Article 125 also banned “unnatural carnal copulation” — defined as oral or anal sex — with another person of the same or opposite sex.</p>
<p>The military code was updated in 2013 to reflect that only forceful, not consensual, sexual acts could be penalized.</p>
<p>Administration officials acknowledged that Article 125 is not the only military law that targeted LGBTQ+ service members.</p>
<p>Senior administration officials told reporters that while the proclamation is narrowly focused on convictions under Article 125, the Department of Justice has been instructed to flag any other clemency applications for veterans penalized for sexual orientation or gender identity under other military statutes.</p>
<p>The U.S. military has a decades-long history of anti-LGBTQ+ policies. The armed forces outright banned gay and lesbian service members during World War II.</p>
<p>In 1993, President Bill Clinton set a “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy, essentially allowing LGBTQ+ members to serve in the military, so long as they didn’t make their sexual orientation public.</p>
<p>The policy was <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/111th-congress/house-bill/2965?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%22H.R.+2965%22%7D&amp;s=6&amp;r=3" target="_blank">repealed</a> under President Barack Obama.</p>
<p>Days after his inauguration, Biden issued an <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/25/executive-order-on-enabling-all-qualified-americans-to-serve-their-country-in-uniform/" target="_blank">executive order</a> overturning a ban on transgender service members.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Pardon power</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The Constitution <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R46179" target="_blank">empowers</a> the president with several ways to forgive crimes against the United States. The president can fully pardon, or lift, punishments without qualification for individuals or groups of people; commute, or reduce, an offender’s sentence; or issue a reprieve, basically delaying an offender’s sentence.</p>
<p>Clemency applications are processed through the Justice Department’s Office of the Pardon Attorney.</p>
<p>Biden <a href="https://www.justice.gov/pardon/presidential-proclamation-marijuana-possession#:~:text=On%20October%206%2C%202022%2C%20President%20Biden%20announced%20a%20full%2C,people%20with%20those%20prior%20offenses." target="_blank">issued</a> sweeping pardons in October 2022 and December 2023 for marijuana offenses.</p>

<p>The first-ever criminal trial of a former U.S. president wrapped up in Manhattan, marking an extraordinary moment in American history not only for a former leader, but for one who is seeking to again hold the Oval Office. Trump, the Republican Party’s presumed 2024 presidential nominee, is now a convicted felon.</p>
<p>The jury deliberated for more than 11 hours, beginning Wednesday just before 11:30 a.m. Eastern and delivering the verdict to Justice Juan Merchan just after 5 p.m. Thursday, according to reporters at the courthouse.</p>
<p>New York does not allow recording in the courtroom but provides public <a href="https://ww2.nycourts.gov/press/index.shtml" target="_blank">transcripts</a> of the proceedings. States Newsroom <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/prosecution-rests-trump-hush-money-trial-after-former-fixer-cohen-grilled" target="_blank">covered the trial</a> in person on May 20.</p>
<p>Trump now faces <a href="http://public.leginfo.state.ny.us/lawssrch.cgi?NVLWO:" target="_blank">penalties</a> ranging from probation to up to four years in prison for each <a href="http://public.leginfo.state.ny.us/lawssrch.cgi?NVLWO:" target="_blank">charge</a> of falsifying business records in the first degree.</p>
<p>Merchan set a sentencing date for July 11 at 10 a.m. That’s just days before the Republican National Convention, where Trump is expected to be officially nominated as the party’s presidential candidate.</p>
<p>New York state prosecutors charged 34 felonies against the former president for each of the 11 invoices, 11 checks, and 12 ledger entries tied to reimbursing his former personal lawyer Michael Cohen.</p>
<p>Cohen, often referred to as Trump’s former “fixer,” <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/star-witness-trump-trial-tells-plot-conceal-porn-star-hush-money-payments" target="_blank">said during trial testimony</a> that he wired $130,000 to adult film star and director Stormy Daniels days before the 2016 election to silence her about an <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/porn-star-stormy-daniels-nyc-hush-money-trial-alleges-sexual-encounter-trump" target="_blank">alleged sexual encounter</a> with Trump.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-declines-witness-stand-testimony-his-first-trial-concludes" target="_blank">Three criminal cases</a>, two federal and one in Georgia, also still hang in the balance for Trump, but the likelihood of another trial happening before November’s election is slim.</p>
	<div class="newsroomSidebarContainer ">
	<div class="newsroomSidebar">After former President Donald Trump was found guilty of 34 felony criminal counts Thursday afternoon, Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin weighed in on the verdict on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter.</p>
<div>&#8220;The American people see this for what it is: a politically motivated prosecution orchestrated by those who want to &#8216;get&#8217; President Trump,&#8221; Youngkin <a href="https://x.com/GlennYoungkin/status/1796306200683741636" target="_blank">wrote</a>. &#8220;On November 5th, Americans will render their verdict on Joe Biden’s failed leadership based on the issues that affect them everyday.&#8221;</div>
<div></div>
<div>Virginia House Minority Leader Todd Gilbert, R-Shenandoah used the same platform to air his view of the verdict.</div>
<p>&#8220;As a prosecutor and criminal defense attorney for the past 27 years, I have never been so struck by this level of fundamental unfairness in a criminal proceeding,&#8221; Gilbert <a href="https://x.com/cToddGilbert/status/1796294093330317745" target="_blank">wrote</a>. &#8220;This was a rigged show trial, replete with legal errors, obvious biases and political agendas.&#8221;</p>
<p>House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, kept his remarks on Trump&#8217;s verdict brief, simply <a href="https://x.com/DonScott757/status/1796288052555383038" target="_blank">writing</a> &#8220;DAMN! All counts?!&#8221; on X.</p>
<div>Senate Finance and Appropriations Committee Chair Sen. Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, reacted to the news of Trump&#8217;s conviction with sharp words about the former president and his political prospects in Virginia ahead of the presidential election in November.</div>
<div></div>
<div>&#8220;I am hopeful that the newly convicted thug will still be legally allowed to waste his time campaigning in Virginia so he can continue costing Republicans multiple elections for running on his platform,&#8221; Lucas <a href="https://x.com/SenLouiseLucas/status/1796299812771450928" target="_blank">wrote</a> on X.</div>
	</div>
	</div>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Trump speaks after verdict</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Trump briefly spoke to news cameras outside the courtroom, criticizing the proceeding as a “rigged, disgraceful trial.”</p>
<p>“The real verdict is going to be Nov. 5 by the people, and they know what happened here and everybody knows what happened here,” Trump said in remarks <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?536021-101/president-trump-speaks-guilty-verdict-hush-money-trial&amp;live" target="_blank">live-streamed and cataloged</a> on C-SPAN.</p>
<p>As he has repeated almost daily for the cameras, Trump again called Merchan a “conflicted” judge and falsely claimed the case “was done by the Biden administration.”</p>
<p>The charges were <a href="https://manhattanda.org/district-attorney-bragg-announces-34-count-felony-indictment-of-former-president-donald-j-trump/#:~:text=Manhattan%20District%20Attorney%20Alvin%20L,and%20after%20the%202016%20election." target="_blank">brought</a> by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, whom Trump described during his post-verdict comments as “Soros-funded,” a common mantra from Trump’s party referring to Hungarian-American billionaire philanthropist George Soros.</p>
<p>During his roughly three-minute remarks, Trump also referred to immigration at the U.S. Southern border, a major campaign rallying cry for Republicans.</p>
<p>“We don’t have the same country anymore. We have a divided mess. We’re a nation in decline, serious decline. Millions and millions of people pouring into our country right now,” Trump said before exiting the hallway without answering shouted questions from reporters.</p>
<p>Despite being a convicted felon, Trump will still be able to vote in November in Palm Beach County, Florida, where he is registered, as long as he is not incarcerated.</p>
<p>That’s because Florida law only bars voting for convicts tried in a separate state if that state also restricts them; a 2021 New York law <a href="https://elections.ny.gov/voting-after-incarceration" target="_blank">restored</a> voting rights for convicted felons following a release from prison and regardless if they are on parole, according to <a href="https://www.politifact.com/article/2024/may/29/trump-verdict-countdown-what-happens-after/" target="_blank">reporting</a> by PolitiFact.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">House speaker sees ‘shameful day in American history’</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Republicans in Congress and other top GOP officials gathered with Trump at the courthouse for support <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/gop-politicians-rush-manhattan-line-behind-trump-hush-money-trial-continues" target="_blank">during the trial</a> and members of the GOP immediately decried the verdict.</p>
<p>U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican who was among those who made the trek, released a statement saying the verdict marked “a shameful day in American history.”</p>
<p>“Democrats cheered as they convicted the leader of the opposing party on ridiculous charges, predicated on the testimony of a disbarred, convicted felon,” Johnson wrote. “This was a purely political exercise, not a legal one.”</p>
<p>Johnson was referring to the testimony from Cohen, who served time in prison for campaign finance crimes related to hush money payments.</p>
<p>Sen. Joni Ernst, an Iowa Republican, blasted it as the result of an unfair political process.</p>
<p>“This was never about justice. It was always about politics,” she <a href="https://x.com/SenJoniErnst/status/1796297715791597620" target="_blank">wrote on X</a>. “ Americans see through Democrats’ weaponization of our justice system and this sham trial as a desperate attempt to persecute Trump and block his re-election.”</p>
<p>The Trump campaign almost immediately solicited donations following the verdict, posting a link on his Truth Social platform to his WinRed donation portal.</p>
<p>Trump’s son Eric Trump reacted on X with “May 30th, 2024 might be remembered as the day Donald J. Trump won the 2024 Presidential Election.”</p>
<p>Video <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/05/30/nyregion/trump-trial-verdict?source=nyt_sports" target="_blank">posted</a> from reporters outside the courthouse showed a black SUV driving slowly outside the courthouse while members of the news media held cameras and some scattered in the crowd waved Trump flags and shouted “we love you.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘The jury has spoken’ </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>In a Thursday evening press conference, Bragg thanked the jurors and his team of prosecutors.</p>
<p>While affirming the case’s historical importance, Bragg said his office worked the case as they would any other, countering the GOP narrative that the case was politically motivated.</p>
<p>The case was decided on “the evidence and the law alone,” he said.</p>
<p>“Donald J. Trump is guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree to conceal a scheme to corrupt the 2016 election,” he said.</p>
<p>“While this defendant may be unlike any other in American history, we arrived at this trial – and ultimately today at this verdict – in the same manner as every other case that comes to the courtroom doors: By following the facts and the law, and doing so without fear or favor.”</p>
<p>Bragg praised “the 12 everyday New Yorkers,” who paid careful attention to a complicated documents-based case to reach a unanimous decision. The jurors’ service represented the “cornerstone” of the “phenomenal” U.S. system of justice, he said.</p>
<p>Asked if he wanted to respond to any of the personal attacks Trump launched against him and his prosecution team, Bragg declined.</p>
<p>Another reporter asked Bragg about criticism of his investigation of the case and his decision to bring a prosecution.</p>
<p>“I did my job. Our job is to follow the facts and the law without fear or favor. And that’s exactly what we did here,” he said.</p>
<p>“Many voices out there,” he added. “The only voice that matters is the voice of the jury. And the jury has spoken.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Trials in limbo in D.C., Georgia, Florida</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The verdict brought to a close the historic first criminal proceeding against a former sitting American president, albeit at the state level.</p>
<p>Trump is currently mired in a fight for absolute immunity from federal criminal charges <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/fueled-lies-trump-charged-seeking-overturn-2020-election-6" target="_blank">accusing</a> him of scheming to overturn the 2020 presidential election results.</p>
<p>A U.S. Supreme Court decision on his immunity claim is pending. Justices <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-supreme-court-floats-return-trial-court-trump-presidential-immunity-case" target="_blank">heard arguments</a> in the case on April 25.</p>
<p>Meanwhile in Florida, federal District Judge Aileen Cannon has indefinitely postponed the U.S. case against Trump for mishandling and refusing to return classified documents that he hid at his Mar-a-Lago estate after he left office.</p>
<p>Trump faces another state case in Georgia, along with several co-conspirators, on racketeering and conspiracy charges related to the state’s 2020 presidential election results. The case has been held up due to <a href="https://georgiarecorder.com/2024/05/09/future-of-fulton-case-against-trump-muddled-as-appeals-court-considers-attempt-to-disqualify-willis/" target="_blank">pretrial disputes</a> over alleged misconduct by Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Biden campaign reacts</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>A spokesman for President Joe Biden’s campaign, Michael Tyler, said in a statement that the verdict showed “no one is above the law” and that Trump remained a threat to democracy whom voters should reject.</p>
<p>“Donald Trump has always mistakenly believed he would never face consequences for breaking the law for his own personal gain,” Tyler wrote. “But today’s verdict does not change the fact that the American people face a simple reality. There is still only one way to keep Donald Trump out of the Oval Office: at the ballot box. Convicted felon or not, Trump will be the Republican nominee for president.”</p>
<p>“The threat Trump poses to our democracy has never been greater,” Tyler continued. “He is running an increasingly unhinged campaign of revenge and retribution, pledging to be a dictator ‘on day one’ and calling for our Constitution to be ‘terminated’ so he can regain and keep power. A second Trump term means chaos, ripping away Americans’ freedoms and fomenting political violence – and the American people will reject it this November.”</p>
<p>The Biden White House had much less to say.</p>
<p>Ian Sams, a spokesperson for the White House Counsel’s Office, said in a one-sentence email: “We respect the rule of law, and have no additional comment.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Members of Congress speak out</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, a Louisiana Republican, said in a statement the guilty decision from the jurors represented “a devastating defeat for any American who believes in the critical legal tenet that justice is blind.”</p>
<p>“This verdict will not withstand an appeal, and was only brought as an attempt to interfere with the 2024 election,” Scalise wrote. “The radical partisan Democrats behind this abuse of our justice system will not prevail. The voters will settle this on November 5th.”</p>
<p>Rhode Island Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, chair of the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee’s federal courts subcommittee, released a statement saying that an “individual who has been convicted of 34 felony counts and shows zero respect for the rule of law is not fit to lead the greatest nation in the world.”</p>
<p>“It’s only in honest courtrooms that the former president has been unable to lie and bully his way out of trouble,” Whitehouse said. “Americans trust juries for good reason.”</p>
<p>North Carolina Republican Sen. Thom Tillis posted on social media that he was “shocked by the verdict considering that this case should have never been brought forward.”</p>
<p>“From the beginning, it was clear that a radical, politically-motivated state prosecutor was using the full weight of his office to go after President Trump at the same time he turned a blind eye to violent criminals,” Tillis wrote. “I expect and hope that President Trump will appeal this verdict to address fundamental questions, including whether President Trump received a fair trial and whether the Manhattan D.A. even had jurisdiction on a federal election matter.”</p>
<p>Minnesota Democratic Rep. Betty McCollum said the jury’s decision showed that America’s justice system functioned the way it was supposed to.</p>
<p>“Today our system of justice worked, and former President Trump was found guilty on all 34 counts by a jury of American citizens,” McCollum wrote on social media. “No person is above the law.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">A ‘sham’ or an ‘affirmation’? </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Iowa Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds wrote in a statement the trial was a “sham.”</p>
<p>“For years, Democrats like Alvin Bragg have been trying to put President Trump in jail with complete disregard for our democracy and the will of the American people,” Reynolds wrote. “The only verdict that matters is the one at the ballot box in November where the American people will elect President Trump again.”</p>
<p>Florida Democratic Rep. Jared Moskowitz wrote on social media that the jury’s guilty verdict wasn’t political.</p>
<p>“A former president being convicted is nothing to be celebrated, but it is an affirmation that nobody is above the law,” Moskowitz wrote. “This verdict was reached by a jury of Trump’s peers, by citizens of the American justice system, not by a judge or by a political opponent.”</p>
<p>Ohio Republican Rep. Jim Jordan, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, rejected the verdict, writing on social media it was a “travesty of justice.”</p>
<p>“The Manhattan kangaroo court shows what happens when our justice system is weaponized by partisan prosecutors in front of a biased judge with an unfair process, designed to keep President Trump off the campaign trail and avoid bringing attention to President Biden’s failing radical policies,” Jordan wrote.</p>
<p>Virginia Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine posted on social media the “verdict is proof that no one is above the law in this country.”</p>
<p>“It’s also tragic in this way — Americans put the reins of leadership in the hands of a person whose character is so far beneath the office that no rational adult would ever encourage young people to emulate … his behavior,” Kaine wrote.</p>
<p>“Trump’s lack of character has caught up to him,” Kaine added. “And Americans — once again — have received a clear warning about a person who wants to seize leadership once again. I pray that we heed the warning.”</p>
<p>House Committee on Oversight and Accountability Chairman James Comer, a Kentucky Republican, said Thursday was a “sad day for all Americans.”</p>
<p>“This verdict in New York is another example of Democrats being relentless in their pursuit to weaponize the courts, abuse America’s judicial system, and target President Joe Biden’s political opposition,” Comer wrote. “One thing is clear: Democrats are afraid to face Donald Trump. Americans will make their voices heard this November.”</p>
<p>Former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, the Republican nominee for the state’s open U.S. Senate seat, urged restraint in a social media post.</p>
<p>“Regardless of the result, I urge all Americans to respect the verdict and the legal process,” Hogan wrote. “At this dangerously divided moment in our history, all leaders — regardless of party — must not pour fuel on the fire with more toxic partisanship. We must reaffirm what has made this nation great: the rule of law.”</p>

Patty Murray in November to inform her that he couldn’t transfer his GI bill benefits to his children, he wasn’t expecting congressional action to solve the problem.</p>
<p>He simply just wanted to let the Washington state Democrat know, he told States Newsroom in an exclusive interview.</p>
<p>With a child about to head to college, Pat, who didn’t want his last name used, had recently been told by the Army that he couldn’t transfer his education benefits to them because he received the Purple Heart after he was medically discharged. This rule does not apply to those who receive the medal while still in service.</p>
<p>Murray and Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican, introduced a bipartisan bill Thursday aimed at closing that loophole.</p>
<p>The legislation, titled the <a href="https://www.murray.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Purple-Heart-final-text.pdf" target="_blank">Purple Heart Veterans Education Act</a>, would permit retroactive award recipients who served on or after Sept. 11, 2001 to transfer their education benefits to one or more dependents. It was unveiled just ahead of Memorial Day, when the nation honors its deceased service members.</p>
<p>“As the daughter of a Purple Heart recipient, I’ve seen firsthand the enormous sacrifices Purple Heart veterans make to defend our freedoms, and I feel strongly that we should be doing absolutely everything we can to help all veterans and their families thrive,” Murray said in a statement Thursday.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t make any sense that service members who are awarded a Purple Heart after their service can’t transfer their GI benefits to their dependents, while those who receive it during their service can—and I am grateful to Pat, my constituent in Washington state who brought this gap in the law to my attention,” continued Murray, a senior member of the Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs.</p>
<p>“Our legislation will close this loophole and allow more children of Purple Heart veterans to further their education. I want to thank Senator Tillis for joining me on this legislation and I’ll be working hard to get it passed into law.”</p>
	<div class="newsroomSidebarContainer ">
	<div class="newsroomSidebar">Virginia recognizes Purple Heart recipients and their service in a variety of ways and has historic connections to the award. The oldest military honor in the United States, the Purple Heart dates back to 1782 when it was established by then-General George Washington — a native of Westmoreland County, Virginia — to commemorate the bravery of select Continental Army soldiers during the American Revolution.</p>
<div></div>
<div>&#8220;Sergeant William Brown was awarded the decoration for his gallantry while assaulting British positions at Yorktown in October 1781,&#8221; according to the <a href="https://armyhistory.org/the-purple-heart-the-story-of-americas-oldest-military-decoration-and-some-soldier-recipients/" target="_blank">Army Historical Foundation</a>.</div>
<div>
<div></div>
<div>The Military Order of the Purple Heart, &#8220;the only veterans service organization comprised strictly of &#8216;combat&#8217; veterans,&#8221; is headquartered in Springfield, Virginia. The organization created the <a href="https://www.purpleheart.org/PurpleHeartTrail" target="_blank">Purple Heart Trails</a> program; the trail&#8217;s origin point is in Virginia at Mt. Vernon, where Washington is buried, and extends the length of Interstate 95 through the state.</div>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>
<div>Gov. Glenn Youngkin decreed August 7, 2023 as Purple Heart Day in Virginia and the state offers special license plates commemorating the prestigious award.</div>
</div>
</div>
	</div>
	
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Glitch in education benefits</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Pat was medically discharged from the U.S. Army and retroactively received a Purple Heart for his actions during Iran’s retaliatory missile barrage in January 2020 on an Iraq airbase, after a U.S. drone strike killed Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani.</p>
<p>The Army later approved 39 Purple Hearts for service members who experienced the attack, <a href="https://www.armytimes.com/news/your-army/2021/12/08/army-approves-31-purple-hearts-for-2020-iran-missile-attack/" target="_blank">according</a> to a December 2021 report by the Army Times.</p>
<p>As his teenager looks to enroll at Central Washington University next year, Pat found out that by law his education benefits would only be available for transfer if he had received the award while still in service.</p>
<p>“My thought was, ‘I doubt that legislators would have done that intentionally.’ I just thought, you know, people probably just didn’t think about how that happens — that some people are going to get retroactive Purple Hearts, or for whatever reason in evaluating them, they’re delayed. So it’s not like an unusual thing,” Pat said in a phone interview.</p>
<p>“I wasn’t thinking much was going to happen, but I just wanted to write Senator Murray, who is my local senator, and let her know the issue. They responded by saying, ‘That’s an oversight on our part, and we want to make good on that.’”</p>
<p>Pat said he’s “grateful for Sen. Murray” and hopes his action is able to help other Purple Heart veterans. For now, his family is moving forward with the college enrollment process for his child, he said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Benefits and dependents</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Among the provisions in the legislation, Murray and Tillis’ bill would also allow veterans to split up 36 months worth of benefits to each of their dependents. For example, they could transfer 20 months to one and 16 months to another.</p>
<p>The bill, if enacted, would also prohibit the benefits from being treated as marital property or a marital estate asset.</p>
<p>And, the bill would permit dependents to access unused benefits if their veteran family member has died.</p>
<p>“Purple Heart recipients are heroes who honorably served our country at great costs, and this oversight that prevents servicemembers who received this distinguished award after their service from transferring their GI bill benefits to their dependents needs to be corrected immediately,” Tillis said in a statement Thursday.</p>
<p>“I am proud to co-introduce this commonsense legislation with Senator Murray to close this loophole and ensure every Purple Heart recipient and dependents are able to further their education,” continued Tillis, who also sits on the Senate’s Veterans’ Affairs Committee.</p>
<p>The number of veterans who retroactively received the Purple Heart after their post-9/11 service is unclear. The bill is estimated to cost $500,000 in mandatory spending over 10 years, according to an informal analysis provided to Murray’s office by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.</p>
<p>The bill has received praise from veterans groups, including the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, not every veteran’s service and sacrifice on behalf of the United States of America is fully recognized while they’re still in uniform,” IAVA CEO and Iraq War veteran Allison Jaslow said in a statement Thursday.</p>
<p>“The Purple Heart Veterans Education Act ensures that those veterans who’ve endured bodily harm on behalf of our nation, but weren’t recognized for it until their service concluded, are able to turn that recognition into an investment in the education of their loved ones.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">More Purple Heart recipients</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The wars in Afghanistan and Iraq have “greatly increased” the number of Purple Heart recipients as the Department of Defense has added some traumatic brain injuries as a recognized condition for the award, <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R42704" target="_blank">according</a> to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until a <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/3218?r=1&amp;q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22hr+3218%22%5D%7D" target="_blank">2017 law</a> that Purple Heart recipients were able to receive full post-9/11 GI Bill benefits regardless of their length of service. Previously, the recipients had to have 36 months of active service.</p>
<p>The Department of Defense does not maintain a record of the number of recipients, according to the CRS, but by law they do maintain a publicly accessible list with the permission of the veteran or next of kin.</p>
<p>Military historians and the National Purple Heart Hall of Honor <a href="https://www.thepurpleheart.com/questions/" target="_blank">estimate</a> about 1.8 million Purple Hearts have been awarded since 1932. The Army Historical Foundation <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/26365598" target="_blank">estimated</a> as of 2016 that 30,000 Purple Hearts had been awarded since 2001. The CRS <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R42704" target="_blank">cited</a> this statistic.</p>

(Douglas Sacha/Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON — The race to harness the tax code is in full swing as economists and advocates across the political spectrum view the expiring Trump-era tax law as an opportunity to advance their economic priorities.</p>
<p>Democratic Rep. Suzan DelBene of Washington said Wednesday that reworking the tax code will be “a reflection of what your values are.”</p>
<p>DelBene, who sits on the U.S. House Committee on Ways and Means Subcommittee on Tax Policy, said her priorities include modernizing the tax code, raising revenue via carbon fees on imported goods, and making permanent an expanded child tax credit akin to the temporary changes in place during the pandemic.</p>
<p>“The top line is starting from what our values and goals are, and then looking at what the policies are that help us get there,” DelBene said at a Politico-sponsored discussion on proposed tax law changes.</p>
<p>The early morning event at Washington’s Union Station brought together tax experts and advocates from Georgetown University Law Center, the Urban Institute, the Heritage Foundation and Groundwork Collaborative.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Tax overhaul</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The massive tax overhaul ushered in under the Trump administration permanently cut the corporate tax rate to 21% from 35%. The <a href="https://www.congress.gov/115/bills/hr1/BILLS-115hr1enr.pdf" target="_blank">2017 law</a>, championed by Republicans as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, also put in place several temporary measures for corporations and small businesses. Some are phasing out or already expired, including immediate deductions for certain investments.</p>
<p>Temporary changes for households included marginal tax rate cuts across the board, a doubling of the child tax credit, and a near doubling of the standard deduction — all of which are set to expire Dec. 31, 2025.</p>
<p>A bipartisan bill to temporarily <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/business-owners-union-leader-urge-us-senate-move-ahead-soon-stalled-tax-package" target="_blank">extend the expiring business incentives</a> and <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/congress-looking-expanding-child-tax-credit-again-who-would-benefit" target="_blank">expand the child tax credit</a> beyond 2025 sailed through the U.S. House in late January, but has been stalled by U.S. Senate Republicans who <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/expanded-child-tax-credit-stranded-us-senate-gop-comparisons-welfare" target="_blank">oppose</a> some of the child tax credit expansion proposals.</p>
<p>A May 2024 nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/60271" target="_blank">report</a> estimated extending the tax cuts would cost roughly $4.6 trillion over 10 years. The bulk of the cost would stem from keeping in place individual tax cuts, according to an <a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/blog/the-new-cost-for-2025-tax-cut-extensions-5-trillion/" target="_blank">analysis</a> of the report by the Bipartisan Policy Center.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-tax/congress-should-revisit-2017-tax-laws-trillion-dollar-corporate-rate-cut-in" target="_blank">Critics</a> of the 2017 law point to a recent March <a href="https://patrick-kennedy.github.io/files/TCJA_KDLM_2024.pdf" target="_blank">analysis</a> from academics and members of the Joint Committee on Taxation and the Federal Reserve that shows that the law’s benefits flowed to the highest earners.</p>
<p>DelBene said revisiting the corporate tax rate, <a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/05/09/2024/corporate-tax-rate-hike-jason-smith" target="_blank">even on the Republican side</a>, is “on the table” and lawmakers will be talking about “where the TCJA wasn’t about investing and making sure that we were being fiscally responsible.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘Incredibly bullish’</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Lindsay Owens, executive director of the Groundwork Collaborative, said Wednesday she’s “incredibly bullish” on elected officials making “fundamental changes” to the tax code next year.</p>
<p>The progressive think tank sent a letter Wednesday to House and Senate leadership and top tax writers urging them “to use the expiration of these provisions as an opportunity to address long-standing problems with our tax code, not just to tinker around the edges.”</p>
<p>The letter was signed by 100 organizations from across the U.S., ranging from the AFL-CIO and the United Auto Workers to the National Women’s Law Center and United Church of Christ.</p>
<p>Stephen Moore, who helped write the Trump-era tax law and is now the conservative Heritage Foundation’s senior visiting fellow in economics, said the 2017 law was a “huge success” and that “we’re gonna definitely make those tax cuts permanent.”</p>
<p>Moore is an economic adviser for former President Donald Trump’s reelection effort, but said he was not speaking on behalf of the presidential campaign.</p>
<p>He said he does not agree with Trump on everything, including a promise to enact 10% tariffs on imported goods, reaching as high as 60% on Chinese imports.</p>
<p>“A tariff is just a consumption tax,” he said. “And so you know, I think that it is not a great policy, in my opinion. But if you’re gonna have a tariff, I would rather have a tariff that is uniform than trying to have, like, a protectionist tariff to, you know, protect this industry or that industry.”</p>
<p>When pressed on data that shows funding the Internal Revenue Service increases revenue, Moore said that President Joe Biden’s increase in funding for the agency is “diabolical.”</p>

(Carol Highsmith/Library of Congress)</p><p>WASHINGTON — After hours of uncertainty Thursday, the U.S. Senate struck a deal to reauthorize several Federal Aviation Authority programs for the next five years, though Maryland and Virginia senators were vehemently opposed and lawmakers hoping to attach unrelated provisions lost out.</p>
<p>The bill heads to the House next week for final approval. Lawmakers from the lower chamber left Wednesday after approving a one-week extension for the FAA programs that expire Friday night. The Senate also passed the extension.</p>
<p>The late night vote, <a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_votes/vote1182/vote_118_2_00162.htm" target="_blank">88-4</a>, drew resistance from the Democratic senators representing Maryland and Virginia. They held up speedier passage of the bill over objections to a provision that would allow more flights in and out of Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, just over the Virginia border from Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>In a joint statement after the vote, Sens. Tim Kaine and Mark Warner of Virginia said the Senate “abdicated its responsibility to protect the safety of the 25 million people” who annually fly through Reagan airport, known as DCA.</p>
<p>The airport, a favorite for lawmakers as it’s closest to the Capitol, is <a href="https://www.flyreagan.com/about-airport/aircraft-noise-information/dca-reagan-national-slot-perimeter-rules" target="_blank">limited</a> by federal regulation on the number of “slots,” or flights that can take off and land per day.</p>
<p>“Just weeks after two aircraft nearly crashed into one another at DCA, this body refused to take up our commonsense amendment to remove a dangerous provision that would have crammed more flights onto the busiest runway in America,” the statement from Kaine and Warner continued, referring to an April 18 near-miss when two planes cleared to take off <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/transportation/2024/04/19/faa-investigating-near-miss-reagan-national/" target="_blank">came within 400 feet of crashing</a>.</p>
<p>The Virginia senators, as well as Sens. Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, held out for hours Thursday as they negotiated a vote for an amendment to strike or tighten a provision that would increase slots at DCA to five more landings and five more take-offs.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘Over 200 member priorities’</h4>

	
<p>Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., agreed to bring what the senators described as a “compromise” amendment to the floor Thursday evening. The amendment proposed giving the final say on slots to the Transportation secretary after considering delays and safety.</p>
<p>But GOP Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, one of the bill’s managers, objected, saying that the bill already “contains over 200 member priorities.”</p>
<p>Cruz, ranking member of the Senate Committee on Commerce, managed the bill with the committee’s chair, Democrat Maria Cantwell of Washington.</p>
<p>Cruz is a proponent of increasing slots at DCA, particularly for a direct flight from San Antonio.</p>
<p>Others support the increase as well: Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock of Georgia had originally proposed adding 28 new slots per day. That idea was scrapped and replaced with Cruz’s amendment to allow five new daily flights in and out.</p>
<p>On the <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?535506-1/senate-session" target="_blank">floor</a> Thursday evening, Cruz pushed back on the safety argument, saying that “the FAA experts have recently clarified that this near miss (on April 18) had absolutely nothing to do with traffic on the runway.” He also blamed opposition on a lobbying effort from United Airlines, which operates a massive hub at Dulles International Airport in Virginia and wants to thwart competition.</p>
<p>Cruz said the final bill addresses safety issues by “ensuring we have sufficient air traffic controllers to monitor the traffic and protect safety.”</p>
<p>Late Thursday night after the bill’s passage, Cantwell took the floor to praise provisions that she said expand the aviation workforce, enhance pilot training and protect consumers.</p>
<p>Among its many provisions, the roughly <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/3935/text?s=2&amp;r=1&amp;q=%7B%22search%22%3A%22HR3935%22%7D" target="_blank">1,000-page legislation</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Directs the FAA to increase air traffic controller hiring targets;</li>
<li>Raises the commercial pilot retirement age to 67 from 65;</li>
<li>Prohibits mask-wearing and COVID-19 vaccine policies for passengers or employees;</li>
<li>Directs the FAA to update drone testing and operating rules;</li>
<li>Requires the Department of Transportation to create a seating policy to allow children to sit next to parents or guardians at no extra charge; and</li>
<li>Requires airlines to automatically refund customers after three hours of delay for domestic flights and after six hours for international flights.</li>
</ul>
<p>“These statutory rights are a big win for consumers,” Cantwell said.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Last flight out of the airport</h4>

	
<p>Many lawmakers view the FAA reauthorization bill as the last major vehicle to which they can attach their priorities before November elections and the close of the 118th Congress.</p>
<p>That opportunity disappeared Thursday when the legislation’s managers decided against allowing non-germane amendments to ride on the bill.</p>
<p>Among the proposals lawmakers were eyeing as additions was Oregon Democrat Ron Wyden’s bipartisan tax bill that would expand the child tax credit and revive corporate tax breaks. Another included Sen. Josh Hawley’s Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, or RECA, which would reauthorize a fund for victims of U.S. radiation testing exposure. The fund expires June 7.</p>
<p>Hawley said Thursday afternoon that he wouldn’t object to the FAA bill, even if RECA wasn’t added on.</p>
<p>“I have no desire to tank the FAA reauthorization,” Hawley, a Missouri Republican, told reporters outside the Senate chamber. “I think we should have a reasonable process around it. But, if we’re not going to, we’re not going to.”</p>
<p>“At least we got automatic refunds for consumers out of this deal, which was good,” Hawley added, referring to his <a href="https://www.hawley.senate.gov/sites/default/files/2024-05/Hawley-FAA-Reauthorization-Act-2024-Amendment-Text_0.pdf" target="_blank">amendment</a> with Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts that senators agreed to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/us-lawmakers-seek-strengthen-bill-ensure-quick-airline-refunds-2024-05-07/" target="_blank">Tuesday</a>.</p>

United States was argued inside. (Photo by Jane Norman/States Newsroom)</p><p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. Supreme Court appeared skeptical Thursday of former President Donald Trump’s argument he is immune from criminal charges that he tried to overturn his loss in the 2020 election.</p>
<p>But conservatives who dominate the court appeared open to returning key questions to a trial court, possibly delaying Trump’s prosecution beyond the November election — and essentially assisting the former president as he fights legal challenges on multiple fronts.</p>
<p>Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for president, has argued in a federal trial court and in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia that his actions following the 2020 election and leading up to the violent Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol, were “official acts” conducted while still in office and therefore are not subject to criminal prosecution.</p>
<p>While court precedent establishes that U.S. presidents are immune to civil damages for their official acts, and to criminal prosecution while in office, the justices now must decide the unanswered question of whether former presidents are absolutely immune from criminal law.</p>
<p>At oral arguments Thursday in Trump v. United States, much of the discussion centered on what should be considered an official presidential act.</p>
<p>Several conservative justices suggested that lower courts work to determine what aspects of the charges against Trump arose solely from his private conduct.</p>
<p>Such a detour could eat up additional weeks or months as the trial calendar converges with Election Day.</p>
<p>A decision from the court may not arrive until late June or early July. If a ruling calls for additional fact-finding at the trial court level, Trump’s election interference trial likely would not happen prior to the November election.</p>
<p>Trump’s lawyer, D. John Sauer, of St. Louis, argued that nearly everything a president does in office — including hypotheticals about ordering a military coup or assassinating a political rival — could be considered official acts.</p>
<p>While much of the court appeared skeptical of that broad view of official acts, several justices on the conservative wing asked about having the trial court determine what acts should be considered official. They also suggested prosecutors could drop sections of the four-count indictment against Trump that dealt with official acts.</p>
<p>The court’s three liberal justices voiced serious concerns about Trump’s immunity argument, with Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson wondering aloud if the court accepting a broad view of criminal immunity for the president would make the Oval Office “the seat of criminal activity.”</p>
<p>The case is one of four in state and federal courts in which criminal charges have been made against Trump. On Thursday, he was in a New York state courtroom where he <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/ny-prosecutor-ties-trump-hush-money-payments-campaign-criminal-trial-kicks" target="_blank">faces charges</a> in an ongoing hush-money trial; the judge there did not allow him to attend the Supreme Court arguments.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Trial court determination</h4>

	
<p>Conservative justices asked if they could avoid the constitutional question by having the trial court, presided over by U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan, determine which parts of the allegations could be considered official or unofficial acts.</p>
<p>Special counsel Jack Smith and his team of prosecutors have indicated that prosecuting only Trump’s private conduct would be sufficient, Justice Amy Coney Barrett said.</p>
<p>“The normal process, what Mr. Sauer asked, would be for us to remand if we decided that there were some official acts immunity, and to let that be sorted out below,” Barrett said, referring to a process in which a case is sent back to a lower court. “It is another option for the special counsel to just proceed based on the private conduct and drop the official conduct.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘Absolute immunity’</h4>

	
<p>Sauer argued, as <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-gop-led-states-argue-presidential-immunity-claim-supreme-court" target="_blank">he has</a> <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-makes-one-last-presidential-immunity-argument-us-supreme-court" target="_blank">for months</a>, for “absolute immunity” from criminal prosecution for presidents acting in their official capacity.</p>
<p>No president who has not been impeached and removed from office can be prosecuted for official actions, Sauer said, broadly interpreting the meaning of official acts.</p>
<p>Liberal justices questioned Sauer about how far his definition of official acts would stretch. Trump’s attorney was reluctant to list any exceptions.</p>
<p>Justice Sonia Sotomayor asked a hypothetical that <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/three-judge-federal-panel-grills-trump-lawyer-claim-presidential-immunity" target="_blank">arose</a> in a lower court: Would it be an official act for the president to order the assassination of a political rival?</p>
<p>“That could well be an official act,” Sauer answered.</p>
<p>He also answered Justice Elena Kagan that it could be an official act for a president to order a military coup, though Sauer said “it would depend on the circumstances.”</p>
<p>Michael R. Dreeben, representing the U.S. Department of Justice, argued that Trump’s broad view of presidential immunity would break a fundamental element of U.S. democracy, that no one is above the law.</p>
<p>“His novel theory would immunize former presidents for criminal liability for bribery, treason, sedition, murder, and here, conspiring to use fraud to overturn the results of an election and perpetuate himself in power,” Dreeben said.</p>
<p>Jackson, questioning Sauer, appeared to agree with that argument.</p>
<p>She said Sauer appeared worried that the president would be “chilled” by potential criminal prosecution, but she said there would be “a really significant opposite problem if the president wasn’t chilled.”</p>
<p>“Once we say, ‘No criminal liability, Mr. President, you can do whatever you want,’ I’m worried that we would have a worse problem than the problem of the president feeling constrained to follow the law while he’s in office,” Jackson said.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘A special, peculiarly precarious position’</h4>

	
<p>But other members of the court appeared more amenable to Sauer’s argument that subjecting presidents to criminal prosecution would constrain them.</p>
<p>Justice Samuel Alito, one of the court’s conservatives, asked Dreeben about Trump’s argument that a president’s duties require a broad view of immunity.</p>
<p>The president has to make difficult decisions, sometimes in areas of law that are unsettled, Alito said.</p>
<p>“I understand you to say, ‘If he makes a mistake, he makes a mistake, he’s subject to the criminal laws just like anybody else,’” Alito said. “You don’t think he’s in a special, peculiarly precarious position?”</p>
<p>Dreeben answered that the president has access to highly qualified legal advice and that making a mistake is not what generally leads to criminal prosecution.</p>
<p>He also noted that the allegations against Trump involve him going beyond his powers as president to interfere with the certification of an election, which is not a presidential power in the Constitution.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Incumbents leaving office</h4>

	
<p>Alito, who seemed to be the justice most sympathetic to Trump’s argument that allowing a president to be prosecuted would undermine the powers of the office, also raised the prospect that incumbents who lose elections may seek to illegally stay in power precisely because prosecution would await after they leave office.</p>
<p>“A stable democratic society requires that a candidate who loses an election, even a close one, even a hotly contested one, leave office peacefully,” he said.</p>
<p>“If an incumbent who loses a very close, hotly contested election, knows that a real possibility after leaving office is … the president may be criminally prosecuted by a bitter political opponent, will that not lead us into a cycle that destabilizes the functioning of our country as a democracy?”</p>
<p>Dreeben answered that “it’s exactly the opposite,” because there are well-established lawful options, including court challenges, available to challenge election results.</p>
<p>Trump posted several times Thursday morning on his social media platform Truth Social that the president would “have no power at all” without absolute immunity.</p>
<p>“That would be the end of the Presidency, and our Country, as we know it, and is just one of the many Traps there would be for a President without Presidential Immunity. Obama, Bush, and soon, Crooked Joe Biden, would all be in BIG TROUBLE,” he wrote.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘Writing a rule for the ages’</h4>

	
<p>Some justices indicated they will be thinking beyond the question as it relates to Trump’s election interference charges, possibly hinting at a drawn-out process in issuing an opinion.</p>
<p>Criminally prosecuting a former president could open the door to prosecution based on motives, including the motive to get reelected or for other personal gain, conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch suggested.</p>
<p>“I’m not concerned about this case, but I am concerned about future uses of the criminal law to target political opponents based on accusations about their motives,” Gorsuch said in a lengthy back-and-forth with Dreeben.</p>
<p>“I’m going to say something that I don’t normally say, which is: That’s really not involved in this case,” Dreeben said, eliciting a laugh from Gorsuch.</p>
<p>“I understand that. I appreciate that. But you also appreciate that we’re writing a rule for the ages,” Gorsuch responded.</p>
<p>At another point, Dreeben tried to redirect the justices to specific details of the Trump case, including his point that the judicial system has safeguards against purely politically motivated and retaliatory legal action.</p>
<p>Dreeben attempted to detail for Alito that the Justice Department functioned “in the way that it is supposed to” when Trump’s alleged plan to ask officials to send fraudulent letters to states regarding election results failed.</p>
<p>Alito pushed back, saying he wanted to discuss the case “in the abstract.”</p>
<p>“I understand that Mr. Dreeben. But as I said, this case will have effects that go far beyond this particular prosecution,” Alito said.</p>
<p>Alan Morrison, a law professor at George Washington University who has argued 20 cases before the Supreme Court, said in a phone interview after oral arguments that the court will not reach “a fast decision” as the justices wrestle with the extent of what is considered a president’s official acts.</p>
<p>“Neither side is going to get everything they want,” Morrison said. “And the hardest questions to answer are going to be what are official and what are not official acts.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘Reacting against a monarch’</h4>

	
<p>Sticking to the specifics of the indictment against Trump, Kagan ran through a list of the allegations and asked Sauer to discern what constituted an official act.</p>
<p>“The defendant asked the Arizona House Speaker to call the legislature into session to hold a hearing based on their claims of election fraud,” Kagan said, citing the indictment.</p>
<p>“Absolutely an official act for the president to communicate with state officials on a matter of enormous federal interest and concern,” Sauer answered, “attempting to defend the integrity of a federal election to communicate with state officials and urge them to view what he views as their job under state law and federal law.”</p>
<p>Kagan moved to hypotheticals and asked if a president who ordered a military coup, but was never impeached and convicted by Congress, could not be held to U.S. criminal law.</p>
<p>“He was the president. He is the commander in chief. He talks to his generals all the time, and he told the generals, ‘I don’t feel like leaving office. I want to stage a coup.’ Is that immune?”</p>
<p>“If it’s an official act, there needs to be impeachment and conviction beforehand,” Sauer said, citing the defense’s reliance on the Constitution’s Impeachment Clause argument.</p>
<p>“That is the wisdom of the (Constitution’s) framers,” he added.</p>
<p>“The framers did not put an immunity clause into the Constitution,” she quickly responded. “… They didn’t provide immunity to the president, and you know, not so surprising. They were reacting against a monarch who claimed to be above the law.”</p>
<p>“Wasn’t the whole point that the president was not a monarch and the president was not supposed to be above the law?” she said.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Federal election interference charges</h4>

	
<p>A federal grand jury <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/fueled-lies-trump-charged-seeking-overturn-2020-election-6" target="_blank">charged</a> Trump with four felony counts in August 2023 for working with several co-conspirators to overturn election results in seven states.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.258149/gov.uscourts.dcd.258149.1.0_2.pdf" target="_blank">indictment</a> charged the former president with conspiracy to defraud the United States and obstruction of an official proceeding, among other charges.</p>
<p>Trump allegedly worked with several others to replace legitimate electors with fraudulent ones in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, New Mexico, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, according to the indictment.</p>
<p>The prosecution also alleges that he tried to leverage the Justice Department to pressure the states to replace their slates of electors, and pressure Vice President Mike Pence into altering results during Congress’s joint session to certify the results on Jan. 6, 2021.</p>

(Phillip Rubino/Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON — Many U.S. taxpayers in a dozen states for the first time can electronically file their federal returns directly to the Internal Revenue Service for free — but critics insist the new federal benefit is not needed and will even harm both users and states.</p>
<p>More than 50,000 taxpayers in Arizona, California, Florida, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Hampshire, New York, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington and Wyoming have so far used the new online IRS Direct File program this tax season, according to the agency.</p>
<p>The free alternative to potentially costly private tax filing software rolled out in mid-March for the 2023 filing season. It is only available for those with W-2 income or simple credits and deductions, like the child tax credit or student loan interest.</p>
<p>The IRS estimates that 19 million taxpayers are eligible to use the new program in advance of the April 15 tax filing deadline.</p>
<p>But opponents argue the government Direct File program is a waste of resources and will snag business from professional tax preparers. They say it will confuse taxpayers who are accustomed to automatically filing their federal and state returns together through private software.</p>
<p>Some states also claim it will cost them revenue and increase what they have to spend on collections from taxpayers who owe money to their states.</p>
<p>The IRS program is purposefully small for now. The agency said in a launch-day release that it’s following “best practices for launching a new technology platform by starting small, making sure it works and then building from there.”</p>
<p>The pilot program “is almost tailor-made for students and young people with simple tax situations,” IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel <a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/commissioner-danny-werfel-1-year-anniversary-speech-the-future-irs-transforming-for-a-digital-world" target="_blank">said</a> in late March, encouraging people to visit the new <a href="http://directfile.irs.gov/" target="_blank">directfile.irs.gov</a>.</p>
<p>The White House is <a href="https://twitter.com/WhiteHouse/status/1772669844615213260?s=20" target="_blank">celebrating</a> the launch as a win for President Joe Biden, who in 2022 along with a Democratic-led Congress authorized its funding to jumpstart the program as part of the Inflation Reduction Act.</p>
<p>The progressive Economic Security Project <a href="https://economicsecurityproject.org/wp-content/uploads/Full-Report_-The-Impact-of-Direct-File-by-the-Numbers.pdf" target="_blank">estimates</a> that if the program scales up, it could eventually save the average taxpayer up to $160 annually in tax prep costs. Assuming broad public adoption, that could add up to Americans saving $11 billion a year in filing fees and time.</p>
<p>The organization also estimates low-income households could gain up to $12 billion in unclaimed federal tax credits, and that the IRS would see a return on investment of more than $100 per federal dollar spent on the program due to less paperwork and fewer errors.</p>
<p>Roxy Caines, director of the Get It Back campaign, said Direct File could increase tax participation, particularly for low-income households.</p>
<p>“Having an accessible way to file taxes is really important because of the high cost of tax preparation as well as the arduous process. It’s often viewed as intimidating,” said Caines, who runs the financial literacy and tax credit advocacy campaign by the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘Unnecessary and unconstitutional’</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>But not everyone is on board.</p>
<p>When Werfel appeared in February before the U.S. House Committee on Ways and Means, Republican Chair Jason Smith of Missouri <a href="https://waysandmeans.house.gov/event/hearing-with-commissioner-of-the-internal-revenue-service-daniel-werfel/" target="_blank">described</a> the program as a “scheme the American people didn’t ask for.”</p>
<p>In January, 13 Republican attorneys general sent a <a href="https://dojmt.gov/wp-content/uploads/IRS-Direct-File-Letter-Final.pdf" target="_blank">letter</a> to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen opposing “the unnecessary and unconstitutional efforts to empower the Internal Revenue Service with the expansive authority to prepare and file tax returns for all taxpayers.”</p>
<p>“American taxpayers do not want to invite the proverbial fox into the hen house,” wrote the officials, led by Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen.</p>
<p>Attorneys general from Georgia, Idaho, Iowa, Louisiana, Missouri, Nebraska, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia and West Virginia co-signed it.</p>
<p>The officials wrote that a program for taxpayers to directly file with the IRS at no cost “needlessly threatens” the livelihoods of tax preparers.</p>
<p>“Every year, tens of millions of taxpayers file their taxes for free with help from existing programs or online software. Additionally, millions of Americans work with small businesses in our states to file their taxes at an affordable cost, including both independent tax preparation services and local accountants. They choose to do so because they want an advocate in their corner who will represent their interests against the IRS bureaucracy,” they wrote.</p>
<p>The IRS did not respond to a request for comment about the criticism.</p>
<p>Pete Sepp, president of the National Taxpayers Union, a fiscally conservative organization that advocates for simplifying the tax code, told States Newsroom the project has been “dramatically oversold” and is being piloted in “some very easy places,” including states that don’t collect their own income tax.</p>
<p>Money for the IRS would be better spent on improving customer service, he argues.</p>
<p>“Every single penny they can scrounge up from other places needs to be poured into that effort, right? Now, in our opinion, designing a portal for direct file that is underpowered and is competing with other services is just not a priority,” he said, referring to the 22-year “Free File” arrangement the IRS has had with select private companies.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">So what about Free File?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Today, the vast majority of taxpayers file electronically, <a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-releases-fiscal-year-2022-data-book-describing-agencys-activities" target="_blank">according</a> to IRS data. Of the 160 million individual federal tax returns that the IRS processed in 2022, 150.6 million, or 94%, were e-filed. Of those, just under 3.3 million used what’s been criticized as an opaque and complicated electronic Free File program.</p>
<p>Free File dates back to the early 2000s, when the idea of e-filing was just budding, and the government had no such program in place.</p>
<p>President George W. Bush’s administration was exploring the possibility of a free direct file portal through the IRS website.</p>
<p>At the time the agency was struggling after failed modernization efforts, and a public-private partnership with the burgeoning tax preparation software companies became an appealing option.</p>
<p>“The tax companies just said, ‘Well, we got a deal for you,’” recalls Nina Olson, who served as the National Taxpayer Advocate for the IRS from 2001 to 2019.</p>
<p>“And at that time, I was very suspect of the deal. I said at the time that they’re going to find themselves in 20 years, that you know, tax companies would pull out and you would have a patchwork of services available to people,” Olson, who now runs the nonprofit Center for Taxpayer Rights, said in an interview with States Newsroom.</p>
<p>What began in 2002 was an agreement between the IRS and a group of  private tax prep software companies, under the name Free File Alliance, to offer free federal tax returns to those under a certain income threshold. In 2023, that annual earnings threshold was $79,000 or less.</p>
<p>Taxpayers who earn above that income threshold have the option to complete their federal returns for free, unguided, using fillable PDF tax forms.</p>
<p>The just over two-decade-old program has been scrutinized for not reaching the taxpayers who most need a free filing option and for not providing a better user experience.</p>
<p>A 2019 Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration <a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/6768599/TIGTA-Free-File-audit.pdf" target="_blank">report</a> described the program as “fraught with complexity and confusion.”</p>
<p>The inspector general found that in 2018 only 2.5 million of the 104 million taxpayers eligible for Free File actually used it.</p>
<p>About 34.5 million of those Free File-eligible taxpayers used one of the alliance companies’ commercial software options, and a likely 14 million of them paid to e-file their federal returns, the report found.</p>
<p>The low number of Free File users likely was because an estimated 9 million eligible taxpayers were unaware that they had to access the Free File software options via the IRS website.</p>
<p>Those who, for example, searched the web and found one of the IRS partner companies’ websites were “not guaranteed a free return filing,” and subsequently susceptible to advertising for potentially costly add-ons like “audit defense,” the report found.</p>
<p>Investigative reporting in 2019 by ProPublica <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/inside-turbotax-20-year-fight-to-stop-americans-from-filing-their-taxes-for-free" target="_blank">revealed</a> deliberate tactics to cloud the Free File program by Intuit, maker of TurboTax, one of the Free File Alliance’s largest partners.</p>
<p>Terms between the IRS and Free File Alliance initially included a commitment from the agency to not develop its own free online filing program. In exchange, the partner companies agreed to limit advertising and add-on solicitation on their free file web pages.</p>
<p>In 2019 the IRS <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/irs-reforms-free-file-program-drops-agreement-not-to-compete-with-turbotax" target="_blank">dropped</a> the prohibition on developing its own program. Limits on company marketing and solicitation for add-on products continued as part of the <a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-efile/ninth-memorandum-of-understanding-on-service-standards-and-disputes.pdf" target="_blank">agreement</a> — though Intuit would eventually have to pay for breaking its commitment.</p>
<p>H&amp;R Block and Intuit respectively left the Free File Alliance in 2020 and 2021. Together they served about 70% of eligible Free File taxpayers in 2019, according to a 2022 Government Accountability Office <a href="https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-22-105236#summary_recommend" target="_blank">report</a> that recommended the IRS develop additional options for taxpayers to file for free.</p>
<p>Acknowledging the opposing viewpoints on whether the IRS should create, or could handle, its own program, the report concluded the agency “should work to manage the risk of taxpayers having fewer options to electronically file their federal taxes for free.”</p>
<p>In 2022, Intuit <a href="https://www.agturbotaxsettlement.com/Portals/0/Document%20Files/Final%20AVC.pdf?ver=ktHm0t4iOO2k2RruoESSLA%3d%3d" target="_blank">settled</a> with attorneys general from across the U.S., agreeing to pay $141 million to Intuit TurboTax customers who ended up buying services that should have been free to them.</p>
<p>Today there are eight companies in the Free File Alliance, with differing income and tax situation criteria. All are <a href="https://apps.irs.gov/app/freeFile/browse-all-offers/" target="_blank">listed</a> on the IRS website.</p>
<p>Olson said she doesn’t view the IRS Direct File pilot as a competitor to the already existing Free File partnership. Rather, it’s “one more component of a robust tax online taxpayer account,” she said.</p>
<p>“This is what countries do around the world. We’re so far behind,” Olson said. “There’s a response to folks who say ‘The government doesn’t need to do this’ or ‘There’s no interest in this product.’ Regardless of whether there’s interest in the product, it’s a government obligation.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Congressional mandate</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Among the tens of billions of dollars Congress authorized for the IRS in the Inflation Reduction Act, $15 million was earmarked for exploring the possibility of an IRS-run direct federal tax filing system.</p>
<p>Specifically Congress mandated the agency to use the money to survey taxpayers’ wants and needs, obtain a third-party opinion, and report back to lawmakers on the costs to create and run such a program.</p>
<p>In its third-party <a href="https://d1y8sb8igg2f8e.cloudfront.net/documents/Independent-Third-Party-Report-to-Congress-508c.pdf" target="_blank">review</a>, the left-leaning think tank New America assessed that a successful IRS-run Direct File program “depends critically” on whether the agency prioritizes the project and begins with limited testing before building up.</p>
<p>The organization estimated that development, staffing, infrastructure and customer service for a scaled-up platform would cost the IRS annually anywhere from $22 million to $47 million if 1 million taxpayers use a Direct File program, and up to $126 million to $213 million in the event that 25 million taxpayers jump on board.</p>
<p>New America also recommended the IRS consider the importance of customer service, data privacy and taxpayers’ habits of filing federal and state returns all on one platform — one of the main concerns from critics.</p>
<p>Ayushi Roy, deputy director of New America’s New Practice Lab, which led the review, told States Newsroom she’s been talking to taxpayers using the Direct File pilot and “broadly speaking, we’re finding that filers are really landing on either ‘Wow,’ or ‘it didn’t include me for now.’”</p>
<p>The group will conduct its own analysis of the IRS trial run, particularly focusing on the experience for Spanish-speaking filers.</p>
<p>As for taxpayer interest, the IRS <a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p5788.pdf" target="_blank">found</a> that 72% of survey respondents said they were “very interested” or “somewhat interested” in a free IRS-provided tool to prepare and file federal taxes.</p>
<p>The survey conducted in 2022 by MITRE, a nonprofit that runs federally funded research and development centers, also found that a top reason cited by 46% of those interested is that they would rather give their financial data to the IRS than to a third party.</p>
<p>An October 2023 <a href="https://www.tigta.gov/sites/default/files/reports/2023-10/2024408002fr.pdf" target="_blank">report</a> from the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration took issue with the design of the survey, warning that the interest level may be “overstated” because the survey did not include a “neutral” option for respondents to choose.</p>
<p>However, the largely Democrat- and progressive-aligned international polling firm GQR <a href="https://betterirs.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/283/Better-IRS_Direct-File-State-Polling-Memos.pdf" target="_blank">found</a> in late January through early February that between 92% and 95% of taxpayers across political ideologies and income levels in Arizona, Florida, Georgia, New York and Texas support a free online IRS filing service.</p>
<p>Several state governments already offer free public electronic filing for state income tax returns, including <a href="https://www.revenue.alabama.gov/individual-corporate/individual-income-tax-electronic-filing-options/" target="_blank">Alabama</a>, <a href="https://www.ksrevenue.gov/iiwebfile.html" target="_blank">Kansas</a>, <a href="https://revenue.ky.gov/Individual/Pages/Free-Electronic-Filing.aspx" target="_blank">Kentucky</a> and <a href="https://www.revenue.pa.gov/OnlineServices/mypath/Individuals/Pages/PIT.aspx" target="_blank">Pennsylvania</a>, which offer the service regardless of income level. Some states, like <a href="https://www.ftb.ca.gov/file/ways-to-file/online/calfile/calfile-qualifications.html" target="_blank">California</a> and <a href="https://tax.iowa.gov/individual-income-tax-electronic-filing-options" target="_blank">Iowa</a>, have income thresholds for free filing.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">States bite back</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Despite the adoption of free public filing in some states, 21 state auditors, comptrollers and treasurers from 18 states sent a <a href="https://myfloridacfo.com/docs-sf/cfo-news-libraries/news-documents/2024/irs-direct-file-letter.pdf" target="_blank">letter</a> on March 25 to Yellen and Werfel expressing concern about the “serious harm” the IRS Direct File program will cause and urging them to “shut down” the service.</p>
<p>“Taxpayers are not the only parties who will suffer from Direct File. States will suffer too. States will lose out on payments from Direct File taxpayers who owe state taxes but incorrectly assume that Direct File covers federal and state filings.</p>
<p>“States will then have to increase resources dedicated to collection efforts,” wrote the officials from Alaska, Florida, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Nebraska, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Utah, West Virginia and Wyoming.</p>
<p>According to the Treasury Department, taxpayers using the IRS Direct File pilot in Arizona, California, Massachusetts or New York are <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/inflation-reduction-act/irs-direct-file-service" target="_blank">automatically directed</a> to their state-supported tax filing websites. Those in Washington are sent to that state’s page to claim the Working Families Tax Credit.</p>
<p>The IRS could not provide a more specific figure of how many taxpayers have so far used Direct File, and its latest estimate stands at 50,000. Advocates say they expect to learn updated numbers as soon as a week after federal taxes are due on April 15.</p>

On Thursday evening, President Donald Trump signed an executive order that bans any transactions between the parent company of TikTok, ByteDance, and U.S. citizens due to national security reasons. The president signed a separate executive order banning transactions with China-based tech company Tencent, which owns the app WeChat. Both orders are set to take effect in 45 days. (Photo Illustration by Drew Angerer/Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. House on Wednesday overwhelmingly passed a bill that effectively bans TikTok unless the company splits from its Chinese owner ByteDance because of national security concerns.</p>
<p><a href="https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/202486?Page=2" data-type="link" data-id="https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/202486?Page=2" target="_blank">The 352-65 vote</a> occurred just a week after lawmakers introduced the bipartisan proposal and days after the powerful House Committee on Energy and Commerce unanimously advanced the legislation, an unusual speed for the 118th Congress.</p>
<p>The bill required a two-thirds majority because House leadership placed it on the floor under a fast-track procedure called suspension of the rules.</p>
<p>The bill, dubbed the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/7521/text?s=1&amp;r=1&amp;q=%7B%22search%22%3A%22Protecting+Americans+from+Foreign+Adversary+Controlled+Applications+Act%22%7D" target="_blank">Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act</a>, now heads to the Senate, where concerns over singling out a private company in legislation may slow momentum.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger, D-Virginia, a former intelligence officer who voted with the majority of the House to effectively ban TikTok, said the &#8220;Chinese Communist Party is capable of using the app to undermine democratic elections, weaponize propaganda, and stifle free speech across the globe.&#8221; She noted in a statement that the House&#8217;s vote to advance the bill is not an &#8220;outright ban,&#8221; but said that Congress forcing TikTok to divest from its parent company ByteDance is an effort to &#8220;protect the data of the American people and keep our country safe online.”</span></p>
<p>Following the U.S. House vote, Virginia Democratic Rep. Bobby Scott said in a statement that he had voted in favor of the measure. The House bill requires TikTok to disinvest from ByteDance within 180 days, said Scott, who added that Americans should be able to keep using the social media platform &#8220;without the associated risks of an app being owned and operated by a foreign adversary of the United States.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Sens. Mark Warner, D-Virginia, and Marco Rubio, R-Florida, who co-chair the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, released a statement applauding the House&#8217;s action against TikTok.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are united in our concern about the national security threat posed by TikTok,&#8221; the senators said. &#8220;We were encouraged by today’s strong bipartisan vote in the House of Representatives, and look forward to working together to get this bill passed through the Senate and signed into law.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ahead of the U.S. House vote, Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares wrote an amicus brief on March 11 leading 18 other states in support of similar legislation in Montana calling for TikTok to divest from ByteDance. The </span><a href="https://files.constantcontact.com/d3e83e11901/bef0b7fe-3c52-4b12-9096-56728f683aa2.pdf?rdr=true" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">brief </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">noted that in 2023, TikTok &#8220;was the second most downloaded mobile application worldwide, generating 654 million downloads over the course of the year&#8221; and pointed to the app&#8217;s data collection practices and &#8220;addictive&#8221; impact on youth as causes for concern.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin in December 2023 issued an </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/governor-of-virginia/pdf/eo/EO-24---Banning-the-Use-of-Certain-Applications-and-Websites-on-State-Government-Technology.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">executive order</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> banning the use of TikiTok “on any government-issued devices, including state-issued cell phones, laptops, or other devices capable of connecting to the internet except for public safety purposes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin said the applications allow China and other foreign governments the chance to &#8221; gain access to the information stored on mobile devices, including location services and browsing history,&#8221; a potential cybersecurity threat.</span></p>

<p>President Joe Biden, whose administration had a hand in crafting the bill, is expected to sign the measure if the upper chamber approves it.</p>
<p>Despite broad support across the aisle, the legislation has been met by fierce opposition from TikTok users — totaling some 170 million in the U.S. — and from a coalition of young House lawmakers.</p>
<p>“Not only am I a ‘no’ on tomorrow’s TikTok ban bill, I’m a ‘Hell no,’” Rep. Maxwell Frost of Florida said at a Tuesday press conference, questioning which companies are large enough to acquire TikTok. Frost is the youngest member of Congress at 27.</p>
<p>“Essentially what this bill is doing is setting this whole sale up to fail,” he said.</p>
<p>Users of the wildly popular social media platform flooded lawmakers’ offices with thousands of calls Thursday after the company sent a push notification warning that a ban could be imminent, an argument the company maintains.</p>
<p>Supporters from both parties refute that claim.</p>
<p>“The legislation before the Congress does not ban TikTok. It is designed to address legitimate national security and privacy concerns related to the Chinese Communist Party’s engagement with a frequently used social media platform,” House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat, said in a statement Wednesday.</p>
<p>“If enacted, the bill would require divestiture by ByteDance and the sale of TikTok to an American company,” he continued.</p>

<p><strong>Divestiture deadline set </strong></p>
<p>The bill gives TikTok 180 days to splinter from ByteDance and will make it unlawful for any American app store or web hosting company to distribute or maintain platforms controlled by designated U.S. adversaries.</p>
<p>The social media platform, 100% owned by ByteDance, <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/members-congress-blast-tiktok-ceo-bipartisan-support-us-ban-looks-possible" target="_blank">has long been</a> in the crosshairs of federal and state lawmakers, whom intelligence officials have warned of the possibility of China’s government accessing Americans’ data via the app.</p>
<p>Lawmakers passed legislation in December 2022 <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/why-tiktok-is-being-banned-for-some-federal-employees" target="_blank">banning</a> the app from most federal employee devices. The Montana Legislature <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/one-state-already-has-voted-ban-tiktok-congress-its-going-be-much-tougher-16" target="_blank">banned</a> the app last year, but the law <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/montana-appealing-ruling-that-blocked-state-barring-tiktok-use-2024-01-03/" target="_blank">remains</a> tied up in court.</p>
<p>Former President Donald Trump issued an <a href="https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-addressing-threat-posed-tiktok/" target="_blank">executive order</a> in 2020 banning TikTok unless it broke from ByteDance. This week Trump <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/03/11/1237833658/house-tiktok-vote-trump" target="_blank">reversed</a> his position on the platform, telling CNBC that “without TikTok you’re going to make Facebook bigger.”</p>
<p>Some Republican lawmakers have fallen in line with Trump’s argument, including Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, who said on the floor Wednesday before the vote she worries that Congress could open a “Pandora’s box” and target other platforms like X.</p>
<p>Greene said her “free speech” was “restored” when Elon Musk purchased Twitter and reinstated her account.</p>
<p>“This is really about controlling Americans’ data,” said Greene on the floor before the vote.</p>
<p>The bill’s original sponsor, Republican Rep. Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin, said from the floor that he wanted to clear up “misconceptions” of the bill ahead of the vote.</p>
<p>“It does not apply to American companies,” the chair of the House Select Committee on China said and later <a href="https://x.com/committeeonccp/status/1767908192363638791?s=20" target="_blank">posted</a> on X from his office’s account.</p>
<p>“It only applies to companies subject to the control of foreign adversaries defined by Congress. It says nothing about election interference and cannot be turned against any American social media platform. It does not impact websites in general. The only impacted sites are those associated with foreign adversary apps, such as TikTok.com.”</p>

(Jemal Countess/Getty Images for Community Change)</p><p>WASHINGTON — The bipartisan tax package passed by the U.S. House <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/child-tax-credit-expanded-business-tax-breaks-get-new-life-bill-passed-us-house%C2%A0" target="_blank">last month</a> is not a done deal, but the proposal’s supporters say it could restore some poverty-reducing benefits that reached millions under the pandemic-era child tax credit expansion.</p>
<p>A majority of low-income families who do not currently qualify for the full credit would see some increase just within the first year of the three-year deal, according to an <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-tax/about-16-million-children-in-low-income-families-would-gain-in-first-year-of#Table1" target="_blank">analysis</a> by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.</p>
<p>The center estimates within the initial year of the legislation, if enacted, 16 million of the 19 million children in low-income households that don’t receive the full credit because of low earnings would benefit.</p>
<p>States topping the list of where those children live include California, Texas, Florida, New York, Georgia, Illinois, Ohio, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Michigan, in that order.</p>
<p>“This is really Congress’ only shot this year to pass legislation that would substantially boost the incomes of millions of low-income families and substantially lower child poverty,” said Stephanie Hingtgen, research analyst for the <a href="http://added" target="_blank">liberal-leaning</a> Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.</p>
<p>A successful bipartisan, bicameral legislative package would be a rare win for both lawmakers and the administration, particularly during an election year. Many of those parents who would see gains live in key 2024 swing states.</p>
<p>The CBPP’s analysis calculates that roughly 400,000 children would be lifted above the poverty line within the first year. The overall benefits would reach families across race and ethnicity, and would particularly help families in low-income rural areas, according to an additional <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/blog/house-passed-bipartisan-tax-bills-child-tax-credit-expansion-would-especially-help-children" target="_blank">report</a>.</p>
<p>Hingtgen found that families of 2.5 million children in rural areas would see an increase in the first year. Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, Ohio and Texas would each see more than 100,000 children benefit in their respective rural communities, she reported.</p>

<p>Both Democrats and Republicans tout the deal, dubbed the Tax Relief for American Families and Workers Act, <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/bipartisan-deal-expand-child-tax-credit-revive-business-tax-breaks-advances-congress" target="_blank">as a compromise</a> because it would expand the child tax credit while extending Trump-era corporate tax incentives through 2025.</p>
<p>Increasing child tax credit benefits has been a rallying cry for Democrats since the temporary pandemic-era expansion for 2021 lifted more than 2 million children out of poverty, according to <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/working-papers/2022/demo/SEHSD-wp2022-24.html" target="_blank">census data</a>.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Recent history of the child tax credit</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The tax break amount per child was doubled under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, from up to $1,000 to up to $2,000 per child under age 17. The actual refundable portion of that credit for 2023 — meaning how much a parent could see in a refund check after his or her tax liability — is capped at $1,600.</p>
<p>However, low-income earners hardly ever hit the full refund amount because it phases in at 15% on the dollar for earned income above $2,500. Households that earn less do not even qualify.</p>
<p>As the current law stands, a single parent with two children would need to earn about $29,000 annually to receive the full credit, or about $34,000 for married parents, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Families with more than two children would need an even higher annual income level to realize the full credit.</p>
<p>As the U.S. was digging out from under the COVID-19 economic fallout, Congress approved a <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/coronavirus/assistance-for-american-families-and-workers/child-tax-credit" target="_blank">one-year expansion</a> of the tax credit to $3,000 per child under age 18, and $3,600 for those under age 6 — even for families who made $0 to $2500 in income. Lawmakers made the entire amount refundable, and a portion of it was sent to families in monthly installments.</p>
<p>Advocates hailed the <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-antipoverty-effects-of-the-expanded-child-tax-credit-across-states-where-were-the-historic-reductions-felt/" target="_blank">research findings</a> that showed the temporary move was a game changer for poverty in the U.S.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Hope for low-income earners?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The changes under negotiation in Congress right now contain several advantages for low-earning parents: For one, the refundable portion of the credit would increase incrementally over the 2023, 2024 and 2025 tax years — from $1,800 to $1,900 to $2,000.</p>
<p>Second, parents could use their current or previous year’s income to calculate their tax credit — what tax experts call a “look-back” approach — and therefore maximize their refund checks. That way, if a parent or couple falls on hard times because of job loss or illness, they can choose to use a previous year’s higher income on their tax return when claiming the credit.</p>
<p>Third, the credit would phase in at 15% per dollar per child on earnings above $2,500, therefore allowing bigger families to reach the full credit faster (as illustrated in a helpful <a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/new-child-tax-credit-proposal-versus-old-concerns-about-work-incentives" target="_blank">table</a> from the Tax Policy Center).</p>
<p>“For example, a family that consists of a married couple with three children — one parent earns $32,000 as a farm worker, while the other parent stays at home to care for their two younger kids, while their older one is in school — I mean, under the expansion, the family would get about $1,900 per child for a total of $5,800. And that is an increase of almost $1,000 compared to current law,” Hingtgen said. “So that’s real money that the family can use to help buy food, clothes or school materials for their children.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Senate GOP opposition</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>While the legislation received overwhelming bipartisan support in the U.S. House on Jan. 31 when it passed in a <a href="https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/202430?Page=2" target="_blank">357-70</a> vote, the deal is hitting opposition from some Republican lawmakers in the U.S. Senate.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Cdd7yRZGJr"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/10/16/state-report-finds-child-care-is-unaffordable-for-most-virginia-families-with-young-kids/">State report finds child care is unaffordable for most Va. families with young kids</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;State report finds child care is unaffordable for most Va. families with young kids&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/10/16/state-report-finds-child-care-is-unaffordable-for-most-virginia-families-with-young-kids/embed/#?secret=39jaakjNVd#?secret=Cdd7yRZGJr" data-secret="Cdd7yRZGJr" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p>Several, including GOP Sen. Mike Crapo of Idaho, the ranking member on the Senate Committee on Finance, hope to make “necessary changes to build support,” as Crapo stated after the lower chamber’s vote.</p>
<p>Both Crapo and Republican Sen. John Thune of South Dakota told reporters that one of their top concerns is the “look-back” provision that would allow parents to use prior-year earnings, according to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/31/house-passes-an-expanded-child-tax-credit-bill-and-sends-it-to-the-senate.html" target="_blank">comments</a> the senators made during hallway interviews compiled by Crapo’s office.</p>
<p>Researchers at the American Enterprise Institute published a <a href="https://www.aei.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/The-Work-Incentive-and-Employment-Effects-of-Eliminating-the-Child-Tax-Credits-Annual-Income-Requirement-2.pdf?x91208" target="_blank">paper</a> in January warning that the option for parents to calculate their eligibility using their current earnings or the prior year’s income “would have important impacts on the labor market that require further study before being considered for passage by Congress.”</p>
<p>According to the AEI’s analysis, the every-other-year change would “lead over 700,000 parents to stop working.” At the same time, the change would double the work incentive for a minority of caregivers who don’t work in a two-year period and “lead 395,000 parents to start working,” write the researchers Kevin Corinth, Angela Rachidi, Matt Weidinger and Scott Winship.</p>
<p>Hingtgen refutes that argument.</p>
<p>“The credit as a whole is only going to families that have earnings, and the look-back provision is only applying to people who have a history of earnings, so it is really not a concern,” she said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Coupling the expansion with corporate tax breaks</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Other <a href="https://patrioticmillionaires.org/2024/02/01/congress-is-trading-horses-kids-are-losing-out/" target="_blank">criticism</a> of the deal is aimed at the “horsetrading” that lawmakers are characterizing as compromise, according to the group Patriotic Millionaires.</p>
<p>Alongside the child tax credit expansion, the legislation revives corporate tax breaks that are winding down or expired under the 2017 tax law.</p>
<p>Among them is a provision that allows companies to expense purchases, for example a $30 million piece of equipment, in the first taxable year rather than getting a deduction over a multi-year period, as was previous law.</p>
<p>Patriotic Millionaires, a group of high-net-worth individuals who lobby Congress on tax policy, calls this “a lopsided trade.”</p>
<p>“Those tax cuts are going into the pockets of America’s very, very rich,” said Bob Lord, the group’s senior adviser on tax policy. “There shouldn’t have to be ransom paid to America’s super rich every time we want to help poor children.”</p>
<p>A timeframe on when the tax deal could receive a vote in the Senate is unclear.</p>
<p>If opposing senators let the upper chamber’s legislative clock run out on the deal this year, the lawmakers will not be able to escape looming tax policy negotiations as the Trump-era tax law further winds down in 2025.</p>
<p>Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, chair of the Senate Finance Committee, is in regular talks with colleagues and Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York, according to committee staff.</p>
<p>“No decisions have been made at this point with respect to a markup or floor process, but obviously Senator Wyden’s goal is to move as quickly as possible to get the expanded CTC out to kids and families who qualify,” said Ryan Carey, committee spokesperson.</p>

(Photo by Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON — Bipartisan U.S. senators are sounding the alarm on cost, workforce shortages and dangerous incidents at assisted living facilities across the country as the needs of aging Americans are <a href="https://www.prb.org/resources/fact-sheet-aging-in-the-united-states/#:~:text=The%20number%20of%20Americans%20ages,from%2017%25%20to%2023%25.&amp;text=The%20U.S%20population%20is%20older%20today%20than%20it%20has%20ever%20been." target="_blank">forecast</a> to sharply increase.</p>
<p>Sen. Bob Casey, chair of the Senate Committee on Aging, led a hearing Thursday to highlight the panel’s fact finding mission. Unlike nursing homes, assisted living care is largely unregulated at the federal level.</p>
<p>“It is long past time for Congress to reexamine this model and ensure that it’s meeting our nation’s needs,” the Pennsylvania Democrat said in his opening remarks.</p>
<p>Citing a <a href="https://www.ncoa.org/article/80-percent-of-older-americans-cannot-pay-for-long-term-care-or-withstand-a-financial-shock-new-study-shows" target="_blank">recent survey</a> that found 80% of adults would not be able to afford four years in an assisted living facility, Casey appealed directly to the public to share their experiences.</p>
<p>“I want to hear from you about the true cost of assisted living,” Casey said, holding a sign that urged people to submit stories to <a href="https://www.aging.senate.gov/assistedlivingbills" target="_blank">aging.senate.gov/assistedlivingbills</a>.</p>
<p>“I think it’s very important that we hear from people — hear from people about their own experience as family members, as people who are paying the bill and also expecting the promises that are made when someone becomes a resident of an assisted living facility,” Casey said. “It is only by hearing those stories, only by hearing about those experiences, can we bring the needed change that I know we all agree has to come.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Residents and family members recall poor care</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Among those who testified was a Virginia woman who said she witnessed alarming situations due to short staffing and poor training in a facility where her husband lived with <a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/lewy-body-dementia/what-lewy-body-dementia-causes-symptoms-and-treatments#:~:text=Lewy%20body%20dementia%20(LBD)%20is,movement%2C%20behavior%2C%20and%20mood." target="_blank">Lewy body dementia</a>.</p>
<p>Patty Vessenmeyer of Gainesville, Virginia, described an “extremely loud” central group room at the facility and finding a resident “bloody and staggering down a hallway” after she tripped on a raised area of the floor covered by a rug.</p>
<p>“A company knowledgeable about dementia care would not design a facility this way,” she said.</p>
<p>She also told lawmakers about having to break up a physical altercation when one resident was beating another with his cane, and of finding her husband had soiled himself when staff were not around to help him reach the bathroom.</p>
<p>Without identifying the Warrenton, Virginia, facility, Vessenmeyer told the committee’s ranking member, Sen. Mike Braun, that the base cost for her husband’s room was $7,900 a month, but that her monthly bill eventually totaled $13,000.</p>
<p>“That sounds unaffordable,” Braun, an Indiana Republican, said.</p>
<p>“If he hadn’t passed away rather quickly … it would have used up all of my nest egg,” Vessenmeyer said.</p>
<p>“That’s the kind of stuff I’ve been appalled by,” Braun responded.</p>
<p>Jennifer Craft Morgan, director of the Gerontology Institute at the University of Georgia, told the panel that assisted living costs across the nation average $4,500 a month, making it “inaccessible to most Americans.”</p>
<p>In addition to breaking down cost barriers, Morgan recommended the industry consistently educate and train workers, reward companies that deliver high-quality care, and standardize monitoring and resources to increase state-based oversight and transparency.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Cost and care vary by state</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>But care is not as costly in all states, and operators can choose to go beyond state requirements, Julie Simpkins, co-president of Gardant Management Solutions, told the lawmakers.</p>
<p>The Illinois-based company is the fifth-largest assisted living care provider in the U.S. Gardant operates services aimed at low-income seniors in Indiana, Illinois, Maryland, Ohio and West Virginia.</p>
<p>Simpkins told Braun that in states like Illinois and Indiana, low-income families see limited out-of-pocket expenses because of the states’ arrangements with federal Medicaid waiver programs.</p>
<p>When asked if that situation stretches across the country for low- and middle-income families, Simpkins told Braun: “Nationally, there needs to be programs in each state to provide access to affordable assisted living. They’re not all there yet.”</p>
<p>Simpkins also testified that Gardant’s facilities exceed state requirements “when we believe it is in the best interest of our residents.”</p>
<p>Those instances include immediately reporting to the state when residents wander out of the facilities, a situation the industry calls “elopement.”</p>
<p>“Even something as technical as a resident walking out the door and instantly returning with a staff member — we know they didn’t leave our community and our staff immediately addressed the situation, but we still report it,” Simpkins said.</p>
<p>Another example, Simpkins said, is that every employee at Gardant’s memory care facilities trains beyond the required levels to become certified dementia practitioners.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Debate over national standards</h4>

	 </strong></p>
<p>Still, “it’s important to note that every state, every community, and every resident is different,” Simpkins said in her testimony.</p>
<p>“Efforts to standardize all assisted living communities would be both unworkable and irresponsible for resident care,” she said.</p>
<p>Richard Mollot, executive director of the Long Term Care Community Coalition in New York City, disagreed.</p>
<p>Because the needs of aging adults have evolved since assisted living dawned in the 1980s, Mollot advocates for national standards and a national database of assisted living caregivers and companies.</p>
<p>“The absence of any federal quality or safety standards, coupled with a virtual absence of reliable public information on the quality, safety and cost of assisted living, have made assisted living a sector ripe for investment by sophisticated private enterprises who can shuffle around resources and take profits with little regard to the promises made to seniors and their family,” Mollot said in his opening statement.</p>
<p>Later, during questioning, Mollot told Casey: “Essentially, there’s no independent validated information on assisted living for the consumers, for policymakers, or for the general public. So families, as you noted, have to rely on facilities and facility marketing materials.”</p>

<p>Casey responded to Mollot, saying he thinks it’s “pretty fundamental that people should have the opportunity to place reliance upon a source that is objective and, to use your word, independent.”</p>
<p>Braun also criticized Simpkins’ argument against standardization, particularly when it comes to transparency.</p>
<p>“I don’t know how you could say that wouldn’t be good,” he said to Simpkins.</p>
<p>“I’ve been the most vocal senator that our health care system is broken,” Braun later continued. “We do not have transparency. We do not have competition.&#8221;</p>
<p>“It’s kind of almost like an unregulated utility and you get your bill after you had a significant health care scrape or a bad accident. You gotta hold your breath to see how much it’s gonna cost or if you can afford it,” he said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Looking ahead</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The hearing did not focus on pushing a particular piece of legislation forward. Rather, the senators said they will be gathering information to assess the industry.</p>
<p>Casey touted the <a href="https://www.aging.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/letters_to_assisted_living_facility_companies.pdf" target="_blank">letters</a> he penned in mid-January to the three largest corporate assisted living care operators, including Atria Senior Living based in Louisville, Kentucky; Brookdale Senior Living in Brentwood, Tennessee; and Sunrise Senior Living in McLean, Virginia.</p>
<p>The Pennsylvania lawmaker also announced he was joining colleagues in requesting that the Government Accountability Office study how much federal money is spent on assisted living facilities, what those facilities are charging families and whether or not they make their charges easily known.</p>
<p>Democratic Sens. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, Mark Kelly of Arizona and Raphael Warnock of Georgia co-signed the <a href="https://www.aging.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/letter_to_gao_re_assisted_living.pdf" target="_blank">letter</a> to GAO.</p>

(Courtesy of Rebecca Rivas/Missouri Independent)</p><p>WASHINGTON — Leading members of Congress released a bipartisan, bicameral tax proposal Tuesday, promising a middle-path deal to help low-income families and provide incentives for businesses as Trump-era tax breaks expire.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://gop-waysandmeans.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/The-Tax-Relief-for-American-Families-and-Workers-Act-of-2024-Technical-Summary.pdf" target="_blank">framework</a> led by top tax policy leaders U.S. Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon and Republican Rep. Jason Smith of Missouri would permanently raise the child tax credit over time and restore tax relief for affordable housing projects.</p>
<p>The three-year proposal would also make exempt disaster payments to wildfire victims and to those who suffered losses after the <a href="https://tennesseelookout.com/2023/02/20/federal-government-to-send-medical-experts-to-site-of-ohio-train-derailment/" target="_blank">massive train derailment</a> in East Palestine, Ohio. The deal also aims to extend research and development tax credits, as well as reduce tax burdens on U.S.-Taiwan business relationships, an effort to bolster relations with the autonomous island nation vulnerable to Chinese government aggression.</p>
<p>Wyden, chair of the Senate Committee on Finance, said in a statement that “fifteen million kids from low-income families will be better off as a result of this plan, and given today’s miserable political climate, it’s a big deal to have this opportunity to pass pro-family policy that helps so many kids get ahead.”</p>
<p>Democrats have been <a href="https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/2022/12/20/child-tax-credit-expansion-left-out-of-congressional-omnibus-package/" target="_blank">pushing to permanently raise</a> the tax credit that low-income families receive per child after a temporary increase during the COVID-19 pandemic <a href="https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2022/income-poverty-health-insurance-coverage.html" target="_blank">illustrated</a> significant reductions in child poverty.</p>
<p>Wyden also praised the deal’s potential to spur affordable housing construction and said that his goal “remains to get this passed in time for families and businesses to benefit in this upcoming tax filing season, and I’m going to pull out all the stops to get that done.”</p>
<p>Smith, chair of the House Committee on Ways and Means, said “American families will benefit from this bipartisan agreement that provides greater tax relief, strengthens Main Street businesses, boosts our competitiveness with China, and creates jobs.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Ending fraud-ridden program</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Both lawmakers highlighted the proposal’s effort to rein in abuse of the COVID-19-era employee retention tax credit by increasing penalties and the statute of limitations for those committing fraud and cutting short the overall program by 14 months.</p>
<p>“We even provide disaster relief and cut red tape for small businesses, while ending a COVID-era program that’s costing taxpayers billions in fraud. This legislation locks in over $600 billion in proven pro-growth, pro-America tax policies with key provisions that support over 21 million jobs. I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass this legislation,” Smith continued in a statement Tuesday.</p>
<p>And for those who file 1099 forms, a provision tucked away in the framework would increase the threshold to file to $1,000 from the current $600.</p>
<p>The proposal won praise from across the tax policy spectrum.</p>
<p>Business Roundtable, an advocacy organization representing a wide range of U.S. CEOs, described the deal’s pitch to revive expired pro-business policies as “critical to strengthening America’s global competitiveness.”</p>
<p>“Business Roundtable strongly supports the bipartisan deal to restore three vital pro-growth tax policies that have expired or are being phased out,” organization CEO Joshua Bolten said in a statement Tuesday. “Reviving immediate research and development expensing, full expensing for purchases of equipment, machinery and technology, and a more sensible business interest deduction would increase domestic investment, bolster U.S. innovation and create American jobs.”</p>
<p>Sen. Sherrod Brown, an Ohio Democrat and evangelist for the child tax credit, urged his colleagues to pass the deal, saying the tax credit expansion &#8220;will help parents keep up with the rising cost of living and ensure that their hard work pays off. The business provisions will support American companies that invest in our nation’s research and manufacturing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Low-income families will now receive $40 each month for each eligible school-aged child, up to $120, to buy groceries beginning in the summer of 2024. The cash will come via electronic benefit transfer, often called EBT, and will be added to food assistance debit cards.</p>
<p>Congress authorized the program’s permanent status in December 2022.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates that the program will reach 21 million children — or around 70% of U.S. children eligible for government meal programs — in the states, tribes and territories that signed on to be part of the initial launch.</p>
<p>A list of implementing agencies in those states, tribal lands and territories will be available in the spring of 2024, according to the USDA. USDA is encouraging families to check for updates at <a href="http://www.fns.usda.gov/sebt/household" target="_blank">www.fns.usda.gov/sebt/household</a>.</p>
<p>Notably the participating four tribes have lands in Oklahoma, Texas and Mississippi, three states that are not part of the launch.</p>
<p>The USDA said other states that will not provide the new grocery benefits for low-income children include: Alabama, Alaska, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Iowa, Louisiana, Nebraska, South Carolina, South Dakota, Vermont and Wyoming.</p>
<p>Some states are preparing to launch the program in 2025, but the USDA did not identify which ones. Agency language in a press release Wednesday noted that “(w)orking with future implementers is a top priority.”</p>
<p>“No kid should have to spend their summer hungry, or without nutritious food,” USDA Deputy Secretary Xochitl Torres Small said in the press release.</p>
<p>“Summer EBT is a giant step forward in meeting the needs of our nation’s children and families throughout the year, and especially in the summer months.”</p>
<p>Schools are typically where low-income children can access free or reduced breakfast or lunch when classes are in session. Those children become vulnerable to hunger during the summer months, according to the USDA and several organizations that monitor child nutrition assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Pilot programs</strong></p>
<p>USDA cites success during several <a href="https://www.fns.usda.gov/sfsp/summer-electronic-benefit-transfer-children-sebtc-demonstration-summary-report" target="_blank">pilot programs</a> conducted during the summers of 2012 to 2013 as the basis to recommend the new benefit. During the test programs, amounts ranging from $30 to $60 were provided during summers for families already enrolled in other summer nutrition assistance or the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, otherwise known as WIC.</p>
<p>The new program will expand the reach of already established <a href="https://www.fns.usda.gov/summer" target="_blank">summer meal programs</a>, according to the USDA. Those programs include free summer meals via delivery or at designated community sites. Private nonprofits, local government agencies and youth sports programs are often the sponsors and played a significant role as the program expanded beyond summer during pandemic school closures.</p>
<p>Participation in those programs has decreased since the pandemic, according to an <a href="https://frac.org/wp-content/uploads/summer-report-2023.pdf" target="_blank">analysis</a> by the Food Research and Action Center, or FRAC. The advocacy organization attributes the decrease in part to Congress’ delay in greenlighting community sponsors to operate the programs in 2022.</p>
<p>Top-ranking states for participation in the summer lunch programs in 2021 and 2022, according to FRAC’s analysis, included New Jersey, New York, Vermont, New Mexico and Maryland. The lowest-ranking states for average daily participation were Texas, Alaska, Oklahoma, North Dakota, Louisiana and Nebraska.</p>

Circuit Court on his claim of presidential immunity from criminal prosecution. (Screenshot from C-SPAN)</p><p>WASHINGTON — Former President Donald Trump appeared in federal court Tuesday seeking immunity from charges that he schemed to overturn the 2020 presidential election results and knowingly fed lies to supporters who turned violent on Jan. 6, 2021.</p>
<p>Trump, who is leading polls in the 2024 Republican presidential primary field, watched while his attorney D. John Sauer was grilled by a panel of judges as he argued that the former president is shielded from criminal prosecution because he acted in an official capacity. Trump in a brief press conference later suggested a ruling against his immunity claim would spur “bedlam” from his supporters.</p>
<p>The former president arrived at the courtroom minutes before the proceedings with his team of lawyers and sat mostly expressionless, taking no notes, while Sauer answered questions from a three-judge all-female panel, according to reporters inside the courtroom. Dozens of other journalists watched a live feed from a media room for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia in the E. Barrett Prettyman Courthouse.</p>
<p>Presiding Judges Karen LeCraft Henderson, Florence Y. Pan and J. Michelle Childs fired question after question to Sauer for roughly 40 minutes as he argued that Trump’s acts leading up to and on Jan. 6 were “official” and that his eventual acquittal by the U.S. Senate protects him from double jeopardy.</p>
<p>Trump was impeached by the U.S. House for inciting an insurrection on Jan. 6.</p>
<p>The decision by the appeals judges — Henderson, appointed under President George H. W. Bush, and the others recent President Joe Biden appointees — is likely to land in the U.S. Supreme Court, where a ruling could have significant implications for presidential liability.</p>
<p>Under questioning, Sauer told the appeals panel that “to authorize the prosecution of a president for his official acts would open a Pandora’s box (from) which this nation may never recover.”</p>
<p>The judges questioned whether a president’s actions while in office, no matter the legality, would be immune from criminal prosecution.</p>
<p>“You’re saying a president could sell pardons, could sell military secrets, could order SEAL Team Six to assassinate a political rival,” Pan said to Sauer.</p>
<p>Sauer conceded that selling military secrets “strikes me as something that might not be held to be an official act.”</p>
<p>Pan replied that Sauer’s concession undermines the Trump team’s argument that the government’s separation of powers guarantees the judiciary cannot hold the executive branch accountable.</p>
<p>“Given that you’re conceding that presidents can be criminally prosecuted under certain circumstances, doesn’t that narrow the issues before us to ‘Can a president be prosecuted without first being impeached and convicted?’” Pan said.</p>
<p>“Your separation of powers argument falls away, your policy arguments fall away if you concede that a president can be criminally prosecuted under some circumstances,” Pan said.</p>
<p>Henderson, questioning whether Trump’s actions can be defended as official acts, said, “I think it’s paradoxical to say that his constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed allows him to violate (federal law).”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Government’s case</h4>

	
<p>Arguing for the U.S. Department of Justice, Assistant Special Counsel James Pearce described the potential for an “awfully scary” and “frightening” future if presidents could be completely immune from criminal prosecution.</p>
<p>Pearce rebuffed the notion that “floodgates” would open for cases against presidents.</p>
<p>“This investigation doesn’t reflect that we are going to see a sea change of vindictive tit for tat prosecutions in the future. I think it reflects the fundamentally unprecedented nature of the criminal charges here,” Pearce said.</p>
<p>Trump could be seen shaking his head in disagreement at the comment, according to reporters in the room.</p>
<p>“If as I understood my friend on the other side is to say here, a president orders his SEAL team to assassinate a political rival and resigns, for example, before an impeachment, (it’s) not a criminal act. I think that’s an extraordinarily frightening future,” Pearce said during his roughly 20 minutes of questioning.</p>
<p>In his five-minute rebuttal, Sauer said a United States in which a president is “very, very, very seldom prosecuted because they have to be impeached and convicted first is the one we’ve lived under for 235 years. That’s not a frightening future, that’s our republic.”</p>
<p>Sauer said the criminal charges against Trump are now creating “a situation where we have the prosecution of the political opponent who’s leading in every poll in the presidential election next year and is being prosecuted by the administration that he’s seeking to replace.”</p>
<p>The three-judge panel concluded oral arguments after an hour and 15 minutes and did not indicate when judges would release a decision.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Trump calls for immunity, warns of ‘bedlam‘</h4>

	
<p>In brief remarks following the hearing at the Waldorf Astoria hotel in Washington, which was a Trump-branded property until his business sold the lease in 2022, Trump said presidents should have legal immunity, proclaimed his innocence and hinted his supporters would create more unrest if he were prosecuted.</p>
<p>Biden was using federal prosecutions to damage his chief rival politically, Trump said.</p>
<p>“This is the way they’re going to try to win,” he said. “And that’s not the way it goes. There’ll be bedlam in the country. It’s a very bad thing, it’s a very bad precedent. As we’ve said, it’s the opening of a Pandora’s box. It’s a very sad thing that’s happened with this whole situation.</p>
<p>“When they talk about threat to democracy, that’s your real threat to democracy and I feel that as a president, you have to have immunity,” Trump added.</p>
<p>The remarks drew on a strategy <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-legal-problems-abound-first-test-2024-presidential-campaign-nears-iowa" target="_blank">the Trump campaign has employed</a> for months to use the former president’s myriad legal troubles to boost his electoral standing by framing him as a victim of political persecution.</p>
<p>Trump suggested that he was being prosecuted for official acts related to curbing voter fraud and repeated debunked claims that the 2020 election was decided by fraudulent votes.</p>
<p>“I did nothing wrong, absolutely nothing wrong,” he added. “I’m working for the country.”</p>
<p>Trump spoke for just more than seven minutes and did not take questions.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Trump indictment</h4>

	
<p>U.S. District Court Judge Tanya Chutkan in December <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.258148/gov.uscourts.dcd.258148.171.0_1.pdf" target="_blank">denied</a> Trump’s motion to dismiss his case based on presidential immunity.</p>
<p>U.S. Special Counsel Jack Smith asked the Supreme Court to immediately take the case, bypassing the appeals level, but the justices <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-supreme-court-wont-yet-rule-presidential-immunity-question-trump-case" target="_blank">declined</a>.</p>
<p>A federal grand jury <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/fueled-lies-trump-charged-seeking-overturn-2020-election-6" target="_blank">indicted</a> Trump in August for interfering in election results following the November 2020 presidential contest.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.258149/gov.uscourts.dcd.258149.1.0_2.pdf" target="_blank">indictment</a> accuses Trump of conspiring with attorneys, a U.S. Department of Justice official and a political consultant, all unnamed, to organize fake electors for Trump from seven key states that Biden in fact won. Those states included Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, New Mexico, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.</p>
<p>The indictment also outlined Trump’s pressure campaign on former Vice President Mike Pence to reject electors from those states during his ceremonial role of certifying the election results on Jan. 6, 2021.</p>
<p>Leading up to that date, the indictment recounts, Trump knowingly fed a stream of lies to his supporters that he won the election, igniting a rally during which he spoke on Jan. 6, 2021 and culminating in a violent attack on the U.S. Capitol. The official four charges against Trump include conspiracy to defraud the United States; conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding; obstruction of, and attempt to obstruct, an official proceeding; and conspiracy against rights.</p>

<p><em>Veterans experiencing a mental health crisis or suicidal thoughts should dial 988 or chat at </em><a href="https://988lifeline.org/" target="_blank"><em>https://988lifeline.org/</em></a></p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Veterans’ care in the United States set all-time records in fiscal year 2023, “shattering” the agency’s performance in previous years, in large part because of an <a href="https://kansasreflector.com/2022/08/10/biden-signs-landmark-bill-aiding-veterans-exposed-to-burn-pits-overseas/" target="_blank">expansion</a> of benefits under the Biden administration, U.S. Secretary of Veterans Affairs Denis McDonough said Monday.</p>
<p>McDonough <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?531646-1/veterans-affairs-secretary-pact-act-implementation-americas-veterans" target="_blank">spoke</a> at the National Press Club less than a week out from Veterans Day and a little over a year after President Joe Biden signed a law that opened benefits eligibility for up to 3.5 million post-9/11 veterans, and for those who served during the Vietnam and Cold War eras.</p>
<p>The Sgt 1st Class Heath Robinson Honoring Our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act, or the <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R47542" target="_blank">PACT Act</a>, provides that roughly two dozen chronic conditions and illnesses are <a href="https://www.va.gov/disability/eligibility/hazardous-materials-exposure/specific-environmental-hazards/" target="_blank">presumed</a> to be caused by breathing toxins from open burn pits or exposure to other hazards, including Agent Orange and radiation.</p>
<p>“Since President Biden took office, VA has delivered more care and more benefits to more veterans than ever before. When it comes to the benefits veterans have earned and deserve, we’re processing their claims faster than ever,” McDonough said at the luncheon in downtown Washington, D.C.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Screening for effects of toxic exposure</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Under the new law, the VA has screened nearly 4.6 million veterans for lasting effects of toxic exposure during their deployments, according to Department of Veterans Affairs figures released Monday.</p>
<p>At the one-year anniversary of enacting the law, Biden <a href="https://missouriindependent.com/2023/08/11/pact-act-in-one-year-aided-340000-ailing-veterans-and-survivors-biden-says/#:~:text=By%3A%20Ashley%20Murray%20%2D%20August%2011%2C%202023%206%3A30%20am&amp;text=There%20is%20no%20overall%20deadline,14." target="_blank">said</a> more than $1.85 billion in PACT-Act related benefits had reached veterans and families.</p>
<p>The legislation received broad bipartisan support in both chambers during the summer of 2022 but was held up for weeks at the tail end of the process after retiring Republican Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania rallied GOP colleagues to block a final procedural vote as a protest to funding language that had been in the bill all along.</p>
<p>Among the statistics Veterans Affairs highlighted Monday:</p>
<ul>
<li>$163 billion in benefits was delivered to just over 1.5 million veterans and survivors ($150 billion of the total went toward compensation and pension payments).</li>
<li>Veterans submitted 2.4 million claims, up 39% from 2022.</li>
<li>Just over 1.9 million claims were processed for veterans and survivors, up 15.9% over the previous record.</li>
<li>116 million health care appointments were made, surpassing the last record by 3 million.</li>
<li>Roughly 1 million calls, texts and chats were received by the Veterans Crisis Line, up 15.1% from a previous record for the hotline.</li>
<li>Emergency care was provided for 33,542 acute suicidal crises at no cost under a new <a href="https://news.va.gov/press-room/starting-jan-17-veterans-in-suicidal-crisis-can-go-to-any-va-or-non-va-health-care-facility-for-free-emergency-health-care/" target="_blank">program</a> started in January.</li>
</ul>
<p>McDonough credited the increased usage and services to upgraded digital tools, including telehealth options and an “overhauled” <a href="https://www.va.gov/" target="_blank">VA.gov,</a> which now serves as “the digital front door for all services VA offers vets.”</p>
<p>“As a result, vets’ trust in VA has grown strong. Again, it’s not 100%, but it’s stronger,” McDonough said.</p>
<p>According to the agency’s <a href="https://www.va.gov/initiatives/veteran-trust-in-va/" target="_blank">survey</a> measuring trust in the VA, 78.9% of veterans expressed current VA-wide trust in the third quarter of 2023, down 0.4% since last quarter’s survey.</p>
<p>When broken down by gender, 80% of male veterans expressed trust compared to 71.2% of female veterans.</p>
<p>McDonough also credited a hiring boom at the agency for more claims being processed.</p>
<p>“This has been a year of hiring at record pace while retaining our record staff and, by the way, not retaining our not excellent staff,” he said.</p>
<p>The Veterans Benefits Administration now employs more than 32,000, according to McDonough.</p>
<p>“The claims process is overwhelmingly moved by a simple entry point, which is more people reviewing claims. So that’s one way we’re addressing this,” McDonough said.</p>
<p>The population of living veterans was estimated at 16.2 million, according to the U.S. Census American Community Survey.</p>
<p>Veterans can contact the agency for benefits information or register for a toxic exposure screening at <a href="https://www.va.gov/" target="_blank">VA.gov</a> or by calling 1-800-MyVA411.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. House Republicans on Wednesday voted for Louisiana’s Mike Johnson as speaker in a chamber that has been frozen for more than three weeks after former Speaker Kevin McCarthy was ousted.</p>
<p>In a 220-209 party-line vote, all Republicans present backed Johnson. All Democrats present voted for Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York.</p>
<p>Republican Conference Chair Elise Stefanik of New York nominated Johnson, 51, who represents his state’s 4th District, saying the conservative congressman “epitomizes what it means to be a leader.”</p>
<p>“Today is the day that House Republicans will humbly look in our hearts and elect Mike Johnson as speaker of the people’s House,” Stefanik said.</p>
<p>Democratic Conference Chair Pete Aguilar of California nominated Jeffries, calling him a “far contrast from who Republicans nominated.”</p>
<p>“The most pressing needs of everyday Americans are his North Star,” Aguilar said.</p>
<p>Johnson, who does not have a strong bipartisan track record, will be tasked with working with the Democratic-controlled Senate on a quickly approaching Nov.17 government funding deadline, and critical legislation such as the recent nearly $106 billion supplemental request from the Biden administration to fund Ukraine, Israel and global aid and U.S border security.</p>
<p>Johnson has voted against several recent bipartisan pieces of legislation such as the infrastructure law, a gun safety bill signed into law and the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act.</p>
<p>Johnson was one of more than 100 House Republicans who voted to block Pennsylvania and Arizona’s 2020 presidential election results following the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.</p>
<p>In advance of the joint session of Congress on Jan. 6 Johnson led a <a href="https://mikejohnson.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=715" target="_blank">statement</a> with 36 fellow Republicans outlining opposition to the Electoral College results in Georgia and Michigan as well.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. House Republicans Tuesday voted to tap Minnesota’s Tom Emmer as speaker following five rounds of ballots — but Emmer quit the race just four hours later, after he was attacked by the GOP’s most powerful figure, former President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>After beating six candidates, Emmer, the No. 3 Republican, faced an uphill battle to coalesce more than 20 hard-right Republican holdouts loyal to Trump, who took to social media shortly after the vote to warn that electing Emmer would be a “tragic mistake.”</p>
<p>“He never respected the Power of a Trump Endorsement, or the breadth and scope of MAGA,” Trump, also a 2024 candidate for president, wrote about Emmer on his site, Truth Social. “He is totally out-of-touch with Republican Voters.”</p>
<p>Emmer, 62, who represents a safe GOP district that includes parts of the western and northern Twin Cities suburbs, the city of St. Cloud and rural areas in between, had continued to meet with holdouts on Tuesday afternoon following the closed-door conference vote.</p>
<p>Emmer quickly left the meeting later Tuesday, dogging reporters chasing after him. He declined to comment before entering a black car. Lawmkers said he dropped out a short time later.</p>
<p>With Emmer out, Republicans will have to begin their nomination process anew and it was unclear how that would proceed.</p>
<p>Emmer would have had to get nearly all of the 221 Republican votes on the House floor, as all Democrats are expected to vote for Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. In the final secret ballot, Emmer earned 117 GOP votes, a long way from the 217 needed for the speaker’s gavel if all Republicans are present and voting.</p>
<p>In a roll call conference vote, again behind closed doors, on whether a member would support him on the floor, Emmer’s support grew to 186, according to several lawmakers in the meeting.</p>
<p>Several Republicans leaving Tuesday’s meeting, such as Reps. Steve Womack of Arkansas and Dusty Johnson of South Dakota, acknowledged that Emmer did not have the votes needed to become speaker, but still remained hopeful that Emmer could narrow that gap.</p>
<p>Womack said that because the conference had a roll call ballot, Emmer can see which Republicans were holdouts.</p>
<p>“I expect that Tom would want to meet with the individuals that are not calling his name and see if there is something he can say or do that could bring them around and help shore up their requisite 217,” Womack said. “If he can’t do that, then he’s got to make a decision as to whether he goes to the floor.”</p>
<p>Womack added that there are some members that will always be against Emmer, but he did not name them.</p>
<p>“What I just saw in that room illustrates to me that there are some people that are pretty well dug in and are not going to support the current designee,” he said.</p>
<p>For example, Georgia’s Rick Allen, had already stated he will never vote for Emmer because the Minnesota Republican voted<a href="https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2022513" target="_blank"> to codify same-sex marriage, according to CNN.</a></p>
<p>Johnson said that Emmer was working on flipping those holdouts.</p>
<p>“People with concerns are coming forward, and he’s taking them head on,” Johnson said.</p>
<p>When asked how many members voted against Emmer in the roll call vote, Mike Waltz of Florida said “too many.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Third GOP nominee</h4>

	
<p>Emmer was the third Republican nominee for speaker.</p>
<p>The first, Louisiana’s Steve Scalise <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/scalise-drops-out-race-us-house-speaker" target="_blank">never brought his nomination for a floor vote</a> and the second, Ohio’s Jim Jordan, was <a href="https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2023/10/20/jim-jordan-again-rejected-in-bid-for-u-s-house-speaker-and-gop-struggles-to-regroup/" target="_blank">tossed aside</a> by the party after his third and final unsuccessful floor vote for the speaker’s gavel.</p>
<p>The House has been without a speaker for 21 days.</p>
<p>Emmer, who serves in GOP leadership as the Republican whip, had the endorsement of former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, but would have had to court members and allies of the far-right House Freedom Caucus who are aligned closely with Trump.</p>
<p>On Monday, Emmer posted a video in which he said he has always “gotten along” with Trump, who is also the current GOP front-runner in the 2024 presidential election.</p>
<p>In a Monday campaign stop in New Hampshire, Trump was asked if he’d endorse Emmer. The former president said he’d “always gotten along with” Emmer, but said he was trying to allow House Republicans to choose their own leader.</p>
<p>Emmer posted <a href="https://twitter.com/GOPMajorityWhip/status/1716536001819017487" target="_blank">a video clip of the appearance to X</a>, saying as speaker, he would continue the pair’s “strong working relationship.”</p>
<p>However, by Tuesday, Trump had posted about his opposition to Emmer on his social media site.</p>
<p>Emmer was also one of the few candidates running for the speakership who voted to certify the 2020 election results.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The speaker campaign</h4>

	
<p>On Monday night, as they tried again to elect a speaker, House Republicans heard pitches from eight of their colleagues who had filed by a Sunday deadline. Pennsylvania’s Dan Meuser was also a candidate but dropped out in the middle of the <a href="https://www.penncapital-star.com/government-politics/u-s-house-republicans-mull-eight-new-candidates-for-speaker-in-advance-of-votes/" target="_blank">closed-door candidate forum</a>.</p>
<p>Those GOP <a href="https://newjerseymonitor.com/2023/10/23/nine-republicans-are-running-for-u-s-house-speaker-heres-your-guide-to-the-field/" target="_blank">lawmakers who ran</a> for the speaker’s gavel included Reps. <a href="https://alabamareflector.com/2023/10/23/alabama-congressman-gary-palmer-to-run-for-u-s-house-speaker/" target="_blank">Gary Palmer of Alabama</a>, <a href="https://floridaphoenix.com/2023/10/20/floridas-byron-donalds-is-now-a-candidate-for-u-s-house-speaker/" target="_blank">Byron Donalds of Florida</a>, Austin Scott of Georgia, <a href="https://lailluminator.com/2023/10/21/another-louisiana-republican-joins-u-s-house-speaker-fray/" target="_blank">Mike Johnson of Louisiana</a>, <a href="https://michiganadvance.com/2023/10/21/rep-bergman-says-his-hat-is-in-the-ring-for-u-s-house-speaker/" target="_blank">Jack Bergman of Michigan</a>, Kevin Hern of Oklahoma and Pete Sessions of Texas.</p>
<p>Early Tuesday, Scalise, the House majority leader, said the goal is for Republicans to unify behind a nominee and get back to legislative work that has been stalled since McCarthy was <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-votes-remove-kevin-mccarthy-speaker" target="_blank">ousted earlier this month. </a></p>
<p>“There’s a lot of work to do,” Scalise said. “All of these things are bills that are ready to go that we want to move.”</p>
<p>Whoever becomes speaker will be tasked with a quickly approaching <a href="https://ncnewsline.com/2023/09/30/ditching-ukraine-aid-u-s-house-in-bipartisan-vote-passes-bill-to-avert-shutdown/" target="_blank">Nov. 17 deadline for government funding</a> and a nearly <a href="https://ncnewsline.com/2023/10/20/israel-ukraine-global-aid-and-border-funding-would-hit-106-billion-under-biden-request/" target="_blank">$106 billion supplemental aid request</a> from the White House for Ukraine, Israel and global aid and U.S. border security. Emmer will also have to lead in moving must-pass legislation such as the <a href="https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2023/08/01/massive-defense-bill-approved-by-u-s-senate-but-deep-partisan-divide-with-house-looms/" target="_blank">annual defense bill</a> and five-year <a href="https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/2023/10/09/farm-bill-stalled-amid-u-s-house-speaker-battle-delay-of-spending-bills/" target="_blank">reauthorization of the farm bill</a>.</p>
<p>On top of legislative duties the new speaker will have to balance striking deals with a White House and Senate controlled by Democrats while also fundraising and protecting vulnerable Republicans and expanding the House’s slim GOP majority in the 2024 elections.</p>
<p>McCarthy said he wants to see the party move beyond its deep fractures and that there must be “consequences” for the eight Republicans who voted with Democrats to oust him.</p>
<p>“It’s frustrating because it’s just a few, these eight, working with all the Democrats to ruin the reputation of the Republicans, but we’ll earn it back,” the California Republican said.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Five ballots for Emmer</h4>

	
<p>Republicans went through five secret ballots on Tuesday to get to a nominee. Some candidates withdrew their names prior to voting to speed the process along, such as <a href="https://alabamareflector.com/2023/10/24/gary-palmer-withdraws-from-u-s-house-speaker-race/" target="_blank">Palmer</a> and Meuser.</p>
<p>Sessions was dropped in the first round of ballots; Bergman in the second round; Scott in the third round; Hern in the fourth round; and Johnson in the fifth round. Donalds withdrew in the fourth round.</p>
<p>Because Republicans have struggled to rally behind one candidate, Rep. Mike Flood of Nebraska asked all speaker candidates and GOP lawmakers to sign a unity pledge.</p>
<p>But there were clear signs of dissent.</p>
<p>For the first four rounds of secret ballots, six lawmakers voted either present or for others besides the announced candidates, stirring concern that a candidate may not be able to gain the support of the majority of the conference on the floor.</p>
<p>Bill Huizenga of Michigan said as the final ballot was ongoing, he had a message for those Republicans who voted present: “We got to figure this out. Stop voting present, stop voting for other people. We have two candidates.”</p>
<p>One of those who voted present, Troy Nehls of Texas, said that Emmer had no chance of becoming speaker and that as Republicans, “we are, again, back to where we started.”</p>
<p>Rep. Brett Guthrie of Kentucky said Emmer asked the holdouts to remain in the room after an up-or-down roll call vote to discuss differences.</p>
<p>“So when I left, several people who voted different than Emmer were at the microphone,” he said.</p>
<p>Rep. Ann Wagner of Missouri said she hoped Emmer’s approach would rebuild trust among the conference.</p>
<p>“This is really good because it also does away with this feeling that there are any kind of backroom deals going on or that people are, you know, getting their wish lists,” Wagner said, referring to one-on-one meetings that other speaker candidates have held.</p>
<p>In January, McCarthy made a secret handshake deal with far right conservatives before he won on a 15th ballot.</p>
<p>Mario Díaz-Balart of Florida said that while Donalds was his first choice, he wanted to unify around Emmer whom he described as “honorable.”</p>
<p>As whip “he has the relationships. If he can’t pull it together then we’re running into some very, very difficult times,” he said.</p>
<p>House Democrats continued to criticize the GOP Tuesday.</p>
<p>“Chaos and dysfunction continue to be the order of the day in the House Republican majority. Today is day 21 without a speaker, and the other side is back to square one,” Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar said at a press conference.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Emmer finances, fundraising</h4>

	
<p>Known in Congress as a promoter of cryptocurrency, Emmer’s own finances are remarkably traditional, according to personal financial reports required of members of Congress.</p>
<p>In his most recent annual report, filed in May, Emmer listed only one asset, an investment account worth between $15,000 and $50,000, and one liability, a mortgage of between $100,000 and $250,000.</p>
<p>He listed no stock holdings, transactions, gifts or other finances — a rarity for congressional financial disclosures that are<a href="https://alabamareflector.com/2023/02/07/tuberville-among-four-in-alabama-congressional-delegation-to-invest-in-corporate-stocks/" target="_blank"> often</a><a href="https://westvirginiawatch.com/2023/07/11/manchin-earned-476k-in-2022-from-family-coal-company-congressional-disclosures-show/" target="_blank"> more</a><a href="https://mainemorningstar.com/2023/09/19/maines-u-s-senators-among-stock-holding-members-of-congress-financial-disclosures-show/" target="_blank"> complicated</a>.</p>
<p>A prolific fundraiser as the former head of the House Republican campaign operation, Emmer has raised millions from the cryptocurrency sector and promoted the technology in the House, where he sits on the Financial Services Committee.</p>
<p>He raised $2 million for the National Republican Congressional Committee in the 2022 cycle from the political action committee of Ryan Salame, the former co-CEO of FTX, a crypto firm that went bankrupt after serious allegations of fraud.</p>
<p>Immediately following that scandal, Emmer<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/ftx-failure-divides-lawmakers-how-tough-get-crypto-regulation" target="_blank"> maintained</a> that the FTX example should not undermine the promise of cryptocurrency itself.</p>
<p>For the current campaign cycle, Emmer has raised a combined $3.7 million for his own campaign and for his leadership PAC. He’s raised $230,000 from contributors in the securities and investment industry — more than any industry other than “retired,” according to the nonprofit campaign spending tracking group Open Secrets.</p>

</p><p>WASHINGTON — U.S. House Republicans Monday night gathered behind closed doors to hear the pitches of eight candidates for the speaker’s gavel, as the chamber approaches three weeks without a speaker.</p>
<div id="modal-ready">
<p>Monday’s nearly three-hour meeting was meant to produce a leading GOP candidate, so that when Republicans vote behind closed doors on Tuesday, there will be a new speaker designate who can be brought to the House floor for a vote. Ohio’s Rep. Jim Jordan on Friday was cast aside by the conference after he failed to gain enough support on the floor.</p>
<p>“We heard tonight, a really strong vision laid out by each of them. Everybody has a lot of the same goals in mind,” said Majority Leader Steve Scalise of Louisiana, who was briefly the nominee two weeks ago before bowing out. “We need to get moving on our agenda.”</p>

<p>Rep. <a href="https://www.penncapital-star.com/blog/u-s-rep-dan-meuser-of-pennsylvania-says-hes-a-candidate-for-speaker-of-the-house/" target="_blank">Dan Meuser of Pennsylvania</a> declared himself a candidate on Sunday but he dropped out of the race during the closed-door meeting Monday night.</p>
<p>“I came in late. I have other commitments that I want to adhere to, largely leading President Trump’s campaign in Pennsylvania. And, we have great candidates,” Meuser said.</p>
<p>Meuser said former President Donald Trump supported his decision to exit the speaker race “based upon the situations at hand and with some of the other members that are in so as we get a strong speaker,” but stopped short of endorsing another candidate.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Majority vote</h4>

	
<p>According to House Republican <a href="https://www.gop.gov/conference-rules-of-the-118th-congress/" target="_blank">rules</a>, any nominee must get a majority of the vote of the conference in the closed-door meeting. Because there are eight candidates, it could take a while before Republicans rally around a speaker designate.</p>
<p>If none receives a majority during the first ballot, the candidate with the least votes would be removed from the ballot and another round of voting would begin.</p>
<p>With 221 House Republicans, a candidate needs the support of 111 to become the speaker nominee in the conference vote. However, the nominee would likely need 217 votes on the floor if all Republicans are present and voting.</p>
<p>The GOP’s speaker designate can only afford to lose a handful of votes on the House floor, as all Democrats are expected to vote for House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York for speaker.</p>
<p>Any Republican speaker will have to walk a delicate line negotiating with the White House and Democratic-controlled Senate on must-pass legislation like an annual defense bill, and aggressively fundraise for the Republican Party as well as protect vulnerable Republicans and expand their slim House majority in the upcoming 2024 elections.</p>
<p>The next speaker of the House will also be tasked with an upcoming <a href="https://ncnewsline.com/2023/09/30/ditching-ukraine-aid-u-s-house-in-bipartisan-vote-passes-bill-to-avert-shutdown/" target="_blank">Nov. 17 deadline on government funding</a>, as well as nearly <a href="https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2023/10/23/israel-ukraine-global-aid-and-border-funding-would-hit-106-billion-under-biden-request/" target="_blank">$106 billion in supplemental aid request from the White House </a>for Israel, Ukraine and U.S. border security.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Unity pledge</h4>

	
<p>House Republicans have been unable to pick a successful candidate to replace former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, who was <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-votes-remove-kevin-mccarthy-speaker" target="_blank">ousted in early October</a> by eight Republicans voting with all Democrats. Following his removal, McCarthy said he would not run again, but has said the decision is ultimately up to the Republican conference.</p>
<p>Jordan brought his candidacy to the floor<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/jim-jordans-bid-be-us-house-speaker-ends-after-rejection-gop-closed-meeting" target="_blank"> three times</a>. With each vote, he continued to lose GOP support.</p>
<p>Following Jordan’s losses, House Republicans held a secret vote in which Jordan failed to garner enough votes from his fellow GOP lawmakers to continue as the nominee.</p>
<p>The first speaker candidate, Louisiana’s Scalise, never called a floor vote, stepping down <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/scalise-drops-out-race-us-house-speaker" target="_blank">a day after he was selected</a> as the nominee after he realized he couldn’t reach the 217 votes needed to become speaker.</p>
<p>To avoid continued struggles to come together in unity behind a candidate, Nebraska Rep. Mike Flood unveiled <a href="https://flood.house.gov/media/press-releases/congressman-flood-launches-unity-pledge-speakers-race" target="_blank">a unity pledge</a> Friday, urging his Republican colleagues to sign and give their support for the speaker designate, regardless of who becomes the candidate.</p>
<p>“I wanted to start this process, this election, with us understanding that we have to be unified to the end of it,” Flood said to reporters.</p>
<p>As of Monday night, all eight candidates signed the pledge, Flood said.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Damage to GOP</h4>

	
<p>Several Republicans, such as Reps. Dusty Johnson of South Dakota and Ralph Norman of South Carolina, said that Republicans ultimately have to pick a speaker because the last few weeks have been damaging to the party.</p>
<p>“Hopefully, small groups of members who have stood in the way of us getting work done in the past understand how incredibly damaging the last four weeks have been,” Johnson said, referring to the beginning of the month when McCarthy was removed.</p>
<p>Norman argued that “there is no perfect speaker,” and that Republicans need to unify behind a candidate.</p>
<p>Following the Republican candidate forum, House Rules Committee Chair Tom Cole of Oklahoma said that all the candidates were good and that he hopes a new speaker can be picked quickly.</p>
<p>Rep. Brett Guthrie of Kentucky said he supports Flood’s unity pledge.</p>
<p>“I think anybody asking for our votes should commit to supporting whoever wins. That’s the only way we’re gonna govern, if we become a majority,” Guthrie said on his way into the candidate forum.</p>
<p>“Anybody who gets 51% at the end of the day, we walk across the street, hold hands and vote for that person … And that’s the way it should be,” said Rep. Vern Buchanan of Florida.</p>
<p>Rep. Matt Gaetz, who sparked McCarthy’s ouster earlier this month, said he thought the candidates did “a great job” in the forum.</p>
<p>“I was most heartened by those who wanted to advance single-subject spending bills rather than link disparate issues like Ukraine funding and Israel funding together,” the Florida Republican said.</p>
<p>Rep. Victoria Spartz of Indiana said she’s pleased to see “competition and vibrancy.”</p>
<p>“I think it’s important for us to govern, but I truly think it’s a good process. This institution is so broken, so only crisis maybe will help, for the American people, to make us work,” Spartz said.</p>
<p>She added that she has “concerns” with some of the candidates, not specifying who, but said she wanted “to give people a chance.”</p>
<p>Whichever candidate gets a majority of the vote will coordinate with North Carolina’s Patrick McHenry, who has been serving as speaker pro tempore, to bring the nomination to the floor for a vote.</p>
<p>McCarthy handpicked him for the role under a procedure established in the wake of the 9/11 attacks to ensure continuity of government. <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/scalise-drops-out-race-us-house-speaker" target="_blank">It’s unclear what legislative authority</a> McHenry has, and House Republicans last week <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-gripped-paralysis-again-after-gop-punts-proposal-speaker-pro-tem" target="_blank">punted on adopting a resolution</a> that would temporarily allow McHenry to move legislation.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">A range of experience</h4>

	
<p>Of all the candidates, Minnesota’s Emmer is the highest ranking Republican.</p>
<p>Emmer has the advantage of already being a member of House GOP leadership and party insider, with connections as a former National Republican Congressional Committee head.</p>
<p>But Emmer, the current House majority whip, is facing criticism from the far right. Emmer did not support Trump’s false 2020 election victory claims, and voted to certify the Electoral College count.</p>
<p>However, he did sign onto a lawsuit out of Texas challenging election results in swing states that Biden won in 2020.</p>
<p>Like Emmer, Palmer also sits in a GOP House leadership position, as chair of an advisory committee known as the Republican Policy Committee.</p>
<p>Hern, who at one point owned two dozen McDonald’s franchises, chairs the Republican Study Committee, a body that has promoted a conservative agenda among House GOP lawmakers since the 1970s.</p>
<p>Hern said the closed-door meeting had a good turnout and he was happy to answer questions from his GOP colleagues. He said they asked “questions of concern about where our conference currently is and where it needs to go.”</p>
<p>Donalds, who belongs to the far-right House Freedom Caucus, received floor nominations for speaker last week and in January during the course of more than a dozen ballots that finally declared McCarthy the winner.</p>
<p>Donalds, first elected in 2020, defended his legislative record, pointing to his time as a Florida state legislator.</p>
<p>“I know the legislative process,” he said. “I’ve worked with our colleagues up here to get a lot of policies done.”</p>
<p>Donalds added that he spoke with Trump but did not answer reporters who asked if the former president would endorse him.</p>
<p>“The president is going to watch us do our process,” he said. “I think he’s gonna be happy with who’s gonna be the next speaker of the House.”</p>
<p>The former president did endorse Jordan, who co-founded the House Freedom Caucus, and struggled to win the support of more centrist Republicans. Members who voted against Jordan also received death <a href="https://kentuckylantern.com/2023/10/19/members-of-u-s-house-gop-describe-threats-sparked-by-votes-against-jim-jordan-for-speaker/" target="_blank">threats</a> and other threatening messages from Jordan allies.</p>
<p>Scott briefly challenged Jordan but lost an internal secret ballot on Oct. 13. Scott is vice chairman of the House Committee on Agriculture, where he chairs the panel on General Farm Commodities, Risk Management, and Credit. He is also the co-chair of the Congressional Crop Insurance Caucus.</p>
<p>He said that many of the candidates running are similar and “there are no personal differences between us.”</p>
<p>“It’s just a matter of being able to do things and get the ball rolling in the right direction,” Scott said. “I’m committed to a House that operates and functions.”</p>
<p>Scott added that he did not specify a plan for government spending to Republicans, but “laid out a path forward for us as a conference.”</p>
<p>Johnson chairs the House Judiciary Committee’s Subcommittee on Constitution and Limited Government, and chairs the Congressional Long Range Strike Caucus.</p>
<p>Bergman, a former lieutenant general in the U.S. Marines and commercial airline pilot, does not hold a leadership position on any committees or caucuses, but he does sit on three House committees, including Armed Services and Veterans Affairs.</p>
<p>Sessions, who has served in Congress for over two decades and was a former head of the NRCC, currently sits on two House committees.</p>
<p>“We’re gonna find out what people think,” Sessions said about whether Republicans would support his nomination.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON — Ohio Republican Jim Jordan is no longer the Republican nominee for speaker of the U.S. House.</p>
<p>Shortly after a failed floor vote Friday on Jordan’s bid, Republicans held a closed-door meeting where Jordan failed to garner enough votes from his fellow GOP lawmakers to stay in the race as their nominee.</p>
<p>“I told the (Republican) conference it was an honor to be their speaker designee,” Jordan said to reporters.</p>
<p>The floor vote was Jordan’s third attempt this week to win sufficient support from Republicans, who hold a slim majority in the House.</p>
<p>“We’ll have to go back to the drawing board,” former Speaker Kevin McCarthy told reporters.</p>
<p>Louisiana’s Steve Scalise said that Republicans will pick a new nominee and come back to their quandary on Monday.</p>
<p>North Carolina’s Patrick McHenry, who has been serving as speaker pro tempore, told reporters that the plan is to have a floor vote for speaker on Tuesday.</p>
<p>A candidate forum for a new speaker designee will be held Monday night at 6:30 p.m. Eastern. Republican Rep. Kevin Hern of Oklahoma told reporters shortly after Jordan’s rejection that he would run.</p>
<p>“I just voted for my good friend Jim Jordan to stay as our Speaker Designate, but the conference has determined that he will no longer hold that title. We just had two speaker designates go down. We must unify and do it fast. I’ve spoken to every member of the conference over the last few weeks. We need a different type of leader who has a proven track record of success, which is why I’m running for Speaker of the House,” Hern wrote on X Friday afternoon.</p>
<p>Rep. Austin Scott of Georgia, who briefly challenged but lost to Jordan in conference on Oct. 13, said he will enter the race again.</p>
<p>“If we are going to be the majority we need to act like the majority, and that means we have to do the right things the right way. I supported and voted for Rep. Jim Jordan to be the Speaker of the House. Now that he has withdrawn I am running again to be the Speaker of the House,” Scott wrote on X.</p>
<p>Rep. Jack Bergman, who had been mulling a bid, said Friday afternoon that his “hat is in the ring.”</p>
<p>“And I feel confident I can win the votes where others could not. I have no special interests to serve; I’m only in this to do what’s best for our Nation and to steady the ship for the 118th Congress,” he wrote on X.</p>
<p>Reports on X from news media indicated that Tom Emmer of Minnesota and Byron Donalds of Florida will also run.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON — Nebraska GOP Rep. Don Bacon said his wife slept with a gun for protection after she received threatening phone calls demanding that her husband support Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan’s bid for U.S. House speaker.</p>
<p>Bacon was among a handful of members who reported threats and the targeting of family members after opposing the conservative hardliner’s bid for the speaker’s gavel.</p>
<p>“I didn’t sleep well last night. I called her and I go, ‘How you doing?’ and she said, ‘I slept really good, I had a loaded gun,’” he said Thursday after leaving a Republican conference meeting.</p>
<p>“It was ugly phone calls,” said Bacon, a member of the House Armed Services Committee who <a href="https://bacon.house.gov/about/about-don.htm" target="_blank">served in the U.S. Air Force for nearly 30 years,</a> retiring as a Brigadier General.</p>
<p>Jordan, chair of the House Judiciary Committee, <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-stalled-again-after-rejecting-jim-jordan-speaker-second-time" target="_blank">failed twice to garner enough floor votes</a> to reach the gavel. Twenty opposed him Tuesday. By Wednesday that gap grew to 22.</p>
<p>Jordan and his allies employed an aggressive campaign over recent days that included Fox News personality Sean Hannity and conservative talk radio host Glenn Beck stumping for him on air and ridiculing critics.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Threats disclosed by members</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>As Republicans met Thursday behind closed doors in an attempt to recalibrate after 16 days without a speaker, several aired grievances about the Jordan camp’s tactics.</p>
<p>Virginia Rep. Jen Kiggans, who voted against Jordan on the second ballot after supporting him during the first floor vote, told reporters following the closed-door meeting that many lawmakers brought up the threats and intimidation.</p>
<p>“We all share the same conservative values and principles,” Kiggans said. “So to get those threats and to be intimidated by members of our own party was really frustrating, especially for people like me.”</p>
<p>https://twitter.com/RepJenKiggans/status/1714704984787370165</p>
<p>Iowa Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, <a href="https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/briefs/rep-mariannette-miller-meeks-says-she-received-death-threats-after-speaker-vote-against-jordan/" target="_blank">who voted for Jordan</a> on the first ballot but opposed him on the second ballot, said Wednesday in a <a href="https://millermeeks.house.gov/media/press-releases/miller-meeks-statement-speaker-vote-and-death-threats" target="_blank">written statement</a> that she’d received “credible death threats and a barrage of threatening calls.”</p>
<p>“One thing I cannot stomach, or support is a bully,” Miller-Meeks said.</p>
<p>“Someone who threatens another with bodily harm or tries to suppress differing opinions undermines opportunity for unity and regard for freedom of speech,” Miller-Meeks said. “I did not stand for bullies before I voted for Chairwoman Granger and when I voted for Speaker designee Jordan, and I will not bend to bullies now.” Rep. Kay Granger is the chair of the House Appropriations Committee.</p>
<p>Georgia Rep. Drew Ferguson, who<a href="https://georgiarecorder.com/brief/georgia-congressman-ferguson-flipped-support-for-house-speaker-citing-threats-from-jordan-allies/" target="_blank"> supported Jordan on the first floor vote but not the second, </a>said in a written statement that he had “genuine concerns about the threatening tactics and pressure campaigns Jordan and his allies were using to leverage members for their votes.”</p>
<p>“I discussed this directly with Jim, and planned to support him on the second ballot,” Ferguson wrote. “When the pressure campaigns and attacks on fellow members ramped up, it became clear to me that the House Republican Conference does not need a bully as the Speaker.”</p>
<p>After voting against Jordan on the floor on Wednesday, Ferguson wrote that he and his family “started receiving death threats.”</p>
<p>“That is simply unacceptable, unforgivable and will never be tolerated,” Ferguson added.</p>
<p>Idaho Rep. Mike Simpson, who opposed Jordan on both floor votes, wrote on X on Wednesday that “intimidation and threatening tactics do not — and will not — work.”</p>
<p>“Steve Scalise earned my vote for Speaker in the last two rounds,” Simpson wrote. “He has repeatedly proven his leadership as our conference’s Majority Leader, and I am honored to support him.”</p>
<p>Rep. Mario Díaz-Balart of Florida said the “nanosecond” that outside pressure tactics begin, “it’s over” for him.</p>
<p>“If you look at the folks that are getting these threats: Don Bacon, retired general of the United States Armed Forces, you know, I don’t know how anybody can think that folks like that can be pressured,” Díaz-Balart said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Jordan stays in the race</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Uncertainty loomed over the Republican conference Thursday.</p>
<p>GOP House members met privately for several hours to try to find a path forward from an essentially frozen lower chamber.</p>
<p>A short-lived proposal to temporarily expand the powers of Speaker Pro Tempore Patrick McHenry of North Carolina fizzled out by day’s end.</p>
<p>Jordan remained in the race, but when a next vote would occur remained unclear late Thursday.</p>
<p>Some members, including Jordan supporter Rep. Kat Cammack of Florida, said they think the next step for the conference is to “hash this out.”</p>
<p>“There has been encouragement from all sides of conference, every walk of life, every faction that is represented in there, that at the end of the day, if we can’t agree on anything, we can agree on one thing and that’s the 22 (who oppose Jordan) have to get in a room and talk to Jim,” she said.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. House rejected Ohio’s Jim Jordan as a candidate for speaker on Tuesday in the first round of voting, though the chamber was expected to potentially conduct additional votes on Jordan’s bid later in the day.</p>
<p>Jordan, co-founder of the far-right Freedom Caucus and one of the lawmakers who bolstered former President Donald Trump’s false claims about the 2020 election, was unable to clinch the votes needed to hold the gavel amid concerns about his agenda and frustrations with his history inside and outside of Congress. The House has now gone two weeks without a speaker.</p>
<p>Twenty Republicans, including Rep. Jen Kiggans of Virginia, as well as all Democrats, voted against Jordan on the first ballot.</p>
<p>​​Florida Rep. Gus Bilirakis was the only Republican who didn’t vote.</p>
<p>House Republican Conference Chair Elise Stefanik, of New York, said in her nomination speech that Jordan is a “patriot” who would “go after corruption and deliver accountability.”</p>
<p>“Jim is the voice of the American people who have felt voiceless for far too long,” Stefanik said. “Whether as Judiciary chair, conservative leader, or representative for his constituents in west central Ohio, whether on the wrestling mat or in the committee room, Jim Jordan is strategic, scrappy, tough and principled.”</p>
<p>House Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar, of California, nominated New York Rep. Hakeem Jeffries for speaker, saying he was the clear candidate for anyone who wanted a bipartisan path ahead.</p>
<p>“The choice before us is simple, come together on a bipartisan path forward, or take us over the cliff,” Aguilar said. “Abandon the extremism that is preventing us from getting things done, or triple down on division and dysfunction.</p>
<p>&#8220;A vote today to make the architect of a nationwide abortion ban, a vocal election denier and an insurrection insider to the speaker of this House would be a terrible message to the country and our allies,” Aguilar said.</p>
<p>There was no majority of the vote needed to elect a speaker, with Jeffries receiving 212 votes and Jordan receiving 200, while other lawmakers got some of the Republican votes.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">McCarthy ousted two weeks ago</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The stalemate comes two weeks after eight House Republicans and Democrats <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-votes-remove-kevin-mccarthy-speaker" target="_blank">voted to remove Kevin McCarthy as speaker </a>about nine months into his tenure.</p>
<p>McCarthy had to hold 15 separate votes in January before he was able to become speaker and only after making several agreements behind closed doors with far-right members of the party.</p>

<p>After McCarthy announced he wouldn’t try again to become speaker, Louisiana’s Steve Scalise and Jordan <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/louisianas-steve-scalise-and-ohios-jim-jordan-jump-race-us-house-speaker" target="_blank">announced their bids</a> for the role.</p>
<p>Scalise, currently the majority leader, <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/scalise-nominated-us-house-gop-speaker-closed-door-meeting" target="_blank">won the first secret ballot nomination vote</a> within the House Republican Conference. But he never scheduled a floor vote and <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/scalise-drops-out-race-us-house-speaker" target="_blank">withdrew from the race</a> after just one day.</p>
<p>Jordan had said after losing the first nomination vote that he would back Scalise on the floor, but several of his followers refused to back their party’s speaker nominee.</p>
<p>House Republicans huddled again Friday to take a second nomination vote for speaker, choosing between Jordan and Georgia’s Austin Scott.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/ohios-jordan-latest-us-house-gop-nominee-speaker-after-days-turmoil" target="_blank">Jordan won that nomination vote</a>, but another secret ballot taken afterward showed that more than 50 House Republicans said they wouldn’t support him during a floor vote.</p>
<p>That <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/jim-jordan-gains-support-vote-nears-us-house-speaker-outcome-still-doubt" target="_blank">gap dwindled over the weekend and throughout Monday </a>as several Republicans, who said they would never back Jordan during a floor vote, announced public support.</p>
<p>Several holdouts remained heading into Tuesday’s floor vote, leaving Jordan short of the roughly 217 votes he would need to become speaker.</p>
<p>Those holdouts maintained their opposition throughout the first ballot on Tuesday afternoon.</p>
<p>“I’m voting for a good, solid, conservative Republican. That’s the only kind of person I’ll vote for,” Rep. Carlos Giménez of Florida said immediately following the vote.</p>
<p>Rep. Dusty Johnson of South Dakota said he anticipated that Jordan might not have all the votes on the first ballot, but he said he remained hopeful that those GOP holdouts would flip.</p>
<p>“A lot of the people who are holding out are very reasonable people,” Johnson said. “It’s my assessment that when people stay at the table that a deal is possible.”</p>
<p>Rep. Lori Chavez-DeRemer of Oregon, who voted for McCarthy on the first ballot, said she did so because he was the closest Republican to secure the necessary 217 votes, but noted that she would “continue to reassess where things stand as this process plays out.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Attempt to expand McHenry powers</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Pennsylvania GOP Rep. Mike Kelly <a href="https://kelly.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/kelly.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/kellpa_030_xml.pdf" target="_blank">introduced a resolution</a> Monday night to elect Rep. Patrick McHenry as speaker pro tempore for up to 30 days. Approving that resolution would expand McHenry’s powers beyond what they are as the speaker pro tempore by designation, Kelly said.</p>
<p>Under the resolution, McHenry, a North Carolina Republican, would stay in the role until Nov. 17 — the same day government funding is set to expire — or until a new speaker is elected, whichever is first.</p>
<p>McHenry has been serving as the speaker pro tempore by McCarthy’s designation under a process put in place to ensure continuity of government following the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.</p>
<p>Chavez-DeRemer said she feared the chaos of the last few weeks would only continue under a Jordan speakership. With the Republican conference still bitterly divided, she said the chamber should empower McHenry.</p>
<p>“Until we can find clear consensus among the Republican Conference, it’s time to give expanded authority to Speaker Pro Tempore McHenry so the House can resume governing,” she <a href="https://twitter.com/RepLCD/status/1714327863694959013" target="_blank">wrote on X</a>, formerly Twitter.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. House Republicans elected Louisiana Rep. Steve Scalise as their nominee for speaker Wednesday following a secret ballot vote in a closed-door conference, according to Republicans leaving the meeting.</p>
<p>“We need to make sure we’re sending a message to people all throughout the world, and that the House is open and doing the people’s business,” Scalise told reporters after the meeting.</p>
<p>Scalise did not confirm whether he had all the votes from his party to take the gavel, but said “we’re gonna have to go upstairs on the House floor and resolve this and get the House reopened again.”</p>
<p>The next step for Scalise, who currently is the majority leader, will be garnering the support of nearly all his GOP colleagues to win a floor vote to become speaker, replacing former Speaker Kevin McCarthy of California.</p>
<p>The nominee picked in the conference meeting only needed to get the backing of a majority of the 221 House Republicans, but Scalise will need about 217 on the floor before he can hold the gavel.</p>
<p>When asked whether he would vote for Scalise, Rep. Scott Perry of Pennsylvania, chair of the far-right House Freedom Caucus, said, “We’re going to go figure it out. Vote’s pretty close.”</p>
<p>“We need to quit having this place run the way it’s run,” he added on how he could be convinced to support the Louisiana Republican.</p>
<p>Rep. Kevin Hern of Oklahoma told reporters as he left the meeting that he will run for House majority leader.</p>
<p>Republicans haven’t yet announced when a floor vote will take place. The House briefly came into session at 3 p.m. and then adjourned.</p>
<p>Reps. Frank Lucas of Oklahoma, Ashley Hinson of Iowa and John James of Michigan gave nominating speeches for Scalise. His path to the nomination was smoothed when Republicans tabled a proposal by Texas Republican Chip Roy to change the rules on how a nominee was selected.</p>
<p>The other candidate was Ohio’s Jim Jordan, chair of the House Judiciary Committee.</p>
<p>Reps. Kelly Armstrong of North Dakota, Erin Houchin of Indiana and Mike Carey of Ohio nominated Jordan.</p>
<p>Reps. Tim Burchett of Tennessee and Matt Gaetz of Florida who voted to oust McCarthy said they would support Scalise on the floor.</p>
<p>“Long live Speaker Scalise,” Gaetz, who filed the motion to vacate McCarthy, said.</p>
<p>The new speaker will have several crises to address as soon as the swearing-in is over.</p>
<p>The first task will likely be addressing the situation in Israel, which is under an ongoing attack from Hamas and possibly other organizations.</p>
<p>Scalise said if elected speaker, one of the first orders of business for the House is to pass a resolution showing the United States support for Israel.</p>
<p>Congress will need to approve supplemental funding <a href="https://kansasreflector.com/2023/10/10/biden-denounces-deadly-hamas-attack-on-israel-theres-no-justification-for-terrorism/" target="_blank">expected to be requested</a> by President Joe Biden, an issue that will garner strong bipartisan support. Biden has <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/biden-denounces-deadly-hamas-attack-israel-theres-no-justification-terrorism" target="_blank">said</a> he wants Congress to take “urgent action” on Israel’s security needs.</p>
<p>Scalise, if elected speaker, will need to work with the Democratic Senate to pass some type of government funding bill ahead of a Nov. 17 deadline. Additional aid to Ukraine could be attached to that package, or a bill carrying aid to Israel.</p>
<p>Scalise also would be tasked with fundraising, protecting centrist Republicans and wrangling far-right conservatives to support his agenda.</p>
<p>However, there are some GOP lawmakers who still plan to vote for Jordan on the House floor, such as Rep. Max Miller of Ohio.</p>
<p>He said he’d back Jordan “because he’s not in leadership.”</p>
<p>“Trust has been shattered in that room,” Miller said. “The only way, in my opinion, that you regain that trust is with a whole new set of people.”</p>
<p>Florida Rep. Kat Cammack said after the closed-door meeting she doesn’t believe Scalise will get the votes needed on the floor to become speaker.</p>
<p>“I think that what’s going to happen at three o’clock is going to be a continuation of the chaos that has plagued the House.”</p>

(Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)</p><div id="modal-ready">
<p>WASHINGTON — Dissident Republicans in the U.S. House voted with Democrats on Tuesday to oust Kevin McCarthy as speaker, a historic move that came just nine months after he secured the gavel following days of negotiating with the GOP’s right flank and 15 rounds of voting.</p>
<p>It wasn’t immediately clear after the vote how the House would proceed in the coming days, having entered uncharted territory. No speaker has <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/HMAN-104/pdf/HMAN-104-pg142.pdf" target="_blank">ever before been removed </a>by the House. North Carolina Rep. Patrick McHenry was named speaker pro tem until the election of a new speaker, and he sent the House into a recess.</p>
<p>The 216-210 vote on a motion to vacate, which Florida Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/florida-rep-matt-gaetz-files-motion-oust-mccarthy-us-house-speaker" target="_blank">filed</a> Monday evening, capped off months of growing dissent among a small group of House Republicans.</p>
<p>Republican Reps. Andy Biggs of Arizona, Ken Buck of Colorado, Tim Burchett of Tennessee, Eli Crane of Arizona, Gaetz, Bob Good of Virginia, Nancy Mace of South Carolina and Matt Rosendale of Montana voted to remove McCarthy.</p>
<p>They also <a href="https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2023518" target="_blank">voted against tabling the motion</a>, which took place just before the vote and would have stopped the process from moving forward.</p>
<p>&#8220;The American people need a speaker who will fight to keep the promises Republicans made to get the majority, not someone who cuts fiscally irresponsible deals that get more Democrat votes than Republican votes,&#8221; said Good in <a href="https://twitter.com/RepBobGood/status/1709288188261343327" target="_blank">a post on X Tuesday</a>.</p>
<p>Warren Davidson of Ohio, Cory Mills of Florida and Victoria Spartz of Indiana voted against tabling, but for keeping McCarthy as speaker.</p>
<p>All House Democrats present voted to declare the office of the speaker vacant.</p>
<p>Immediately after the House was declared in recess, Republicans crowded McCarthy for handshakes, hugs and pats on the back.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Only three motions to vacate in history</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>So far, there have only been three instances where a motion to vacate was filed, one in March 1910, one in July 2015 and the one this month.</p>
<p>McCarthy said before the vote that he was calling Gaetz’s bluff, though he appeared to accept he would be ousted as speaker.</p>
<p>“At the end of the day, if you throw a speaker out that has 99% of their conference, that kept the government open and paid the troops — I think we’re in a really bad place for how we’re going to run Congress,” McCarthy said.</p>
<p>The California Republican said he believed his support for passing a bipartisan short-term spending bill on Saturday, preventing a partial government shutdown, was the “right decision.”</p>
<p>“I stand by that decision and at the end of the day, if I have to lose my job over it, so be it,” McCarthy said. “I’ll continue to fight.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">McCarthy excoriated </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Gaetz and other hard-line conservatives have publicly rebuked McCarthy for not holding to a private deal he struck with them in January in order to secure the speakership.</p>
<p>The group of GOP lawmakers, some of whom are in the Freedom Caucus, have lamented McCarthy striking an agreement with President Joe Biden in May to avoid a default on the nation’s debt and for relying on Democratic votes to pass the short-term government spending bill.</p>
<p>Gaetz, speaking Monday on the floor, called on McCarthy to detail whether he had brokered a private deal with Biden to hold a vote on legislation that would provide additional aid to Ukraine in its fight against the Russian invasion. He also criticized McCarthy for reportedly adding border security to those talks.</p>

<p>“I get that a lot of folks might disagree with my perspectives on the border or Ukraine,” Gaetz said. “But could we at least agree that no matter how you feel about Ukraine or the Southern border, they each deserve the dignity of their own consideration and should not be rolled together.”</p>
<p>House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries released a “Dear Colleague” letter just before the vote announcing House Democrats would vote to vacate the chair.</p>
<p>“Given their unwillingness to break from MAGA extremism in an authentic and comprehensive manner, House Democratic leadership will vote yes on the pending Republican Motion to Vacate the Chair,” Jeffries wrote.</p>
<p>The group of Republican dissenters who voted to remove McCarthy represents a small fraction of the House Republican Conference, many of whom backed McCarthy on the floor Tuesday and defended his record.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">GOP supporters: ‘He did the right thing’</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>“He’s being punished because he did the right thing on Saturday and made sure that the government didn’t shut down, and we bought more time to continue the appropriations process,” GOP Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma told reporters.</p>
<p>Cole offered the motion to table on behalf of McCarthy.</p>
<p>Arkansas GOP Rep. Steve Womack told reporters before the vote the motion to vacate was a distraction and a “fool’s errand.”</p>
<p>Womack, who sits on the Appropriations Committee, said Republicans should focus on clearing all 12 appropriations bills before the new mid-November deadline.</p>
<p>“We just took the country to the brink of a shutdown for the purpose of what? Moving the rest of our appropriation bills,” Womack said. “We need to finish our work, and the only way to do that is to pass the rule and get these bills across the floor and move to the Senate in conference.”</p>
<p>Rep<strong>. </strong>Dusty Johnson of South Dakota told reporters Gaetz’s push for a motion to vacate showed there are “middle school grudges” against McCarthy.</p>
<p>“I think that Matt (Gaetz) is making a huge error,” Johnson said. “I think America is gonna be less well off because of his efforts. I think chaos has not served this country.”</p>

<p>Republican Rep. Stephanie Bice of Oklahoma told reporters she was skeptical of the motivations some have stated for removing McCarthy as speaker.</p>
<p>“This isn’t about the appropriations process, and don’t be fooled. (Gaetz) wants to talk about the fact that we should have been doing our (appropriations) work in August. Look, it didn’t happen. So now is the time, and instead of focusing on that for the next 43 days, we’re going to be focusing on this,” Bice said.</p>
<p>GOP Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania told reporters that Republicans should focus on clearing legislation to fully fund the government and work on getting aid to Ukraine.</p>
<p>“If we vacate the chair, the government will shut down, our credit rating will go down, interest rates will go up,” Fitzpatrick said. “Ukraine will be victimized and lose that war to Russia. That is what is at stake here.”</p>

	</strong></p>
<p>Democrats huddled behind closed doors for nearly 90 minutes Tuesday morning to plot a path forward and allow members to speak for up to one minute about the motion to vacate. Rounds of applause and some cheering could be heard from the hallway outside the meeting.</p>
<p>Democratic lawmakers said after the meeting that McCarthy hadn’t built trust.</p>
<p>New Hampshire Democratic Rep. Annie Kuster told reporters the party had “unity of purpose” ahead of the vote.</p>
<p>“What has happened that all of you have witnessed and the American people have witnessed is that the current speaker has chosen to cater to a very extreme element that, in my view, it’s sort of a post-truth world,” Kuster said. “I think you can see that within his own caucus, but you can certainly see it in the way he’s treated us and the American people.”</p>
<p>Congressional Progressive Caucus Chair Pramila Jayapal, a Washington state Democrat, told reporters that the House GOP could “wallow in their pigsty of incompetence and inability to govern.”</p>
<p>Jayapal said that Republican infighting about who their speaker should be was not an issue that Democrats felt the need to solve. She also noted that McCarthy has repeatedly broken trust with Democrats, making the party reluctant to help him keep the speakership.</p>
<p>“Nobody trusts Kevin McCarthy, and why should we? He has broken his commitment over and over again,” Jayapal said.</p>
<p>McCarthy, Jayapal said, has made a series of decisions that have eroded any support he would have had from Democrats. Those include his public comments following the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol by pro-Trump rioters, his decision to walk away from a spending agreement he and Biden brokered earlier this year and his decision to withhold bringing a bill to the floor that would provide additional aid to Ukraine.</p>

<p>“Kevin McCarthy stood on the House floor and said one thing and then talked to Donald Trump and immediately did something else,” Jayapal said. “He has supported the insurrectionist president that enabled January 6 to happen and tried to obstruct the peaceful transfer of power.”</p>
<p>Jeffries, a New York Democrat, told reporters before the vote the party would “continue to put people over politics and to fight to make life better for everyday Americans.”</p>
<p>“From the very beginning that has been our objective and it will continue to be our sole focus,” Jeffries said. “We encourage our Republican colleagues, who claim to be more traditional, to break from the extremists.”</p>

<p>Rep. Richard Neal, a Massachusetts Democrat, told reporters after the closed-door meeting there wasn’t “a lot of goodwill in that room for Kevin McCarthy.”</p>

<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Disputes over spending, Ukraine</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Just hours before a shutdown would have begun this weekend, Congress approved a short-term bill to fund the government until Nov. 17. The House passed the stopgap measure in a <a href="https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2023513?Page=2" target="_blank">335-91</a> vote, with 90 Republicans opposing it. Senators approved the bill <a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_votes/vote1181/vote_118_1_00247.htm#position" target="_blank">88-9</a>, with nine Republicans opposed.</p>
<p>The deal didn’t include additional funding for Ukraine, though Biden said Sunday that he and McCarthy <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/next-battle-congress-over-ukraine-aid-biden-presses-house-speaker-vote" target="_blank">agreed</a> to find the votes needed to pass a supplemental package with military assistance and humanitarian relief for the war-torn country as it resists further invasion by Russia.</p>
<p>The stopgap funding bill to avert a government shutdown was not the only time McCarthy worked with Democrats to avert financial calamity. In May the speaker <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/biden-mccarthy-say-they-have-brokered-debt-limit-deal-avert-us-default" target="_blank">brokered</a> a deal with Biden to raise the debt ceiling and keep the U.S. from defaulting on its loans.</p>
<p>The deal, signed into law as the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/3746?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%22fiscal+responsibility+act%22%7D&amp;s=1&amp;r=1" target="_blank">Fiscal Responsibility Act</a>, included agreed-upon spending levels for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1.</p>
<p>McCarthy has been <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/government-shutdown-nears-us-house-gop-fails-pass-one-month-spending-plan" target="_blank">unable to unify</a> his far-right members around the established spending levels during this year’s appropriations process, bringing the federal government within hours of a partial shutdown.</p>
<p>House lawmakers on the far-right of the spectrum have been browbeating McCarthy since before he took the gavel.</p>
<p>McCarthy’s path to the speakership in January took 15 ballots as more than a dozen far-right conservatives blocked him during a four-day stalemate.</p>
<p>The California Republican won on the 15th ballot after <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-gop-backs-mccarthy-speaker-after-tense-and-chaotic-late-night-session-25" target="_blank">several concessions</a> to the ultra-conservative wing of his party, including a change to the motion to vacate that will allow any one member to essentially call for a no-confidence vote on the speaker.</p>
<p>McCarthy also reserved spots on key committees for far-right members and entered a handshake deal with members of the House Freedom Caucus, promising to cut spending levels.</p>

(Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)</p><div id="modal-ready">
<p>WASHINGTON — A sweeping government shutdown appeared inevitable on Friday, with the U.S. Senate stuck in a procedural holding pattern on its bipartisan stopgap bill and divided U.S. House Republicans unable to pass their short-term spending bill.</p>
<p>Both chambers of Congress must approve and President Joe Biden must sign government funding legislation before midnight on Saturday, otherwise a funding lapse would begin on Oct. 1.</p>
<p>But mid-afternoon Friday, a month-long funding <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/BILLS-118hr5525ih/pdf/BILLS-118hr5525ih.pdf" target="_blank">bill</a> packed with steep spending cuts drafted by some of the more conservative members of the House GOP <a href="https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2023511?Page=2" target="_blank">failed</a> to pass, 198-232. Twenty-one Republican members opposed it. The measure would have had no future in the Democratic-controlled Senate.</p>
<p>House leaders following that vote announced they will be in session and voting on Saturday, though on what was not immediately clear ahead of a GOP conference meeting in the late afternoon.</p>
<p>The mood lagged in the U.S. Capitol on Friday, where workers and law enforcement chatted in the hallways and cafeterias about the prospect of working without pay.</p>

<p>More than 3.5 million federal employees <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/disaster-nears-millions-federal-workers-paychecks-would-be-hold-shutdown" target="_blank">would either work without pay or be furloughed</a> if the government shuts down. Federal employees would receive back pay after the shutdown ends, though that provision has not extended to federal contractors in the past.</p>
<p>U.S. troops, roughly 1.3 million people, <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/active-duty-military-would-work-without-pay-shutdown-white-house-warns" target="_blank">would be required to work without pay </a>until the shutdown ends.</p>
<p>A partial government shutdown wouldn’t have broad impacts on so-called mandatory spending programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, because those accounts are not predominantly funded through the annual appropriations process.</p>
<p>A shutdown would have varying effects on the dozens of departments and agencies that do rely on Congress to approve new spending bills each year.</p>
<p>Those include the departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Education, Energy, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, Interior, Justice, Labor, State, Transportation, Treasury and Veterans Affairs. Almost all services for veterans would continue, however.</p>
<p>Other activities were affected as well by the looming shutdown — former President Jimmy Carter’s 99th birthday party at the Carter Center in Atlanta was <a href="https://georgiarecorder.com/2023/09/29/with-shutdown-looming-celebration-for-jimmy-carters-99th-birthday-starts-early/" target="_blank">moved up </a>to Saturday instead of Sunday.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Border security and spending cuts</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>During debate on the failed GOP bill, Ohio Republican Rep. Jim Jordan said the legislation would fund the government, cut spending and “secure the border.” GOP lawmakers attached a border security bill they passed earlier this year to the short-term funding bill.</p>
<p>“Three simple, common sense things, but the most important of those three is … the border situation,” Jordan said.</p>
<p>Florida Democratic Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz said the stopgap spending bill would be a “gift basket to far-right extremists” that will “slingshot” the federal government into a shutdown.</p>
<p>“The gutting cuts in this bill do not continue current funding like we’ve historically done in continuing resolutions,” she said. “Instead, this so-called CR slashes cancer and Alzheimer’s research, defunds the police, undercuts allies like Israel and Ukraine.”</p>
<p>House Republicans’ stopgap spending bill would have cut funding below current levels, resulting in billions less available for federal departments and agencies. The departments of Defense, Homeland Security and Veterans Affairs would have been exempted from those cuts.</p>

<p>White House budget director Shalanda Young argued during a Friday briefing that Speaker Kevin McCarthy should stick to the spending deal <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/biden-mccarthy-say-they-have-brokered-debt-limit-deal-avert-us-default" target="_blank">he and the president brokered </a>in May.</p>
<p>“The speaker wanted to set toplines, we set them,” Young said.</p>
<p>Young criticized House Republicans for not agreeing to the Senate stopgap bill that would last through Nov. 17 to give lawmakers more time to come to an agreement to pass the 12 appropriations bills into law.</p>
<p>“This is not hard,” Young said. “It is not meant to come back and negotiate and redo things we just agreed to do three months ago. It is to keep the government open to give congressional negotiators more time on long-term bills.”</p>
<p>McCarthy, a California Republican, said during a press conference before the House vote that he would likely keep trying to pass a short-term funding bill ahead of the Oct. 1 deadline.</p>
<p>“You have watched me time and again — have you ever known me to quit after one time if it doesn’t succeed?” McCarthy said. “I don’t stop.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Senate working on stopgap</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The Senate <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-senate-moves-short-term-spending-bill-struggle-avoid-shutdown-days-away" target="_blank">released a broadly bipartisan stopgap spending bill</a> earlier this week and has since taken two procedural votes to advance the measure.</p>
<p>But that chamber’s rules don’t allow the Senate to vote on final passage before the Saturday midnight deadline without the consent of all 100 lawmakers.</p>
<p>Kentucky’s GOP Sen. Rand Paul has said he won’t allow a vote as long as the $6.1 billion in additional aid for Ukraine is in the legislation. But party leaders in the Senate aren’t seriously considering removing the Ukraine money.</p>
<p>And Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, the senior GOP senator from Kentucky, warned against forcing a government shutdown Thursday, saying it would be “an actively harmful proposition.”</p>
<p>“Instead of producing any meaningful policy outcomes, it would actually take the important progress being made on a number of key issues and drag it backward,” McConnell said.</p>
<p>Republican senators are trying to draft an amendment to the stopgap bill that would increase spending on border security and make policy changes, a move they hope would encourage House GOP leaders to put the bill on the floor.</p>
<p>Senate Minority Whip John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, said Friday that everything was still “up in the air,” but that he was “hopeful” senators would work out an agreement before the deadline.</p>
<p>“I still think there’s something that can get through here before the deadline tomorrow night,” Thune said. “What exactly it looks like, I think, is still not totally resolved.”</p>
<p>Indiana Republican Sen. Mike Braun said following a closed-door meeting Friday afternoon that “nothing’s really coming together” because there are “too many moving parts at this stage.”</p>

<p>It wasn’t clear if there would be enough GOP support for the bipartisan Senate CR to move past a procedural hurdle Saturday that requires at least 60 votes, Braun said.</p>
<p>“It looks like probably what’s going to have to happen is something with clarity is going to have to come out of the House,” Braun said. “And I don’t know what that would be, because there was a vote that just didn’t work.”</p>
<p>The stalemate, he said, is at the “worst point” since he’s been a senator.</p>
<p>Alabama Republican Sen. Katie Britt said senators want to make sure whatever they vote on is “compatible” with their House Republican colleagues.</p>
<p>“So we’ll see what they come up with in the morning. In the meantime, we’re going to continue to work on these measures,” Britt said. “We want to be prepared.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Veterans health, WIC, SNAP, parks</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Among agencies, the Department of Veterans Affairs would be largely exempt from the impacts since the VA is funded in advance, a rare exception to how Congress typically handles federal funding for so-called discretionary programs, which make up about one-third of annual federal spending.</p>
<p>The VA says that about 15,620 of its 450,000 employees would be furloughed during a shutdown and several of its programs would be put on hold, including the education call center or GI Bill hotline, career outreach and permanent headstone installations at veterans’ cemeteries.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/government-shutdown-wont-affect-health-care-or-most-benefits-veterans-va-says" target="_blank">Veterans would continue receiving</a> health care as well as education and pension benefits.</p>
<p>Almost 7 million people within the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, also called WIC, <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/food-benefits-low-income-families-risk-government-shutdown" target="_blank">could lose access to the program</a> during a partial government shutdown.</p>

<p>U.S. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said Monday that the “vast majority of WIC participants would see an immediate reduction and elimination of those benefits, which means the nutrition assistance that’s provided would not be available.”</p>
<p>Vilsack, a former Iowa governor, said that the USDA has a contingency fund for WIC, but that it would only last a day or two.</p>
<p>He added that another nutrition program, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly known as food stamps, has enough funding to last the month of October in the event of a government shutdown. There are about 40 million low-income people who rely on SNAP.</p>
<p>“Now, if the shutdown were to extend longer than that, there would be some serious consequences to SNAP,” Vilsack also said on Monday.</p>
<p>Vilsack added that amid a partial government shutdown, it will be <a href="https://wisconsinexaminer.com/2023/09/27/the-farm-bill-is-on-the-verge-of-expiring-congress-is-months-away-from-a-new-version/" target="_blank">nearly impossible for Congress to pass a new farm bill.</a> Every five years, lawmakers must write a sweeping farm bill to set policy and funding levels for farm, food, nutrition and conservation programs.</p>
<p>This year’s farm bill is set to expire Sept. 30, but lawmakers typically finish it by the end of the year. The 2018 farm bill was signed into law in December of that year.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/nearly-all-national-park-sites-close-during-government-shutdown" target="_blank">National Park officials would need to close off access</a> to most of the country’s 425 parks, recreation areas and national historic sites during a shutdown.</p>

<p>The IRS would continue processing certain payments, maintaining its computer networks and printing and designing tax forms for the upcoming year. However, some taxpayer services will <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/266/IRS-FY24LapsePlan.pdf" target="_blank">cease</a> during the non-filing season. Call sites that respond to taxpayer questions will be closed during a funding lapse.</p>
<p>Several sources of federal aid to states will also be affected, Tim Storey, the CEO of the National Conference of State Legislatures, said in a written statement Friday.</p>
<p>“A shutdown creates uncertainty for states and impedes access to vital federal programs,” Storey said. “While states may not feel the immediate effects, critical state services that receive federal funding such as (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families), disaster relief efforts, cybersecurity and child nutrition may be put in jeopardy if Congress does not come to an agreement quickly.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Road projects on track</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Most federal funding for highways and transit, including the daily reimbursements to state departments of transportation and transit agencies, will continue without interruption.</p>
<p>Those programs are funded through the Highway Trust Fund, not annual appropriations. The trust fund was reauthorized in the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law. The law also provided five years of advanced appropriations for highway and transit spending, meaning that the workers at the U.S. Department of Transportation who process those payments can remain at work with pay through a partial shutdown.</p>
<p>That means federal money for construction of roads, bridges and transit would continue to flow to state coffers.</p>
<p>“If it’s a highway or mass transit project everybody should be at work and fully funded and able to do all of the things on Oct. 2 that they were able to do on Sept. 29,” Jeff Davis, a senior fellow at the national transportation think tank Eno Center for Transportation, said on a Friday webinar.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Air turbulence ahead</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Air travel, meanwhile, could see disruptions.</p>
<p>Air traffic controllers, considered essential to protect life and safety, would be required to work without pay.</p>
<p>Federal employees were <a href="https://www.gsa.gov/system/files/2023_GSA_Payroll_Calendar-R1pdf.pdf" target="_blank">scheduled</a> to receive a regular paycheck Friday, before a potential partial shutdown. The first paycheck they miss would be Oct. 13, if the partial shutdown is still ongoing then.</p>
<p>If a funding lapse persists that long, the air traffic controllers could begin work slowdowns, leading to air travel delays and cancellations.</p>
<p>Air traffic controllers are forbidden by law from striking, but the last partial shutdown saw several <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/06/politics/ten-air-traffic-controllers-shutdown/index.html" target="_blank">call in sick</a> rather than work without pay.</p>
<figure id="attachment_35428" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Reagan_natl-scaled.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-35428" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Reagan_natl-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1707" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Reagan_natl-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Reagan_natl-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Reagan_natl-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Reagan_natl-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Reagan_natl-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Reagan_natl-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Reagan National Airport.

<p>“Imagine the pressure that a controller is already under every time they take their position at work,” Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said at a Sept. 27 news conference. “And then imagine the added stress of coming to that job from a household with a family that can no longer count on that paycheck.”</p>
<p>In addition to hurting morale in the short-term, a shutdown would ruin training programs for air traffic controllers, Buttigieg said.</p>
<p>“We would immediately have to stop training new air traffic controllers and furlough another 1,000 controllers who are already in the training pipeline,” he said. “The complexity of the hiring and training process means even a shutdown lasting a few days could mean we will not hit our staffing and hiring targets next year.”</p>
<p>Other employees that would be required to work during the partial government shutdown include those in the Transportation Security Administration under the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.</p>
<p>Of the nearly 61,000 TSA employees, the agency expects nearly 58,000 to continue security checks across the nation’s airports.</p>
<p>In addition to funding lapses for most federal programs, the authorization for the Federal Aviation Administration expires at midnight Saturday, meaning that the trust funds that operate outside the normal appropriations process could not fund operations as they do for highways.</p>
<p>Even a short-term funding bill without an FAA extension is in practice the same as not having a short-term bill, Davis said.</p>
<p>“The budget authority is not available because the underlying trust fund from which it’s drawn doesn’t exist at the moment,” he said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Parks to shutter</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Almost all National Park Service sites that they are physically able to block access to <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/nearly-all-national-park-sites-close-during-government-shutdown" target="_blank">would close</a>.</p>
<p>“At NPS sites across the country, gates will be locked, visitor centers will be closed, and thousands of park rangers will be furloughed,” the Interior Department, which oversees the NPS, <a href="https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/government-shutdown-will-close-americas-national-parks-impede-visitor-access" target="_blank">said Friday</a>.</p>
<p>States and nonprofit groups can work with the federal government to fund park operations. The governors of Arizona and Utah have said they will seek such agreements this year. But even those sites may see a disruption in access as agreements are finalized and funding is secured.</p>
<p>Mount Rushmore National Monument in South Dakota, for example, was closed for the first three days of the 16-day shutdown in 2013. After a blizzard, the park reopened for the last three days of the shutdown with the help of nonprofit donations and an agreement with South Dakota’s state government, Cheryl Schreier, the former Mount Rushmore superintendent, said in a Friday interview.</p>
<p>Park sites stayed open with a minimal workforce during the 2018-2019 shutdown. U.S. Senate Energy and Natural Resources ranking Republican John Barrasso of Wyoming called for the Interior Department to do the same this year and criticized the decision to close parks.</p>
<p>“The Biden administration has the ability to keep our nation’s parks open and accessible,” he said in a statement. “Instead, they’re deliberately trying to make a government shutdown as painful as possible for American families and visitors alike.”</p>
<figure id="attachment_34277" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG_8209-scaled.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-34277" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG_8209-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1707" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG_8209-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG_8209-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG_8209-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG_8209-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG_8209-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG_8209-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Hikers in Shenandoah National Park. (Sarah Vogelsong / Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p>But the Government Accountability Office said the decision to keep parks open during the shutdown <a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/b-330776.pdf" target="_blank">was illegal</a>. And park advocates have said remaining open without enough workers created problems.</p>
<p>Visitors to Mount Rushmore during the 2018-2019 shutdown “were very confused,” Schreier said. Trash and even human waste piled up as visitors couldn’t find open bathrooms.</p>
<p>Law enforcement officials, not visitor services employees, comprised most of the workforce.</p>
<p>“It makes it difficult when you don’t have, obviously, the adequate staff,” Schreier said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Historic, cultural sites to close</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Public tours of the U.S. Capitol will cease, as the Congressional Visitor Center would close down during a funding lapse. This includes tours of the complex’s storied dome.</p>
<p>U.S. Capitol Police will continue to report to work to secure the complex, but they will do so without pay.</p>
<p>“I’ve sent my membership updates to prepare for a shutdown if it happens, which it looks like it will,” said Gus Papathanasiou, chairman of the USCP Labor Committee. “I’m hoping a shutdown doesn’t happen because with the cost of living higher than ever, this shutdown will create an enormous hardship.”</p>
<p>Workers with the Architect of the Capitol, the office charged with maintaining the Capitol buildings and grounds, will continue to work in a limited capacity without pay.</p>
<p>USCP officers and Capitol maintenance staff will receive back pay upon the end of a shutdown.</p>
<p>The Smithsonian museums and the National Zoo will remain open until at least Oct. 7, even if a partial government shutdown is triggered this weekend, according to the institution’s contingency <a href="https://www.si.edu/sites/default/files/about/smithsonian-federal-lapse-plan.pdf" target="_blank">plan</a> released Thursday.</p>
<p>The institution, which employs nearly 4,000 across its several locations, will continue to use fund balances from prior years until they are exhausted.</p>
<p>Just over 1,100 Smithsonian workers will remain on the job during the shutdown to care for animals, continue lab experiments, maintain library archives and secure the facilities.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Student loan repayments</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Federal student loan repayment officially begins Oct. 1, and regardless of a shutdown, those payments are still due.</p>
<p>“Even if extreme House Republicans needlessly shut down the government, loan payments will continue to be due starting this month,” a spokesperson from the Department of Education said in a statement to States Newsroom.</p>
<p>The Biden administration did <a href="https://newhampshirebulletin.com/2023/08/28/heres-what-to-know-about-new-federal-policies-for-repaying-student-loans/" target="_blank">launch a one-year on-ramp program </a>where borrowers with federal student loans won’t be faulted for not repaying their loans. However, interest will still accrue.</p>
<p>Education Secretary Miguel Cardona, in a <a href="https://www2.ed.gov/about/shutdown/contingency-plan-2021.pdf" target="_blank">contingency plan</a>, said the department would furlough 90% of its staff. There are about 4,000 full-time and part-time employees.</p>
<p>Programs that would still run because they are mandatory include Pell Grants and Federal Direct Student Loans.</p>
<p>Some programs that would lapse include the development and awarding of grants. The Office for Civil Rights would pause its reviews and investigations and guidance and regulatory actions.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON — The White House is warning that a partial government shutdown would mean 1.3 million active-duty armed services members must keep working without receiving paychecks and hundreds of thousands of Pentagon employees would face furloughs.</p>
<p>According to September 2022 figures, numerous states are home to large numbers of troops who would work without pay until after the shutdown, including Virginia with 129,400; North Carolina with 95,900; Florida with 66,900; Georgia with 63,800; and Washington with 62,100.</p>
<p>“Nobody joins the military to get rich. You join because you love your country. You want to serve, and you’re willing to do it at some risk to yourself. But you have every expectation that the government is going to be able to pay a decent wage and take care of your family,” John Kirby, spokesperson for the Biden administration’s National Security Council, said on a call with reporters Tuesday.</p>
<p>“When (service members) don’t get their paychecks, electrical bills, water bills, rent, mortgage, grocery bills, all that stacks up to the great detriment of these young men and women,” he continued. “So in total, more than 1.3 million could actually face real financial hardship as they continue to show up to defend the rest of us.”</p>
<p>Service members would be paid retroactively upon the end of a shutdown, which could last hours, days or weeks.</p>
<p>Virginia Rep. Jen Kiggans, R-Virginia Beach, last week introduced <a href="https://www.militarytimes.com/news/pentagon-congress/2023/09/22/congress-eyes-protecting-military-pay-ahead-of-government-shutdown/" target="_blank">legislation that would ensure pay from service members</a>, including members of the Coast Guard, is uninterrupted.  However, neither chamber has taken action on the bill yet.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Government shutdown Saturday</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>House Speaker Kevin McCarthy has been unable to unify his party members on full-year government spending bills or even a short-term stopgap measure that would avoid a shutdown, which would occur Saturday night without action by Congress.</p>
<p>Far-right members of the conference want to further cut nondefense spending beyond an agreement that McCarthy reached with President Joe Biden, who signed it into <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/3746/summary/00" target="_blank">law</a>. Some also want to sever any Ukraine funding from a government funding deal.</p>
<p>The fiscal year ends Saturday, and McCarthy has only a slim margin of votes he can afford to lose. Additionally, any spending bills or short-term deals to avoid a funding lapse would need to be bipartisan enough to appeal to the Democrat-led Senate.</p>
<p>If no deal is reached before the year’s fiscal deadline, <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/09/21/a-disaster-nears-millions-of-federal-workers-paychecks-would-be-on-hold-in-a-shutdown/" target="_blank">other</a> parts under the Defense Department’s massive scope will be affected, the administration also warned.</p>
<p>Kirby said the Pentagon’s military recruitment programs as well as procurement and management of existing defense contracts will be disrupted if the department’s civilian employees are furloughed.</p>
<p>“All of this would prove disruptive to our national security and our efforts to address the critical needs of the American people. And again, the reason is these extreme House Republicans are basically turning their backs on a bipartisan budget deal that they worked out with the president, that two-thirds of them voted for just a few months ago,” he said.</p>
<p>The department’s civilian workforce totals 804,422, and roughly 430,000 could face furloughs, according to the Pentagon on Tuesday.</p>
<p>McCarthy’s office did not respond to a request for comment on the possibility of troops working without pay or Pentagon furloughs.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON — Health care representatives from across the United States are urging Congress to halt cuts to funding that helps hospitals care for uninsured or low-income patients who rely on Medicaid.</p>
<p>More than 250 hospitals and health systems appealed to House and Senate leadership in a <a href="https://essentialhospitals.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/AEH-member-sign-on-letter-DSH.pdf" target="_blank">letter</a> Thursday asking the lawmakers to avert or delay a forthcoming $8 billion cut to “America’s health care safety net.”</p>

<p>The reduction to the Medicaid <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF10422" target="_blank">disproportionate share hospital funding</a> is scheduled for Oct. 1, as mandated under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.</p>
<p>The deadline comes as Congress faces partisan <a href="https://kentuckylantern.com/2023/09/12/battles-over-spending-farm-bill-ukraine-and-yet-more-loom-over-a-divided-congress/" target="_blank">roadblocks</a> to fund the government and renew a number of expiring federal programs by the end of the fiscal year, or Sept. 30.</p>
<p>“Not only does Medicaid DSH ensure access to care for millions of people, it enables our hospitals to provide essential services to their communities, including top-level trauma, burn, and neonatal intensive care. The need for DSH funding is even greater now, as hospital expenses per patient have increased significantly since the pandemic,” read the letter sent by the advocacy organization America’s Essential Hospitals.</p>
<p>The fund compensates hospitals that treat a disproportionate number of uninsured patients or low-income patients whose government-provided Medicaid coverage pays a lower rate than private insurance or Medicare.</p>
<p>The ACA provision, written under the premise that rates of uninsured people would continue to decrease, requires $8 billion per year in cuts from 2024 to 2027.</p>
<p>Higher rates of insurance coverage “have not materialized,” Dr. Bruce Siegel, president and CEO of America’s Essential Hospitals, wrote in a statement accompanying the letter.</p>
<p>The offices of GOP House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and Democratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries did not respond to a request for comment on the letter.</p>
<p>The impending cuts have also been a concern for senators on both sides of the aisle. Over the last decade, Congress has stopped reductions to the fund that were required under the ACA.</p>
<p>In a bipartisan <a href="https://www.aging.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/medicaid_disproportionate_share_hospital_letter.pdf" target="_blank">letter</a> from August to Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, 20 senators wrote that “(c)uts of this magnitude could undermine the financial viability of hospitals, threatening access to care for the most vulnerable Americans.”</p>
<p>“It is essential that we continue to protect those who have come to rely on the services provided by Medicaid DSH hospitals. We ask you to act as soon as possible to address the Medicaid DSH cuts to ensure our nation’s hospitals can continue to care for every community,” the senators wrote in the Aug. 3 letter co-led by Bob Casey, a Pennsylvania Democrat, and James Lankford, a Republican from Oklahoma.</p>
<p>Neither Schumer’s nor McConnell’s office responded to requests for comment on either letter.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">New health coverage data</h4>

<p>According to Census Bureau <a href="https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2023/acs-health-insurance-coverage.html?utm_campaign=20230914msacos1ccstors&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery" target="_blank">data</a> released Thursday, uninsured rates <a href="https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2023/acs/acsbr-015.pdf" target="_blank">dropped</a> in 27 states in 2022 compared to 2021, with some changes attributed to increases in public insurance.</p>
<p>“For seven of the states with lower uninsured rates in 2022, the difference was driven by increased private coverage. For 10 states, the uninsured rate decrease was related to increased public coverage. In three particular states —Missouri, New York, and Virginia — the decline in the uninsured rate was a result of increases in public coverage that outweighed decreases in private coverage,” David Waddington, chief of the Social, Economic, and Housing Statistics Division at the Census Bureau, said in a press release.</p>
<p>Maine was the only state where the uninsured rate increased, up to 6.6% in 2022, from 5.7% in 2021.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON — Medicare can now negotiate lower prices for 10 common high-price drugs, cutting out-of-pocket costs for an estimated 9 million seniors and saving taxpayers billions, the Biden administration said Tuesday.</p>
<p>Medicare will begin this year to negotiate with the manufacturers of popular medications used to treat blood clots, diabetes, heart disease, rheumatoid arthritis, chronic kidney disease, psoriasis, blood cancers, Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis.</p>
<p>Enrollees will begin to see lower prices in 2026.</p>
<p>The prescription drug negotiations are a result of last year’s Inflation Reduction Act, a massive spending <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/5376" target="_blank">package</a> that contained measures to reduce prescription drug prices, subsidize climate change reduction technology and adjust the corporate tax rate.</p>
<p>“For far too long, Americans have paid more for prescription drugs than any major economy. And while the pharmaceutical industry makes record profits, millions of Americans are forced to choose between paying for medications they need to live or paying for food, rent, and other basic necessities. Those days are ending,” President Joe Biden said in <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/08/29/statement-from-president-joe-biden-on-historic-action-to-lower-prescription-drug-costs/" target="_blank">a statement</a> Tuesday.</p>
<p>About 9 million enrollees in Medicare’s Part D prescription drug coverage program spent $3.4 billion out of pocket in 2022 on the 10 drugs selected for negotiation, according to a <a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/reports/aspe-ira-drug-negotiation-fact-sheet" target="_blank">report</a> released Tuesday by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.</p>
<p>The 10 drugs are: Eliquis, Enbrel, Entresto, Farxiga, Imbruvica, Januvia, Jardiance, multiple Fiasp and NovoLog insulin products, Stelara and Xarelto.</p>
<p>Democrats hailed the announcement of the selected drugs. The party held majorities in both the House and Senate when Congress <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-democrats-send-sweeping-climate-health-and-tax-legislation-biden" target="_blank">passed</a> the Inflation Reduction Act along party lines in August 2022.</p>
<p>“For years politicians promised to take on the big drug companies and empower Medicare to negotiate lower drug prices for consumers. With the Inflation Reduction Act Democrats have delivered. Soon millions of Americans will see lower prices on some of the most expensive and widely used prescription drugs,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York said in a statement Tuesday.</p>
</div>
<p>We Work for Health, an advocacy and communications initiative <a href="https://www.720strategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/720-PhRMA-WeWorkForHealth.pdf" target="_blank">backed by the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America</a> (PhRMA) that maintains a coalition in Virginia, issued a statement criticizing the list as an &#8220;overstep&#8221; and warning the drug pricing provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act would prevent pharmaceutical companies from being able to reinvest profits in research and development of new medicines.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today&#8217;s announcement lacks critical details for the American patients and workers who will be directly harmed by this flawed, short-sighted policy,&#8221; wrote We Work for Health Executive Dan Leonard. &#8220;While there has been so much attention placed on the list of drugs, the reality is that a growing list of areas of unmet patient need will face even greater hurdles as a result of the flawed policies and implementation of the IRA.&#8221;</p>
<div id="modal-ready">
<p>Of the nearly 66 million Americans enrolled in Medicare, 52 million are enrolled in the Part D prescription drug coverage plan, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services <a href="https://data.cms.gov/tools/medicare-enrollment-dashboard" target="_blank">enrollment dashboard</a>.</p>
<p>The Inflation Reduction Act also made common adult vaccines, including shingles and TDAP, free for certain Medicare enrollees. Monthly insulin costs for Medicare enrollees were also reduced to $35 for Part D beneficiaries as part of the IRA, and beginning in 2025 annual out-of-pocket prescription drug costs will be capped at $2,000.</p>
<p>The law’s prescription drug provisions, including the government’s new ability to negotiate what it pays for certain drugs, is expected to reduce the federal deficit by $129 billion by 2031, according to a Congressional Budget Office <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/58850" target="_blank">analysis</a>.</p>
<p>The government will choose 15 additional Part D-covered drugs in 2025 to negotiate lower prices beginning in 2027. Several more Part D and Part B drugs will be phased in for negotiations through 2029.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON — A deadline for a year’s worth of backdated benefits is fast approaching for U.S. veterans suffering illnesses after exposure to open burn pits, Agent Orange and other toxins.</p>
<p>Nearly a year ago, President Joe Biden <a href="https://kansasreflector.com/2022/08/10/biden-signs-landmark-bill-aiding-veterans-exposed-to-burn-pits-overseas/" target="_blank">signed</a> the PACT Act, a law supporters describe as the largest expansion of veteran benefits in U.S. history. The law eases the path to expanded coverage, alleviating veterans from having to prove conditions like respiratory illness and cancer are a result of breathing toxic burn pit fumes or exposure to radiation or chemicals like tactical herbicides.</p>
<p>There is no deadline for qualifying veterans to file under the PACT Act, but former service members or their surviving family members have until Aug. 9 to claim benefits that date back to the law’s enactment in August 2022.</p>
<p>“The law helps us to provide generations of veterans and their survivors with the care and benefits that they certainly deserve and have earned,” Mike Walljasper, assistant Veteran Service Center manager at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, said Wednesday on a call with reporters hosted by the office of Rep. Joe Neguse, a Colorado Democrat.</p>
<p>As of mid-July, 371,716 veterans and 7,715 survivors had completed PACT Act-related claims. Just under 80% have been approved, according to the latest data from the VA.</p>
<p>Up to 3.5 million post-9/11 former service members could be <a href="https://www.va.gov/resources/the-pact-act-and-your-va-benefits/" target="_blank">eligible</a>, according to lawmakers and veterans organizations.</p>
<p>The PACT Act also <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R47542" target="_blank">expands</a> VA eligibility for those who served in the Persian Gulf War, served active duty at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina between 1953 and 1987, participated in chemical or biological warfare testing at the Deseret Test Center in Fort Douglas, Utah from 1962 to 1973, including Project 112 and “Project Shipboard Hazard and Defense,” participated in radiation-risk activities during active or inactive duty, or were exposed to a dioxin or a toxic substance found in herbicides or defoliants during the Vietnam era.</p>

<p>The VA has hired thousands of claims processors to support the <a href="https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/2022/11/26/thousands-of-veterans-deluge-va-with-claims-for-toxic-exposure-benefits-health-care/" target="_blank">effort</a>, Walljasper said.</p>
<p>The law presumes several disease and illness categories are related to service in qualifying locations or operations.</p>
<p>“That simply means that the veteran is not required to prove that active military service caused their condition that they’re trying to be service connected for,” Walljasper said. “Basically it takes a step away so that we can grant a benefit to that veteran.”</p>
<p>Some of the presumptive conditions “of note” for Vietnam-era veterans who were exposed to Agent Orange have included hypertension. For many Persian Gulf veterans, VA staff are seeing numerous claims for respiratory illnesses and cancer, Walljasper said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Lawmakers flag deadline</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Many lawmakers have issued statements, posted on social media and conducted other outreach to flag the Aug. 9 deadline for retroactive benefits.</p>
<p>“We passed the PACT Act last summer to finally give all generations of toxic-exposed veterans and their families the care and benefits they have earned. Now it’s critically important folks apply for that expanded support, and August 9th is a big deadline,” said Sen. Jon Tester, a Montana Democrat and original co-sponsor of the legislation.</p>
<p>Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, another original co-sponsor, held in-person info sessions through the spring and summer.</p>
<p>“Too many veterans who were exposed to toxins in the line of duty were not getting the benefits and treatment they earned,” the Nevada Democrat said in a statement Wednesday.</p>
<p>Sen. Jerry Moran, a Republican from Kansas and original backer of the bill, <a href="https://twitter.com/JerryMoran/status/1686792466081382400?s=20" target="_blank">posted</a> a deadline reminder late Wednesday on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter.</p>
<p>The legislation received broad bipartisan support in both chambers during the summer of 2022 but was held up for weeks at the tail end of the process after retiring Republican Sen. Pat Toomey, of Pennsylvania, rallied GOP colleagues to block a final procedural vote as a protest to funding language that had been in the bill all along.</p>
<p>The delay sparked a <a href="https://kansasreflector.com/2022/07/28/these-people-dont-care-u-s-senate-gop-stalls-bill-for-veterans-exposed-to-burn-pits/" target="_blank">days-long campout</a> on the Capitol steps by veterans, their families and comedian Jon Stewart, who took up the cause.</p>
<p>The $280 billion measure eventually <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/third-times-charm-us-senate-reverses-course-backs-aid-veterans-exposed-burn-pits" target="_blank">passed</a> the Senate in an 86-11 vote.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">How to find more information and apply</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Veterans who think they may be eligible should sign up to participate in a Toxic Exposure Screening, which the VA describes as a roughly 10-minute process.</p>
<p>Staff have conducted over 4 million screenings as of mid-July, and 1.7 million veterans identified at least one toxic exposure event, according to VA data.</p>
<p>“So many Virginia veterans are already benefiting from the PACT Act,” Sen. Tim Kaine, a Democrat from the commonwealth and original co-sponsor, said in a statement Wednesday. “I urge veterans who may have been exposed to toxins during their service to visit <a href="http://www.va.gov/PACT" target="_blank">www.va.gov/PACT</a> to see if they’re eligible under the PACT Act and apply by August 9, so they can get benefits backdated to when we passed the law last year.”</p>
<p>For veterans who do not yet have claims ready, they can submit an intent to file, which is “basically a placeholder” in line, Walljasper said.</p>
<p>Veterans can also call 1-800-MyVA411, or 1-800-698-2411, or find a <a href="https://www.va.gov/find-locations" target="_blank">walk-in location</a>.</p>
<p>The VA has published a <a href="https://www.va.gov/files/2023-02/Journey%20Map_Accessing%20VA%20Benefits%2C%20Services%20V2.28.2023%201530hrs_2.pdf" target="_blank">guide</a> to help veterans assess their eligibility for the expanded benefits.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON — Despite <a href="https://www.armed-services.senate.gov/hearings/to-receive-testimony-on-the-department-of-defense-budget-request-for-fiscal-year-2024-and-the-future-years-defense-program" target="_blank">warnings</a> from Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin that vacant top military positions affect readiness, Congress is heading into its August recess with hundreds of defense nominees on <a href="https://tennesseelookout.com/2023/06/19/swelling-crowd-of-top-military-nominees-blocked-from-u-s-senate-vote-by-tuberville/" target="_blank">hold</a> as Alabama Sen. Tommy Tuberville continues his protest against the Defense Department’s abortion leave policy.</p>
<p>As of Thursday, 301 military nominees had not yet reached the U.S. Senate floor for approval, normally a smooth and quick process for the upper chamber, which approves the nominees in large blocs.</p>
<p>Tuberville is blocking the nominations in response to a policy that supports service members’ travel for “non-covered reproductive health care.”  The administration instituted the directive after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade.</p>
<p>Roughly 80,000 female service members are stationed in areas where reproductive services, including elective abortions, are severely restricted or not available, according to a RAND <a href="https://www.rand.org/pubs/perspectives/PEA2227-1.html" target="_blank">analysis</a>.</p>
<p>When asked how he felt about going into recess leaving top military spots vacant, Tuberville told reporters: “On the whole it’s not my job to change this. (The Biden administration) changed this. Let’s vote on it on the floor, I mean it’s pretty simple.”</p>
<p>During a press conference last week, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said he would be open to Tuberville’s request for a standalone floor vote on the policy.</p>
<p>Tuberville maintains he has not received any direct communication from the majority leader.</p>
<p>He said he also hasn’t received communication from leadership about bringing the nominees for individual votes — a process that, if not shortened, could take months of floor time.</p>
<p>“They’re not concerned about it,” Tuberville said.</p>
<p>Schumer faces the issue of scarce floor time. To circumvent Tuberville’s hold the majority leader would need to bring nominees to the floor individually, which could all but halt the Senate.</p>
<p>At a Thursday night press conference as the Senate readied to leave the nation’s capital for a month, Schumer said Republican leadership is responsible for convincing Tuberville to release the holds.</p>
<p>“I think in August, pressure is going to mount on Tuberville, and I think the Republicans are feeling that heat,” Schumer said.</p>
<p>Multiple senators joined Committee on Senate Armed Services Chair Jack Reed of Rhode Island in a late-night Senate <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?529553-3/senate-session-part-3" target="_blank">session</a> Wednesday to speak out against the months long delay.</p>
<p>Biden <a href="https://kansasreflector.com/2023/07/22/tuberville-hold-on-military-nominees-is-not-only-wrong-it-is-dangerous-biden-says/" target="_blank">said</a> last week that Tuberville’s blockade is “not only wrong — it is dangerous.”</p>
<p>Schumer’s office did not respond Thursday to a States Newsroom inquiry on whether Schumer has directly reached out to Tuberville.</p>
<p>The Senate is scheduled to return to Washington after Labor Day.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. senators avoided a heated partisan split as they passed the massive annual defense policy package late Thursday —  in stark contrast to the GOP-led House version, in which far-right members <a href="https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/briefs/defense-bill-that-targets-abortion-access-trans-health-racial-equity-passes-u-s-house/" target="_blank">included</a> language to restrict abortion access and transgender care for service members.</p>
<p>Senators passed the National Defense Authorization <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/2226/text" target="_blank">Act</a> <a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_votes/vote1181/vote_118_1_00212.htm" target="_blank">86-11</a>, but lawmakers are expected to hit a rocky road as both chambers will now have to reconcile their respective versions. Congress has reliably <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF10516" target="_blank">enacted</a> the defense bill for over 60 years, but the deep partisan differences this year raise the prospect the legislation could falter.</p>
<p>Members in the upper chamber spent the week voting on just over a dozen standalone amendments to the roughly 1,100-page bill, as well as a bipartisan manager’s package of nearly 50 bipartisan measures.</p>
<p>“The NDAA is a prime example of how Congress can work together for the American people,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a Thursday night press conference. “We have a very divided country, a divided Congress, but nonetheless we were able to come together and pass a bill overwhelmingly on one of the most important issues facing America, the defense bill, and this is not alone.”</p>
<p>The House “ought to look to the bipartisan Senate as to how to get things done instead of just throwing out partisan bills that have no chance, no chance, of passing,” Schumer continued. Many of the policy riders in the House bill would not be accepted in the Democratic-led Senate.</p>
<p>The $886 billion authorization package does not directly allocate the funds to the Department of Defense. Rather, it sets out a guide for how they should be spent. Congressional appropriators are slowly working through a separate annual <a href="https://arkansasadvocate.com/2023/07/27/u-s-house-spending-bill-for-the-va-renews-fight-over-abortion-access-transgender-care/" target="_blank">process</a> to green-light all government funds through 12 spending bills.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Ukraine aid, radioactive waste, Pride flags</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Several amendments received broad backing, though senators rejected a rider from top Foreign Affairs Republican Jim Risch of Idaho and Senate Armed Services Ranking Member Roger Wicker of Mississippi to designate an inspector general to oversee Ukraine aid.</p>
<p>Amendments from Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming on investing in domestic uranium production and from Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey to reenact the firefighter cancer registry were among those voted into the final version with strong support from both sides of the aisle.</p>
<p>A proposal from Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri <a href="https://missouriindependent.com/2023/07/27/u-s-senate-oks-hawley-proposal-to-expand-coverage-for-atomic-bomb-related-illness-to-st-louis/" target="_blank">to compensate those suffering illnesses</a> from the government’s radioactive waste just made it over the 60-vote threshold to be added to the NDAA.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, senators rejected a bid from Republican Sen. Roger Marshall of Kansas aimed at restricting flags that can fly over military installations — a measure that made it into the GOP-led <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF10516" target="_blank">House military spending bill</a></p>
<p>Democrat Sen. Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, the first woman in Congress to come out as an openly LGBTQ person, spoke on the floor before the vote in opposition to Marshall’s offering, calling it a “thinly veiled” attempt to ban the Pride flag.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, a <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/07/26/u-s-senate-votes-to-curb-farmland-purchases-by-china-iran-north-korea-russia/" target="_blank">bipartisan measure</a> to ban China, Iran, North Korea and Russia from purchasing U.S. farmland, co-sponsored by GOP Sen. Mike Rounds of South Dakota and Democrat Jon Tester of Montana, received overwhelming support. An amendment to screen outbound private U.S. investment in those nations,  co-sponsored by Democratic Sen. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania and GOP Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, was also approved in a near unanimous vote Tuesday.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Alabama v. Colorado over Space Command</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Among the priorities negotiated into the final Senate version was Alabama U.S. Sen. Tommy Tuberville’s bid to tie the construction budget of the U.S. Air Force as well as the Air Force secretary’s travel account to a final decision on the <a href="https://coloradonewsline.com/briefs/senators-defense-secretary-space-command-colorado/" target="_blank">location</a> of U.S. Space Command.</p>
<p>The command center, which largely oversees the nation’s satellites, has been provisionally located in Colorado Springs, Colorado since 2019.</p>
<p>However, prior to leaving office former President Donald Trump announced the headquarters would move to Huntsville, Alabama.</p>
<p>Democratic Sens. Michael Bennet and John Hickenlooper of Colorado strongly opposed Tuberville’s language in the NDAA, but ultimately their amendment to strike it never came up for a vote.</p>
<p>“It’s unacceptable that Senator Tuberville continues to put politics above our military readiness and national security by holding critical funding hostage,” Bennet said in an emailed statement. “The Biden Administration must work swiftly to make a final basing decision for the U.S. Space Command headquarters based on our national security, not politics.”</p>
<p>The Pentagon referred all questions to the U.S. Air Force. The Air Force, as a general policy, does not comment on pending legislation, a spokesperson said.</p>
<p>“What we want to do is try to force the Air Force secretary to make a decision,” Tuberville said Thursday, speaking to reporters near the Senate subway. “No matter where it goes, we need to get Space Command going. I mean we’re three years into this and we’re not even closer than we were three years ago.”</p>
<p>Hickenlooper said he’s reached out to the Biden administration “only about 1,000 times” regarding the Space Command location decision, and while “they don’t hang up on me, and they listen very patiently,” he still hasn’t received a definitive answer.</p>
<p>The White House did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>“It’s all about our national security and that obviously I have a state self-interest in that it’s already in Colorado. But if it was already in New Hampshire, and for political purposes President Trump was moving it to Mississippi, I’d still be against it,” Hickenlooper told States Newsroom while walking from the floor to his office Thursday.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON — During an otherworldly hearing on Capitol Hill Wednesday, lawmakers and witnesses launched accusations that the Pentagon is stonewalling Congress and the public from information about unidentified anomalous phenomena, more often referred to as UFOs.</p>
<p>That includes a 2014 encounter when a “dark gray or black cube inside a clear sphere” traveled within 50 feet of two U.S. fighter jets off the coast of Virginia, according to witness testimony.</p>
<p>The enigma brought together both Democratic and Republican lawmakers on a GOP-led U.S. House Oversight and Accountability subcommittee in imploring high-ranking military and intelligence officials to clear the air on potential malevolent activity, clandestine military weapons development, or even the existence of extraterrestrial life.</p>
<p>“The lack of transparency regarding UAPs has fueled wild speculation and debate for decades eroding public trust in the very institutions that are meant to serve and protect them, as is evidenced by the large amount of people we have here,” said Wisconsin GOP Rep. Glenn Grothman, chair of the Subcommittee on National Security, the Border and Foreign Affairs.</p>
<p>“We must demand transparency from the Department of Defense, our intelligence community and our defense industry on the UAP work,” Grothman said in his opening statement.</p>
<p>The discovery in February of a Chinese surveillance balloon hovering over Montana days after it entered U.S. airspace above Alaska <a href="https://idahocapitalsun.com/2023/02/09/china-balloons-voyage-across-alaska-montana-and-u-s-enrages-members-of-u-s-senate-panel/" target="_blank">heightened</a> anxiety and attention about UAPs, traditionally referred to as unidentified flying objects. The balloon traversed the contiguous U.S. and was shot down by the U.S. military off the coast of South Carolina. China’s government denied the craft’s spying capabilities.</p>
<p>Lawmakers on the oversight panel displayed wide-ranging skepticism, raising conjecture and questions about possible involvement from defense contractors, cover-ups of crash sites and debris, and harassment and intimidation of both military and commercial pilots who report sightings.</p>
<p>“Pilots have reported encounters for years. Because of the stigma around reporting these incidents, we still don’t have a complete picture of actually what’s going on, particularly as our witnesses will testify on the civilian side,” subcommittee ranking member Robert Garcia of California said.</p>
<p>But Pentagon officials say they take the public interest in UAPs “seriously.”</p>
<p>“The Department is fully committed to openness and accountability to the American people, which it must balance with its obligation to protect sensitive information, sources, and methods. DoD also committed to timely and thorough reporting to Congress,” Sue Gough, Defense Department spokesperson, said in a written response to States Newsroom.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Unexplained encounters</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Retired U.S. Navy Cmdr. David Fravor recounted for the panel his high-profile story, now <a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/2165713/statement-by-the-department-of-defense-on-the-release-of-historical-navy-videos/" target="_blank">declassified</a>, of when he and other F-18 Super Hornet jet pilots in 2004 witnessed a white object in the shape of a “Tic Tac” mint or “propane tank” hovering over choppy whitewater off the Southern California coast on a clear, calm day.</p>
<p>As he and fellow pilots flew within a half mile of the object, “it rapidly accelerated and disappeared right in front of our aircraft. Our wingman, roughly 8,000 feet above us, also lost (sight of it). We immediately turned to investigate the whitewater only to find that it was also gone,” Fravor testified.</p>
<p>The crew soon got word from air controllers that the object had traveled 60 miles in less than a minute.</p>
<p>Crews watching the radar had detected objects in prior weeks descending “rapidly” from 80,000 feet to 20,000 feet and then hovering for hours before going straight back up, Fravor told the panel.</p>
<p>The object “was far superior in performance to my brand new F/A-18F and did not operate with any of the known aerodynamic principles that we expect for objects that fly in our atmosphere,” Fravor said in his testimony.</p>
<p>Beyond a debrief, Fravor said no further investigation of the incident occurred.</p>
<p>Ryan Graves, former U.S. Navy F-18 pilot and current executive director of Americans for Safe Aerospace, told the panel that UAP sightings became an “open secret” among aircrew stationed near Virginia Beach, Virginia.</p>
<p>After an upgrade to their radar system, service members began detecting tracks with infrared sensors, which they initially dismissed as software glitches until the pilots physically corroborated the objects, Graves testified.</p>
<p>A “pivotal incident” occurred in 2014 during an air combat training mission 10 miles off the coast of Virginia Beach, Graves said. That’s when pilots in Graves’ squadron saw a clear sphere with a gray cube inside hovering “motionless against the wind” at the GPS location and altitude where the training was to begin.</p>
<p>“The jets, only 100 feet apart, were forced to take evasive action. They terminated the mission immediately and returned to base. Our squadron submitted a safety report, but there was no official acknowledgement of the incident and no further mechanism to report the sightings,” Graves testified.</p>
<p>The 2022 National Defense Authorization Act required the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to begin submitting annual reports about UAPs to Congress. The initial <a href="https://www.dni.gov/index.php/newsroom/reports-publications/reports-publications-2023/item/2354-2022-annual-report-on-unidentified-aerial-phenomena" target="_blank">report</a> was published in January.</p>
<p>NASA <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/uap" target="_blank">announced</a> in June 2022 that the agency would begin studying UAPs from “a scientific perspective,” focusing on identifying current data and how best to collect data in the future.</p>
<p>The 2022 defense policy bill also triggered the Pentagon to <a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3100053/dod-announces-the-establishment-of-the-all-domain-anomaly-resolution-office/" target="_blank">establish</a> the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) in coordination with the ODNI to investigate UAP near military installations.</p>
<p>Gough says the Pentagon “welcomes the opportunity to speak with any former or current government employee or contractor who believes they have information relevant to the historical review.”</p>
<p>“These individuals are still obligated to protect classified information and may not disclose classified information to the media, the public, or anyone who does not have proper access to such information, including the appropriate clearance level and need-to-know. These lifelong obligations extend to a public congressional hearing,” Gough said.</p>
<p>“There is no impediment to AARO receiving all UAP-related information, past or present, regardless of level or origin of classification.  By law, AARO may receive all UAP-related information, at all levels of classification, regardless of whether the original classification authority for such information is within DoD or the Intelligence Community,” Gough continued.</p>
<p>Defense Department officials also maintain there is no evidence to support many theories discussed during the hearing.</p>
<p>In response to claims made during the hearing that secret defense contracts could be related to UAP investigations, or that service members have been injured while examining crash sites, Gough said the Pentagon “has not discovered any verifiable information to substantiate claims that any (government) programs regarding the possession or reverse-engineering of extraterrestrial materials have existed in the past or exist currently.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">House members flock to hearing</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The high-profile hearing attracted the participation of several House members who do not officially sit on the subcommittee.</p>
<p>Members waived onto the panel for the headline-grabbing event included GOP Reps. Tim Burchett and Andy Ogles of Tennessee, Anna Paulina Luna and Matt Gaetz of Florida, Eric Burlison of Missouri, and Democratic Reps. Jamie Raskin of Maryland and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York.</p>
<p>Republican 2024 presidential race candidate Vivek Ramaswamy released a statement Wednesday urging the panel to ask whether the government has evidence of extraterrestrial life, find and reveal the names of officials with first-hand knowledge of UAP crash sites, and probe whether private corporations are involved in UAP programs.</p>
<p>“This is an issue of government transparency. We can’t trust a government that does not trust its people,” said Burchett. “We’re not bringing little green men or flying saucers into the hearing. … We’re here to uncover the facts.”</p>
<p>Burchett <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6331679638112" target="_blank">told</a> Fox News Live on Sunday that he is “100%” certain the federal government is covering up information about unidentified objects.</p>
<p>Democrat Rep. Jared Moskowitz of Florida asked David Grusch, a former Department of Defense task force member, about the existence of satellite imagery of UAP.</p>
<p>“I personally reviewed both what we call overhead collection and from other strategic and tactical platforms that I could not even explain prosaically. I have a degree in physics by the way,” testified Grusch, a former National Reconnaissance Office representative on the Defense Department’s Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena Task Force.</p>
<p>“I’m aware that you guys have not seen these reports unfortunately, and I don’t know why,” he continued.</p>
<p>Lawmakers said they will continue to push the administration to improve transparency and reduce stigma for both military and commercial pilots who report sightings.</p>
<p>“It shouldn’t take the potential for nonhuman origin to bring us together,” Moskowitz said.</p>
<p>The White House did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>The Director of National Intelligence referred all inquiries to the Defense Department.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. senators approved bipartisan amendments to the annual defense policy bill Tuesday night that would prohibit China, Iran, North Korea and Russia from <a href="https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/2023/03/17/limits-on-foreign-ownership-of-u-s-farmland-gain-support-in-congress-despite-skepticism/" target="_blank">purchasing</a> U.S. farmland and screen American investment in high-tech ventures on foreign adversary soil.</p>
<p>By a 91-7 vote, the lawmakers approved a <a href="https://www.congress.gov/amendment/118th-congress/senate-amendment/813/text?s=2&amp;r=9&amp;q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22Mike%22%2C%22rounds%22%5D%7D" target="_blank">measure</a> that would require review of — and direct the president to halt or waive — agricultural land transactions by the four nations.</p>
<p>The amendment would empower the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States to evaluate the land deals. The <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/international/the-committee-on-foreign-investment-in-the-united-states-cfius" target="_blank">committee</a> already reviews other inbound investment transactions,</p>
<p>Of the 40 million acres of U.S. forest and farmland owned by foreign investors at the end of 2021, China accounted for 383,935 acres, or less than 1%, according to a U.S. Department of Agriculture <a href="https://www.fsa.usda.gov/Assets/USDA-FSA-Public/usdafiles/EPAS/PDF/2021_afida_annual_report_through_12_31_2021.pdf" target="_blank">report</a> on foreign land holdings.</p>
<p>The 2022 purchase of 300 acres by a Chinese-owned corn processing company near an Air Force base in North Dakota triggered concern among some lawmakers, as did the discovery in February of a Chinese surveillance <a href="https://kansasreflector.com/2023/02/03/chinese-surveillance-balloon-now-drifting-across-the-middle-of-the-u-s-pentagon-confirms/" target="_blank">balloon</a> hovering over Montana, home to many U.S. nuclear missiles.</p>
<p>The amendment was co-sponsored by Republican Sens. Mike Rounds of South Dakota, Steve Daines of Montana, John Kennedy of Louisiana, Joni Ernst of Iowa, Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming, Ted Cruz of Texas, Kevin Cramer and John Hoeven of North Dakota, Katie Britt of Alabama, and Democratic Sens. Jon Tester of Montana and Sherrod Brown of Ohio.</p>
<p>“In recent years, our country has seen firsthand attempts by our near peer competitors to acquire land adjacent to our military bases,” Rounds said on the Senate floor Tuesday.  “In 2020, a Chinese-led company planned to build a wind energy farm project near Del Rio, Texas, only miles away from Laughlin Air Force base, where U.S. pilots are trained.”</p>
<p>State lawmakers blocked the wind farm project in 2021, but recently <a href="https://apnews.com/article/texas-chinese-wind-farm-green-energy-6cd629303e8870e1942c170ebc52d7bc" target="_blank">gave</a> it a green light after a company from Spain backed it instead.</p>
<p>As of 2021, Canadian investors held the largest amount of forest and farmland, followed by the Netherlands, Italy, United Kingdom and Germany, according to the USDA.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Investment abroad</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Senators also voted 91-6 on an amendment to screen investment by U.S. companies in China, Iran, North Korea and Russia in high-tech sectors, including artificial intelligence, advanced semiconductors, satellite communications and quantum computing.</p>
<p>Democratic Sen. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania and GOP Sen. John Cornyn of Texas have been pushing legislation since 2021 that would monitor the offshoring of supply chains in industries and locations with national security implications.</p>
<p>The annual defense bill “tackles the toughest national security issues facing our nation,” Casey said on the Senate floor Tuesday. “And the technological competition with the People’s Republic of China is certainly at the top of that list.”</p>
<p>“Right now we’re in competition with a communist government that doesn’t play by the rules,” he continued in remarks before the vote. “The Chinese government employs economic espionage and it exploits the United States’ open research and innovation to build up its own capabilities.”</p>
<p>U.S. outbound investment totaled $6.58 trillion at the end of 2022, <a href="https://www.bea.gov/news/2023/direct-investment-country-and-industry-2022" target="_blank">according to</a> the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.</p>
<p>Most was concentrated in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Ireland and Canada. Just over $1 trillion landed in Latin America and the Western Hemisphere, while roughly $951 million went to Asia and the Pacific. The Middle East and Africa were near the bottom of the list with just over $80 million and $46 million, respectively.</p>
<p>The Casey-Cornyn amendment would require U.S. corporations and other entities to notify the secretary of the Treasury prior to a deal.</p>
<p>Unlike foreign investment that comes into the U.S., no federal mechanism screens the dollars American companies are investing outside the nation.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Defense bill</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The National Defense Authorization Act is the annual defense policy bill that continues defense policies, nuclear weapons programs and authorizes defense-related spending.</p>
<p>Lawmakers often use the <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF10516" target="_blank">massive bill</a> as a vehicle for various policy matters because Congress consistently enacts the legislation each year. After the Senate bill is passed, it will go to a conference committee with <a href="https://kansasreflector.com/2023/07/14/defense-bill-that-targets-abortion-access-trans-health-racial-equity-passes-u-s-house/" target="_blank">a House-passed bill</a> that targets abortion access, transgender health and racial equity.</p>
<p>The legislation does not appropriate money for the Department of Defense and other relevant federal agencies. Rather, the bill authorizes how the funds should be spent.</p>
<p>The 2022 NDAA authorized $768.2 billion.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WASHINGTON — A U.S. default on its debt would have a significantly broader impact on federal operations, financial markets and the global economy than recent government shutdowns that have left ordinary Americans largely untouched.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the two have been confused frequently during debate over the debt limit, the federal government has had considerable practice with partial government shutdowns during the past decade — unlike a default on the debt, which would be uncharted territory. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has warned default could come as soon as June 1 without an agreement between Congress and President Joe Biden.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Government shutdowns don’t hit payments for Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid, since Congress places those programs in the mandatory category that’s exempt from the annual government funding process and therefore predominantly exempt from funding lapses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A default would potentially reduce payments that keep millions of households afloat, as well as payments to states and providers for health care for elderly and low-income Americans. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Government shutdowns don’t affect the financial markets that much anymore, meaning Americans’ retirement accounts typically don’t start shrinking the longer a lapse in government operations extends. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Economists expect that would be much different in an unprecedented debt default. </span></p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Virginia has a lot at stake if the debt ceiling isn’t resolved&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/05/15/virginia-has-a-lot-at-stake-if-the-debt-ceiling-isnt-resolved/embed/#?secret=FdDUhyURJc#?secret=LAjhLrqfRD" data-secret="LAjhLrqfRD" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">William Galston, Ezra K. Zilkha chair and senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution, said partial government shutdowns and a default on the debt are “almost like mirror images of each other.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In the first case, there’s money available but no plan to authorize and appropriate expenditures of that money. That’s when the government shuts down,” explained Galston, who served as a top domestic official in the Clinton administration. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When you reach the debt limit, the government has already enacted programs — some of which are permanent programs, like Social Security and Medicare — but it no longer has the money to pay for them, because it can’t borrow what it needs to fill the gap between what it’s taking in and what it would have to put out,” he added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That even includes the military. The Pentagon is bracing for a series of “severe” and unknown consequences for troops and national security should lawmakers fail to address the debt ceiling, officials told States Newsroom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Because there is no precedent for a default, it is difficult to know the precise impacts on specific federal programs. But what’s clear is that, without the ability for the federal government to borrow funds, there is a very real potential that any government program or payment would be halted or severely delayed,” a Pentagon spokesperson said in an emailed statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Here are more of the specific ways a default could roll across America:</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Social Security</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the U.S. government defaults, payments to the estimated </span><a href="https://www.ssa.gov/news/press/factsheets/basicfact-alt.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">67 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> people who are relying on Social Security this year could be delayed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social Security is the </span><a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF11615" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">largest</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> government program in terms of how many Americans are affected by it, including retired workers and dependents, people with disabilities and surviving dependents of deceased workers who count on Social Security payments as a major source of income. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A temporary disruption in payments to those who depend on Social Security income to pay their own bills could result in “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">impacts that would ripple through the economy at-large,” </span><a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/default-would-have-a-catastrophic-impact-on-the-economy/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wrote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Jean Ross, a senior fellow for economic policy at the liberal-leaning Center for American Progress.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the end of 2022, roughly 48.6 million retired workers along with 2.7 million of their dependents relied on Social Security checks that averaged $1,825 a month, according to the Social Security Agency. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. </span><a href="https://www.ssa.gov/oact/STATS/table4a3.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">spent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> $1.2 trillion on Social Security benefits in 2022.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The short story here is that U.S. taxpayers owe people money because of legislation enacted in the past. We can talk about what kinds of recent legislation have pushed up federal borrowing means, but in fact some of this legislation was passed 90 years ago,” said Wendy Edelberg,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> director of The Hamilton Project and a senior fellow in economic studies at the liberal-leaning Brookings Institution, on a call Thursday with a group of economists.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We owe interest to those who have lent to the U.S. by purchasing Treasury securities. We owe (money to) doctors and hospitals who have treated Medicare and Medicaid patients, and millions of people are entitled to benefits,” said Edelberg.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Social Security Administration referred all questions about a possible default to the U.S. Treasury. Treasury did not respond to an inquiry for more information.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Veterans benefits</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Veterans Administration Press Secretary Terrence Hayes said he does not have a “blueprint for what happens to the VA” if lawmakers do not strike a deal in the coming days. The Treasury Department will soon exhaust all special accounting maneuvers it has been using since January when the U.S. hit its $31.4 trillion debt ceiling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Because there is no precedent for a default, it is difficult to know the precise impacts on specific federal programs. But what is clear is that, without the ability for the federal government to borrow funds, there is a very real potential that any government program or payment would be halted or severely delayed,” Hayes said in an emailed statement to States Newsroom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Treasury makes payments totaling $25 billion on behalf of the VA each month, according to the agency.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There are 4 million disabled veterans whose payments are scheduled for June 1, and those payments are now uncertain,” said Edelberg, citing recent estimates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A more detailed list of those payments, according to the VA’s figures, include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$12 billion per month in benefits payments to more than 7.1 million veterans and their families</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$4.8 billion per month in pay to more than 451,000 VA employees</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$2.6 billion per month to community providers caring for roughly 900,000 veterans per month</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$1.8 billion per month to medical and other contractors, on over 114,000 contracts</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$835 million per month in pharmacy costs, for roughly 57,000 monthly payments</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$3 billion per month for other costs, including to small and veteran-owned businesses</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hayes also said there is a risk that the VA’s vendors could decide “to reduce or completely cease providing goods and services to VA if payment was uncertain.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As President Biden has made clear, a default would be catastrophic for the American people and for our nation’s veterans,” he said.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Medicare and Medicaid</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Government payments to physicians, skilled nursing homes, hospitals and insurance companies could lag behind if lawmakers do not raise the U.S. borrowing limit so that the government can pay its bills on time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of September 2022, more than </span><a href="https://www.cms.gov/pillar/expand-access" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">65 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Americans were enrolled in Medicare, the federal program that pays for health care for Americans age 65 and up and certain younger people with disabilities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Medicare plans are categorized into four options — parts A, B, C and D — that range from inpatient hospital stay coverage to prescription drug benefits and various medical services in between. As of 2022, 49 million Americans relied on Medicare Part D for prescription drug coverage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Private practices, hospitals, and community health centers, many of which run on tight budgets and rely on timely payments for providing services, would be in the unprecedented situation of being unsure of whether they will be paid for providing care to patients covered by Medicaid and Medicare,” said Antoinette Kraus, spokesperson for the advocacy group Pennsylvania Health Access Network. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A default would create tremendous uncertainty for doctors and patients alike. Patients who are receiving treatment for a serious health condition or who require regular care for a disability or chronic condition could find themselves unable to get the care they need,” Kraus said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Low-income individuals, including children, disabled or pregnant persons and seniors, can receive health care coverage under Medicaid, a joint federal-state program that provides medical and long-term care.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of the more than 93 million Americans enrolled in some form of Medicaid, 46.2% were children, according to January </span><a href="https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/program-information/medicaid-and-chip-enrollment-data/report-highlights/index.html#:~:text=93%2C008%2C246%20individuals%20were%20enrolled%20in,individuals%20were%20enrolled%20in%20CHIP." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> released by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is very likely that federal Medicaid payments to states would, along with many other obligations of the federal government, be delayed,” said Kate McEvoy, head of the National Association of Medicaid Directors. “Default is a very different scenario from an impasse in settling the federal budget, in which case payments for Medicaid and other entitlements continue to be made.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most nursing home residents </span><a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF10343" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rely</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Medicaid and Medicare to cover their care, meaning a potential default is especially alarming to the industry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With the long term care industry already experiencing a historic workforce crisis and recovering from the pandemic, any disruption of lifeline reimbursements will result in devastating consequences for our nation’s most vulnerable individuals who need access to care. However, we remain optimistic that policymakers will come to a solution,” said a spokesperson for the American Health Care Association and National Center for Assisted Living, which identifies itself as the largest association in the U.S. representing long-term care facilities.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Federal employees</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During a partial government shutdown, exempt federal employees report to work without pay, while non-exempt federal workers are sent home without pay — a situation Congress remedies once they reach a funding agreement. The exempt employees keep the government functioning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">American Federation of Government Employees Public Policy Director Jacqueline Simon said a default on the debt that lasts long enough for federal employees to miss a paycheck would be a vastly different experience than what they’ve dealt with during past shutdowns. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The union, which represents 750,000 workers within the federal government and the District of Columbia’s local government, hasn’t sent any guidance to its members about what to do if they don’t get paid during a default. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is an unprecedented situation and operations will be in uncharted waters,” Simon said. “And there’s no way to make guidance based on law.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Public safety employees, Simon said, have worked without pay during past partial government shutdowns with a promise they’d get paid eventually when a bipartisan agreement was struck — something she expects they would do after a debt default is resolved. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In previous shutdowns, public safety employees have been called into work, expected to show up to work with the promise that they’d get paid eventually when the appropriations bills pass,” Simon said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I assume there’d be a similar kind of situation where you don’t even need appropriations bills to pass, you just need the default to end,” she said, later adding that because the United States has never defaulted, “nobody really knows.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Substance use prevention and recovery, mental health</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. is facing a staggering drug overdose epidemic, and many states and local governments rely on </span><a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R46426" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">federal grants</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for prevention and treatment efforts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drug overdose rates in the U.S. have risen fivefold in the past two decades, according to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db457.htm#:~:text=Drug%20overdose%20deaths%20have%20risen,increased%20from%2017.1%20to%2019.6." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> published in December. In 2021 </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the CDC </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/nchs_press_releases/2022/202205.htm" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tracked</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a record 107,622 overdose deaths — of which 71,238 were due to manmade, illegal fentanyl substances, an issue in the crosshairs of both Democrats and Republicans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Illicit fentanyl ending up in other drugs — for example, counterfeit prescription pills, cocaine and heroin — has been the target of </span><a href="https://www.dea.gov/onepill" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">federal agencies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the subject of multiple congressional hearings and </span><a href="https://idahocapitalsun.com/2023/01/26/u-s-house-gop-takes-aim-at-fake-pills-containing-deadly-fentanyl-sold-on-social-media/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">roundtables</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, or SAMHSA, administers two major grant programs: one for substance abuse prevention and treatment services, the other for mental health services. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The agency, housed under the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, </span><a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R46426" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">devoted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 65% of its $5.89 billion program budget in 2020 to treatment programs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facilities that receive federal dollars could be in limbo if the government defaults.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s a little hard to tell. I don’t know if the publicly funded facilities would stop accepting patients or if they would assume that it’s going to be paid at a later date. And, you know, it’s just so unclear and up in the air because this is such an unusual situation,” said Mark Dunn, director of public policy for the National Association of Addiction Treatment Providers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SAMHSA did not respond to requests for comment.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">National defense</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin </span><a href="https://www.appropriations.senate.gov/hearings/review-of-the-presidents-fiscal-year-2024-budget-request-for-the-department-of-defense" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">told</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Senate appropriators on May 11 that a potential default brings uncertainty for the over </span><a href="https://demographics.militaryonesource.mil/chapter-1-total-military-force" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">3.4 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> military personnel and the U.S. military’s global presence and commitments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There is substantial risk to our reputation,” Austin testified. “Again, we are viewed as being a source of stability globally. And we always pay our debts, and there’s just a number of things that we’re working with allies and partners on and that would come into question as to whether or not we’ll be able to execute programs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But most importantly, this will affect the livelihood of our troops and our civilians. We won’t be able to pay people like we should and, and I think that’s something that China and everybody else can exploit,” he continued.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">USDA food assistance</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One in four Americans, from infants to seniors, participate in one of the 15 food and nutrition assistance programs offered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of those programs offer monthly assistance, such as the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, referred to as WIC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the government defaults, monthly payments to more than </span><a href="https://fns-prod.azureedge.us/sites/default/files/resource-files/34SNAPmonthly-5.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">42.5 million Americans on </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">SNAP, and monthly payments to the more than 6 million families on WIC, could be delayed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The recent bill that House Republicans barely </span><a href="https://wisconsinexaminer.com/2023/04/26/u-s-house-gop-pushes-through-debt-ceiling-increase-coupled-with-massive-spending-cuts/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">passed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that would </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">temporarily raise the U.S. borrowing limit also tightened access to food and assistance for low-income Americans by </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">expediting the effective dates for safety net work requirements — from 2025 to 2024 for SNAP.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SNAP already has </span><a href="https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/work-requirements" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">two sets of work requirements.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another program that could be affected if there are delays in payments is the Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations, where each month USDA sends packed foods to about </span><a href="https://fns-prod.azureedge.us/sites/default/files/resource-files/fdpir-program-fact-sheet-2020-for%20website.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">84,000 individuals on Native American reservations.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A USDA spokesperson said in an email that the exact impact of certain federal programs can depend on uncertain factors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But what’s clear is that, without the ability for the federal government to borrow funds, there is a very real potential that any government program or payment would be halted or severely delayed,” the spokesperson said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">S</span><a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/chart-gallery/gallery/chart-detail/?chartId=104891#:~:text=The%20USDA%27s%20National%20School%20Lunch,schools%20and%20residential%20childcare%20institutions." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">chool lunches</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which USDA provides for more than 30 million children each day, could also be affected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other child nutrition programs that could get wrapped up in payment delays include the National School Lunch Program, School Breakfast Program, Child and Adult Care Food Program, Summer Food Service Program and the Special Milk Program.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lisa Davis, the senior vice president of the No Kid Hungry campaign at Share Our Strength, said in an email that a default would have a devastating impact on families and individuals who rely on food assistance programs such as SNAP. Share Our Strength is a national organization that aims to end child hunger and poverty in the U.S.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Not only is SNAP being used as a bargaining chip in these negotiations, but the people who benefit from this critical program will be some of the individuals hit hardest if a government default becomes reality,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Farmers could also run into problems if there are delays to any USDA payments, ranging from crop insurance payouts to new loans for expanding farming operations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">USDA </span><a href="https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2023/05/01/usda-providing-130-million-assistance-help-farmers-facing-financial" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in early May an additional $130 million in </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">automatic financial assistance for qualifying farm loan program borrowers who are facing financial risk. Those who qualify will receive automatic payments from the Farm Service Agency, but those funds could be delayed if the country were to default on its debt.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Homeland security</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the U.S. government were to default, it would mean the U.S. Department of Homeland Security would have to delay payments to various private contractors such as those that run </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Immigration and Customs Enforcement </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">detention facilities, and even delays in grants to nonprofits that provide aid and transportation to migrants seeking asylum.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It would also mean that the more than </span><a href="https://www.tsa.gov/news/press/factsheets/tsa-glance" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">50,000 </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transportation Security Administration</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> employee</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">s across more than 440 airports could have their paychecks delayed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to States Newsroom’s request for comment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Court proceedings before immigration judges would also be delayed. There is already a more than </span><a href="https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/us-immigration-backlogs-mounting-undermine-biden" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1.6 million backlog of cases</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Department of Justice, which handles immigration court proceedings, did not respond to States Newsroom’s request for comment.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Highways and transit</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Highway Trust Fund, which sends money from federal gas and diesel taxes to states for road and transit maintenance and construction, could also see a rare disruption in outlays.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On paper, the trust fund has a healthy balance — it was </span><a href="https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/highwaytrustfund/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$94.2 billion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the beginning of April.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But if Treasury doesn’t have the money to actually spend, that could mean payments from the trust fund would be delayed, said Jeff Davis, a transportation spending expert and senior fellow at the Eno Center for Transportation, a nonpartisan think tank.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After making debt service payments, there’s no clear indication what already-obligated spending would take priority, putting highway and transit funds on par with scores of other programs, Davis said, cautioning that his analysis was provisional because it was not backed by precedent or Treasury Department guidance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think they’re going to have to wait in line with everybody else,” Davis said of Highway Trust Fund payments if the debt limit is hit. “Just because there’s theoretically that much money in the trust fund doesn’t make a difference if there’s actually no dollars in the Treasury.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Conservation</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conservation advocates won a huge legislative victory in 2020 when Congress passed the Great American Outdoors Act that provided $900 million annually for the Land and Water Conservation Fund and removed the fund from the annual appropriations process by classifying it as mandatory spending.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prior to 2020, the fund, which is filled by fees on offshore oil and gas development and used to protect national parks and forests, wildlife refuges, coasts and other natural areas and provides matching grants for state and local recreation projects, was subject to periodic fights over its funding levels and — at times — its continued existence. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proponents considered the 2020 law approving the fund in perpetuity a once-in-a-generation victory. Montana Republican U.S. Sen. Steve Daines, a leading proponent of the measure, thanked then-President Donald Trump “for signing the most important piece of conservation legislation in over 50 years.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But a default could reintroduce the uncertainty proponents thought they’d erased with the 2020 law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A default would be an economic disaster across the board — even in ways we don’t know yet,” U.S. House Natural Resources ranking member Raúl Grijalva, an Arizona Democrat, said in a written statement. “The Treasury would likely have to make tough calls about extraordinary measures to redirect mandatory funds to pay our debt, so even widely beloved programs like the Land and Water Conservation Fund could be at-risk.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A spokeswoman for the U.S. Interior Department, which manages the fund, declined to comment on what would happen in a potential default.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We can’t speculate on unforeseen circumstances,” the spokeswoman, Melissa Schwartz, wrote in an email.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similarly, Daines spokeswoman Rachel Dumke declined to entertain the possibility of default.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Senator Daines does not see a default on the national debt as an option and he is calling on President Biden to make a deal with Speaker McCarthy as soon as possible to avoid a crisis,” she wrote in an email.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Housing assistance</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development said in an email that “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">without the ability for the federal government to borrow funds, there is a very real potential that any government program or payment would be halted or severely delayed.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">HUD handles rental assistance, housing vouchers, claims of unfair housing practices, obtaining affordable loans and public housing, among other things.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Some of HUD’s key agency programs and initiatives, which play a vital role for Americans across the country, could be halted or severely delayed … which would impact our nation’s most vulnerable communities,” the spokesperson said.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/hud_no_23_045" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the agency announced more than 2,400 grants totaling $5.6 billion in funding for 1,200 communities across the U.S. for community development, homeless assistance and affordable housing. Payments to those programs could be delayed if the government defaults.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WASHINGTON — As illicit fentanyl seizures reach record numbers, the Biden administration on Friday announced “government-wide efforts” to counter narcotics trafficking, including criminally charging members of the Sinaloa Cartel operating out of Mexico, and sanctioning Chinese producers of the chemicals used to make the synthetic drug.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Department of Justice unsealed indictments alleging fentanyl trafficking, weapons offenses, and money laundering against 28 defendants, including those at the highest levels of the notorious and violent cartel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-charges-against-sinaloa-cartel-s-global-operation" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">indictments</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> allege that its members reaped hundreds of millions of dollars in profits “by flooding the United States with fentanyl.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seven of the defendants are in custody pending extradition proceedings. U.S. law enforcement will work with counterparts in Mexico to “expeditiously extradite” the other defendants, a senior administration official said said on background Friday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control concurrently issued sanctions against two China-based entities — Wuhan Shuokang Biological Technology Co., Ltd, owned by Yao Huatao, and Suzhou Xiaoli Pharmatech Co., Ltd — for the sale of precursor chemicals to cartel members in Mexico for the production of illicit fentanyl “intended for U.S. markets,” according to the department.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Huatao was indicted by the Justice Department earlier this month on conspiracy charges, including money laundering and fentanyl trafficking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Treasury’s OFAC also sanctioned five individuals from China and Central America, including a Guatemala-based precursor chemical broker working on behalf of cartel members in Mexico.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These efforts demonstrate the U.S. government&#8217;s commitment to dismantling this deadly criminal enterprise, and every level, from those who willingly ship illicit precursor chemicals from overseas to those who traffic pills right into our homeland killing tens of thousands of Americans every year,” a White House senior administration official told reporters on background Friday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, the Department of State added several individuals, including those who were indicted and sanctioned Friday, to its Narcotics Rewards Program that offers up to $25 million in exchange for information leading to arrests and convictions of drug traffickers.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Politics of fentanyl</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The issue of illicit fentanyl crossing the southwest border into the United States is a talking point for both Republicans and Democrats whose constituents have been affected by staggering overdose deaths.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The GOP-led U.S. House has so far this year led numerous </span><a href="https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2023/01/26/u-s-house-gop-takes-aim-at-fake-pills-containing-deadly-fentanyl-sold-on-social-media/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">roundtables</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://kansasreflector.com/2023/02/15/funding-needed-to-curb-fentanyl-smuggling-at-ports-of-entry-administration-officials-say/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hearings</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> around combating the deadly drug, often conflating the drug overdose crisis with immigration concerns.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Illicit fentanyl seizures by U.S. law enforcement are up 400% in 2023 over 2019 numbers, according to Customs and Border Patrol. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To date this year, more illegal fentanyl has been seized by agents than all of the synthetic drug seized last year, according to a senior administration official Friday — though those numbers are not yet reflected on the CPB’s drug seizure </span><a href="https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/drug-seizure-statistics" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">dashboard</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

Morgan Griffith of Virginia, and Bob Latta of Ohio.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill aims to permanently classify fentanyl-related analogs as Class I substances under the Controlled Substances Act.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this year, a bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers, including Democratic Reps. Joe Neguse of Colorado and Madeleine Dean of Pennsylvania, launched the </span><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/fentanyl-prevention-focus-new-congressional-caucus-co-chaired-colorados-neguse" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fentanyl Prevention Caucus.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his 2023 State of the Union address, President Joe Biden called for the purchase of  advanced detection machines to inspect cargo and packages, including those arriving through private couriers like FedEx.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While illicit fentanyl arrives to the U.S. over land borders, it also comes via the coasts and U.S. mail.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden has requested $46 billion for next year’s drug control programs, roughly $2 billion over the current amount, according to the White House.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Staggering overdose deaths</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drug overdose deaths have skyrocketed in the U.S., increasing fivefold in the last two decades, according to a</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db457.htm#:~:text=Drug%20overdose%20deaths%20have%20risen,increased%20from%2017.1%20to%2019.6." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> published in late 2022.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of the record-setting 107,622 overdose deaths tracked by the CDC in 2021, 71,238 of them were attributed to manmade, illegal fentanyl substances.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The synthetic opioid is 50 times stronger than heroin and 100 times stronger than morphine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because of its potency and cost-effectiveness for illegal drug producers, the synthetic opioid — that can be both liquid and powder form — is often found in other types of drugs, including heroin, cocaine and fake prescription pills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency — through its “One Pill Can Kill” </span><a href="https://www.dea.gov/onepill" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">campaign</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — warns that six out of every 10 fentanyl-laced fake prescription pills contain a lethal dose of the synthetic opioid.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though they are both synthetic opioids, pharmaceutical fentanyl differs from illicit fentanyl in that it is prescribed by medical practitioners for pain management — for example, following surgery or for advanced-stage cancers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fentanyl that is made at facilities and distributed through illegal drug markets is considered illicit.</span></p>

(Bryan Dozier / Special to The Christian Science Monitor)</p><div id="modal-ready">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WASHINGTON — The </span><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/silicon-valley-bank-biggest-us-lender-fail-2008-financial-crisis" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recent bank failures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that shocked the markets and caused a speedy government bailout were “basic prudential regulation failure” by management, U.S. Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia said Monday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Democratic senator, who sits on the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, told reporters he stands by his position that 2018 banking regulation rollbacks that he supported were not solely to blame and that he finds it “unconvincing” that a stress test would have spotted a run on the California-based Silicon Valley Bank that happened in a matter of hours.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Congress repealed a portion of the Dodd-Frank Act in 2018 that as a result exempted midsize banks from certain stress tests. Several of Warner’s Senate Democratic colleagues have called for those protections to be restored.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was $42 billion in six hours, frankly started by some irresponsible (venture capitalists), crying the equivalent of fire in a crowded theater Wednesday night and Thursday morning. Not sure that&#8217;s illegal, but it sure is immoral,” Warner said. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And you know when you suddenly have a run on the bank — that would by the time Thursday come around (amount to) basically 25 cents on a $1 for every dollar in the bank — I&#8217;m not sure how that is stopped.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Federal regulators seized the Santa Clara-based bank on Friday, March 10, quickly followed by a state takeover of Signature Bank of New York, which was already under scrutiny for its role in cryptocurrency banking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve officials took the extraordinary step of guaranteeing depositors their funds, even above the federally insured limit of $250,000.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">President Joe Biden, </span><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/biden-says-us-bank-deposits-are-safe-despite-tumult-over-california-bank-collapse" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in remarks last week</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, called for bank managers to be “fired.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Warner said he wants to see the president’s specific proposal but said he supports “clawback” provisions by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which is tasked with buoying confidence in the U.S. financial system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The senator has joined other Senate Democrats in supporting a measure that would recoup profits and bonuses from bank executives within a 60-day window of a bank’s failure. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several large U.S. banks on Thursday joined together to give a $30 billion cash infusion to the First Republic Bank, a San Francisco-based midsize lender that saw its stock plummet following the collapse of SVB.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Warner expressed concern about a runoff of deposits going from midsize to larger U.S. banks, as in the case of First Republic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I was kind of nervous over the weekend, I had calls with a bunch of folks. You know, this week could still be choppy with some of these midsize banks,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, as midsize banks reportedly press the FDIC to insure all deposits above $250,000 for the next two years, Warner said he’s “open to that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t want to rush because to take that leap is a big leap,” he said. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Intelligence, TikTok and China</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Warner, chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, hammered on threats posed by the popular Chinese-owned video app TikTok, citing his concern over user data that could be harvested by the Chinese Communist Party and the risks of the CCP spreading propaganda via the app, including messaging about Taiwan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The senator introduced the RESTRICT Act last week along with South Dakota Republican Sen. John Thune. The bill aims to empower the Commerce secretary to limit transactions involving communications and technology companies entirely or partially run by foreign adversaries, including China — possibly setting the stage for a TikTok ban.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far the bipartisan bill has attracted 18 co-sponsors, evenly split from each side of the aisle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think our key here, though, is to put in place a rules-based approach, not just for TikTok, but for technologies that threaten national security that come from China, Russia, Iran, North Korea, and Cuba and Venezuela,” Warner said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Warner also called on the intelligence community to “lean as forward as possible” in declassifying information about tech companies operated by foreign adversaries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When pressed on potential as opposed to the proven spying capabilities or harm of TikTok, Warner defended his argument to crack down on the app.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The potential of whether it&#8217;s 100 (million) or 150 million young Americans’ data being collected for years, do we really want to wait to see the potential of that exploitation before we say ‘Oh my gosh, there could be harm?’” he said. “I think that potential is of great enough harm and that we need to act.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Warner spoke to reporters at the Monitor Breakfast series, an event hosted by the Christian Science Monitor that brings together lawmakers, newsmakers and journalists.</span></p>

Silicon Valley Bank was shut down on Friday morning by California regulators and was put in control of the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Prior to being shut down by regulators, shares of SVB were halted Friday morning after falling more than 60% in premarket trading following a 60% declined on Thursday when the bank sold off a portfolio of US Treasuries and $1.75 billion in shares to cover  declining customer deposits.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden reassured Americans early Monday that their money is safe in U.S. banks after a tumultuous weekend following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and a move by regulators to shut down a second lender.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Americans “should feel confident that their deposits will be there, if and when they need them,” Biden said during short remarks from the White House.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department took what is being described as an extraordinary step Sunday night, ensuring that depositors of the California-based SVB and Signature Bank of New York would be able to access their money by Monday morning, even above the federally insured limit of $250,000.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Treasury Secretary (Janet) Yellen and a team of banking regulators have taken action, immediate action, and here are the highlights,” Biden said. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“First, all customers who had deposits in these banks can rest assured they will be protected and they&#8217;ll have access to their money as of today. That includes small businesses across the country that bank there and need to make payroll, pay their bills and stay open for business.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No losses, and this is an important point, no losses will be borne by the taxpayers,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rather, deposits will be covered by an insurance pool that banks regularly contribute to, according to a joint decision Sunday by the Fed, Treasury and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the agency tasked with buoying confidence in the U.S. financial system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The agencies further announced that shareholders and “certain unsecured debtholders” would not be protected and would be held responsible for losses, as required by law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden reiterated the point Monday as he listed steps being taken by the government to avoid a further run on banks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Second, the management of these banks will be fired,” he said. “If the bank is taken over by FDIC, the people running the bank should not work there anymore. Third, investors in the banks will not be protected. They knowingly took a risk and when the risk didn&#8217;t pay off, investors lose their money. That&#8217;s how capitalism works.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The administration will seek a “full accounting” of what led to SVB’s investors and depositors withdrawing what totaled to $42 billion Thursday, Biden said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By Friday, federal regulators had seized the bank, causing the second-largest bank failure in U.S. history. The bank, the nation’s 16th largest, is headquartered in Santa Clara, California, and is known for its role in the tech boom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Sunday, the U.S. financial agencies announced that state regulators had shut down Signature Bank, which operates in New York, Connecticut, California, Nevada and North Carolina.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Signature had already been under the scrutiny of regulators for its rocky role in cryptocurrency banking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The weekend upheaval stoked fears, as the banks were the largest to fail since the 2008 financial crisis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden urged Americans to consider the “broader context” — a strong job market and low unemployment numbers — and said he will push Congress to enact regulations that were reversed during the Trump administration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“During the Obama Biden administration, we put in place tough requirements on banks, like Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, including the Dodd-Frank law, to make sure that the crisis we saw in 2008 would not happen again,” Biden said. But he said those rules were rolled back by the Trump administration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;m going to ask Congress and the banking regulators to strengthen the rules for banks to make it less likely this kind of bank failure would happen again,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a joint statement Sunday, Democrats’ top Banking Committee lawmakers issued a joint statement praising the administration’s actions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As we work to better understand all of the factors that contributed to the events of the last several days and how to strengthen guardrails for the largest banks, we urge financial regulators to ensure the banking system remains stable, strong and resilient, and depositors’ money is safe. Americans should continue to be confident in their preferred financial institutions in their communities,” said Senate Banking Committee Chair Sherrod Brown, of Ohio, and the ranking member of the House Financial Services Committee, Maxine Waters, of California. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brown, long a proponent of regulating the crypto market, expressed concern Thursday after Silvergate, a main lender to digital asset companies, announced it would be liquidating its operations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In January, the Ohio lawmaker sent a </span><a href="https://www.banking.senate.gov/newsroom/majority/brown-van-hollen-regulators-taxpayers-wall-streets-failures" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">letter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to U.S. banking regulators warning that taxpayers could be on the hook if another financial collapse, similar to the 2008 crisis, were to occur.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We cannot allow the banking system to lose public confidence again,” he wrote. “It is the responsibility of the financial institution and its investors, not taxpayers, for preventing a bank failure and absorbing losses that may occur during such a failure.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden began his State of the Union address Tuesday — his first to a divided Congress — with an appeal to bipartisan priorities, but later criticized parts of the GOP agenda and got a sense of Republicans’ appetite for conflict during one combative stretch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden opened the 72-minute speech with an olive branch to congressional Republicans, listing several items he’d worked with the party on over the past two years. He highlighted laws passed to spend $1.2 trillion on infrastructure, boost semiconductor manufacturing and make electoral reforms. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also called for congressional Republicans to work with Democrats and his administration for the next two years. Expanding access to opioid-related addiction treatment and strengthening the fight against </span><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/biden-state-union-speech-call-bipartisan-action-fentanyl-crisis" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fentanyl trafficking</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as well as blocking overcharges on items like resort and airline fees, should be bipartisan priorities, he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“To my Republican friends, if we could work together in the last Congress, there is no reason we can’t work together in this new Congress,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Biden also commended Democratic laws that passed without Republican support and pledged to veto several policies favored by some Republicans, including a nationwide abortion ban and the repeal of a bill that caps the price of insulin for Medicare recipients. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And he called for legislation Republicans may be unlikely to support, including a bill to protect LGBTQ Americans under the 1964 Civil Rights Act.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Let’s also pass the bipartisan Equality Act to ensure LGBTQ Americans, especially transgender young people, can live with safety and dignity,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the aftermath of the death of Tyre Nichols, a 29-year-old Black man, at the hands of Memphis, Tennessee, police, Biden proposed a renewed focus on police reforms. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden in discussing debt limit negotiations blasted GOP members’ willingness to allow the U.S. to default on its debt to force spending cuts and a proposal to force a vote to reauthorize Social Security and Medicare every five years — inciting cries of outrage from many Republicans present, most prominently Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You lie! Liar!” shouted Greene, as many GOP lawmakers booed and yelled “No!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GOP U.S. Sens. Rick Scott of Florida and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin have endorsed requiring periodic votes to continue Social Security and Medicare. Biden didn’t mention the senators by name Tuesday, and acknowledged that they were perhaps a minority of their party. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But some Republicans in the U.S. House chamber Tuesday booed at the perceived attack, prompting Biden to declare the programs safe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well, I&#8217;m glad to see it,” he said. “I enjoy conversion.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers also shouted at Biden about illicit fentanyl entering the U.S. over the Southwest border.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Fentanyl is killing more than 70,000 Americans a year,” Biden said after recognizing New Hampshire father Doug Griffin, whose 20-year-old daughter died of a drug overdose in 2014. Griffith was invited as a guest of the first lady.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s your fault,” several GOP members yelled.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Unity agenda</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden emphasized his work on bipartisan issues, saying he passed 300 bills in the last two years that had support from both parties. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those measures include a reauthorization of a law to strengthen enforcement of violence against women, a law to recognize same-sex marriages, a law to tweak the electoral process and the infrastructure law he championed. That law helped fund airport improvements in Atlanta and Portland, Oregon, among 20,000 other projects. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He highlighted a few issues that he thought both parties could work to address.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following another year of record drug overdose deaths, Biden for the second year in a row highlighted battling the opioid crisis as one of the main pillars of his “Unity Agenda” — policy areas where the president says both parties can join together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden promised to increase drug detection machines at the border, to work with carriers like FedEx to inspect more packages and to enforce strong penalties for traffickers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Officials seized nearly 15,000 pounds of illicit fentanyl last year,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">with the vast majority coming into the U.S. via land border crossings, according to the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden vowed to work with Congress to more strictly classify illicit synthetic fentanyl-related substances under the Controlled Substances Act, a proposal that has been re-introduced this Congress. </span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Veterans, mental health</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also falling under Biden’s Unity Agenda: combating homelessness and pressing health issues for America’s veterans, and addressing the nation’s mental health crisis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The president touted </span><a href="https://kansasreflector.com/2022/08/10/biden-signs-landmark-bill-aiding-veterans-exposed-to-burn-pits-overseas/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a bipartisan law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that expands benefits for veterans who were exposed to open burn pits in Afghanistan and Iraq, Agent Orange in Vietnam, and other toxic substances in other geographic theaters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Veteran homelessness fell by 11% last year, according to the White House, and the Veterans Affairs Department is slated to expand mental health resources, including establishing peer-to-peer support programs and hiring more clinicians.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The call for improving veteran health care was a rare part of the speech that won compliments from Republican members. Senate Veterans’ Affairs ranking Republican Jerry Moran of Kansas praised Biden for signing the bill.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Supporting our veterans is a mission that should always break through the gridlock in Congress,” Moran said in a post-address statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iowa Republican U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson also said she was encouraged by Biden’s reference to veteran mental health and pledged to work toward it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mental health resources for everyday Americans, including students, are also expanding, Biden said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden touted the passage of the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act that created grants for schools to establish trauma-informed youth mental health programs and other health services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2022 law was brokered by a bipartisan group of 20 senators last summer in the evenly divided Senate following the May mass shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, that claimed the lives of 19 students and two teachers.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘Finish the job’</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden also commended bills Democrats passed without Republicans, especially the landmark climate, health and taxes legislation that passed along party lines last year. He vowed to fight any effort to undo them and to “finish the job” on some contentious policy areas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some Republicans wanted to repeal the climate, health and taxes law, he said, pledging to veto any such reversal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That law capped the cost of insulin at $35 a month for Medicare patients. He called for Congress to expand that cap to people on private insurance plans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Every day, millions need insulin to control their diabetes so they can stay alive,” Biden said. “Insulin has been around for 100 years. It costs drug companies just $10 a vial to make, but, Big Pharma has been unfairly charging people hundreds of dollars — and making record profits. Not anymore.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also called for more resources to fight climate change, which he called “an existential threat” that affects Republican and Democratic states alike.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And he called for a “billionaire minimum tax” to require wealthy people be taxed at a rate no lower than working-class professions and closing more tax loopholes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Congress should also pass a ban on assault weapons, he said, bringing sustained applause from Democrats.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And, with the family of 29-year-old Nichols, who died after being brutally beaten by Memphis police, in the audience, Biden asked Congress to “finish the job” on police reform.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Police reform</h4>

	
<p><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/whos-guest-list-state-union-speech" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the many guests</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> were RowVaughn and Rodney Wells, the mother and stepfather of Nichols, who were invited by the White House and Democratic Rep. Steven Horsford of Nevada, chair of the Congressional Black Caucus.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They had to bury Tyre last week,” Biden said as the couple stood. “As many of you personally know, there’s no words to describe the heartache or grief of losing a child. But imagine, imagine if you lost that child at the hands of the law.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nichols’ death last month just three days after his beating by police has renewed calls from Democrats and the White House for </span><a href="https://michiganadvance.com/2023/02/03/congressional-black-caucus-meets-with-biden-to-push-for-police-accountability/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">police reform</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden called for more training for police and to hold them to a higher standard, and for Congress to pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, a bill that passed the House twice when it was under Democratic control. The bill faltered in the Senate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Just like every cop when they pin on that badge in the morning has a right to be able to go home at night, so does everybody else out there. Our children have a right to come home safely,” Biden said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said that “when police officers or police departments violate the public trust, they must be held accountable.”</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Economy and democracy</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden extolled progress he said the country has made since he came into office two years ago on issues related to the economic recovery from the pandemic and on defending democratic norms. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He touted a strong economic recovery after the COVID-19 pandemic, including job growth and a record-low unemployment rate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The economy added more than 500,000 jobs last month, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ </span><a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">January report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The national unemployment of 3.4% is a 50-year low, Biden said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The story of America is a story of progress and resilience,” he said in the opening minutes of the speech. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Two years ago, our economy was reeling. As I stand here tonight, we have created a record 12 million new jobs — more jobs created in two years than any president has ever created in four years. Two years ago, COVID had shut down our businesses, closed our schools, and robbed us of so much. Today, COVID no longer controls our lives.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The average price of gas has dropped $1.50 since its peak last summer, Biden said. Republicans often note it is still higher than when he took office.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Oil production</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden also called on U.S. oil companies to produce more domestic oil, prompting laughs from the GOP side of the aisle. Republicans have routinely criticized the president for policies they say have discouraged oil and gas production.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden also praised the condition of U.S. democracy. He came into office mere weeks after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. While that event remained a stain on the nation, Biden said similar attempts to subvert the nation’s system of government have not followed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And two years ago, our democracy faced its greatest threat since the Civil War,” he said. “Today, though bruised, our democracy remains unbowed and unbroken.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, he called the current moment “an inflection point” and noted the danger of political violence like that committed against Paul Pelosi, the husband of former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who was in the chamber as a guest of first lady Jill Biden.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Shouts of opposition</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite Biden’s calls for unity and Speaker Kevin McCarthy’s promise that GOP lawmakers would remain civil during the address, several outbursts could be heard from the Republican side.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_34365" class="wp-caption alignright" style="max-width:100%;width:429px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/GettyImages-1463971699-scaled.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class=" wp-image-34365" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/GettyImages-1463971699-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="429" height="286" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/GettyImages-1463971699-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/GettyImages-1463971699-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/GettyImages-1463971699-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/GettyImages-1463971699-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/GettyImages-1463971699-2048x1366.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 429px) 100vw, 429px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene gives a thumbs down during President Joe Biden&#8217;s State of the Union address. The Georgia Republican shouted at Biden at various times during the speech. (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the loudest and most raucous moments was when Biden accused some in the GOP of wanting to cut entitlement programs as part of a negotiation to raise the debt ceiling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Some of my Republican friends want to take the economy hostage — I get it — unless I agree to their economic plans. All of you at home should know what those plans are,” Biden said. “Instead of making the wealthy pay their fair share, some Republicans want Medicare and Social Security to sunset.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That led to shouts from Greene and others, which evoked then-U.S. Rep. Joe Wilson’s outburst during a joint address to Congress by President Barack Obama in 2009. Wilson’s episode was considered a shocking breach of decorum, and he apologized for it that night.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Greene doubled down in a video posted to social media following the speech, and none in her party rushed to criticize the Georgia firebrand, demonstrating how difficult Biden’s call for bipartisanship will be to realize.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Greene also called out to Biden “China spied on us” at the mention of the rival nation. The Georgia Republican carried an inflated white balloon through the halls of Congress shortly before Biden’s address, using the stunt to draw attention to the </span><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/chinese-surveillance-balloon-now-drifting-across-middle-us-pentagon-confirms" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chinese surveillance balloon spotted across the U.S. last week</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and shot down by the Air Force just off the coast of South Carolina Saturday.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Ukraine funding request</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the one-year anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine approaches, defending the Eastern European nation again featured in Biden’s address. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year’s State of the Union occurred just days after Russia’s February 2022 attack.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Pentagon has directed just over $29 billion in defense and security assistance for Ukraine in the past twelve months, including a roughly $2 billion weapons package Friday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden pledged to continue supporting Ukraine “as long as it takes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Putin’s invasion has been a test for the ages. A test for America, a test for the world. Would we stand for the most basic of principles? Would we stand for sovereignty? Would we stand for the right of people to live free or tyranny? Would we stand for the defense of democracy?” Biden said. “&#8230; One year later we know the answer, yes we would and we did.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both sides of the chamber rose to their feet and applauded when a moment later Biden pointed up to the gallery to recognize Ukraine ambassador Oksana Markarova.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">National abortion ban</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden made a brief mention of abortion rights in the first State of the Union after the U.S. Supreme Court ruling last year overturning Roe v. Wade. He noted that more than a dozen states began enforcing “extreme abortion bans.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Congress should pass a law to reinstate nationwide abortion rights, he said, adding that he would veto a national abortion ban, if it passed.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Reactions from GOP hostile</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Members of Congress’ reception to the address fell along predictable party lines. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Congressional Democrats largely praised the effort, including the sections on jobs, abortion rights, clean energy and health care.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Republicans also found much to criticize. Some statements indicated no speech Biden could have given would have won them over.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“President Biden is filled with more hot air than the China spy balloon,” House Oversight and Accountability Chairman James Comer, a Kentucky Republican, said in a statement. “Deflate the rhetoric and the facts reveal President Biden’s policies have created crises on every front.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Much of the Republican agenda in Biden’s first two years in Congress and the states has focused on classroom teachings about racism in the U.S., transgender rights, abortion and other cultural issues.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders focused on those issues in </span><a href="https://www.republicanleader.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/governor-sarah-huckabee-sanders-delivers-republican-address-to-the-nation?peek=BU3JzdrGjQ/D6eoEmf7alu2MlhP8pf22KNN/D8Zpz47IzP2v" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the official GOP response.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Biden administration seems more interested in woke fantasies than the hard reality Americans face every day,” she said. “Most Americans simply want to live their lives in freedom and peace, but we are under attack in a left-wing culture war we didn’t start and never wanted to fight.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WASHINGTON — The U.S. House adopted rules for the 118th Congress on Monday, though several of the concessions Speaker Kevin McCarthy made with more conservative members of the Republican Party to secure the gavel weren’t included in the document or publicly circulated ahead of the vote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://rules.house.gov/sites/republicans.rules118.house.gov/files/BILLS-118hresPIH-118th-rules-of-the-house-of-reps-V3.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">55-page rules package</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the House voted nearly party-line</span> <a href="https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/202323?Page=2" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">220-213</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">to adopt sets the parameters for how bills should be written, how committees will operate and how the floor will run during the next two years. The majority in every Congress writes its own such rules.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it doesn’t include promises McCarthy reportedly made to cut spending by more than $100 billion, place hard-right lawmakers on key committees and put together some sort of debt limit plan ahead of a default deadline later this year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican Rep</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Tony Gonzales of Texas was the sole member of his party to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">vote against adopting the rules. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gonzales didn’t speak during floor debate Monday but said on</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “</span><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/texas-republican-opposes-house-rules-package-warns-nightmare-party" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fox &amp; Friends</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” on Sunday that he opposed the rules package because of an agreement to cut spending to the last fiscal year’s levels and a provision that allows any one member to call for a no-confidence vote on the speaker. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;m against the rules for a couple of different reasons. One is the defense spending, the cut in defense. I think that&#8217;s an absolutely terrible idea,” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gonzales said.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But the other is the vacate the chair. I don&#8217;t want to see us every two months be in lockdown. This isn&#8217;t the parliament. The American public are counting on House Republicans to be the one savior in this all. If we can&#8217;t get this right, it&#8217;s going to be nightmare after nightmare.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘Empowering the extremists’</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Massachusetts Rep. Jim McGovern, the top Democrat on the Rules Committee, urged opposition to the package during floor debate Monday afternoon, arguing that it would empower the extreme right of the House Republican Conference. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What&#8217;s clear from all of this is that the Republican Party no longer cares about governing and this rules package is exhibit No. 1,” McGovern said. “This rules package puts politics first, empowering the extremists who are only interested in their own power.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maryland Democrat Steny Hoyer spoke against the changes, saying they would “impede” the work of the House.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, a Louisiana Republican, lamented that legislation brought to the floor during previous sessions of Congress was written “behind closed doors, by a small number of people not concerned about the consequences.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For a long time, we’ve been saying this needs to change. In fact, we ran on an agenda to change the way Washington works, to fix this broken system, to get our country back on track, and we were awarded the majority by the people across this country,” Scalise said. “So today starts that process of fixing what&#8217;s broken in Washington.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Texas Rep. Chip Roy, one of the holdout GOP lawmakers who negotiated concessions from McCarthy last week in exchange for votes to become speaker, said on the floor that Republicans and McCarthy agreed to a floor vote on a Texas border security plan, a vote on legislation to set term limits for members and a process that would bring appropriations bills to the floor under open rules, which allow any member to offer amendments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes, we have had conversations and agreements, as individuals are supposed to do,” Roy said. “Looking each other in the eye and saying, ‘We’re going to bring balanced budgets to the floor of the House.’ You bet that we’ve got agreements, we’re going to do that.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">New select panel on coronavirus</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the rule changes are new budgetary constraints and reporting, a requirement bills adhere to a single subject and a measure allowing any member to introduce a resolution that could lead to a no confidence vote on the speaker.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other proposed changes include the renaming of committees — for example, the Education and Labor Committee will be redubbed Education and the Workforce. The package calls for the empaneling of a select subcommittee to investigate the origins of the coronavirus pandemic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans are moving from the pay-as-you-go rule that Democrats used to offset the cost of new mandatory spending to a cut-as-you-go rule. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The change “prohibits consideration of a bill, joint resolution, conference report, or amendment that has the net effect of increasing mandatory spending within a five-year or ten-year budget window,” according to a </span><a href="https://rules.house.gov/sites/republicans.rules118.house.gov/files/118-Rules-of-the-House-of-Representatives-SxS-V2.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">GOP summary</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the rules changes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans are reinstating a rule that legislation must be released at least 72 hours before floor votes can take place, an effort to address Republican criticism that there’s often not enough time to read and understand legislation before members are expected to vote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rep. Michelle Fischbach, a Minnesota Republican, said during floor debate the provision would “allow more thoughtful and deliberate consideration that will improve what we pass out of this House.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New reporting requirements for major legislation mandate that the Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan scorekeeper, include a long-term economic outlook when giving a budget score to the bill, including effects on economic output, employment and capital stocks.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Handshake deals</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not included in the official rules package, or public documents, are reported handshake deals that McCarthy made with certain members of his party in order </span><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-gop-backs-mccarthy-speaker-after-tense-and-chaotic-late-night-session-25" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to secure the votes needed </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">to become speaker last week following four days of voting and 15 ballots. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The California Republican reportedly promised members he’ll reduce discretionary spending to fiscal 2022 levels, cutting more than $115 billion compared to current levels. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">White House spokesperson Andrew Bates said in a written statement Monday the impact of reducing defense spending, which some Republicans swear they won’t agree to, would make the United States “less capable of keeping the American people safe and advancing our national security interests.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This push to defund our military in the name of politics is senseless and out of line with our national security needs,” Bates said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats voiced concerns about proposed reductions in government spending, including possible defense cuts and threats to programs like Social Security and Medicare.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is an extreme proposal that&#8217;s in front of us,” Massachusetts Democratic Rep. Richard Neal said during floor debate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If they follow the logic to its manifestation, this will pit Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid against defense spending,” Neal added. “Our seniors will be sold out, our military will be sold out, and the full faith and credit of the United States will be under threat. All in a quest to organize the House.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">IRS staffing bill </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both parties accused the other side of so-called “weaponization” of government agencies and congressional investigations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The GOP plans to pass a bill late Monday to pull funding for additional staffing and enforcement at the Internal Revenue Service, accusing Democrats of targeting everyday Americans with tax audits. The bill is likely to hit a roadblock in the Democrat-majority Senate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The GOP legislation would increase the deficit by $114 billion over 10 years, according to </span><a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/58894" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an analysis </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">released Monday by the CBO.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the panel to investigate COVID-19 origins and policies, the GOP also included in its rules the establishment of a panel that will be “committed to investigating the radical left position of the federal government,” said Tom Cole of Oklahoma, who now chairs the Rules Committee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Republican majority is expected in the coming days to bring two abortion-related bills to the House floor — legislation that was outlined in the rules package.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a week of chaos, we now have a rules package for MAGA extremists attacking our freedoms and every major responsibility of this body,” said Washington Rep. Pramila Jayapal, chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This package criminalizes abortion by advancing bills that attack access and health care without a single hearing or markup.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The House will reconvene Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday of this week.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WASHINGTON — The U.S. House slogged through more votes for speaker Thursday, with Republicans unable to reach consensus about whether Kevin McCarthy should lead them during the 118th Congress, or if another lawmaker should win the gavel. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twenty-one Republicans, including Bob Good of Virginia, voted against McCarthy during the third day, signaling that ongoing closed-door negotiations and talks on the House floor from McCarthy allies haven’t succeeded yet. The level of opposition was unchanged from Wednesday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Like I said from the beginning, we want to change things fundamentally here so this place works for the American people. And we&#8217;re not going to stop going until we get that one way or the other,” Pennsylvania’s Scott Perry said during a brief interview as voting dragged on inside the chamber. “Either we have the tools to do it, or we have the personnel to do it. It’s going to be one, or the other.”</span></p>
</div>
<p>On Twitter, Good declared that &#8220;for the sake of the American people and the future of our country, Republicans must not settle for Kevin McCarthy.&#8221;</p>
<p>https://twitter.com/RepBobGood/status/1611061583253278722</p>
<div id="modal-ready">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McCarthy’s backing through two rounds of ballots continued to hold at 201 votes, with 20 members of his conference voting for other candidates — including Florida’s Byron Donalds, Oklahoma’s Kevin Hern and former President Donald Trump — and one member voting present. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nebraska’s Don Bacon reiterated Thursday that a stronghold of the Republican conference will remain behind McCarthy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re in for the long haul,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats continued to uniformly back New York’s Hakeem Jeffries, who holds the most votes for speaker, with 212. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The House cannot move on from speaker debate unless a candidate gets at least 218 votes or the chamber adjourns, as it did on </span><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/gops-hard-right-flank-tanks-mccarthys-bid-be-house-speaker-multiple-ballots" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tuesday</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-paralyzed-following-second-day-gop-failure-elect-speaker" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wednesday</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Until Republicans unite around McCarthy or a consensus candidate emerges, the 434 current House members cannot be sworn in and committees cannot form, leaving the chamber stuck.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Democratic rebuke</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Democrats rebuked the GOP stalemate in floor speeches Thursday, with the new leadership trio — Majority Leader Jeffries, Whip Katherine Clark of Massachusetts and Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar of California — releasing a joint statement as well. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“House Democrats are united and ready to get to work,” they said. “Unfortunately, House Republicans remain unable to organize themselves in a manner that allows the Congress to move forward and do the business of the American people.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michigan’s John James, an incoming freshman Republican, sought to contextualize the ongoing GOP stalemate by referencing the speaker election of the 34th Congress, noting it took lawmakers more than 133 votes over two months to elect Nathaniel Banks of Massachusetts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The issues today are over a few rules and personalities, while the issues at that time were about slavery and whether the value of a man who looks like me was 60% or 100% of a human being,” James said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was a long, drawn-out, painful process. But it needed to happen,” James continued. “And in the end, Nathaniel Banks won by the slimmest of margins. But you know, margins don’t matter when your policies are on the right side of history.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">James, who nominated McCarthy ahead of the seventh ballot, also pressed all of his Republican colleagues to back the California Republican and not let the process extend longer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The American people have told us, by putting a Republican majority here, that they want Republicans to lead, and they want a government that works and doesn&#8217;t embarrass them,” James said. “And we are failing on both missions. That must change today.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But North Carolina’s Dan Bishop offered Donalds as an alternative candidate ahead of the seventh ballot, arguing that McCarthy wasn’t the right person for the role. Arizona’s Andy Biggs offered Donalds on the eighth ballot. And Montana’s Matt Rosendale nominated Donalds on the ninth ballot, underway late Thursday afternoon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are committed to make change to this institution that has lost its way,” Bishop said, calling Donalds a “man of personal conviction.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bishop said the ongoing gridlock within the House GOP will be resolved, though he didn’t offer details for a clear path forward during his floor speech. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“People ask me what is the end game? How does this end? The answer to this question is that this is a dynamic process,” Bishop said. “All of the decisions on this floor result from the coming together of minds — one way or another.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McCarthy told reporters he remained optimistic while rushing between meetings inside the U.S. Capitol Thursday morning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think everybody, of the members I&#8217;ve talked to, (has) been very productive. They&#8217;ve been productive in their discussions, their ideas. … They want to find a solution that’s possible,” McCarthy said.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Concessions by McCarthy</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there are concerns within the House Republican Conference about some of the concessions McCarthy might make to get the backing of the 218 House members needed to become speaker. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alabama’s Robert Aderholt said during a brief interview before the House session that potentially allowing Maryland Rep. Andy Harris to elbow Oklahoma’s Tom Cole out as chairman of the spending panel that controls funding for the departments of Education, Health and Human Services and Labor “is a bridge too far.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When you start into the seniority process, I think that&#8217;s going a bit too far and I would have very great concerns about that,” Aderholt said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aderholt, a senior appropriator and subcommittee chairman, said whether House GOP leaders bring the dozen annual government funding bills to the floor under open rules, which allow any member to offer any amendment, could be challenging. Open rules for such bills are a demand by McCarthy opponents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The House hasn’t used open rules for spending bills in several years, with both Republicans and Democrats opting for a process that allows for limited amendment debate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;ll be honest with you, I have mixed emotions about it,” Aderholt said. “I think generally speaking, when you have an open rule, it&#8217;s a good idea. But also too, you can get some crazy amendment in there. And so I think it&#8217;s a double-edged sword. So I think we’ve got to go into this with all eyes open.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wisconsin&#8217;s Mike Gallagher said during an interview as the votes went on that the biggest roadblock to Republicans uniting around McCarthy for speaker “seems to be just basic trust.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gallagher also questioned how McCarthy potentially giving into demands from the opposition group that a minimum number of its members be placed on certain committees, like Rules or Appropriations panels, would affect the conference. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you say, &#8216;Okay, you get X spots on the Rules Committee and X spots on the Appropriations Committee,&#8217; well, then every faction in the Republican caucus is going to [say], ‘I want three spots on Ag. I want, you know, 10 spots on Armed Services.’ Then it&#8217;s just chaos,” Gallagher said. </span></p>

(C-SPAN)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WASHINGTON — </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. House Republicans&#8217; stalemate over who should lead the chamber for the next two years dragged on Wednesday, with Kevin McCarthy failing to get the votes needed to become speaker on three more ballots. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The chamber then adjourned until 8 p.m. Eastern to give the House GOP a chance to meet privately, though House Republican leaders had no clear plan to garner the support of the members who have vehemently opposed McCarthy.</span><b></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second day of floor votes saw 21 GOP lawmakers including Bob Good of Virginia vote against the California congressman, despite ongoing efforts to turn members to his side. That was an increase of one from Tuesday, with Indiana’s Victoria Spartz now voting present. </span><b></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Until McCarthy wins enough votes or the House elects another speaker, members-elect cannot be sworn in, meaning that while the 118th Congress is technically underway, the House has no members and no agreed-upon rules under which to operate, such as how legislation can be brought to the floor. The clerk of the House has been conducting the proceedings.</span><b></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nebraska’s Don Bacon said late Wednesday afternoon that some Republicans are putting together a backup plan. </span><b></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s a group of us that know that plan B has to be worked on,” Bacon said on a call hosted by D.C.-based political organization No Labels, which advocates for bipartisanship.</span><b></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bacon wouldn’t reveal details about negotiations on a compromise candidate for House speaker. “We can’t be public about it for the time being,” he said. </span><b></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A social media post by former Republican President Donald Trump in the morning didn’t sway the holdouts to McCarthy’s side when the chamber came into session at noon.</span><b></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Republicans, do not turn a great triumph into a giant &amp; embarrassing defeat,” Trump wrote, adding that McCarthy would do a “good job, and maybe even a great job.” </span><b></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Colorado Republican Lauren Boebert, a McCarthy opponent, called on Trump to reverse course during a floor speech in the afternoon, saying that the party should work together and “stop with the campaign smears and tactics to get people to turn against us.”</span><b></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Even having my favorite president call us and tell us we need to knock this off,” Boebert said. “I think it actually needs to be reversed. The president needs to tell Kevin McCarthy that, sir, you do not have the votes and it’s time to withdraw.” </span><b></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McCarthy said before the floor votes that Republicans plan to keep talking and that he had the “same game plan as yesterday.” </span><b></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We&#8217;ll find an agreement where we all get together, and we&#8217;ll work through this,” McCarthy told reporters around noon.</span><b></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a call with select Republicans Wednesday morning, McCarthy touted his support from Trump, according to a GOP aide.</span><b></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m not going anywhere,” McCarthy said on the call that he led with Majority Leader Steve Scalise of Louisiana and GOP Whip Tom Emmer of Minnesota.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Adjournment unsuccessful in unifying GOP</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The House </span><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/gops-hard-right-flank-tanks-mccarthys-bid-be-house-speaker-multiple-ballots" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">held three votes for speaker</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Tuesday before the chamber adjourned for the night in an unsuccessful attempt to get Republicans to unify around a candidate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McCarthy lost the backing of 19 members on the first two votes before Florida’s Byron Donalds joined the group of lawmakers opposing McCarthy’s bid for speaker during the third ballot, bringing the total of opponents to 20.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McCarthy needs the backing of at least 218 House members, a challenging task at the moment, given he can only lose four votes amid House Republicans’ especially narrow majority. That means McCarthy and his backers need to get at least 17 of the 21 members who voted against him Wednesday to change their minds. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Floridian backed for speaker</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The GOP lawmakers opposing McCarthy rallied around Florida’s Donalds as their preferred candidate on the fourth, fifth and sixth ballots Wednesday, moving away from an earlier push for Ohio’s Jim Jordan. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Texas Republican Chip Roy got a standing ovation from the entire House chamber when he noted that nominating Donalds for speaker, along with Democrats’ nomination of New York Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, represented “the first time in history there have been two Black Americans placed into the nomination for speaker of the House.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The House held a second full standing ovation after Roy said that “we do not seek to judge people by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the GOP split over who should hold the speaker’s gavel continued throughout the afternoon, with the vast majority of the House Republican Conference pressing for McCarthy </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">both during floor speeches and in what appeared to be tense conversations on the House floor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wisconsin&#8217;s Mike Gallagher, who nominated McCarthy on the fourth ballot, argued that the disagreement among Republicans was part of the democratic process, rebuffing criticism the party is in disarray. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sure it looks messy, but democracy is messy,” Gallagher said. “That’s a feature, not a bug of our system. We air it all out, in the open for the American people to see.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The floor speeches, however, didn’t move Republicans any closer to actually electing a speaker. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McCarthy for the moment is staying put in the speaker’s race with the backing of 201 members of his conference. </span></p>

<p>WASHINGTON — Republican control of the U.S. House got off to a rocky start Tuesday when the party was unable to decide who should become speaker amid a sharp disagreement within the party’s more conservative faction.</p>
<p>California Rep. Kevin McCarthy didn’t clinch the backing of the 218 lawmakers he needed to become the head of the chamber during the first three rounds of ballots, marking the first time in a century the speaker’s election went to multiple ballots.</p>
<p>After the unsuccessful first day, where opposition to McCarthy increased as the day went on, House Republicans moved to adjourn until noon Wednesday.</p>
<p>The move gives McCarthy more time to negotiate with the 20 GOP lawmakers who oppose his bid for speaker, possibly changing the tally before voting resumes.</p>
<p>McCarthy received 203 votes to Democratic nominee Hakeem Jeffries’ 212 votes on the first ballot, with the remaining support going to other GOP lawmakers.</p>
<p>McCarthy said after that vote that GOP leaders want to pass legislation addressing the border and the economy, but can’t do that until the party elects a speaker.</p>
<p>“We’ve certain members right now that think they can use a small majority to try to get themselves the gavel,” he said. “That’s not how it works.”</p>
<p>Reps. Andy Biggs of Arizona, Dan Bishop of North Carolina, Andrew Clyde of Georgia, Eli Crane of Arizona, Matt Gaetz of Florida, Bob Good of Virginia, Paul Gosar of Arizona, Ralph Norman of South Carolina, Scott Perry of Pennsylvania and Matt Rosendale of Montana were among the Republican members to vote against McCarthy on the first ballot. All of those GOP lawmakers voted for Biggs after Gosar nominated him.</p>
<p>Other GOP votes went to Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, Indiana Rep. Jim Banks, New York Rep. Lee Zeldin and Florida Rep. Byron Donalds. Banks, Zeldin and Donalds were not formally nominated for speaker during the first round of voting.</p>
<p>The 19 Republican lawmakers who opposed McCarthy on the first ballot also voted against him during the second ballot, though all moved to voting for Jordan, who has said he doesn’t want the role and nominated McCarthy ahead of the second ballot.</p>
<p>During the third ballot, Florida’s Donalds joined the McCarthy opposition, writing in a tweet that the House should adjourn so Republicans can “huddle and find someone or work out the next steps.”</p>
<p>“When the dust settles, we will have a Republican Speaker, now is the time for our conference to debate and come to a consensus,” Donalds wrote. “This will take time, Democracy is messy at times, but we will be ready to govern on behalf of the American people. Debate is healthy.”</p>
<p>Good called for McCarthy to step aside following the first ballot, saying he expects Jordan to pick up ballots.</p>
<p>“The sooner he pulls out — for the good of the country, for the good of the Congress, for the good of the conference – the better everyone is and that way we can move together to try to find who the best person is that can reach 218,” Good said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Four-vote margin</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>House Republicans have an especially slim majority, with just a four-vote margin to pass bills across the floor or elect a speaker.</p>
<p>The impact of the razor-thin majority and divisions within the Republican Party about policy goals and its future were on full display Tuesday, with conservative members split over whether McCarthy should lead the party during the next two years or if another lawmaker was better suited to take the helm.</p>
<p>Gaetz said ahead of the first speaker vote that the group of conservative GOP lawmakers wants a commitment from McCarthy for balanced budgets, a Texas border plan, term limits and individual votes on earmarks.</p>
<p>Gaetz also said that incoming House Armed Services Committee Chair Mike Rogers, an Alabama Republican, told Gaetz he would be kicked off the committee if he didn’t back McCarthy for speaker.</p>
<p>Boebert told reporters the group presented a plan to McCarthy on Monday evening that could have gotten him the votes needed to become speaker on the first ballot, but he rejected the offer.</p>
<p>“I have been working every day to unify the Republican Party for the American people,” Boebert said before the vote. “And yesterday we had a deal that was not a selfish deal in any way for Kevin McCarthy, to get him the gavel on the first ballot, and he eagerly dismissed us.”</p>
<p>Boebert said one of the policy changes that is especially important to her is a single-member motion to vacate, which would allow any member of the House, not just a member of leadership, to call for a vote on the speaker.</p>
<p>“We were just told when we left this door, ‘We will give you single-member motion to vacate,’” Boebert said following the closed-door GOP meeting ahead of the floor vote.</p>
<p>Perry said the Tuesday morning meeting was “about a beat-down and a simulated unity in the room which really doesn&#8217;t exist.”</p>
<p>Perry also said anti-McCarthy Republicans are being “threatened with being kicked off your committees if you don’t vote as you’re ordered to.”</p>
<p>“We took an offer to him last night of things that are completely and wholly within his purview,” Perry said. “If he wants to accept the offer, we’re happy to join the discussion.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">D.C. ‘status quo’ criticized</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Bishop of North Carolina wrote in a <a href="https://twitter.com/RepDanBishop/status/1610309812180471809" target="_blank">statement</a> ahead of the vote that McCarthy is not the right candidate to be speaker.</p>
<p>&#8220;He has perpetuated the Washington status quo that makes this body one of the most unsuccessful and unpopular institutions in the country,&#8221; Bishop said. &#8220;This is not about personality differences or who has &#8216;earned&#8217; the position. It&#8217;s about the American people.&#8221;</p>
<p>The last speaker’s election to go for more than one ballot was in 1923, when Frederick Huntington Gillett, a Massachusetts Republican, didn’t secure the gavel until the ninth ballot, <a href="https://history.house.gov/People/Office/Speakers-Multiple-Ballots/" target="_blank">according to</a> the U.S. House Office of the Historian.</p>
<p>Of the 14 speaker elections that have gone to multiple ballots, the 34th Congress, which began in 1855, held the most votes, reaching 133 before electing Nathaniel Prentice Banks to the role.</p>
<p>The U.S. House can’t begin any of its work for the 118th session of Congress until it elects a speaker, putting GOP plans for legislation on hold for the moment.</p>
<p>House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, a Louisiana Republican, said the House GOP will bring “meaningful, ready-to-go” legislation in the House during the first few weeks of the 118th Congress as committees “organize and start moving legislation through regular order.”</p>
