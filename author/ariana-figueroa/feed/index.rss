(Photo by David McNew/Getty Images)</p><p dir="ltr">WASHINGTON —  A top Republican on the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee said Tuesday that when President-elect Donald Trump takes office and the GOP takes control of the Senate, lawmakers’ first priority will be to pass a border security package through a complex process known as budget reconciliation.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump has promised his base his administration will enact mass deportations of people living in the country illegally. South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham said at a Judiciary hearing that Senate Republicans will focus on increasing beds at detention centers, hiring Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and purchasing technology for enforcement at the southern border.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It is our belief that the only way you’ll get control of the border is for deportations to start early,” he said. “If we do not have outflow, the inflow will continue.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, a senior fellow at the pro-immigration think tank the American Immigration Council, Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, told the panel the endeavor will be expensive.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Carrying out mass deportations of 1 million people would <a href="https://immigrationimpact.com/2024/10/02/report-costs-mass-deportation-immigration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cost about $88 billion a year</a> for arrests, detainment and removal, he said. About 13 million people are living in the United States illegally.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Fixing a broken system</h4>
<p dir="ltr">The committee hearing, led by Democrats who control the Senate now but will be in the minority next year, explored the ramifications of the Trump campaign promise of mass deportations.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Instead of mass deportations, mass accountability,” said the chair of the committee, Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois. “Let’s fix our broken immigration system in a way that protects our country and honors our heritage as a nation of immigrants.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The budget reconciliation process cited by Graham that would be used to pass border security legislation, if successful, would allow Republicans to get around the 60-vote filibuster in the Senate.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Reconciliation is generally used when one party controls the House, Senate and the White House, because it only requires a majority vote in each chamber.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Graham added that Republicans will also prevent those people who were paroled into the country through executive authority from employing another avenue for legal immigration status. The GOP has been critical of programs that allow certain nationals from Haiti, Nicaragua, Cuba and Venezuela to temporarily work and live in the United States.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“So if you’re here illegally, get ready to leave,” Graham said.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">DACA program</h4>
<p dir="ltr">One of the hearing witnesses, Foday Turay, is in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, which is awaiting a federal court ruling on its legality after the Trump administration tried to end it.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Separately, on Monday, <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2024/12/09/texas-daca-recipients-affordable-care-act/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a federal court blocked</a> the implementation of a final rule from the Biden administration to allow DACA recipients to have health care access under the Affordable Care Act. </p>
<p dir="ltr">About 500,000 people are in the program, which is aimed at protecting children brought into the country without authorization from deportation. It also allows them to obtain work permits.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Turay is an assistant district attorney in the Philadelphia District Attorney’s Office, and said if he were deported it would devastate his family, as he is the primary income earner in his household.</p>
<p dir="ltr">He said his wife, a U.S. citizen, is the primary caretaker of her mother, a person with disabilities who is undergoing cancer treatments. Additionally, Turay said he would have to leave his son behind if he is deported.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Another witness, Patty Morin of Aberdeen, Maryland, told how her daughter, Rachel, was killed. <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/baltimore/news/1-year-ago-maryland-mom-rachel-morin-was-murdered-heres-what-happened-since-baltimore-ma-and-pa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The suspect, who was charged</a> with first-degree murder and sexual assault, was in the country illegally and had a prior criminal record.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Durbin said Democrats are not opposed to ICE carrying out its duties to deport those with criminal records and stressed that Trump’s plans for mass deportations extend beyond that group and would include people like Turay.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“This man for a living is prosecuting criminals,” Durbin said of Turay. “This other individual is a clear criminal with a record. When we say ‘mass deportation,’ should we consider them the same because they’re both undocumented?”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Graham said when it comes to DACA, “hopefully we can find a solution to that problem.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Over the weekend, Trump expressed his support for coming to an agreement with Democrats to allow DACA recipients to remain in the country, despite trying to end the program during his first term.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Use of National Guard</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Durbin said he is concerned about Trump’s comments about using the National Guard to carry out mass deportations.</p>
<p dir="ltr">One of the witnesses, Randy Manner, a retired major general in the U.S. Army, said he sees problems with using the military for mass deportations.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It could affect military readiness, he said, and the military is not trained in that capacity.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Immigration enforcement is the responsibility of federal law enforcement agencies,” Manner said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">He added that having soldiers carry out that directive would have a negative impact on morale and recruiting. Manner also said having the U.S. military involved in that kind of political messaging would erode public trust.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Cost of mass deportations</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Minnesota Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar said not only would mass deportations be harmful to communities, but a financial strain as well.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Reichlin-Melnick said industries that would be hit particularly hard by losing employees would include construction, agriculture and hospitality.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Reichlin-Melnick also argued that ICE already focuses on arresting and conducting deportation proceedings for noncitizens with criminal records.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The overwhelming majority of people who would be the target of a mass deportation campaign do not have criminal records,” he said. “They are people who have been living otherwise law-abiding lives in this country, living, working and, in many cases, paying taxes.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Tennessee Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn suggested that local law enforcement should be empowered to carry out deportations, even though immigration enforcement is a federal issue.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Art Arthur, a resident fellow in law and policy at the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that advocates for sharply limiting immigration, supported that idea.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“They’re going to be the people who are best able to pull those individuals out of the community,” Arthur said of local law enforcement.</p>

Matt Gaetz leaves a House Republican Conference meeting at the U.S. Capitol on Oct. 3, 2023 in Washington, D.C. (Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">WASHINGTON — Former Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz announced Thursday he’s withdrawing as President-elect Donald Trump’s planned nominee for attorney general days after securing the appointment.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Gaetz’s path to Senate confirmation was highly unlikely following years of investigations about alleged drug usage and payments for sex, including with an underage girl. He submitted his resignation to Congress last week.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“While the momentum was strong, it is clear that my confirmation was unfairly becoming a distraction to the critical work of the Trump/Vance Transition,” Gaetz wrote in&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/mattgaetz/status/1859649045553402285" target="_blank">a social media post.</a> “There is no time to waste on a needlessly protracted Washington scuffle, thus I&#8217;ll be withdrawing my name from consideration to serve as Attorney General. Trump&#8217;s DOJ must be in place and ready on Day 1.”&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump&nbsp;<a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113522181118234752" target="_blank">posted on social media</a> afterward that he “greatly” appreciated “the recent efforts of Matt Gaetz in seeking approval to be Attorney General.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“He was doing very well but, at the same time, did not want to be a distraction for the Administration, for which he has much respect,” Trump wrote. “Matt has a wonderful future, and I look forward to watching all of the great things he will do!”</p>
<p dir="ltr">When asked if the Trump-Vance transition team had another nominee choice lined up, and whether they viewed the Gaetz withdrawal as a setback, spokesperson Karoline Leavitt did not provide details.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;President Trump remains committed to choosing a leader for the Department of Justice who will strongly defend the Constitution and end the weaponization of our justice system. President Trump will announce his new decision when it is made,&#8221; Leavitt told States Newsroom in an emailed statement.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The House Ethics Committee&nbsp;<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-ethics-panel-republicans-vote-against-disclosure-gaetz-report" target="_blank">voted along party lines</a> Wednesday not to release its report on Gaetz, following more than three years of investigation. Gaetz has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, including the allegations that he had sex with a minor.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Meetings with senators</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Trump’s running mate, Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, spent Wednesday shuffling Gaetz between meetings with Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which would have held his confirmation hearing. Republicans will control the Senate in the new session of Congress beginning in January.</p>
<p dir="ltr">South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee,&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/LindseyGrahamSC/status/1859657654336983200" target="_blank">wrote on social media</a> that he respected Gaetz’s decision to withdraw his name from consideration as AG.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I look forward to working with President Trump regarding future nominees to get this important job up and running,” Graham said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley, incoming Judiciary Committee chair, posted the following on X: “I respect Gaetz decision &amp;look fwd 2helping PresTrump confirm qualified noms 2reform Dept of Justice &amp;bring TRANSPARENCY/ACCOUNTABILITY Trump’s mission = DRAIN THE SWAMP&amp; I would add get some1 who will answer my hundreds of outstanding oversight letters sitting at Biden DOJ/FBI.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Grassley’s staff referred States Newsroom to the social media post when the outlet reached out for comment.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The offices of Sens. John Kennedy of Louisiana and Tom Cotton of Arkansas, fellow Senate Judiciary Committee Republicans, declined to comment.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Gaetz’s future is unclear, given that he resigned from the U.S. House last week and notified the chamber he didn’t plan to take the oath of office for the upcoming 119th Congress.</p>
<p dir="ltr">He first joined the House in January 2017 and led efforts to remove former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy from that role last year, setting off a month-long stalemate within the House Republican Conference over who should lead the party.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The race to fill his empty seat in a special election has already&nbsp;<a href="https://floridaphoenix.com/2024/11/21/two-more-republicans-file-to-run-for-matt-gaetz-congressional-seat/" target="_blank">attracted six candidates</a>, mostly Republicans in a heavily conservative-leaning district.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Gaetz could jump into the race for his old seat, possibly winning a place back in the House of Representative next year following the special election.</p>
<p dir="ltr">He could also try to take the oath of office when the next session of Congress begins on Jan. 3, since he wrote in his resignation letter that he did “not intend to take the oath of office for the same office in the 119th Congress, to pursue the position of Attorney General in the Trump Administration.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">That would give the House Ethics Committee jurisdiction to complete its report on Gaetz and release it publicly.&nbsp;</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">AG oversees Department of Justice</h4>
<p dir="ltr">The attorney general is responsible for overseeing the Department of Justice, which includes the federal government&#8217;s top law enforcement agencies as well as prosecutors.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, or ATF, Drug Enforcement Administration, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Federal Bureau of Prisons, Office for Victims of Crime, Office on Violence Against Women and U.S. Attorneys&#8217; offices are among the 40 entities within the DOJ and its 115,000-person workforce.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Congress approved $37.52 billion for the Department of Justice in the most recent full-year spending bill.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump had two attorneys general during his first term as president. He first nominated former Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, whom Trump later fired amid disputes, and then Bill Barr.&nbsp;</p>

Biden continued the tradition of inviting the newly elected president to meet at the White House after Trump won the presidential election on Nov. 5. (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)</p><p dir="ltr">WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden welcomed President-elect Donald Trump to the White House Wednesday, a tradition between incoming and outgoing American leaders, though the courtesy was not extended to Biden after he won the 2020 election.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The pair met behind closed doors in the Oval Office for most of the meeting that lasted just under two hours. Biden’s Chief of Staff Jeff Zients and Trump’s incoming counterpart, Susie Wiles, joined the president and president-elect.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Biden had been seeking reelection against Trump until late July, when Biden dropped his bid. Vice President Kamala Harris lost the race to Trump after just over 100 days of campaigning as the Democratic nominee.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Harris did not attend the meeting, according to the White House.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In brief remarks before cameras, Biden congratulated his predecessor who will again take the oath of office in January as the nation’s 47th president.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Well, Mr. President-elect, former president, Donald, congratulations,” Biden said, as Trump interjected with “Thank you very much, Joe.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“And looking forward to having a, like I said, smooth transition, do everything we can to make sure you’re accommodated, what you need,” Biden continued. “And we’re gonna get a chance to talk about some of that today.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump again thanked Biden and responded “And politics is tough. And it’s, many cases, not a very nice world, but it is a nice world today. And I appreciate it very much, a transition that’s so smooth, it’ll be as smooth as it can get. I very much appreciate that, Joe,” Trump said.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">A ‘substantive’ conversation</h4>
<p dir="ltr">First lady Jill Biden joined the president in greeting Trump and presented a handwritten letter of congratulations and offer for transition assistance addressed to incoming first lady Melania Trump, according to the White House.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The meeting got underway just after 11 a.m. Eastern, and the press was ushered out after the brief welcoming remarks and photo opportunity. Biden and Trump finished their private discussion at roughly 1 p.m. Eastern.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Neither addressed a large gathering of reporters and photographers outside afterward.</p>
<p dir="ltr">White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Biden and Trump had “a very good back and forth.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“(Biden) wants you all to know that the president-elect was gracious, came with a detailed set of questions, it was, again, substantive” Jean-Pierre said at the daily press briefing.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Jean-Pierre declined to provide the meeting’s specifics but said “the length of the meeting tells you they had an in-depth conversation on an array of issues.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump did <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/biden-has-invited-trump-to-the-white-house-trump-shunned-that-tradition-when-biden-won" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not</a> invite Biden to the White House following his 2020 presidential election win, nor did he attend his successor’s inauguration that occurred just 14 days after a mob of his supporters violently tried to stop Congress’ certification of Biden’s victory.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The president-elect’s transition team did not immediately respond to States Newsroom’s inquiries on why Trump did not invite Biden to the White House in 2020.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Musk, Ramaswamy to head new initiative</h4>
<p dir="ltr">The president-elect continues to announce numerous Cabinet and staff positions, <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-names-floridas-rep-mike-waltz-national-security-adviser" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stacking</a> his administration with staunch loyalists.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Late Tuesday, Trump announced he named billionaire Elon Musk and former presidential hopeful Vivek Ramaswamy to what he describes as a new “Department of Government Efficiency,” or shortened to “DOGE,” also the name for a popular internet dog meme and cryptocurrency in the last decade.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump said the new entity would function outside of government.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“To drive this kind of drastic change, the Department of Government Efficiency will provide advice and guidance from outside of Government, and will partner with the White House and Office of Management &#038; Budget to drive large scale structural reform, and create an entrepreneurial approach to Government never seen before,” Trump said in a statement.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Musk was also present, sitting in the front row during Trump’s visit with House Republicans earlier Wednesday.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Also on Tuesday night, Trump announced Fox News host Pete Hegseth as his pick for secretary of Defense, a position that requires managing hundreds of billions in Pentagon spending.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Trump endorses Johnson</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Trump joined House Republicans Wednesday morning before his meeting with Biden at the White House. At a hotel near the U.S. Capitol, Trump received a standing ovation from GOP lawmakers, according to congressional pool reports.</p>
<p dir="ltr">House Speaker Mike Johnson, Republican of Louisiana, introduced Trump, calling him a “singular figure in American history,” according to congressional pool reports. </p>
<p dir="ltr">House Republicans are also planning to have their leadership elections late Wednesday, but it’s expected that Johnson will be selected to continue the role, although an official vote for the speaker’s gavel will take place in January.</p>
<p dir="ltr">At the meeting, Trump threw his support behind Johnson to continue in his role as House speaker, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/house-republicans-meet-triumphant-trump-elect-leadership-team-rcna179669" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to NBC News.</a></p>
<p dir="ltr">During the meeting, Trump touted GOP wins in keeping control of the lower chamber. Although Republicans are on track to hold their slim majority, The Associated Press, the news organization that States Newsroom relies upon for race calls based on <a href="https://www.ap.org/elections/our-role/how-we-call-races/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decades of experience</a>, has not called the House for Republicans though it might happen soon.</p>

Democrats have 207 seats, with 12 races still to be called.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump also joked about wanting to run for another term in office — <a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-22/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">something that the U.S. Constitution prohibits</a>, as presidents are limited to only serving two terms. </p>
<p dir="ltr">“I suspect I won’t be running again unless you do something,” Trump told members, who laughed, according to pool reports.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Democrats ready to push back</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Chair of the House Democratic Caucus Pete Aguilar said Wednesday that Democrats are ready to work with the incoming administration in a bipartisan manner, but are also prepared to push back on efforts to further restrict reproductive rights, such as a national abortion ban, and any changes to the Affordable Care Act.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We’re clear-eyed about the challenge ahead of us,” Aguilar, Democrat of California, said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">He acknowledged the failure of Democrats to regain control of the House.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I think it’s appropriate for the current caucus to reflect on what happened, to listen to listen to our constituents, to listen to American people, to listen to our members, to gather data, and then to chart a path forward,” he said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Aguilar added that Democrats plan to look at voter data to understand the issues important to their voting bloc.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I don’t want to have broad generalizations of any group or geographic or otherwise, without that data in front of me,” he said. “I think it’s very clear to us that for people with two jobs, the economy is, gas and groceries and rent. We’ll need to speak to those issues if we’re going to be the party that speaks to our community members and people working, everyday Americans, then we need to speak to those issues, and … that’s on us to communicate.”</p>

(Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)</p><p dir="ltr">WASHINGTON — Vice President Kamala Harris Wednesday afternoon called Donald Trump to concede the 2024 presidential race, according to a senior Harris aide.</p>
<p dir="ltr">During the call, the Democratic presidential nominee “discussed the importance of a peaceful transfer of power and being a president for all Americans,” the senior aide said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Steven Cheung, the Trump campaign communications director said in a statement that during the call Trump “acknowledged Vice President Harris on her strength, professionalism, and tenacity throughout the campaign, and both leaders agreed on the importance of unifying the country.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Harris&nbsp;delivered a concession speech at 4 p.m. Eastern to her supporters at Howard University in Washington, D.C. Her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, was in the crowd as well.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The outcome of this election is not what we wanted,” she said. “But hear me when I say this: The light of America&#8217;s promise will always burn bright.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Harris told her supporters to not be discouraged by the results, but to continue the fighting and organizing.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Sometimes the fight takes a while,” she said. “This is not a time to throw up our hands, this is a time to roll up our sleeves.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The college was also the site of her election watch party on Tuesday night, which quickly turned somber after her path to the White House narrowed when the southern battleground states of North Carolina and Georgia swung to Trump.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Harris, who was originally expected to attend her own election night party, never arrived on campus, disappointing supporters and Howard alums.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/ap-former-president-donald-trump-wins-second-term" target="_blank">Trump was declared the presidential winner</a> early Wednesday, according to projections by The Associated Press.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Harris said it was important to accept the results of the race – something that Trump did not do four years ago, leading to a violent insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“That principle, as much as any other, distinguishes democracy from monarchy or tyranny and anyone who seeks the public trust must honor it,” she said. “At the same time, in our nation, we owe loyalty not to a president or a party, but to the Constitution of the United States.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Harris said that while she concedes the election, “I do not concede the fight that fueled this campaign.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The presidential race isn’t the only loss for Democrats. They lost control of&nbsp; the U.S. Senate and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/it-was-hell-good-day-us-senate-gop-takes-election-victory-lap" target="_blank">Republicans are favored to take the House</a>, potentially giving the GOP a trifecta in Washington.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The election saw a deep gender divide,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/10/25/harris-trump-poll-gender-gap/75697863007/" target="_blank">with exit poll surveys</a> showing women tended to favor Harris over Trump.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It’s the second time a woman has led as the presidential candidate for a major party and it’s the second time a woman has lost to Trump. Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton lost to him in 2016.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The election came two years after the constitutional right to an abortion was stripped away by the U.S. Supreme Court. The incoming 47th president cemented its conservative majority by hand-picking three justices.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Harris, whose bid only began in July after President Joe Biden suspended his reelection campaign, had a little over 100 days to pick a running mate, release policy plans to appeal to voters and hit the seven battleground states.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Despite the sprint of a campaign, Harris said she was grateful for the campaign she and Walz ran and the coalition they built along the way.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Some of that coalition was fractured, though. There was deep dissatisfaction within her party for the current administration’s handling of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Michigan, which has a high Arab American population and is a state that Biden won in 2020,&nbsp;<a href="https://michiganadvance.com/2024/11/06/trump-turns-michigan-red-once-again/" target="_blank">voted for Trump</a>, according to projections by The Associated Press.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It was Harris’ second time running for the White House, after her first run quickly fizzled in 2019 before Biden picked her as his running mate.</p>
<p dir="ltr">With Biden out of the race following a disastrous June debate that rattled his party’s belief he could win a rematch against Trump, the coronation of Harris as the party heir breathed new hope into Democrats along with a flood of cash. They raised more than $1 billion, according to the campaign.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Despite the funding and new enthusiasm among Democrats, the swing states of Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin ultimately went to Trump, giving him a clear path to the White House with 292 Electoral College votes out of 270 needed to win the White House, to her 224 votes,&nbsp;<a href="https://apnews.com/live/trump-harris-election-updates-11-5-2024" target="_blank">according to The Associated Press.&nbsp;</a></p>

<p dir="ltr">The first-ever&nbsp;<a href="https://idahocapitalsun.com/2024/05/30/breaking-trump-found-guilty-on-34-felony-counts-in-ny-hush-money-trial/" target="_blank">convicted</a> felon elected to the Oval Office,&nbsp;Trump by 8 a.m. Eastern had won four of the vital seven swing states in which he and the Democratic nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris, spent most of their time campaigning through 2024.</p>
<p dir="ltr">North Carolina,<a href="https://georgiarecorder.com/2024/11/06/after-bitter-defeat-in-2020-trump-comes-back-to-win-georgia-in-2024/" target="_blank"> Georgia</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://penncapital-star.com/election-2024/donald-trump-projected-to-win-pennsylvanias-19-electoral-votes/" target="_blank">Pennsylvania</a> and Wisconsin all voted for Trump, giving him 277 Electoral College votes compared to 224 for Harris.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Still without a victor declared were Michigan, Nevada and Arizona. But even without them, Trump — who will be the nation’s 47th president as well as having been its 45th — had more than enough of the 270 votes required to win the Electoral College.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump still faces charges of election subversion related to his actions in connection with the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">GOP Senate</h4>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/struggle-control-congress-too-close-call-states-begin-adding-votes" target="_blank">Republicans also took control&nbsp;</a>of the U.S. Senate, guaranteeing Trump a relatively smooth path in confirming his appointments to the courts and the Cabinet in the coming months.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As of Wednesday morning, Republicans had nabbed 52 seats in the Senate and Democrats had 42, the AP said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Montana Sen. Jon Tester, a longtime centrist Democrat viewed as his party’s most vulnerable senator in 2024,&nbsp;<a href="https://dailymontanan.com/2024/11/06/sheehy-leads-tester-in-early-montana-us-senate-results/" target="_blank">was ousted&nbsp;</a>by Republican Tim Sheehy in a high-profile race called by the AP on Wednesday morning.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Control of the U.S. House had not yet been called but Republicans were leading there on Wednesday morning, 198-180.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If they were to maintain control of the chamber, that would set up an extraordinary Republican trifecta in Washington that likely could expedite legislation including on taxes, the debt, reproductive rights and immigration.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Harris is expected to address the nation on Wednesday, her campaign co-chair, Cedric Richmond, told a crowd that had gathered Tuesday night for an election watch party at her alma mater, Howard University in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p dir="ltr">All results are unofficial until local election officials across the country&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eac.gov/election-officials/election-results-canvass-and-certification" target="_blank">verify and certify</a> the outcome in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncsl.org/elections-and-campaigns/election-certification-deadlines" target="_blank">coming days and weeks</a>.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Trump legal problems</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Trump’s long presidential campaign was punctuated by a busy legal schedule that included two federal cases, still&nbsp;<a href="https://missouriindependent.com/2024/10/03/special-counsel-jack-smith-reveals-new-evidence-against-trump-in-2020-election-case/" target="_blank">ongoing</a>, and cases in Georgia and New York. The former president was convicted in New York in May on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records related to hush money paid to a porn star ahead of the 2016 election. His sentencing is scheduled for Nov. 26.</p>
<p dir="ltr">His long appeal of the government’s 2020 election subversion charges against him eventually received a victory in the U.S. Supreme Court when the conservative majority ruled that former presidents enjoy criminal immunity for core constitutional duties, and presumed immunity for duties on the office’s outer perimeter, but none for personal actions.</p>
<p dir="ltr">After the election subversion case was returned to the lower court, U.S. special counsel Jack Smith presented new evidence to underscore that Trump schemed to overturn 2020 presidential results in a personal capacity, acting alongside his private lawyers. Trump has indicated numerous times that, if elected to another presidency, he would oust Smith.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump’s refusal to concede the 2020 presidential contest to President Joe Biden eventually culminated in his supporters’ violent attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Speaking to his supporters in West Palm Beach, Florida, earlier on Wednesday, alongside his running mate, Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, Trump thanked “thousands of friends in this incredible movement like nobody’s ever seen before.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Frankly, this was, I believe, the greatest political movement of all time. There’s never been anything like this in this country,” Trump said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump promised to “heal” the country and that his second presidency “will truly be the golden age of America.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We overcame obstacles that nobody thought possible,” Trump said.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">A roller coaster race</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Trump had spent most of his reelection campaigning against President Joe Biden, who bowed out of the race in the summer after a disastrous debate performance.</p>
<p dir="ltr">That required the Trump team to pivot to a new campaign with a candidate Trump had never gone up against — Harris.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Harris, who touted herself as the underdog, tried to position herself as a new generation of leadership and through her policy plans on housing, health care and the economy, offering a new chapter for Americans.</p>
<p dir="ltr">She heavily ran on her support of reproductive rights and the threat to democracy that a second Trump presidency would bring, citing the immunity ruling from the Supreme Court.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In the end, Trump’s core campaign issues of immigration and criticisms of the economy appeared to have swayed voters, and she fell short of claiming any of the swing state votes that offered her a path toward victory.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As it became clear late Tuesday that she was falling behind in support in key states that carried Biden to the White House in 2020, thousands of her supporters who gathered at Howard University for a<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/harris-watch-party-dc-hope-gives-way-anxiety" target="_blank"> watch party left in waves</a> as her chances for victory continued to narrow.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Trump led with 267 Electoral College votes overall nationally, eclipsing Democratic nominee Vice President Harris’ 224, just before 3 a.m. Eastern, according to the AP. A total of 270 votes are needed to win.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Associated Press had not yet projected results for the other battleground states of Arizona, Michigan, Nevada and Wisconsin. Trump, however, held leads in all four. Alaska’s three electoral votes are reliably Republican and were expected in the morning hours.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Decision Desk HQ and Fox News also called Wisconsin for Trump, which would give him an Electoral College victory. The AP and other media that project election winners, including NBC News, CNN and The New York Times, had not called the race by 3 a.m. Eastern.</p>

<h4 dir="ltr">    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Trump promises to ‘heal’</h4>

<p dir="ltr">Trump amassed electoral votes shortly after polls closed in states forecast in his favor, and picked up critical wins in key battlegrounds when the AP projected victories for him in <a class="ext" title="(opens in a new window)" href="https://ncnewsline.com/2024/11/05/ap-trump-wins-north-carolina/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-extlink="">North Carolina</a> just before midnight, <a class="ext" title="(opens in a new window)" href="https://georgiarecorder.com/2024/11/06/after-bitter-defeat-in-2020-trump-comes-back-to-win-georgia-in-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-extlink="">Georgia</a> at about 1 a.m., and <a class="ext" title="(opens in a new window)" href="https://penncapital-star.com/election-2024/donald-trump-projected-to-win-pennsylvanias-19-electoral-votes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-extlink="">Pennsylvania</a> just before 2:30 a.m. Trump won the key states in his successful 2016 campaign but lost them in his failed reelection bid in 2020.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Speaking to his supporters in West Palm Beach, Florida, Trump thanked “thousands of friends in this incredible movement like nobody’s ever seen before.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Frankly, this was, I believe, the greatest political movement of all time. There&#8217;s never been anything like this in this country,” Trump said.</p>

<p dir="ltr">&#8220;We overcame obstacles that nobody thought possible,” Trump said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">During his roughly 25-minute speech, Trump thanked his family and campaign staff, and invited his running mate, Sen. J.D. Vance of Ohio, and Dana White, CEO of Ultimate Fighting Championship, to speak on stage.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Vance, poised to become Trump’s vice president, said a new administration would usher in an economic “comeback” for the U.S.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I think we just witnessed the greatest political comeback in the history of the United States of America,” Vance said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">White thanked popular podcast host Joe Rogan for his election eve endorsement of Trump.</p>

<p dir="ltr">As election night turned into early Wednesday, the previously energetic crowd at Howard <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/harris-watch-party-dc-hope-gives-way-anxiety" target="_blank">started to dwindle</a>. Once campaign co-chair Cedric Richmond announced Harris would not be speaking at the party, the last stragglers left in waves, the mood quickly souring.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Richmond said that Harris would address supporters and the nation later Wednesday, and tried to give a small pep talk.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We still have votes to count,” he said. “We still have states that have not been called yet.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">In reference to reports that Harris’ watch party had begun to wind down, Trump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt commented on X “sounds like joy has left the building…” The word “joy” was a rallying cry among the Harris camp and supporters during her whirlwind campaign.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Billionaire Elon Musk, a major funder and surrogate for the Trump campaign, posted on his platform X a photo of a launching rocket ship along with the words, “The future is gonna be fantastic.” Shortly before that he posted a photoshopped image of himself hauling a sink into the Oval Office with the message, “Let that sink in.”</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘I don’t feel as hopeful’</h4>

	</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Harris had planned to spend election night at her alma mater, Howard University in Washington, D.C., where her supporters gathered, but she never left from the vice president’s residence at the Naval Observatory, according to press pool reports.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Early in the evening, Lalika Gerald, a Howard graduate from 2005, remembers studying TV production in the library that is now overlooking an election night rally for potentially the first Black woman to lead the country.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It’s a very exciting time just to be here and to know that a Bison like myself is about to be our president,” she said, referring to the university’s mascot.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The 41-year-old from Prince George’s County, Maryland, said she has felt a roller coaster of emotions throughout the day.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“As excited and as hopeful as I am, you know you never know what might happen,” she said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a moment for us to be really seen.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">By the time the event ended around 1 a.m., Harris supporters’ said the hope they felt at the start of the evening had left.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I don’t know what’s happening, but it’s very stressful right now,” Liane Crosey said as she left the watch party. “Seeing the numbers coming in, I don’t feel as hopeful.”</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">A convicted felon in the Oval Office</h4>

<p dir="ltr">Trump is positioned to make history as the first-ever <a class="ext" title="(opens in a new window)" href="https://idahocapitalsun.com/2024/05/30/breaking-trump-found-guilty-on-34-felony-counts-in-ny-hush-money-trial/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-extlink="">convicted</a> felon elected to the presidency. His long presidential campaign tangled with a busy legal calendar that included two federal cases, still <a class="ext" title="(opens in a new window)" href="https://missouriindependent.com/2024/10/03/special-counsel-jack-smith-reveals-new-evidence-against-trump-in-2020-election-case/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-extlink="">ongoing</a>, and cases in Georgia and New York. The former president was convicted in New York in May on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records related to hush money paid to a porn star ahead of the 2016 election. His sentencing is scheduled for Nov. 26.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump ascended on the campaign trail despite facing federal felony charges for scheming to overturn the 2020 presidential election.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Four years ago, Trump refused to concede to Biden in 2020 and lost dozens of court cases challenging the results.</p>
<p dir="ltr">His repetition of the lie that the 2020 was “stolen” from him became a main feature of his campaign rallies in 2024.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The major policy area he focused on during the campaign was curtailing immigration, and he promised to conduct mass deportations of immigrants in the country illegally. Trump and Vance also targeted legal immigrants, including by amplifying the debunked rumor that Haitians with Temporary Protected Status in Springfield, Ohio, were eating pets.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump also pledged to ramp up tariffs, taxes on goods produced overseas, in an effort to boost U.S. manufacturing.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump and campaign officials tried to distance the candidate from a comprehensive conservative policy blueprint written by the Heritage Foundation, a Washington think tank. The plan calls for restructuring the federal government to empower the president, further restricting abortion access and limiting immigration, among other proposals.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump would likely enjoy friendly lawmakers in Washington over the next two years, as Republicans were <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/republicans-take-majority-control-us-senate-after-ohio-west-virginia-victories" target="_blank">projected to win</a> control of the U.S. Senate. Control of the House remained unknown early Wednesday,</p>
<p dir="ltr">Despite several U.S. House races remaining too close to call, Republican Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana issued a written statement declaring “There is hope and morning in America again!”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Donald Trump is now our President-elect, chosen by the American people for such a time as this. The citizens of our great country used their voices to decisively reject four more years of Harris’ open borders, high crime, increased cost of living, weaponized government, dangerous radical woke ideology, and weakness on the world stage &#8211; demanding instead, a return to common sense, peace, and prosperity,” Johnson said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump is not officially president-elect until election results are certified.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">In the states</h4>

	</h4>
<p dir="ltr">States Newsroom journalists fanned out across the country Tuesday, talking to voters outside churches, community centers, schools and courthouses, where the presidential race not only weighed on their minds, but congressional contests and ballot initiatives as well.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Voter Stephanie Capps in Raleigh, <a class="ext" title="(opens in a new window)" href="https://ncnewsline.com/briefs/election-day-in-battleground-nc-voters-reflect-on-history-and-the-future-theyd-like-to-see/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-extlink="">North Carolina</a>, said she brought her 9-year-old daughter to the polls to show her democracy in action.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Because a little over 100 years ago, women couldn’t vote,” Capps told NC Newsline. “And so, we talked about how it’s really important for her to learn to vote.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The presidential campaigns continued to hit swing states, speak to the press and issue statements reminding voters of their rights.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Harris stayed in Washington, D.C, where she called in to several radio shows in battleground states. According to her campaign, she was a guest on Power 99 in Philadelphia with Cappuchino and KDKA NewsRadio in Pittsburgh with Larry Richert, the Big Tigger Morning Show in Atlanta, Georgia and Foxy 107.2 with Karen Clark in Raleigh, North Carolina.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I’m proud to have a lot of support out of Pittsburgh, it’s a historic city,” Harris <a class="ext" title="(opens in a new window)" href="https://x.com/KDKARadio/status/1853814481379266648" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-extlink="">told</a> Richert, who asked about her 10 campaign visits to the western Pennsylvania city.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Harris’ running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, stopped in Harrisburg, <a class="ext" title="(opens in a new window)" href="https://penncapital-star.com/election-2024/election-day-2024-live/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-extlink="">Pennsylvania</a>, Tuesday where he spoke to supporters and volunteers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Walz told reporters after the event “I think the choice couldn’t be starker.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump <a class="ext" title="(opens in a new window)" href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/113432133120615756" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-extlink="">posted</a> video messages on his platform Truth Social throughout Tuesday reminding voters to remain in line if they arrive before polls close.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Republicans, we’re doing very well. Stay on line, don’t get off line, and vote. Make sure you get through and vote. We’re gonna have a big victory tonight,” Trump said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Biden, who was the presumed Democratic nominee until he dropped his reelection bid and endorsed Harris just over 100 days ago, did not make any public appearances Tuesday.</p>

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON — Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump on Monday hopscotched across swing states and prepared for what could be an exceedingly tense election night watch as the 2024 presidential election sped to a close.</p>
<p>So far, more than 80.6 million Americans have voted, according to&nbsp;<a href="https://election.lab.ufl.edu/early-vote/2024-early-voting/" target="_blank">the University of Florida’s Election Lab.</a></p>
<p>In a presidential contest that pollsters say is virtually a toss-up, seven battleground states likely will determine the outcome of the election. The results could take days, election officials repeatedly&nbsp;<a href="https://dailymontanan.com/2024/10/25/final-results-may-lag-in-deadlocked-presidential-contest-anxious-election-officials-warn/" target="_blank">have warned</a> and stressed again Monday. The 2020 presidential race was called for President Joe Biden the Saturday following Election Day.</p>
<p>“Election Day is not results day,” said&nbsp;Quentin Turner, the Common Cause Michigan executive director, during a Monday webinar.</p>
<p>Jen O&#8217;Malley Dillon, chair of the Harris-Walz campaign, made similar remarks during a Monday call with reporters, but still issued predictions as to when the campaign expects to know some results from key states.</p>
<p>She said the campaign understands that results could take a while based on each state’s law. Some states begin counting votes after the polls close, some as they come in.</p>
<p>O&#8217;Malley Dillon said because of that, the campaign expects on election night to have “near complete results” for North Carolina, Michigan and Georgia, “and then partial results from Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Arizona.”</p>
<p>She said the campaign expects by Wednesday morning to have most of the “results in from Wisconsin and additional results from Pennsylvania and potentially Michigan.”</p>
<p>“And then on Wednesday and beyond, we expect additional results from Pennsylvania, Arizona, Nevada,” she said. “So we think some of this stuff will trickle in, but keep in mind that some ballots will continue to be counted for many days.”</p>
<p>Democracy groups like Common Cause said during the webinar that they are prepared for high voter turnout on Election Day.</p>
<p>Bob Phillips, the Common Cause North Carolina executive director, said he expects about 1 to 1.5 million voters in his state on Election Day.</p>
<p>“For the most part, we&#8217;ve seen a lot of voter enthusiasm,” he said.</p>
<p>He added that there have been more calls on the voter help hotline than in the previous elections.</p>
<p>“There is definitely higher tension, more emotion, particularly among the electioneering that goes on outside the precincts, as well as some issues since this is our first major election where we&#8217;ve had the voter ID requirements,”&nbsp;Phillips said.</p>
<h4>It’s all about Pennsylvania (almost)</h4>
<p>Harris is closing out her campaign in the battleground state of Pennsylvania, which offers the most electoral votes of the swing states at 19.</p>
<p>O&#8217;Malley Dillon said the campaign will have get-out-the-vote rallies late Monday night in the seven swing states with Harris and surrogates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We’ve believed all along this race is going to be incredibly close, and so it&#8217;s really going to come down to mobilization, and that&#8217;s why an event like tonight matters so much,” she said.</p>
<p>Harris will head to Scranton and then to Allentown, a city with a large Puerto Rican population that Democrats have courted following racist remarks by a comedian at a Trump rally that referred to the island of Puerto Rico as “garbage.” She’ll then rally in Philadelphia with musical performances from The Roots and Lady Gaga among others.</p>
<p>Trump will make four stops in three states — starting in Raleigh, North Carolina, stopping twice in Pennsylvania at&nbsp;Reading and Pittsburgh and finishing in Grand Rapids, Michigan.</p>
<p><a href="https://ncnewsline.com/2024/11/04/trump-in-final-nc-rally-looks-for-a-third-straight-win-harris-barnstorms-pennsylvania/" target="_blank">While at his first campaign stop in North Carolina</a> on Monday, he told supporters that if he wins another term he will levy a 25% tariff on Mexico if migrants continue to head from that country to the U.S.-Mexico border.</p>
<p>“You&#8217;re the first I’ve told this to,” Trump told the crowd. “And if that doesn’t work, we’ll go up to 50. And if that doesn’t work, we’ll go to 75.”</p>
<p>Trump will hold his election night watch party at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Palm Beach, Florida. Harris will have hers at her alma mater at Howard University in Washington, D.C.</p>
<h4>Polling puzzles</h4>
<p>Polls published over the weekend still showed a tight race, but one in Iowa&nbsp;<a href="https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/2024/11/02/harris-takes-slim-lead-over-trump-in-final-iowa-poll-before-2024-election/" target="_blank">rattled the Trump campaign</a>, showing that Harris had a lead in a state that the former president easily won in 2016 and 2020.</p>
<p>The highly regarded pollster — somewhat of a Midwestern oracle — showed that independent and women voters were breaking for Harris.</p>
<p>Both candidates are within the margin of error in all seven swing states meaning any of the states — Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin — could tip to either one.</p>
<p>Over the weekend, Harris appeared on NBC’s live sketch comedy show, “Saturday Night Live.”&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/nbc-donald-trump-campaign-free-ad-time-nascar-race-kamala-harris-snl-sketch-1236052709/" target="_blank">Trump also appeared</a> on a free commercial during NBC’s broadcast of a Sunday NASCAR race in compliance with the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fcc.gov/sites/default/files/political_programming_fact_sheet.pdf" target="_blank">FCC’s Equal Time rule.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://michiganadvance.com/2024/11/04/harris-vows-to-end-war-in-gaza-during-final-michigan-rally-at-msu/" target="_blank">On Sunday, while at Michigan State University,</a> Harris pledged that she would do “everything in her power” to end the war in Gaza if she were to win the White House. Michigan has a high Arab American population that has been critical of Democrats&#8217; handling of the Israel-Hamas war, where&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/longform/2023/10/9/israel-hamas-war-in-maps-and-charts-live-tracker" target="_blank">more than 44,000 Palestinians have been killed.</a></p>
<p><a href="/article/harris-takes-slim-lead-over-trump-final-iowa-poll-2024-election">During a Sunday rally</a> in Pennsylvania, Trump told supporters that he shouldn’t have left the White House after losing the 2020 presidential race and then he joked about not minding if journalists were shot while covering his campaign event.&nbsp;</p>

(Jeenah Moon/Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON — On the final frantic Sunday of the presidential race, while Vice President Kamala Harris spoke at a Black church service in Michigan, former President Donald Trump told supporters at a Pennsylvania rally that he “shouldn’t have left” the White House after he lost the 2020 presidential election.</p>
<p>At a campaign rally at an airplane tarmac in Lititz, Pennsylvania, Trump again perpetuated the falsehood that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from him and claimed that this year’s election would also be stolen because election results could take a while to be counted.</p>
<p>“These elections have to be decided by 9 o’clock, 10 o’clock, 11 o’clock on Tuesday night,” he said. “Bunch of crooked people.”</p>
<p>Election officials have warned that<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/final-results-may-lag-deadlocked-presidential-contest-anxious-election-officials-warn" target="_blank"> results could take days to finalize.</a></p>
<p>The comments came as new polls showed good news for Harris. A highly regarded pollster in Iowa showed a shocking lead for Harris there and New York Times-Siena College polls of the seven major battleground states showed slight leads for Harris in some Sun Belt swing states, while Trump made gains in the Rust Belt.</p>
<p>As the campaign dwindles to its final hours, here are seven key developments from this weekend:</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Trump says he ‘shouldn’t have left’ White House</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Trump spent much of his Lititz rally complaining about the election process and media coverage, seeming to repeat his false claim that he was the rightful winner of the 2020 election.</p>
<p>“I shouldn’t have left, I mean, honestly,” Trump said. “We did so well, we had such a great — so now, every polling booth has hundreds of lawyers standing there.”</p>
<p>He also <a href="https://penncapital-star.com/election-2024/pennsylvania-lititz-lancaster-trump-rants-about-polls-says-i-dont-mind-if-someone-shoots-through-the-fake-news-at-pa-rally/" target="_blank">joked about shooters targeting reporters</a> covering his event, the Pennsylvania Capital-Star reported.</p>
<p>He pointed to protective glass covering him on two sides and noted a press section was on another side of him.</p>
<p>“To get me, someone would have to shoot through the fake news,” Trump said. “And I don’t mind that so much.”</p>
<p>In a statement that seemed to contradict the plain meaning of Trump’s remark, campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung denied Trump was encouraging violence against reporters.</p>
<p>“The President’s statement about protective glass placement has nothing to do with the Media being harmed, or anything else,” Cheung wrote. “It was about threats against him that were spurred on by dangerous rhetoric from Democrats. In fact, President Trump was stating that the Media was in danger, in that they were protecting him and, therefore, were in great danger themselves, and should have had a glass protective shield, also. There can be no other interpretation of what was said. He was actually looking out for their welfare, far more than his own!”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Harris heads to the Big Apple</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Harris made an unscheduled trip to New York City Saturday, where she made a surprise appearance during the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Funs6yyEw" target="_blank">cold open of NBC’s “Saturday Night Live”</a> alongside actress Maya Rudolph, who portrays the veep in the live sketch comedy show.</p>
<p>In the three-minute opener, Rudolph approaches a vanity dresser and wishes she could talk to “someone who was in my shoes” as a “Black, South Asian woman running for president, preferably from the Bay Area.”</p>
<p>Rudolph turns toward the faux mirror, and Harris, on the other side, responds, “You and me both, sister.”</p>
<p>They wore identical suits and Harris turned to Rudolph and said that she is “here to remind you, you got this.”</p>
<p>“Because you can do something your opponent cannot do. You can open doors,” Harris said, joking about a recent campaign event where Trump tried to open the door to a garbage truck.</p>
<p>Rudolph cackled, doing an impersonation of Harris’ laugh, before the two women began a pep talk with puns of Harris’ first name.</p>
<p>“Now, Kamala, take my palmala,” Rudolph said. “The American people want to stop the chaos.”</p>
<p>“And end the dramala,” Harris said.</p>
<p>Harris and Rudolph then stood side-by-side and said they were going to vote for “us.”</p>
<p>Harris joked and asked Rudolph if she was registered to vote in the battleground state of Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Harris headed from New York to Michigan, where she spoke Sunday at the historically Black Greater Emmanuel Institutional Church of God in Christ in Detroit.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Polling bombshell in a non-swing state</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Polling in the latest <a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/iowa-poll/2024/11/02/iowa-poll-kamala-harris-leads-donald-trump-2024-presidential-race/75354033007/" target="_blank">Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll</a>, reported a shocking lead for Harris in a state that Trump easily won in 2016 and 2020, with women and independent voters breaking for the Democratic presidential nominee.</p>
<p>The poll shows Harris leading with 47% of likely voters compared to 44% with Trump, <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/harris-takes-slim-lead-over-trump-final-iowa-poll-2024-election" target="_blank">according to the Register.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://cdn.nucleusfiles.com/a4/a4f946f9-4e27-4bae-8e32-e77638040f06/11.2-djt-iowa-poll.pdf?_nlid=S2fMS533ZU&amp;_nhids=g2dmirPedj" target="_blank">The Trump campaign </a>quickly called the Iowa poll “a clear outlier,” and instead cited a <a href="https://emersoncollegepolling.com/november-2024-iowa-poll-trump-53-harris-43/" target="_blank">poll by Emerson College </a>as accurate, which showed the former president having 53% support compared to 43% for Harris.</p>
<p>Trump also took his grievances to his social media site, Truth Social.</p>
<p>“All polls, except for one heavily skewed toward the Democrats by a Trump hater who called it totally wrong the last time, have me up, BY A LOT,” he wrote. “I LOVE THE FARMERS, AND THEY LOVE ME.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/03/us/politics/harris-trump-times-siena-poll.html" target="_blank">The New York Times/Siena College Sunday polls</a> found that Harris is improving in North Carolina and Georgia while Trump has gained in Pennsylvania and maintains a strong advantage in Arizona. Harris is still ahead in Nevada and Wisconsin, according to the poll, but Michigan and Pennsylvania remain tied. The poll of Georgia showed Harris with a 1-point edge.</p>

<p>Both candidates were within the polls’ margins of error, meaning that the seven swing states could tip to either candidate.</p>
<p>While both Democratic and Republican politicians have expressed confidence in winning the election, polling experts said during a <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?539658-1/political-analysts-discuss-2024-elections&amp;live" target="_blank">panel</a> hosted by the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute in late October there’s no way to know for sure who will control the White House until all the votes are counted.</p>
<p>Kristen Soltis Anderson, founding partner at Echelon Insights, said there’s about a 60% chance that this year’s nationwide polling has been mostly correct, though she emphasized that the people who focus their careers on political polling are dedicated to providing a realistic understanding of where campaigns are headed.</p>
<p>“We are trying our very hardest to get it right,” Anderson said. “Even if you don’t believe in our altruism or even if you don’t believe in our academic and intellectual integrity, believe in nothing else than our financial incentives. You want to be the pollster who was right. It is very good business to be the pollster who is right.”</p>
<p>Jeff Horwitt, partner at Hart Research, said during the panel his firm has wrapped up its polling for this election year and expressed skepticism about the polls that emerge close to Election Day.</p>
<p>“Because our job, for our political clients, is to tell them the contours of the election,” Horwitt said. “How do we convince voters to vote for our candidate? What are the most effective messages? What do we have to think about? So the public polls are seeing now, they’re super interesting, and they’re important, but they’re not actionable.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Trump welcomes sexist insult</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>As Trump spent his weekend in a campaign blitz across North Carolina, he welcomed a sexist remark from a rallygoer in Greensboro who suggested that Harris worked as a prostitute.</p>
<p>During the Saturday night rally, Trump questioned whether Harris’ previously worked at a McDonald’s. Her campaign has stated that she worked the summer job in 1983. In a campaign photo opportunity, <a href="https://penncapital-star.com/election-2024/trump-weekend-pennsylvania-arnold-palmer-latrobe-mcdonalds-steelers-elon-musk/" target="_blank">Trump visited a closed McDonald’s </a>in Pennsylvania where he handed fries to pre-screened people at the drive through.</p>
<p>“It’s so simple,” Trump said. “She’s a significant liar, and when you lie about something so simple, so she never worked there –”</p>
<p>“She worked on a corner,” a man from the crowd shouted.</p>
<p>Trump laughed at the crude comment.</p>
<p>“This place is amazing,” Trump said. “Just remember, it’s other people saying it, it’s not me.”</p>
<p>Harris has significantly gained support with women, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/10/10/the-harris-trump-matchup/" target="_blank">according to the Pew Research Center. </a>Trump has often dismissed criticism that he has lagged among women.</p>
<p>During a rally last week in Wisconsin, and in an attempt to win over women voters, Trump said that he would protect women and “I’m going to do it whether the women like it or not.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Trump repeats ‘father of fertilization’ claim</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>At a Greensboro, North Carolina, rally Saturday, Trump again called himself “the father of fertilization,” a title <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-claims-title-father-ivf-fox-news-town-hall-women-voters" target="_blank">he first gave himself</a> during a Fox News town hall with women voters last month.</p>
<p>“I consider myself to be the father of fertilization,” he said Saturday.</p>
<p>The Iowa poll — and other late surveys — showed a stark gender gap, with women voters increasingly preferring Harris.</p>
<p>Nearly twice as many Iowa independent women voters, 57% to 29%, favored Harris. That represents a major gain for Harris since a September survey by the same pollster showed the vice president’s edge with independent women was only 5 percentage points.</p>
<p>Democrats have sought to exploit their advantage with women voters by emphasizing Trump’s record on abortion access. The former president appointed three of the U.S. Supreme Court justices who voted in 2022 to overturn the federal right to an abortion.</p>
<p>A flurry of state-level policymaking on reproductive rights has followed, including restrictions on in vitro fertilization, a common fertility treatment.</p>
<p>Trump has said he opposed an Alabama Supreme Court ruling that outlawed the treatment in the state, but had not previously taken a position on the issue.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Early voters up to 76 million</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>More than 76 million voters had already cast ballots through early and mail voting by midday Sunday, according to <a href="https://election.lab.ufl.edu/early-vote/2024-early-voting/" target="_blank">the University of Florida’s Election Lab</a>.</p>
<p>Roughly half of those have come in states that track voters’ partisanship. About 700,000 — roughly 2% of the total — more Democrats have voted in those states than Republicans, but the numbers include California, where Democrat Joe Biden won more than 5 million more votes than Trump in the 2020 election.</p>
<p>Among the six states — Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina, Colorado, Idaho and Virginia — that track voters’ gender, women accounted for 54% of the vote, compared to 43.6% for men.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed"> ‘Election eve’ blitz</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The candidates for president and vice president plan to sprint across the key swing states in the campaign’s final days, with particular focus on Pennsylvania, the largest of the contested states where polling has shown a deadlocked race.</p>
<p>The Harris campaign announced Sunday the vice president would be in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia on Monday, the night before Election Day, for rallies and musical performances. Scheduled entertainers and speakers included Oprah Winfrey, The Roots, Lady Gaga and Katy Perry.</p>
<p>Harris is also set to hold an event in Allentown, Pennsylvania, a majority-Latino city, on Monday. Part of Harris’ closing message has highlighted racist comments Trump and his supporters have made about Latinos.</p>
<p>After spending much of the weekend in North Carolina, Trump will also hold a rally in Pittsburgh on Monday evening.</p>
<p>Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Harris’ running mate, will be in Milwaukee on Monday.</p>
<p>Trump running mate Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance will hold events in Georgia, Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania on Monday.</p>
<p>Harris will hold an election night watch party at her alma mater, Howard University, in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>Trump’s watch party will be at his Mar-a-Lago club in West Palm Beach, Florida.</p>

(Photo by Melissa Sue Gerrits/Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON — As an exceedingly bitter, tight and dark campaign for the presidency moves into its last moments, apprehensive election officials and experts warn Election Day is only the first step.</p>
<p>The closing of the polls and end of mail-in voting kick off a nearly three-month process before the next president of the United States is sworn in on Inauguration Day in January. New guardrails were enacted by Congress in 2022 to more fully protect the presidential transition, following the Jan. 6, 2021 mob attack on the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters and a failed scheme to install fake electors.</p>
<p>But even before that shift to a new chief executive begins, a presidential victor is unlikely to be announced election night or even the following day.</p>
<p>It’s a result that will possibly take days to determine, given tight margins expected in seven swing states. Officials needed four days to count all the votes to determine President Joe Biden the victor of the 2020 presidential election.</p>
<p>In states like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, the law does not allow that process to begin for millions of mail-in ballots until Election Day. Other states allow pre-processing of ballots.</p>
<p>Trey Grayson, Kentucky’s former Republican secretary of state, said ballot authentication could be on different timelines across the country after voting ends on Election Day.</p>
<p>“We have 50 states, plus D.C., that pretty much all do it differently,” Grayson, who served as president of the National Association of Secretaries of State, told reporters Friday on a call of bipartisan former state election officials who are working to explain the process to the public.</p>
<p>It could mean “in a very close election that we don’t know on election night who the president is or who controls the House or the Senate, but we should feel confident over the next couple of days, as we work through that, that we’re going to get there,” he said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Lawsuits and potential recounts </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Those delays, which former President Donald Trump seized on to spread the baseless lie that the election was stolen from him, are expected again in November, especially as all eyes will be on the battleground states — Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.</p>
<p>Additionally, there already are hundreds of pre-election lawsuits, mainly filed by Republicans, ranging from election integrity challenges to accusations of noncitizens allowed to vote in federal elections — something that rarely happens and is already illegal. The legal challenges could further spark delays.</p>
<p>“We will not have a winner on election night most likely and so we need to be able to prepare the public for this,” said Virginia Kase Solomón, the president and CEO of the democracy watchdog group Common Cause, during a Tuesday briefing.</p>
<p>She added that her organization will focus on combating misinformation and disinformation on election night and beyond.</p>
<p>“There is the potential that somebody could claim the win before … all of the votes have been counted,” she said.</p>
<p>In the early morning hours after Election Day in 2020, before results from key states were determined, Trump falsely claimed he won in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duE8tnrSmNc&amp;t=3s" target="_blank">an address at the White House.  </a></p>
<p>On top of that, experts say this year could see election denial erupting in countless courtrooms and meeting rooms in localities and the states, as well as across social media, if doubts are sown about the results.</p>
<p>Recounts could also delay an official election result, and the laws vary from state to state.</p>
<p>For example, in Pennsylvania, if a candidate demands a recount, three voters from each of the over 9,000 precincts have to petition for a recount.</p>
<p>“We’ve never seen that happen actually in Pennsylvania,” Kathy Boockvar, the commonwealth’s former Democratic secretary of state, said on Friday’s call with reporters.</p>
<p>An automatic statewide recount is triggered in Pennsylvania if there’s a difference of a half percent of all votes cast for the winner and loser. The final recount results, by law, are due to the secretary of state by Nov. 26, and results would be announced on Nov. 27, Boockvar said.</p>
<p>The margin in Pennsylvania’s 2020 results for the presidential election was between 1.1% and 1.2%, not enough to trigger the automatic recount, Boockvar said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Taking out the shrubs</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>State election officials have been preparing for the past year to train poll workers to not only run the voting booths but for possible violence — a precaution put in place after the 2020 election — and have beefed up security around polling locations.</p>
<p>On Friday, Trump posted on X that the election “will be under the closest professional scrutiny and, WHEN I WIN, those people that CHEATED will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the Law, which will include long term prison sentences so that this Depravity of Justice does not happen again.”</p>
<p>A reporter asked Grayson about the possibility of aggression from poll watchers. The Republican National Committee <a href="https://gop.com/press-release/trump-campaign-and-rnc-unveil-historic-100000-person-strong-election-integrity-program/" target="_blank">announced</a> in April a “historic move to safeguard the integrity of the electoral process,” establishing party-led trainings for poll watchers.</p>
<p>Poll watchers are not a new concept, and Grayson said clear “safeguards” are in place.</p>
<p>“If you’re intimidating, you’re gone. There’s clear laws in every state on that,” he said.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/rising-trend/decision-2024" rel="attachment wp-att-40551" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft wp-image-40551 size-full" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/National-image-Horizontal.png" alt="" width="3240" height="720" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/National-image-Horizontal.png 3240w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/National-image-Horizontal-300x67.png 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/National-image-Horizontal-1024x228.png 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/National-image-Horizontal-768x171.png 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/National-image-Horizontal-1536x341.png 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/National-image-Horizontal-2048x455.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 3240px) 100vw, 3240px" /></a></p>
<p>Celestine Jeffreys, the city clerk in Green Bay, Wisconsin, said during a Wednesday roundtable with election workers that the city has an Election Day protocol in place that includes everything from blocking off streets to City Hall to getting rid of shrubbery.</p>
<p>“We have actually removed bushes in front of City Hall” to ensure no one can be concealed behind them, she said. In the second assassination attempt on Trump earlier this year, a gunman hid in bushes outside Trump’s private golf course.</p>
<p>New Mexico Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver said during a Tuesday briefing she is focused on the physical safety of election officials.</p>
<p>During the event with the National Association of Secretaries of State, she said such safety is not only a priority during voting but when officials move to certify the state’s election results in December.</p>
<p>“We have all been spending a lot more time on physical security and making sure that our election officials at all levels are more physically secure this year,” Toulouse Oliver said. “And of course, you know when our electors meet in our states, you know, ensuring for the physical security of that process and those individuals as well.”</p>
<p>On Dec. 17, each state’s electors will meet to vote for the president and vice president. Congress will vote to certify the results on Jan. 6.</p>
<p>“We are thinking a lot more about this in 2024 than we did in 2020, but I think that each one of us… have a playbook in mind for how to handle any unanticipated eventualities in the certification process,” she said.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/law-enforcement-officials-prepare-possible-post-election-violence-dc" target="_blank">It’s a security precaution</a> that the U.S. Secret Service is also taking.</p>
<p>For the first time, Congress’ certification of the Electoral College on Jan. 6 has been designated a National Special Security Event, something that is usually reserved for Inauguration Day on Jan. 20.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The 2020 experience</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>In 2020, The Associated Press did not call the presidential election for Biden <a href="https://blog.ap.org/behind-the-news/calling-the-2020-presidential-race-state-by-state" target="_blank">until</a> 11:26 a.m. Saturday, Nov. 7 — roughly three-and-a-half days after polls closed. The AP, as well as other media organizations, project election winners after local officials make initial tabulations public.</p>
<p>Those tallies are then <a href="https://www.eac.gov/election-officials/election-results-canvass-and-certification" target="_blank">canvassed, audited and certified</a>, according to each state’s legal timeline. Recounts may also extend the timeline before final certification.</p>
<p>The vote totals reported in Pennsylvania — a state that carried 20 Electoral College votes in 2020 — put Biden over the top for the 270 needed to win the presidency.</p>
<p>Trump refused to concede the race, and instead promised to take his fight to court.</p>
<p>For the next two months, Trump and his surrogates filed <a href="https://electioncases.osu.edu/case-tracker/?sortby=filing_date_desc&amp;keywords=&amp;status=all&amp;state=all&amp;topic=25" target="_blank">just over 60 lawsuits</a> challenging the results in numerous states. Ultimately none of the judges found evidence of widespread voter fraud.</p>
<p>The next step was for Congress to <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2014-title3/html/USCODE-2014-title3-chap1-sec15.htm" target="_blank">count</a> each state’s certified slate of electors, which by law, it must do on the Jan. 6 following a presidential election.</p>
<p>However, in the weeks leading up to Jan. 6, Trump and his private lawyers worked to replace legitimate slates of electors with fake ones, according to <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/collection/january-6th-committee-final-report?path=/GPO/January%206th%20Committee%20Final%20Report%20and%20Supporting%20Materials%20Collection" target="_blank">hundreds</a> of <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/67656604/266/2/united-states-v-trump/" target="_blank">pages</a> of records compiled by a special congressional investigation, and by the U.S. Department of Justice.</p>
<p>Trump pressured then-Vice President Mike Pence to block ratification of the Electoral College’s vote at the Jan. 6 joint session of Congress, because the vice president’s role in the certification of electoral votes was not exactly clear in the Electoral Count Act of 1887.</p>
<p>Pence ultimately refused.</p>
<p>Thousands of Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 following a “Stop the Steal” rally at The Ellipse park, south of the White House, where Trump told the crowd “We will never concede.”</p>
<p>The mob assaulted police officers, broke windows to climb inside and hurled violent threats aimed at elected officials, including the desire to “hang” Pence. More than 1,500 defendants <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/44-months-jan-6-attack-us-capitol" target="_blank">have been charged</a> by the Department of Justice.</p>
<p>Congress stopped its process of reviewing the state electors in the 2 p.m. Eastern hour as police ushered the lawmakers to safety. The joint session resumed at roughly 11:30 p.m., and Pence called the majority of electoral votes for Biden at nearly 4 a.m. on Jan. 7.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">New law on presidential transition</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>To deter another Jan. 6 insurrection, Congress <a href="https://missouriindependent.com/2022/09/28/key-u-s-senate-panel-advances-bill-aimed-at-preventing-another-jan-6/" target="_blank">passed</a> the <a href="https://www.appropriations.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/JRQ121922.PDF" target="_blank">Electoral Count Reform and Presidential Transitional Improvement Act of 2022</a> as part of a massive appropriations bill.</p>
<p>The Electoral Count Reform Act codifies into law that the vice president, who also serves as the president of the U.S. Senate, only ceremoniously reads aloud a roll call of the votes.</p>
<p>Most notably, the provision raises the threshold for lawmakers to make an objection to electors. Previously, only one U.S. House representative and one U.S. senator would need to make an objection to an elector or slate of electors.</p>
<p>But under the new law, it would take one-fifth of members to lodge an objection and under very specific standards — 87 House members and 20 senators.</p>
<p>The Electoral Count Reform Act also identifies that each state’s governor is the official responsible for submitting the state’s official document that identifies the state’s appointed electors, and says that Congress cannot accept that document from any official besides the governor, unless otherwise specified by the state’s law.</p>
<p>Trump and his allies tried to replace legitimate slates of electors in several states with fake electors who would cast ballots for Trump.</p>
<p>The Presidential Transitional Improvement Act provides candidates with funding and resources for transitional planning, even if a candidate has not conceded after the election.</p>
<p>There are already issues with the transition of power. The top Democrat on the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability, Maryland Rep. Jamie Raskin, <a href="https://oversightdemocrats.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/democrats-oversight.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/2024-10-23.JBR%20to%20Trump%20and%20Vance%20re%20transition%20MOUs.pdf" target="_blank">sent a Wednesday letter</a> to Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, urging them to sign documents to ensure a peaceful transition of power.</p>
<p>“With fewer than three weeks left until an election in which the American people will select a new President of the United States, I urge you to put the public’s interest in maintaining a properly functioning government above any personal financial or political interests you may perceive in boycotting the official transition law and process,” Raskin wrote.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Denial expected at all levels of government</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Experts warn the effort to delay certification of the vote is largely being fought at the local and state levels, and that several groups are gearing up to sow doubt in the election outcome.</p>
<p>Devin Burghart, president of the Institute for Research and Education on Human Rights, said on a press call Wednesday that since 2020, “election denial has shifted away from the capital to county election commission meetings, courtrooms, cyber symposiums and countless conspiracies in preparation for a repeat this November.”</p>
<p>“This time, the baseless claim that undocumented immigrants are somehow swamping the polls has fueled the ‘big lie’ machine,” Burghart said.</p>
<p>Boockvar said the noncitizen topic is not new.</p>
<p>“I’d like to level set and remind everyone that it’s been illegal at the federal level since 1996 and you know, when you think back on 2002 the <a href="https://www.eac.gov/about/help_america_vote_act.aspx" target="_blank">Help America Vote Act</a> basically required voters to provide ID when they register, which is usually a driver’s license or a Social Security number, and states are checking that data against the DMV database. And these protections are enormously successful,” Boockvar said.</p>
<p>In two high-profile cases, the U.S. Department of Justice sued Republican-led efforts in <a href="https://alabamareflector.com/2024/10/16/federal-judge-blocks-alabama-secretary-of-states-voter-removal-plan/" target="_blank">Alabama</a> and <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/judge-orders-people-removed-from-voter-rolls-to-be-reinstated-gov-youngkin-to-seek-appeal/">Virginia</a> to purge voter rolls after alleging thousands of noncitizens were registered to vote. Both states were ordered to stop the programs and reinstate voters – though Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin promised Friday to appeal and even escalate to the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>More than 165 electoral process lawsuits across 37 states have been filed by both parties since 2023 leading up to the 2024 presidential election, according to a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2024-election-court-lawsuits-influence-voting/" target="_blank">survey</a> by Bloomberg of pre-election cases. The journalists found that more than half the cases have been filed in swing states, and challenge almost every facet of the voting process, from absentee voting, to voter roll management, voter eligibility and vote certification.</p>
<p>Republican and conservative groups have filed roughly 55% of the lawsuits, mostly aimed at narrowing who can vote, and overall most of the cases were filed in August and September, according to the analysis.</p>
<p>Courts threw out dozens of lawsuits claiming voter fraud in 2020.</p>
<p>Mai Ratakonda, senior counsel at States United Democracy Center, said anti-democracy groups have used litigation “to legitimize their efforts to sow doubt in our election system.”</p>
<p>“We’ve unfortunately continued to see this trend of filing lawsuits to bolster and legitimize narratives that our elections are insecure and laying the groundwork to contest results later,” Ratakonda told reporters on a press call Wednesday hosted by the organization, whose stated mission is to protect nonpartisan election administration.</p>

(Aristide Economopoulos / NJ Monitor)</p><p><em>This is one in a series of States Newsroom reports on the major policy issues in the presidential race.</em></p>
<p>WASHINGTON — A mass shooting at a Georgia high school in September thrust the issue of gun violence to the forefront of the presidential race.</p>
<p>Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump agree that gun violence is a major problem, but they offer strikingly different views on how to address it.</p>
<p>Two 14-year-old students and two math teachers were killed at Apalachee High School.</p>
<p>While at a campaign rally in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, shortly after the Apalachee shooting, Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, <a href="https://georgiarecorder.com/2024/09/04/georgia-national-democratic-leaders-call-for-gun-safety-legislation-after-apalachee-high-shooting/" target="_blank">renewed calls</a> for an assault weapons ban, universal background checks and red flag laws.</p>
<p>Students should not have to be frightened of school shootings, she said. “They are sitting in a classroom where they should be fulfilling their God-given potential, yet some part of their big, beautiful minds is worried about a shooter breaking through the door,” she said. “It doesn’t have to be this way.”</p>
<p>Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, expressed his condolences.</p>
<p>“Our hearts are with the victims and loved ones of those affected by the tragic event in Winder, GA,” Trump wrote on his social media site Truth Social. “These cherished children were taken from us far too soon by a sick and deranged monster.”</p>
<p>Trump has survived two assassination attempts, one where he was injured in the ear, but has not changed his stance on guns.</p>
<p>After the first assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania, Trump campaign senior adviser Chris LaCivita said at <a href="https://tennesseelookout.com/2024/07/16/gun-rights-advocates-at-convention-spell-out-plans-if-gop-gains-control-in-november/" target="_blank">the Republican National Convention</a> that the party won’t back away from its support of Second Amendment rights.</p>
<p>During a Univision town hall with undecided Latino voters that aired Wednesday night, an audience member asked Trump how he would explain his gun policy to “parents of the victims of school shootings.”</p>
<p>“We have a Second Amendment and a right to bear arms,” Trump said. “I’m very strongly an advocate of that. I think that if you ever tried to get rid of it, you wouldn’t be able to do it. You wouldn’t be able to take away the guns, because people need that for security, they need it for entertainment and for sport, and other things. But they also, in many cases, need it for protection.”</p>
<p>A majority of Americans view gun violence as a problem — about 60% — and they expect it to only get worse over the next five years, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2023/06/28/gun-violence-widely-viewed-as-a-major-and-growing-national-problem/" target="_blank">according to a Pew Research Center study.</a></p>
<p>This year there have been 421 mass shootings, according to the <a href="https://www.gunviolencearchive.org" target="_blank">Gun Violence Archive</a>, which tracks gun violence in the U.S.</p>
<p>For a third year in a row, in 2022 — the most recent year of finalized data — firearms were <a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2024/guns-remain-leading-cause-of-death-for-children-and-teens" target="_blank">the leading cause of death </a>for children and teens ages 1 to 17, <a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/sites/default/files/2024-09/2022-cgvs-gun-violence-in-the-united-states.pdf" target="_blank">according to a report from the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions.</a></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Harris’ record</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>In the aftermath of two mass shootings in 2022, Congress passed the most comprehensive bipartisan gun safety legislation in decades.</p>
<p>In Uvalde, Texas, 19 children and two teachers were murdered, making it the second-deadliest mass shooting since the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre in 2012. In Buffalo, a white supremacist targeted a Black neighborhood and killed 10 Black people in a grocery store.</p>
<p>The package that Congress passed and President Joe Biden signed into law provided $11 billion in mental health funds and $750 million for states to enact red flag laws. It also closed loopholes and established a White House Office for Gun Violence Prevention, among other provisions.</p>
<p>Red flag laws allow courts to temporarily remove a firearm from an individual who is a threat to themselves or others, among other provisions.</p>
<p><a href="https://washingtonstatestandard.com/briefs/biden-administration-to-create-new-gun-violence-prevention-office/" target="_blank">Biden tasked Harris with leading</a> the White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention, which helps local communities implement that 2022 bipartisan gun legislation and aids communities impacted by gun violence.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Trump’s record</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>During Trump’s first presidency, he had a mixed record on gun policy.</p>
<p>After a mass shooting in Las Vegas, Nevada, the Trump administration moved to ban bump stocks, which allow a semi-automatic rifle to quickly fire bullets.</p>
<p>However, the U.S. Supreme Court, to which Trump appointed three conservative justices, <a href="https://missouriindependent.com/briefs/u-s-supreme-court-overturns-ban-on-bump-stocks-used-in-las-vegas-mass-shooting/" target="_blank">struck down the ban on bump stocks. </a></p>
<p>Trump also threatened to veto legislation from <a href="https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/saphr8hr1112hr_20190225.pdf" target="_blank">Congress that would have enhanced background checks on guns.</a></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Promise: a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines</h4>

	
<p>Democrats have long called for a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, which are typically used in mass shootings.</p>
<p>The U.S. used to have a ban on assault weapons, but it expired in 2004 and Congress failed to renew the ban.</p>
<p>“I am in favor of the Second Amendment, and I believe we need to reinstate the assault weapons ban,” Harris <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbGlPpQUmMA" target="_blank">said at the White House</a> in late September.</p>
<p>Fulfilling this promise would come down to the makeup in Congress and overcoming the Senate’s 60-vote threshold to advance legislation.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Promise: a rollback of Biden regulations</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>During a forum with the National Rifle Association in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, in February, Trump promised to roll back all gun-related regulations that the Biden administration has implemented.</p>
<p>“Every single Biden attack on gun owners and manufacturers will be terminated on my very first week back in office, perhaps my first day,” Trump said.</p>
<p>Trump specifically said he would cancel the Biden administration’s <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/23/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-comprehensive-strategy-to-prevent-and-respond-to-gun-crime-and-ensure-public-safety/" target="_blank">“zero-tolerance” policy,</a> which revokes federal licenses from gun dealers who violate firearm laws.</p>
<p>Brian Hughes, a Trump campaign senior adviser, said in a statement to States Newsroom that if Trump wins a second term, “he will terminate every single one of the Harris-Biden’s attacks on law-abiding gun owners his first week in office and stand up for our constitutionally enshrined right to bear arms.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Promise: tax credits, no gun-free zones</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>During an NRA event in April 2023, Trump said that he was supportive of a tax credit for teachers who wanted to carry a firearm in schools.</p>
<p>Trump has also previously voiced his disapproval of schools being gun-free zones. Days after the Uvalde school shooting, Trump attended another NRA event in Houston, Texas, where he argued that a gun-free zone does not allow people to protect themselves.</p>
<p>“As the age-old saying goes, the only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun,” Trump said. “The existence of evil is one of the very best reasons to arm law-abiding citizens.”</p>
<p>He argued that schools should have metal detectors, fencing and an armed police officer.</p>

In this photo, a ghost gun is displayed before the start of an event about gun violence in the Rose Garden of the White House April 11, 2022 in Washington, D.C. (Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON — U.S. Supreme Court justices Tuesday grappled with whether the Biden administration exceeded its authority when it set regulations for kits that can be assembled into untraceable firearms, and a majority of justices seemed somewhat skeptical the rule was an overreach.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docket/docketfiles/html/public/23a82.html" target="_blank">Garland v. VanDerStok,</a> the nine justices are tasked with determining whether a rule issued by the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives in 2022 overstepped in expanding the definition of “firearms” to include “ghost guns” under a federal firearms law.</p>
<p>Ghost guns are firearms without serial numbers and can be easily bought online and quickly assembled in parts, usually through a kit. Law enforcement officials use serial numbers to track guns that are used in crimes.</p>
<p>Arguing on behalf of the Biden administration, U.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar told the justices that there has been an “explosion in crimes” with untraceable guns across the U.S.</p>
<p>She added that the federal government has for years required gun manufacturers and sellers to mark firearms with a serial number.</p>
<p>“The industry has followed those conditions without difficulty for more than half a century, and those basic requirements are crucial to solving gun crimes and keeping guns out of the hands of minors, felons and domestic abusers,” Prelogar said.</p>
<p>She said with the kits to make untraceable homemade guns in as little as 15 minutes, those manufacturers “have tried to circumvent those requirements.”</p>
<p>Prelogar said untraceable guns “are attractive to people who can’t lawfully purchase them or who plan to use them in crime.”</p>
<p>Because the ATF saw a spike in crimes committed with those firearms, Prelogar said it promulgated the 2022 rule. The Biden administration said since 2016, it’s seen <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/04/11/fact-sheet-the-biden-administration-cracks-down-on-ghost-guns-ensures-that-atf-has-the-leadership-it-needs-to-enforce-our-gun-laws/#_ftn1" target="_blank">a tenfold increase in ghost guns.</a></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What the rule does</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The regulation does not ban ghost guns, but requires manufacturers of those firearm kits or parts to add a serial number to the products, as well as conduct background checks on potential buyers. The regulation also clarified those kits are considered covered by the 1968 Gun Control Act under the definition of a “firearm.”</p>
<p>The Biden administration is advocating for the Supreme Court to reverse a lower court’s decision that favored gun rights groups and owners that argued the agency exceeded its authority.</p>
<p>Pete Patterson on Tuesday represented <a href="https://www.firearmspolicy.org/vanderstok" target="_blank">those gun rights groups</a>, such as the Firearms Policy Coalition and clients, and argued the ATF expanded the definition of a firearm to “include items that may readily be converted to a frame or receiver.”</p>
<p>A frame or receiver is the primary structure of a firearm that holds the other components that cause the gun to fire.</p>
<p>“Congress decided to regulate only a single part of a firearm, the frame or receiver, and Congress did not alter the common understanding of a frame or receiver,” he said. “ATF has now exceeded its authority by operating outside of the bounds set by Congress.”</p>
<p>The case has already been before the high court on an emergency basis in 2023. The three liberal justices, Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson, and two conservative justices, Chief Justice John Roberts Jr. and Amy Coney Barrett, allowed the regulation to remain in place while going through legal challenges.</p>
<p>The case is similar to the Supreme Court decision that struck down a Trump-era ban on bump stocks from the ATF, but that was on the grounds of a Second Amendment argument.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Omelets and turkey chili kits</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Justice Samuel Alito questioned Prelogar whether the kits were defined as weapons.</p>
<p>“Here’s a blank pad and here’s a pen,” he said. “Is this a grocery list?”</p>
<p>She said it wasn’t because “there are a lot of things you could use those products for to create something other than a grocery list.”</p>
<p>Alito asked her if he had eggs, chopped up ham, peppers and onions, “is that a Western omelet?”</p>
<p>“No, because, again, those items have well known other uses to become something other than an omelet,” Prelogar said. “The key difference here is that these weapon parts kits are designed and intended to be used as instruments of combat, and they have no other conceivable use.”</p>
<p>Barrett asked if her answer would change if “you ordered it from HelloFresh and you got a kit and it was like turkey chili, but all of the ingredients are in the kit?”</p>
<p>Prelogar said it would.</p>
<p>“We are not suggesting that scattered components that might have some entirely separate and distinct function could be aggregated and called a weapon, in the absence of this kind of evidence that that is their intended purpose and function,” she said.</p>
<p>“But if you bought, you know, from Trader Joe’s, some omelet-making kit that had all of the ingredients to make the omelet, and maybe included whatever you would need to start the fire in order to cook the omelet, and had all of that objective indication that that’s what’s being marketed and sold, we would recognize that for what it is,” Prelogar continued.</p>
<p>Roberts asked Patterson what the purpose would be of selling a receiver without a hole in it, meaning the gun is not complete.</p>
<p>Patterson argued that the kits are mainly for gun hobbyists, who would have to drill their own holes to put the product together.</p>
<p>“Some individuals enjoy, like working on their car every weekend, some individuals want to construct their own firearms,” Patterson said.</p>
<p>Roberts seemed skeptical.</p>
<p>“I mean drilling a hole or two, I would think doesn’t give the same sort of reward that you get from working on your car on the weekends,” Roberts said.</p>
<p>Patterson argued that putting together a homemade gun was somewhat difficult, especially if an individual had no experience.</p>
<p>“Even once you have a complete frame, it’s not a trivial matter to put that together,” he said. “There are small parts that have to be put in precise locations.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">No hobbyists</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>In her rebuttal, Prelogar pushed back on the notion that hobbyists were using those kits, arguing that “if there is a market for these kits, for hobbyists, they can be sold to hobbyists, you just have to comply with the requirements of the Gun Control Act.”</p>
<p>“What the evidence shows is that these guns were being purchased and used in crime. There was a 1,000% increase between 2017 and 2021 in the number of these guns that were recovered as part of criminal investigations,” she said. “The reason why you want a ghost gun is specifically because it’s unserialized and can’t be traced.”</p>

(Photo by Jim Vondruska/Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON — Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris said Tuesday during a radio interview that she supports changing a Senate procedure in order to codify the right to an abortion.</p>
<p>Vice President Harris said she is in favor of ending the 60-vote threshold in the Senate, known as the filibuster, to advance abortion rights legislation. But that task would hinge on Democrats agreeing to do so and holding on to majority control in the Senate, a difficult feat this November as <a href="https://idahocapitalsun.com/2024/09/23/racing-toward-election-day-control-of-u-s-senate-and-house-up-for-grabs/" target="_blank">Republicans appear potentially poised to take back the upper chamber. </a></p>
<p>“I think we should eliminate the filibuster for Roe, and get us to the point where 51 votes would be what we need to actually put back in law the protections for reproductive freedom and for the ability of every person and every woman to make decisions about their own body and not have their government tell them what to do,” she said during an interview with Wisconsin Public Radio.</p>
<p>Harris in 2022 said she would <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2022/09/10/remarks-by-vice-president-harris-at-the-2022-democratic-national-committee-summer-meeting/" target="_blank">cast a tie-breaking vote</a> in favor of abortion rights in her role as vice president. She has often pledged to sign into law a codification of Roe v. Wade, the constitutional right to an abortion struck down by the conservative U.S. Supreme Court in 2022.</p>
<p>Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said in August that Democrats would talk about rules changes to codify abortion rights, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/chuck-schumer-outlines-2025-agenda-democrats-sweep-eying-filibuster-ch-rcna167433" target="_blank">NBC reported.</a></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Trump in Pennsylvania</h4>

	
<p><a href="https://penncapital-star.com/election-2024/trump-talks-agriculture-and-china-in-smithton-ahead-of-rally-at-iup/" target="_blank">At a Monday rally in Pennsylvania</a>, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump referred to himself as a “protector” of women. Trump said women no longer needed to think about abortion and it is “now where it always had to be, with the states.”</p>
<p>“All they want to do is talk about abortion,” the former president said at the rally, referring to Democrats. “It really no longer pertains because we’ve done something on abortion that no one thought was possible.”</p>
<p>Trump has called for Senate Republicans to dismantle the filibuster, but GOP Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and other Republican leaders like No. 2 Sen. John Thune of South Dakota have vowed to keep the procedure in place.</p>
<p>Current Senate projections indicate Republicans are likely to gain control of the Senate. Republicans are also expected to pick up a seat in West Virginia, and only need to hold on to seats in Florida, Texas and Nebraska.</p>
<p>Democrats will need to secure wins in Arizona, Michigan, Montana, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Additionally, Senate Democrats would need to break a possible 50-50 tie through a Democratic presidency — if they want to remain the majority party and change the filibuster.</p>
<p>If Harris wins, and Democrats hold 50 seats in the Senate, then Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota, the vice presidential nominee, would be the tie-breaking vote.</p>
<p>During a Tuesday Senate press conference on abortion, Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington said she was supportive of Harris’ stance and that it would be a carve-out of the filibuster, rather than an elimination of it.</p>
<p>“What we are talking about is a simple procedure to allow, whenever rights are taken away from someone, that the U.S. Senate can, without being blocked by a filibuster, be able to restore those rights,” she said.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Harris, Trump and the economy</h4>

	
<p>The Harris campaign hosted a Tuesday press call with business owner and  “Shark Tank” investor Mark Cuban, to advocate for Harris’ economic policies.</p>
<p>Polls have found that voters view Trump as better for the economy. <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/09/09/in-tied-presidential-race-harris-and-trump-have-contrasting-strengths-weaknesses/" target="_blank">Pew Research</a> found that Trump’s key advantage is the economy, with 55% of voters viewing the former president as making good economic decisions, and 45% of voters viewing Harris as making good decisions about the economy.</p>
<p>“In a nutshell, the vice president and her team thinks through her policies,” Cuban said. “She doesn’t just off the top of her head say what she thinks the crowd wants to hear, like the Republican nominee.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Battleground states still the favorite spot</h4>

	
<p>The candidates will continue to campaign and travel, especially around battleground states this week.</p>
<p>Trump is scheduled Tuesday to visit Savannah, Georgia, where he will give an afternoon campaign speech about lowering taxes for business owners.</p>
<p>Walz is scheduled to head back to his home state of Minnesota Tuesday for a campaign reception there.</p>
<p>Harris is heading to <a href="https://penncapital-star.com/briefs/kamala-harris-to-campaign-in-pennsylvania-on-wednesday/" target="_blank">Pennsylvania Wednesday </a>for a campaign rally and then she’ll travel to Arizona on Friday and Nevada on Sunday.</p>
<p>Trump is stopping in Mint Hill, North Carolina, on Wednesday to give remarks about the importance of making goods in the U.S. His running mate, Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, will travel to Traverse City, Michigan, on Wednesday to rally supporters.</p>
<p>Vance on Thursday will give a campaign speech on the economy in Macon, Georgia, and then host a voter mobilization drive in Flowery Branch, Georgia.</p>
<p>On Friday, Trump is scheduled to rally supporters in Walker, Michigan and in the evening hold a town hall in Warren, Michigan.</p>

The FBI is leading the investigation and has said the incident “appears to be an attempted assassination of former President Trump” while he was golfing at his West Palm Beach, Florida, club. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON — Ryan Wesley Routh appeared in federal court Monday on two firearm charges after being apprehended by local law enforcement Sunday in what the FBI is investigating as a possible assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Authorities found a rifle in an area Routh was seen fleeing on Sunday, but acting Secret Service Director Ron Rowe said Monday that Routh did not fire his weapon. Trump was unharmed, his campaign confirmed shortly <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/fbi-investigates-apparent-assassination-attempt-against-trump-florida-former-president-safe" target="_blank">after Sunday’s incident. </a></p>
<p>The Secret Service agent who spotted someone holding a rifle near the treeline of Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida, fired toward the suspect. Trump, the GOP presidential nominee, was golfing at the time.</p>
<p>The incident is being investigated as the second assassination attempt against Trump in two months. He sustained an injury to his ear during a shooting in Butler, Pennsylvania, in July.</p>
<p>The Trump campaign Monday blamed Democrats and the media for the shooting.</p>
<p>“Democrats and the Fake News must immediately cease their inflammatory, violent rhetoric against President Trump — which was mimicked by yesterday’s would-be assassin,” the campaign said in a statement.</p>
<p>Routh, 58, appeared before U.S. Magistrate Judge Ryon McCabe in West Palm Beach federal court and was charged with possession of a firearm as a convicted felon and for obliterating the serial number on a firearm, according to court records. If convicted, he would face up to 20 years in prison.</p>
<p>Routh is being held in pretrial detention, <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25145956-routh" target="_blank">according to a criminal complaint</a> filed by FBI special agent Mark Thomas.</p>
<p>The FBI is leading the investigation.</p>
<p>Separately, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/desantis-state-will-conduct-credible-probe-trump-assassination-bid" target="_blank">the state will conduct its own investigation</a> into the possible assassination attempt to determine if Routh broke any state laws.</p>
<p>A detention hearing on the federal charges is set for Sept. 23, the U.S. Department of Justice said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Initial investigation</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>According to an affidavit accompanying the criminal complaint, at 1:31 p.m. Eastern on Sunday, a Secret Service agent walking the perimeter of the golf course spotted a rifle poking out of the tree line. The agent fired toward the rifle.</p>
<p>Rowe said at a Monday press conference that Routh did not have a line of vision at the former president and he did not fire his weapon.</p>
<p>“The agent who was visually sweeping the area … saw the subject armed with what he perceived to be a rifle and immediately discharged his firearm,” Rowe said. “The subject, who did not have line of sight to the former president, fled the scene. He did not fire or get off any shots at our agents.”</p>
<p>Routh fled in a Nissan SUV, according to the charging documents. A witness took photos of the license plate and local law enforcement officers stopped the vehicle in Martin County, which borders Palm Beach County.</p>
<p>West Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw said the witness was able to identify the driver as “the person that he saw running out of the bushes that jumped into the car.”</p>
<p>Routh was the sole person in the vehicle, according to the complaint.</p>
<p>According to the charging documents, agents found at the site Routh fled a digital camera, two bags, an SKS-style 7.62 x 39 rifle, which is the predecessor to the AK-47 assault rifle that law enforcement initially said they found Sunday, and a scope.</p>
<p>They also found a bag of food and noticed the rifle had the serial number obliterated “to the naked eye,” according to the filing documents.</p>
<p>The weapon also must have crossed state lines, Thomas noted.</p>
<p>“SKS-style 7.62 x 39 caliber rifles are not manufactured in the state of Florida,” Thomas wrote. “Therefore, I submit that there is probable cause to believe that the SKS-style rifle, which was seized from the tree line at Trump International… traveled in interstate or foreign commerce.”</p>
<p>The officers who stopped Routh on Interstate-95 noted that the license plate associated with the Nissan is registered to a 2012 white Ford truck that was reported stolen, according to the complaint.</p>
<p>Law enforcement found a July 10 Facebook post in which Routh directed his followers to contact him on WhatsApp and listed a contact number, according to the complaint.</p>
<p>Phone records associated with that number indicated that the phone “was located in the vicinity of the area along the tree line described from 1:59 a.m. Eastern to 1:31 p.m. Sunday,” according to the complaint.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Secret Service response</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The incident follows the July 13 <a href="https://penncapital-star.com/campaigns-elections/trump-campaigns-in-western-pennsylvania-with-rally-in-butler-county/" target="_blank">assassination attempt</a> of Trump during a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, in which the Secret Service was heavily criticized for its response.</p>
<p>Then-Director Kimberly Cheatle <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-secret-service-director-resigns-amid-fury-over-agency-failures-protecting-trump" target="_blank">resigned</a> and Congress <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-leaders-name-members-trump-assassination-attempt-task-force" target="_blank">established a bipartisan task force</a> to investigate the July shooting.</p>
<p>The leaders of that task force, U.S. Rep. Mike Kelly, Republican of Pennsylvania, and U.S. Rep. Jason Crow, a Colorado Democrat, have requested a briefing from the Secret Service on the security response to the shooting in West Palm Beach.</p>
<p>Members of Congress have been more complimentary of the Secret Service’s response to the Florida incident.</p>
<p>House Speaker Mike Johnson, Republican of Louisiana, commended the agency’s response during an interview with “Fox and Friends” on Monday.</p>
<p>“What I understand happened is that those agents that were with him yesterday saw that barrel of that gun between the bushes on a golf course. I mean, you know, that’s a difficult thing to spot. Thankfully, they did,” Johnson said. “But unlike in Butler, they did not pause. They immediately pulled their weapons and fired. I think that’s why this guy, the suspect, the shooter, threw the gun in the bushes and ran.”</p>
<p>Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, said on the Senate floor Monday that senators are open to giving the Secret Service more funding in legislation this month needed to keep the government open past Sept. 30.</p>
<p>“If the Secret Service is in need of more resources, we are prepared to provide it for them,” he said. “Possibly in the upcoming funding agreement.”</p>
<p>President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, said Sunday they’d been briefed on the matter and condemned political violence.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Prior arrests, Ukraine activism</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>In 2002, Routh was convicted in Greensboro, North Carolina, for possession of a weapon of mass destruction, which is a felony in the state. He was arrested after fleeing law enforcement and barricading himself for three hours in a business, <a href="https://greensboro.com/man-with-gun-barricades-self-inside-business/article_3006b4f9-9370-5b08-a54e-46c87faf6cbe.html" target="_blank">according to the Greensboro News &amp; Record.</a></p>
<p>He was also arrested in North Carolina in 2010 for possession of stolen goods.</p>
<p>Jeffrey Veltri, the special agent in charge of the bureau’s Miami field office, said during a Monday press conference that the FBI is conducting interviews with family and friends in Honolulu and Charlotte, North Carolina.</p>
<p>He added that in 2019 the FBI received a tip that Routh possessed a firearm, which was illegal because of his felony record. When FBI agents followed up, the tipster “did not verify providing the initial information,” Veltri said.</p>
<p>The agency referred the matter to Honolulu police, he said.</p>
<p>Routh was interviewed by The New York Times last year about his efforts to recruit Afghan soldiers who had fled the Taliban to fight in Ukraine’s war against Russia.</p>
<p>Routh, who had spent time in Ukraine and does not have any U.S. military experience, said he had planned to illegally obtain documents to move those Afghan fighters from Pakistan and Iran to Ukraine.</p>
<p>“We can probably purchase some passports through Pakistan, since it’s such a corrupt country,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/25/world/europe/volunteers-us-ukraine-lies.html" target="_blank">Routh told the Times in the interview</a>.</p>
<p>He wrote an ebook that he published on Amazon Kindle about his time in Ukraine, during which he became disillusioned about the country’s ability to win its war against Russia.</p>
<p>Kathleen Shaffer, who said Routh was her fiancé, set up a GoFundMe in 2022 to help Routh travel to Ukraine for 90 days to fight in the war.</p>
<p>The fundraiser has been deleted, but can be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240915214407/https://www.gofundme.com/f/ryans-international-volunteer-center-in-kyiv" target="_blank">accessed through internet archives.</a></p>
<p>“Any and all funds will support purchase of additional flags, tactical gear, any supplies needed for incoming volunteers, and hostel lodging,” according to the fundraiser, which raised $1,865 out of its goal of $2,500.</p>
<p>States Newsroom called a number associated with Shaffer, but could not reach her.</p>
<p>Public records show Routh currently lives in Kaaawa on the island of Oahu in Hawaii.</p>
<p>In 2018, Hawaii News Now <a href="https://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/story/37542027/in-kaaawa-drenching-rains-leave-behind-flooded-yards-and-a-muddy-mess/" target="_blank">interviewed Routh about torrential rains in Kaaawa</a>. Routh talked in the interview about a recent home project he finished after buying his home a year prior.</p>

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON — Latino voters are concerned with the high cost of living, the minimum wage and rising housing costs heading into the November elections, according to a comprehensive survey released Wednesday by UnidosUS, the largest Hispanic civil rights and advocacy center in the nation.</p>
<p>“Laying out a coherent economic policy agenda that will resonate with Latinos … would go a long way, I think, for our community,” Janet Murguía, the president and CEO of UnidosUS, said on a call with reporters detailing the <a href="https://unidosus.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Natl-deck-UnidosUS-2024-Pre-Election-Poll-of-Hispanic-Electorate.pdf" target="_blank">results of the survey.</a></p>
<p>The <a href="https://unidosus.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/National-crosstabs-UnidosUS-2024-Pre-Election-Poll-of-the-Hispanic-Electorate.pdf" target="_blank">survey included 3,000 eligible Hispanic voters</a> who were interviewed in either English or Spanish, from Aug. 5-23, with oversampling of residents of Georgia, North Carolina, Arizona, Pennsylvania, Nevada, Florida, Texas and California. The poll, conducted by BSP Research, had a margin of error of plus or minus 1.8 percentage points.</p>
<p>Murguía said Latinos are the second-largest voting-age population and 1 in 5 of them will be casting ballots for the first time in a presidential election this November.</p>
<p>“Top of mind are pocketbook issues,” she said. “Hispanic voters are most deeply concerned, like many of their fellow Americans, about the rising cost of living.”</p>
<p>Another issue that Latinos strongly supported is access to abortion. By a 71% to 21% margin, Latinos oppose abortion bans, according to the survey.</p>
<p>“They do not support making it illegal,” Murguía said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Minimum-wage workers</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Wages and jobs that provide economic security are a top priority for Latino voters, Gary Segura, who conducted the research poll for UnidosUS, said.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.epi.org/publication/swa-wages-2022/#:~:text=Low%2Dwage%20workers%20are%20disproportionately%20women%20and%20Black%20and%20Hispanic" target="_blank">Latino workers are disproportionately workers</a> who earn the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour, which has not increased since 2009. If the federal minimum wage had kept pace with inflation, it would be around $24 an hour, <a href="https://aflcio.org/what-unions-do/social-economic-justice/minimum-wage#:~:text=Since%20then%2C%20it%20has%20lost,would%20be%20%2424%20an%20hour." target="_blank">according to the AFL-CIO.</a></p>
<p>“The lived economy for Latinos is different than the lived economy for the nation as a whole,” Segura said.</p>
<p>Segura said during the poll, interviewers followed up with respondents on their concerns about jobs and wages and found that being able to afford necessities like food and housing were top issues.</p>
<p>“People are struggling to make ends meet,” he said.</p>
<p>The number one response was that “jobs don’t pay enough, or I have to take a second job to make ends meet,” Segura said. “We talk a lot about the low levels of unemployment in this society now, which is certainly good news, but the issue is that many of those jobs do not pay enough for the holder of that job to essentially pay their basic living expenses.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Opinions on immigration</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Murguía noted that immigration, which the Republican presidential nominee, former President Donald Trump, has made a core campaign issue, ranks fifth in priorities among Latino voters, tied with concern about gun violence and too-easy access to assault weapons.</p>
<p>“We want to be crystal clear that Latino voters overall are not buying into campaign tactics that demonize immigrants,” Murguía said. “They know the difference between those who mean us harm and those who are contributing to the fabric of our nation.”</p>

<p><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-promises-mass-deportations-undocumented-people-how-would-work" target="_blank">Trump has promised mass deportations</a> should he win a second term, a policy issue that has “virtually no support” by Latino voters sampled in the survey, Segura said.</p>
<p>Segura added that while Trump has campaigned on the issue, his promise to launch mass deportations is not particularly well known in Latino communities.</p>
<p>“Many of the people we speak to believe that (Trump) will do it if he can, but they just don’t actually believe that he can pull that off,” Segura said. “So there’s both a lack of awareness of these really draconian measures or proposals and then a lack of belief that they would actually come to pass.”</p>
<p>He added that he thinks it’s an opportunity for Democrats to campaign on the issue, but Vice President Kamala Harris has mainly criticized Trump for tanking a bipartisan border security deal.</p>
<p>“Our own results suggest that the primary border concern comes from voters who lean in the GOP direction in the first place, and so I don’t see a lot of movement there or a lot of risk for (Democrats), particularly in targeted advertisements and Hispanic voters,” Segura said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘Dismissive and diminishing language’</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The poll found that 55% of those Latinos had not been contacted by either political party this year.</p>
<p>“We often hear a really dismissive and diminishing language about Latino participation in elections,” Segura said. “‘Latinos don’t vote as often as they should. Latinos will let you down’ and so forth, and no one ever wants to address the elephant in the room, which is that no one is asking Latinos to vote.”</p>
<p>The Harris campaign last month launched a bilingual WhatsApp campaign to target Latino voters. Michelle Villegas, the national Latino engagement director for the Harris campaign, said during a Hispanic Caucus meeting at the Democratic National Convention that <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/harris-campaign-launches-bilingual-whatsapp-channel-draw-latino-voters-swing-states" target="_blank">the Latino vote is key to victory in three battleground states</a> — Arizona, Nevada and Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>The survey also found that running mates had an impact on Latino voters. Harris’ running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, gave her a 3-point boost, Trump’s running mate, Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, made his rating drop by 3 points.</p>
<p>“Vance has (a) negative impact on the Republican ticket, which is consistent with his low favorability among Latino voters,” according to the survey.</p>
<p>While Democrats have an advantage with Latino voters, and Harris has seen a boost in support compared to when President Joe Biden was in the race, she is still not reaching the levels of Latino support seen in previous elections, Clarissa Martinez De Castro, the vice president of the Latino Vote Initiative at UnidosUS, said.</p>
<p>“There is work to be done to reach the levels of support Democrats need and had achieved in previous elections, and more intense communication with these voters is needed, particularly on economic issues and immigration,” Martinez De Castro said.<br />
Equis Research, which conducts research and polling specifically about Latino voters, <a href="https://www.weareequis.us/research/xssaug2024bgmemo" target="_blank">found in a recent poll t</a>hat Harris has gained significant support from Latinos but that Harris “remains a few points shy of what Biden received in 2020” across battleground states.</p>

(Photo by Leon Neal/Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON — “Mass deportation now!” is a catchphrase for the Trump presidential campaign, as the Republican nominee proposes a crackdown on immigration that would oust thousands of undocumented people.</p>
<p>Often citing a deportation operation enacted by former President Dwight Eisenhower in the 1950s, former President Donald Trump has repeatedly vowed in campaign rallies that he plans to not only go back to the tough immigration policies of his first term in office, but expand them greatly.</p>
<p>“We’re going to have the largest deportation,” Trump said at a June campaign rally in Racine, Wisconsin. “We have no choice.”</p>
<p>The crowd responded with a chant: “Send them back. Send them back. Send them back.”</p>
<p>Mass deportation would be a broad, multipronged effort under Trump’s vision. The plan includes invoking an 18th-century law; reshuffling law enforcement at federal agencies; transferring funds within programs in the Department of Homeland Security; and forcing greater enforcement of immigration laws.</p>
<p>But whether a Trump administration could accomplish a mass deportation is doubtful. Historians, lawyers and immigration and economic experts interviewed by States Newsroom said removal of the more than 11 million undocumented people in the country would require enormous amounts of resources and overcoming legal hurdles. The effects on the U.S. economic and social fabric would be profound, they said.</p>
<p>“I don’t think it will happen,” Donald Kerwin, a senior researcher on migration at the University of Notre Dame, said of mass deportations. “But what it can do is it can make the lives of the undocumented and their families miserable.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">GOP support</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Trump repeatedly has pledged mass deportation.</p>
<p>At the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee in July, delegates waved “Mass Deportation Now” signs as Trump said “to keep our families safe, the Republican platform promises to launch the largest deportation operation in the history of our country.”</p>
<p>In a March rally in Dayton, Ohio, Trump said some undocumented immigrants were not “people.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know if you call them people,” Trump said. “In some cases they’re not people, in my opinion, but I’m not allowed to say that because the radical left says that’s a terrible thing to say.”</p>
<p>Trump’s campaign message comes as the Biden administration has dealt with the largest number of migrant encounters at the <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2021/11/09/whats-happening-at-the-u-s-mexico-border-in-7-charts/" target="_blank">southern border in 20 years</a> and immigration <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/611135/immigration-surges-top-important-problem-list.aspx" target="_blank">remains a top issue for voters. </a></p>
<p>However, since President Joe Biden signed a recent executive order, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/rcna159777" target="_blank">border crossings have fallen to their lowest level since he took office. </a></p>
<p>The GOP and Trump have now set their sights on the Democratic presidential nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>
<p>House Republicans already <a href="https://mainemorningstar.com/2024/07/25/six-u-s-house-dems-join-gop-in-condemning-harris-biden-administration-over-border-policy/" target="_blank">led a resolution disapproving </a>of Harris’ handling of the southern border and labeling her the “Border Czar,” a title she was given by the media. Her campaign has argued she never had such an official title  and her involvement with immigration has been focused on root causes of migration in Central and South America, rather than domestic immigration.</p>
<p>Even though Biden is no longer in the race, and has undertaken his own crackdown on immigration, he warned in mid-June, <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/biden-unveil-protections-some-undocumented-spouses-easier-daca-work-visas" target="_blank">during an announcement of protections offered for the spouses of long-term undocumented people</a>, that Trump would undertake mass deportations.</p>
<p>“Now he’s proposing to rip spouses and children from their families and homes and communities and place them in detention camps,” <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?536470-1/president-biden-announces-plan-undocumented-spouses-daca-anniversary" target="_blank">Biden said</a> of Trump. “He’s actually saying these things out loud, and it’s outrageous.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">How does the public feel?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Polls have found Americans are split on the idea of mass deportations but Republicans are more supportive.</p>
<p>A recent <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/poll-trump-biden-neck-and-neck-06-09-2024/" target="_blank">CBS News poll</a> that found nearly 6 in 10 voters favor a new government agency that would deport all undocumented immigrants. Of those voters, one-third were Democrats and 9 in 10 were Republicans.</p>
<p>The Trump campaign did not respond to multiple requests from States Newsroom for comment on the specifics of how a second Trump administration would plan to carry out mass deportations.</p>
<p>The massive deportation campaign that Trump often cites in his campaign rallies was conducted under the Eisenhower administration in the summer of 1954, with a pejorative, racist name attached to it.</p>
<p>“Following the Eisenhower model, we will carry out the largest domestic deportation operation in American history,” Trump said at a September rally last year in Ankeny, Iowa.</p>
<p>But what the Trump campaign is proposing is not an Eisenhower-style crackdown, said Michael Clemens, a professor in the Department of Economics at George Mason University.</p>
<p>“That policy was instituted hand-in-hand with a crucial other arm of the policy,” he said — which was that lawful work pathways for Mexicans to the U.S. were nearly tripled at the same time as the mass deportations.</p>
<p>“We’ve heard zero about substantial increases in lawful migration pathways from the people who are now talking about an Eisenhower-style crackdown,” Clemens said. “What they’re proposing is not an Eisenhower-style crackdown — it is something that the Eisenhower administration understood would not work and therefore it did not do.”</p>
<p>Additionally, the Eisenhower program was not as successful as thought.</p>
<p>The Einshower administration <a href="https://history.house.gov/Exhibitions-and-Publications/HAIC/Historical-Essays/Separate-Interests/Depression-War-Civil-Rights/" target="_blank">claimed that it deported 1 million people</a> back to Mexico, but the real number is a couple hundred thousand, said Eladio Bobadilla, an assistant history professor at the University of Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>“It wasn’t really about getting rid of immigrants in any real sense,” he said. “It was a way to sell to the American public that the problem had been solved.”</p>
<p>While one agency of the Eisenhower administration was deporting Mexicans — and often U.S. citizens of Mexican descent — another agency was sometimes bringing those same workers back in through the so-called Bracero program, which was created through <a href="https://prologue.blogs.archives.gov/2023/09/27/the-bracero-program-prelude-to-cesar-chavez-and-the-farm-worker-movement/#:~:text=The%20Bracero%20Program%20was%20a,lasted%20from%201942%20to%201964." target="_blank">an executive order by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt</a> in 1942.</p>
<p>States and local governments also worked in tandem with the 1950s deportation operation, something unlikely to happen under a second Trump administration, said David Bier, the director of immigration studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank.</p>
<p>“You also had the cooperation of the employers in those areas, because the Eisenhower administration was totally explicit that all the people that we’re deporting, you’re gonna get workers back legally through the Bracero guest worker program,” said Bier.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Obama deportation</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The most recent mass deportation campaign came during the Obama administration, said Clemens, who studies the economic effects of migration.</p>
<p>That was the Secure Communities program, which was a set of agreements between local law enforcement and federal level immigration enforcement officials such as Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection. Localities shared information about noncitizens who were encountered by local law enforcement, such as at traffic stops.</p>
<p>“Our most recent experience with mass deportation at the federal level, mostly under the Obama administration, directly harmed U.S. workers,” Clemens said.</p>
<p>The program was slowly rolled out, from 2008 to 2014, but over those six years nearly half a million workers were deported.</p>
<p>For every 10 workers who were deported, one U.S. job was eliminated, Clemens said.</p>
<p>“The net effect is that Secure Communities cost jobs for Americans across the country,” he said.</p>
<p><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/233150241700500101" target="_blank">In a recent paper for the Center for Migration Studies of New York,</a> Kerwin and Robert Warren found that mass deportations would financially harm U.S. families, especially the more than 3 million mixed-status families.</p>
<p>“The household income in those households plunges, and drops all of these families, or a high percentage of them, into poverty,” Kerwin said.</p>
<p>Of those mixed-status families, meaning some family members have different citizenship or immigration status, about 6.6 million members are U.S. citizens, said Warren, a senior visiting fellow at the center, a think tank that studies domestic and international migration patterns.</p>
<p>“So you say, ‘We took out one undocumented immigrant,’ but you damaged a family of U.S. citizens,” Warren said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Expanded executive authority</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The early architects of the Trump administration’s immigration policies such as Steven Miller and Ken Cuccinelli have laid out a second term that would expand the use of executive authority to carry out mass deportations and curtail legal immigration.</p>
<p>Such policies include limiting humanitarian visas and parole and moving to end Temporary Protected Status, known as TPS, said ManoLasya Perepa, policy and practice counsel with the American Immigration Lawyers Association.</p>
<p>Like the first Trump administration, Perepa anticipates that there will be a slew of lawsuits to file injunctions, such as preventing the ending of TPS.</p>
<p>The Trump administration dealt with a flurry of lawsuits over an order to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which protects a little over half a million undocumented people brought into the United States as children without authorization.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court eventually blocked it and kept the program, but DACA is still at risk of being deemed unlawful in a separate suit that is <a href="https://newjerseymonitor.com/2023/01/29/lengthy-timeline-for-daca-legal-fight-puts-lives-on-hold-for-years/" target="_blank">likely to head again to the high court. </a></p>
<p>“I think anybody with a status that keeps getting renewed is really, really at risk,” she said. “All you’re doing is driving people into the shadows.”</p>
<p>With the courts likely to get involved, Trump has said he wants to go back to his policy that expanded expedited removals, which means if an undocumented person is in the country for two years without a court hearing or any type of authorization, they can be deported without a hearing before a judge.</p>
<p>That type of removal is limited to 100 miles from a border zone, but the Trump administration expanded that to the rest of the country.</p>
<p>“The reality is, if the (Trump) administration increases interior enforcement, technically, all of these people could be detained,” Perepa said.</p>
<p>The Migration Policy Institute, a think tank that researches migration, <a href="https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/trump-deportations-unfinished-mission" target="_blank">has estimated</a> that “the expansion of expedited removal to the U.S. interior could apply to as many as 288,000 people.”</p>
<p>Miller, a senior White House adviser during the Trump administration, said on the right-wing podcast “The Charlie Kirk Show” in November 2023 that the U.S. military would need to be involved for those mass deportations to Mexico, which is “why Trump has talked about invoking the Alien Enemies Act.”</p>
<p>“Because of the logistical challenges involved in removing…you would need to build an extremely large holding area for illegal immigrants that at any given points in time, you know, could hold upwards of 50, 60, 70,000 illegal aliens while you are waiting to send them someplace, somewhere that would be willing to accept them,” Miller said.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/alien-and-sedition-acts" target="_blank">The Alien and Sedition Act, an 18th-century wartime law</a>, allows the executive branch to deport any noncitizen from a country that the U.S. is at war with and deport any noncitizen deemed dangerous.</p>
<p>The law can also be used for extraordinary measures that are not deportation, including the last time it was invoked after the bombing of Pearl Harbor. <a href="https://www.archives.gov/research/immigration/enemy-aliens/ww2" target="_blank">It led to the internment camps</a> of more than 120,000 people of Japanese descent, more than half of whom were U.S. citizens, as well as German and Italian nationals, during World War II.</p>
<p>Trump has vowed to use a title within the Alien and Sedition Acts to target drug dealers, gang members and cartel members.</p>
<p>“I will invoke the Alien Enemy Act, to remove all known or suspected gang members from the United States ending the scourge of illegal alien gang violence once and for all,” Trump said at a campaign stop in Reno, Nevada.</p>
<p>Cuccinelli, a former attorney general of Virginia and acting director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services during the Trump administration, wrote the policy section for the Department of Homeland Security for <a href="https://static.project2025.org/2025_MandateForLeadership_FULL.pdf" target="_blank">the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025</a> – a conservative “battle plan” for the next Republican president.</p>
<p>In that section, he laid out recommendations for an incoming Republican administration to curtail the use of temporary work visas for workers in agriculture, construction and hospitality; prevent U.S. citizens from qualifying for federal housing subsidies if they live with someone who is a noncitizen; and require driver’s license information to be shared with federal authorities; among other policies.</p>
<p>The Heritage Foundation did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Punishing states</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>In a lengthy interview Trump conducted<a href="https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/2024/04/30/trump-says-hed-use-police-national-guard-and-possibly-the-military-to-expel-immigrants/" target="_blank"> with Time magazine</a>, he said he would withhold federal funding from states and local governments that don’t cooperate in deportation proceedings.</p>
<p>That could violate the 10th Amendment in the Constitution, said Mae Ngai, a historian and Asian American studies professor at Columbia University.</p>
<p>“States and municipalities cannot be coerced to enforcing federal laws,” she said, adding that immigration law is a federal matter. “You cannot force the police department or sheriffs … to pick up immigrants.”</p>
<p>State and local cooperation in detaining immigrants could be a challenge, said Julia Gelatt, associate director of the U.S. Immigration Policy Program at the Migration Policy Institute.</p>
<p>Legal challenges make it costly for local law enforcement to detain people solely to wait for immigration proceedings, and many local governments have decided not to hold people beyond their criminal detentions.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Funding issues</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Deploying the military for immigration enforcement and constructing detention camps would also come with a large price tag.</p>
<p>Those large expenses would have to be approved by Congress, which may not be a willing partner.</p>
<p>There are ways to get around the legislative branch, such as reshuffling money within the Department of Homeland Security, but they come with downsides, Bier of the Cato Institute said.</p>
<p>“That’s politically risky because if there’s any kind of natural disaster, and you’re using money to deport people that can have some big blowbacks in the affected areas,” he said.</p>
<p>The Trump administration did this in 2019, <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/news/2019/08/27/dhs-reprogram-and-transfer-271-million-support-humanitarian-and-security-emergency" target="_blank">when it transferred $271 million</a> from the Federal Emergency Management Association to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. It also transferred $23.8 million from the Transportation Security Administration to ICE.</p>
<p>Trump could also reassign law enforcement agencies to tackle immigration enforcement, Bier said, but he would face pushback from affected agencies that have their own priorities.</p>
<p>“They’re not going to want to cooperate with just giving up on everything they’re trying to do,” Bier said.</p>

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)</p><p>CHICAGO — Vice President Kamala Harris accepted her party’s nomination for president Thursday evening, pitching her candidacy as an opportunity for the nation to move forward, rather than accept a dark future she said would follow a second election of her Republican opponent.</p>
<p>Harris on the last night of the Democratic National Convention took advantage of the largest television audience she’s likely to have at least until her first debate with Republican nominee Donald Trump next month.</p>
<p>The vice president told her life story to the millions of Americans watching, saying it informed her agenda meant to boost the country’s’ middle class.</p>
<p>She characterized herself as a lifelong public servant and unifier, in contrast to what she described as Trump’s divisive self-centeredness.</p>
<p>“My entire career, I have only had one client: the people,” she said. “And so, on behalf of the people, on behalf of every American, regardless of party, race, gender, or the language your grandmother speaks, on behalf of my mother and everyone who has ever set out  on their own unlikely journey, … on behalf of everyone whose story could only be written in the greatest nation on Earth, I accept your nomination for president of the United States of America.”</p>
<p>She professed her patriotism several times in her roughly 40-minute address. Near the close, she urged the Democrats in the arena and viewers at home to work for her election on behalf of the country.</p>
<p>“Let’s get out there and let’s fight for it,” she said “Let us write the next great chapter in the most extraordinary story ever told.”</p>
<p>Americans across the nation made their assessments. Yvette Young, a lifelong Philadelphia resident and project manager at SEPTA who attended a watch party at a Harris campaign office, said she thought it was an excellent speech and comprehensive.</p>
<p>“She touched on, I think, every issue,” Young said. “She wasn’t afraid to call Donald Trump out on his nonsense and put into perspective how he has harmed our country.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">A middle-class childhood</h4>

	
<p>Harris has downplayed the historic nature of her candidacy — she is the first Black and South Asian woman to lead a major party ticket and would be the first woman president of any race — but expanded Thursday on the values her immigrant mother instilled in her.</p>
<p>Her mother, a scientist from India, “was tough, courageous, a trailblazer in the fight for women’s health,” she said.</p>
<p>Harris described her upbringing as middle class, saying she was raised mainly by her mom after her parents divorced. Harris’ father was a Jamaican student who met her mother at a civil rights meeting, Harris said Thursday.</p>
<p>The vice president promised to be a middle-class champion, creating what she called “an opportunity economy” that would unite labor, small businesses and workers. Additionally, she pledged to “end America’s housing shortage,” to lower the cost of everyday needs.</p>
<p>Ahead of the convention, Harris<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/harris-unveils-plan-curb-price-gouging-boost-child-tax-credit-tackle-rent-hikes" target="_blank"> unveiled policy details</a> to stop price gouging, boost the child tax credit, curb rent hikes and help first-time homebuyers.</p>
<p>“We know a strong middle class has always been critical to America’s success,” she said. “And building that middle class will be a defining goal of my presidency. This is personal to me. The middle class is where I come from.”</p>
<p>Her remarks were applauded by another person at the watch party, Lindsay Davis, a Germantown resident and UX designer.</p>
<p>Davis believes that there’s a particular issue that Harris can talk about that can sway undecided voters.</p>
<p>“A lot of the stuff she’s already said about making it easier for first-time homebuyers to buy a house that was, like, huge,” she said. “I think that’s really big for, like, younger people that aren’t boomers, I guess Gen Z, Gen X, Gen whatever, all the Gens.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">A sense of justice</h4>

	
<p>Harris’s mother also taught her daughters “never to complain about injustice, but to do something about it,” she said, repeating a line former first lady Michelle Obama used throughout a Tuesday speech.</p>
<p>She said the same sense of justice motivated her to become a prosecutor, which she did as the district attorney of San Francisco and attorney general of California before her election to the U.S. Senate in 2016.</p>
<p>As the top lawyer in California, Harris won a $20 billion settlement for homeowners in the state as part of a nationwide lawsuit against banks over predatory lending during the 2008 financial crisis.</p>
<p>North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, who was also his state’s attorney general at the time, said Thursday in remarks just before Harris spoke that he saw her demand much more than what the banks initially offered.</p>
<p>“America, we’ve got a lot of big fights ahead of us,” he said. “And we’ve got one hell of a fighter ready to take them on.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Trump’s ‘dark agenda’</h4>

	
<p>Harris described much of her policy objectives in contrast to her opponent, the former president seeking another term, Trump.</p>
<p>While her administration would work to expand reproductive rights, Trump would further restrict them, she said.</p>
<p>Trump would pursue a nationwide abortion ban “with or without Congress,” limit access to birth control and require women to report miscarriages, she said.</p>
<p>“Why is it that they don’t trust women?” she asked the packed United Center crowd. “Well, we trust women.”</p>
<p>She said if she is elected, and Congress passes a bill restoring the Roe v. Wade abortion decision, she will sign it into law. For that to happen, Democrats would likely need to not only control both chambers, but also have 60 votes in the Senate.</p>
<p>On foreign policy, Harris said Trump wouldn’t stand up to dictators, “because he wants to be an autocrat himself.”</p>
<p>She described November’s election as a “fight for America’s future.”</p>
<p>The crowd broke out in a chant: “We’re not going back.”</p>
<p>She also asked the audience to imagine how dangerous Trump would be in office after a July 1 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that said Trump could not be prosecuted for most actions he took in office.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Second woman candidate</h4>

	
<p>Harris addressed a packed crowd in which many women wore white, a nod to the women’s suffrage movement.</p>
<p>Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who gave a speech Monday, was the first woman to accept the presidential nomination of a major party at the 2016 Democratic National Convention, when she gave her acceptance speech in a white pantsuit.</p>
<p>But Harris dressed head to toe in black.</p>
<p>She took the stage to Beyoncé’s “Freedom,” a song the campaign has <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/black-women-quickly-mobilize-boost-kamala-harris-presidential-bid" target="_blank">made its anthem.</a> Beyoncé, however, did not appear in person, despite widespread rumors she would show up.</p>
<p>After Harris’ speech, what Democratic officials said were 100,000 red, white and blue balloons were released, a convention tradition. Harris and her husband, Doug Emhoff, and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and his wife, Gwen Walz, held hands onstage and acknowledged the cheers of the delegates.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘Unexpected’ path to nomination</h4>

	
<p>Harris acknowledged her abbreviated path to the nomination, which began just 32 days ago, was highly unusual.</p>
<p>After President Joe Biden dropped his reelection bid and endorsed Harris on July 21, the party quickly coalesced around the vice president.</p>
<p>She racked up the necessary delegates and after a short vetting period tapped Walz. They soon hit the campaign trail in the seven key battleground states – Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin.</p>
<p>Throughout the whirlwind, she has praised Biden for his leadership and accomplishments.</p>
<p>She did again in the opening lines of her speech Thursday.</p>
<p>“Your record is extraordinary, as history will show,” she said. “And your character is inspiring.”</p>
<p>Republicans have criticized the process that led to Harris’ nomination, calling it a “coup” against Biden.</p>
<p>In a written statement ahead of Harris’ address Thursday, Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Whatley repeated that claim and slammed Harris’ policy proposals as “the most radical agenda ever put forward at a major party convention.”</p>
<p>“After staging a coup to take the nomination from Joe Biden just weeks ago, Kamala Harris will take the stage at the DNC to share her dangerously liberal agenda with the Democrats gathered to coronate her in Chicago,” he said.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Convention capstone</h4>

	
<p>Harris’ acceptance marked the end of a four-day convention focused on the theme of passing the torch to the next generation that was woven through the speeches of long-established Democrats in the party, such as former President Bill Clinton, who said he <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/bill-clinton-urges-democrats-work-harris-president-joy" target="_blank">loved “seeing all these young leaders.”</a></p>
<p>On the first night, Biden, who dropped out of the race last month, <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/biden-delivers-late-night-farewell-democrats-he-passes-torch-harris" target="_blank">delivered a farewell address to Democrats</a>, endorsing Harris. The Obamas Tuesday made the <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/hope-making-comeback-obamas-make-case-kamala-harris" target="_blank">case for Harris,</a> saying in her candidacy, “hope is making a comeback.”</p>
<p>As Harris gave her speech aimed at defining her candidacy and vision for the country as one of freedom and joy, <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/frustrated-uncommitted-delegates-push-palestinian-american-speaker-dnc-nears-end" target="_blank">a sit-in protest occurred outside the United Center.</a> Dozens of Uncommitted delegates who advocated for a Palestinian American to have a speaking slot at the DNC said they had their request denied by the Harris campaign.</p>
<p>Inside the arena, Harris said negotiating an end to the war, with a return of Israeli hostages and a lasting cease-fire, was a top administration priority.</p>
<p>“President Biden and I are working to end this war, such that Israel is secure, the hostages are released, the suffering in Gaza ends and the Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity,” she said.</p>
<p>At the watch party in Philadelphia, Alina Taylor, a special education teacher who lives in Upper Dublin, said as a Democratic committee person for her area, she plans to volunteer and canvass for the Harris campaign.</p>
<p>“I came down here because I’m fired up and I’m ready to go,” she said.</p>
<p>She said prior to Harris’ speech that she wants to hear her talk about the economy and what she plans on doing about reproductive rights.</p>
<p>“That’s so huge, because I want my daughters to have more rights than me, and I don’t want them to have less,” she said.</p>

She urged them to continue reaching out to Latino voters, a key voting bloc in this year’s election. (Photo by Ariana Figueroa/States Newsroom)</p><p>CHICAGO — Latino lawmakers and organizers Wednesday stressed their voting bloc as key to delivering battleground states to Democrats in November, as the Harris campaign launched a bilingual WhatsApp channel to target Latino voters.</p>
<p>“The Latino vote will be the deciding factor in this election,” actress and Democratic surrogate Eva Longoria said during a Hispanic Caucus meeting on the third day of the Democratic National Convention.</p>
<p>Members of Congress and officials from Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign told delegates how they were reaching out to Latino voters, including the launch of the bilingual WhatsApp channel.</p>
<p>“The channel will be the first-of-its-kind in an American presidential election, and will provide culturally relevant content that reflects the Latino community that already exists on the platform and serve as another tool to combat misinformation and disinformation,” the Harris campaign said in a release.</p>
<p>WhatsApp is a popular messaging tool among immigrant populations and Latinos, and it’s a free encryption messaging app that can be used globally.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/04/PI_2021.04.07_Social-Media-Use_FINAL.pdf" target="_blank">A Pew Research Center report</a> found that about a quarter of Americans use WhatsApp, but that 46% of Hispanic Americans use it compared to 23% of Black Americans and 16% of white Americans.</p>
<p>Julie Chavez Rodríguez, manager of the Harris campaign, launched the start of the WhatsApp campaign with a video message, noting that the channel will provide a “behind the scene” look at the campaign and information about Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Democratic Gov. Tim Walz.</p>
<p>The channel will be operated by “Latinos con Harris-Walz.”</p>
<p>Michelle Villegas, the national Latino engagement director for the Harris campaign, said the Latino vote is key to victory in three battleground states, Arizona, Nevada and Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>“These are places where Latino voters are going to help us win and beat the margin of victory in these races,” Villegas said.</p>
<p>Villegas said the campaign is also launching bilingual phone outreach and local organizations, as well as several coalitions like “Latino Men for Kamala.”</p>
<p>Former President Donald Trump has made some inroads with Latino voters, specifically with men, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/02/us/politics/trumps-support-among-latinos-grows-new-poll-shows.html" target="_blank">according to a recent poll by The New York Times. </a></p>
<p>“This is the first time that a presidential campaign in the United States has ever had a WhatsApp channel,” Villegas said. “It’s huge. It’s super exciting and super important, because we know that Latinos are communicating on WhatsApp.”</p>
<p>The app, which is a dominant source of communication, has also been rife with misinformation, something that Longoria noted Democrats needed to stay on top of, especially when that misinformation and disinformation is in Spanish.</p>
<p>“Our Spanish language brothers and sisters are being targeted with misinformation, and we have to help them,” she said.</p>
<p>Longoria, who has close ties to the Biden administration, said that she will also be doing Latino voter outreach on WhatsApp.</p>
<p>Last year, the White House <a href="https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/2023/06/19/were-just-trying-to-live-our-lives-daca-hits-11-year-mark-still-mired-in-the-courts/" target="_blank">hosted a screening</a> of the film “Flamin Hot,” which was Longoria’s directorial debut. The movie tells the legendary origin story of “Flamin’ Hot Cheetos,” a popular snack in the Latino community. The <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2021-05-16/flamin-hot-cheetos-richard-montanez" target="_blank">Los Angeles Times has debunked the tale</a>, but it’s still a popular rags-to-riches story.</p>
<p>Longoria added that Democrats need to talk about issues important to the Latino community, such as the economy and inflation.</p>
<p>“We have so much work to do,” Longoria said. “I think one of the big issues for Latinos, people think it’s always immigration, and that’s important, but the argument of the economy is something that I think we’re not articulating well enough to our Latino brothers and sisters.”</p>
<p>The deputy chief of staff and senior adviser to Harris, Sergio Gonzales, said that Latino voters are critical.</p>
<p>“We will not take any Latino vote for granted,” he said, adding that Harris also hails from a state with a high Latino population — California.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Polling on Latino voters</h4>

	
<p>Equis Research, which conducts research and polling specifically about Latino voters, <a href="https://www.weareequis.us/research/xssaug2024bgmemo" target="_blank">found in a recent poll t</a>hat Harris is ahead of Trump when it comes to registered Hispanic voters, 56% to 37%.</p>
<p>The poll found that Harris has also gained support from Latina women compared to when Biden was still in the race before he dropped out last month. For example, Biden was polling at 50% among Latina women and Harris is polling with about 59% support from Latinas.</p>
<p>“With the entrance of Kamala Harris, we are seeing results that are back in a historically normal range,” according to an analysis of the poll. “Relative to Biden, she sees rebounds across Latino subgroups, with the largest among young people.”</p>
<p>However, the report noted that Harris “remains a few points shy of what Biden received in 2020” across battleground states such as Arizona.</p>
<p>The CEO of the political organization Voto Latino, María Teresa Kumar, said that the states where the group is doing Latino voter registration include Nevada, Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina and Texas.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">No congressional action</h4>

	
<p>U.S. Democratic Reps. Greg Casar of Texas and Delia Ramirez of Illinois said the Biden administration has continued to have an impact on immigration reform without Congress, such as with the recent implementation of deportation protections for undocumented spouses.</p>
<p>Immigration reform is virtually dead in a divided Congress. A bipartisan border security measure that was crafted in the Senate collapsed after Trump raised objections to it, wanting to campaign on the issue of immigration.</p>
<p>Instead, most immigration reform has come from the White House through rulemaking, like <a href="https://missouriindependent.com/briefs/biden-administration-to-issue-rule-expanding-daca-health-care-access/" target="_blank">expanding health care access</a> to uninsured people in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and the most recent executive action for undocumented spouses of U.S. citizens.</p>
<p><a href="https://missouriindependent.com/2024/06/18/biden-to-unveil-protections-for-some-undocumented-spouses-easier-daca-work-visas/" target="_blank">The deportation protection</a> for those married to a U.S. citizen is a one-time action that is expected to allow roughly 500,000 undocumented spouses and their children to apply for lawful permanent residence — a green card — under certain requirements.</p>
<p>Ramirez, whose husband is a DACA recipient, said immigrants and Latinos are “tired of waiting” for immigration reform. She said it’s an issue Harris should campaign on, because of the economic benefit that immigrants provide.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/60165" target="_blank">The Congressional Budget Office</a> has estimated an economic boost over the next year due to the contributions of immigrants, lowering the deficits by $990 billion over the 2024-2034 period and raising federal revenues by $1.2 trillion.</p>
<p>“We have a daughter of immigrants running to be our president,” Ramirez said of Harris’ parents — her father is a Jamaican immigrant and her late mother was an Indian immigrant. “This is our moment to lean in on the contributions of immigrants.”</p>

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON — As Vice President Kamala Harris prepares to give the keynote address at the Democratic National Convention Thursday, making her the first Black and South Asian woman to lead a major party ticket, her nomination has energized a strong and loyal voting bloc in the Democratic Party — Black women.</p>
<p>Since President Joe Biden <a href="https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/2024/07/21/breaking-president-joe-biden-bows-out-of-reelection-campaign/" target="_blank">last month bowed out</a> of his reelection race and <a href="https://x.com/JoeBiden/status/1815087772216303933" target="_blank">named Harris</a> as his choice for the nomination, her campaign has quickly <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/kamala-harris-will-be-democratic-presidential-nominee-dnc-announces" target="_blank">scooped up the necessary delegate votes</a>, raked in more than $300 million and galvanized the Democratic base. Black women are playing a major role in this rapid mobilization.</p>
<p>Emory University political scientist Andra Gillespie said in an interview with States Newsroom that Harris is benefiting from not only an influx of cash, but also an army of volunteers.</p>
<p>The campaign’s battleground states director, Dan Kanninen, told reporters in late July more than 360,000 volunteers have signed up to knock on doors, canvass and make phone calls.</p>
<p>“What we’ve seen happen in the last couple of weeks is an influx of resources that will allow Harris to mount as effective a mobilization campaign as she can,” Gillespie said.</p>
<p>All of this is key to mounting a competitive race, Gillespie said, especially in all-important Georgia.</p>
<p>In that state, Black women’s work to encourage turnout and register voters was credited with turning the state blue for Biden in 2020. The victory sent two Democratic U.S. senators to Congress, solidifying a split Senate in which Harris was the tiebreaker and in which a Democratic majority confirmed numerous federal judges to lifetime appointments — as well as the first Black woman named to the Supreme Court, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cookpolitical.com/analysis/national/national-politics/presidential-campaign-reset-arizona-georgia-and-nevada-move" target="_blank">The Cook Political Report with Amy Walters</a> moved Georgia from a “lean Republican” ranking to “toss-up” after Harris entered the presidential race, noting a 1 percentage point lead over her GOP opponent, former President Donald Trump. For comparison, Biden was trailing 2.5 percentage points behind Trump in the Peach State.</p>
<p>Keneshia Grant, an associate professor of political science at Howard University in Washington, D.C., said that when <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/president-joe-biden-bows-out-reelection-campaign-harris-vows-win-nomination-8" target="_blank">Biden first announced he was stepping down</a> July 21 <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/democratic-calls-new-nominee-ramp-biden-camp-pledges-stay-course" target="_blank">under pressure</a> from party leaders following his disastrous debate performance, it was not immediately clear that <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/what-know-about-vice-president-kamala-harris-endorsed-biden-his-successor" target="_blank">Harris</a> would be next in line. It took Biden a little over 30 minutes to endorse her as his chosen successor.</p>
<p>In the days before Biden’s announcement, South Carolina’s U.S. Rep. Jim Clyburn urged the party to <a href="https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2024/07/02/texas-u-s-house-member-calls-for-biden-to-withdraw-amid-debate-fallout/" target="_blank">coalesce around Harris</a>, should Biden no longer be on the ticket. Clyburn was pivotal in delivering Black support for Biden in 2020 and remains a close Biden ally.</p>
<p>“We should do everything we can to bolster her, whether she’s in second place or at the top of the ticket,” he said of Harris.</p>

<p>Grant said that Black women — often referred to as the backbone of the Democratic party — had signaled to top party members that “passing over this Black woman in this moment would not be tolerated.”</p>
<p>Within hours of Biden quitting the race, a Zoom call with organizers of #WinWithBlackWomen <a href="https://x.com/WinWithBLKWomen/status/1815300802359026153" target="_blank">drew in more than 90,000 participants</a> and raised more than $1.3 million to support Harris’ bid.</p>
<p>“The (Democratic) Party might not have had a notion of a Black woman as president, right now, but clearly the people feel differently and felt differently,” Grant said.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Influence of ‘Divine Nine’</h4>

	
<p>As a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc., the first Black sorority, established in 1908 at Howard University, Harris has an untapped resource in <a href="https://nmaahc.si.edu/explore/stories/divine-nine-black-fraternities-sororities" target="_blank">the “Divine Nine</a>” – Black Greek-letter organizations, made up of four sororities and five fraternities.</p>
<p>Deborah Elizabeth Whaley, a professor of African American studies at the University of Iowa, said that Black sororities and fraternities are more than a social group. She added that they’ve been at the forefront of civil rights issues such as the women’s suffrage movement and anti-lynching legislation.</p>
<p>“The whole idea is that you’re coming together in the name of service to help Black communities as well as holding up academic excellence,” Whaley said.</p>
<p>As soon as Harris entered the race at the top of the ticket,  the Divine Nine, which boasts more than 2 million members, swung into action.</p>
<p>“One of the things that the Black sororities and (fraternities) are known for is voter registration,” Whaley said.</p>
<p>The National Pan-Hellenic Council, Inc. —  the governing body of the Divine Nine — announced it would undertake a major voter turnout mobilization campaign. Because the groups are nonprofits, they can’t endorse a candidate and must remain nonpartisan.</p>
<p>“This campaign will activate the thousands of chapters and members in our respective organizations to ensure strong voter turnout in the communities we serve,” the National Pan-Hellenic Council, Inc. said in a statement.</p>
<p>Harris’s sorority, AKA, formed its own political action committee on Aug. 9, <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/itemizer/committee/C00886036/2024" target="_blank">according to ProPublica’s</a> Federal Election Commission tracker.</p>
<p>Whaley said she’s not surprised Harris has prioritized inclusion of Black sororities, such as her visit to the <a href="https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/2024/07/24/harris-calls-on-zeta-phi-beta-members-to-mobilize-voters-ahead-of-november-election/" target="_blank">Zeta Phi Beta sorority conference in Indianapolis,</a> Indiana, when she was the likely Democratic presidential nominee, in late July.</p>
<p>“We know when we organize, mountains move,” Harris said to more than 6,000 sorority sisters. “When we mobilize, nations change. And when we vote, we make history.”</p>
<p>Whaley said that Black sororities are a “training ground to be of service to community, to be a leader, and to function effectively in a world where you are a member of a starkly marginalized group and you are a minority in terms of your gender.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">A different tune</h4>

	
<p>On Harris’ first visit to the campaign headquarters in Delaware, before she addressed the staff, the song she walked out to was Beyoncé’s “Freedom.”</p>
<p>It’s a song that is played during all her campaign stops and, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/22/entertainment/beyonce-freedom-harris-campaign/index.html" target="_blank">according to CNN</a>, Beyoncé has given the campaign permission to use the 2016 song from her Grammy-nominated album, “Lemonade.”</p>
<p>Grant noted that in choosing that particular Beyoncé song, it not only signals to voters that Harris at 59 is a younger candidate — compared to Trump, who is 78 — but it’s a departure from the <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2016/07/25/remarks-first-lady-democratic-national-convention" target="_blank">catchphrase coined by former first lady</a> Michelle Obama at the 2016 Democratic National Convention, “When they go low, we go high.”</p>
<p>“From the things I’m seeing in the campaign and from her posture, she’s not saying ‘When you go low, I go low,’ but she is saying … ‘When you go low, we at least call you out on it,’” Grant said.</p>
<p>The song choice is also not lost on Kinitra Brooks, an associate professor and the Audrey and John Leslie Endowed Chair in Literary Studies in the Department of English at Michigan State University.</p>
<p>Brooks, who co-edited a collection of essays on Beyoncé’s “Lemonade,” said that the song is about more than breaking chains, but “the cost of freedom.”</p>
<p>“It takes hard work to achieve freedom, but also to maintain it,” she said. “I think that leads to the conversations that we’re having about the rollback of rights.”</p>
<p>As Harris has set out on a rapid-fire campaign tour in the battleground states of <a href="https://azmirror.com/2024/08/09/harris-and-walz-draw-huge-crowd-in-arizona-promise-action-on-immigration-abortion/" target="_blank">Arizona</a>, <a href="https://georgiarecorder.com/2024/07/30/harris-challenges-trump-at-boisterous-georgia-state-rally-to-say-it-to-my-face-in-debate-dare/" target="_blank">Georgia</a>, Nevada and <a href="https://penncapital-star.com/election-2024/harris-and-walz-campaign-in-western-pennsylvania-for-first-time-as-running-mates/" target="_blank">Pennsylvania</a>, she has positioned her campaign as a “fight for the future,” and has accused the Trump campaign of focusing on the past.</p>
<p>“Across our nation, we have been witnessing a full-on assault on hard-won, hard-fought freedoms and fundamental rights,” Harris said at an Aug. 10 <a href="https://nevadacurrent.com/2024/08/11/harris-walz-energize-crowd-at-first-nevada-rally-as-democratic-presidential-ticket/" target="_blank">campaign rally in Las Vegas, Nevada</a>. “We are not going back.”</p>

[&#8230;]]]></description>

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)</p><p>CHICAGO — Hillary Clinton, the first woman to clinch a major political party’s presidential nomination, on the first night of the Democratic National Convention praised Vice President Kamala Harris — the second woman in U.S. history to be nominated — for her bright vision for the nation and her ability to lead the country forward.</p>
<p>“The story of my life and the history of our country is that progress is possible, but not guaranteed,” Clinton told a packed crowd in the United Center. “We have to fight for it. And never, ever give up.”</p>
<p>Clinton, the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee, said that together, women have put “a lot of cracks in the highest, hardest glass ceiling.”</p>
<p>“On the other side of that glass ceiling is Kamala Harris taking the oath of office as our 47th President of the United States,” she said. “When a barrier falls for one of us, it … clears the way for all of us.”</p>
<p>Clinton said that Harris’ historic nomination, as the first Black and South Asian woman at the top of a major party ticket, is an opportunity for the country to progress.</p>
<p>Clinton said that every generation has “carried the torch forward,” and that Harris will carry that torch as she pushes for the restoration of abortion access, affordable housing and child care.</p>
<p>Harris has often promised to restore Roe v Wade, the Supreme Court ruling that gave Americans the constitutional right to an abortion. However, in order to pass legislation in Congress, Democrats would need to control the House and have 60 votes in the Senate to advance legislation past the filibuster.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Women in history</h4>

	
<p>Clinton highlighted Democratic women who had broken barriers throughout history. She cited the late U.S. Rep. Shirley Chisholm, the first woman to run for the Democratic Party presidential nomination, and the first Black person to seek to be a major party’s candidate for president, and the late U.S. Rep. Geraldine Ferraro, the first woman nominated for the vice presidency by a major political party.</p>
<p>Clinton said that accepting the presidential nomination was the greatest honor of her life. She touched on her loss to Donald Trump in 2016, and noted that despite it, there was a wave of women who ran for public office following Trump’s ascension to the White House.</p>
<p>“We refused to give up on America,” she said.</p>
<p>Clinton said that when she looks at Harris’ campaign she sees freedom.</p>
<p>“I see freedom from fear and intimidation, from violence and injustices, from chaos and corruption,” she said.</p>
<p>Harris indeed has framed her campaign as a fight for freedom, and as an effort to move forward as opposed to Trump and the GOP. Additionally, Beyonce’s song “Freedom” is the campaign’s anthem.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Harris speaks</h4>

	
<p>Harris, who made a brief surprise appearance before Clinton spoke, thanked President Joe Biden for his leadership before she stressed that the November elections are a fight for the future.</p>
<p>“This November, we will come together and declare with one voice, as one people, we are moving forward,” Harris said. “We all have so much more in common than what separates us.”</p>
<p>Harris is expected to give her speech accepting the nomination on Thursday night.</p>
<p>Clinton said that Harris would be “for the people,” which was also the theme of the first night of the convention. Clinton criticized Trump and said that the former president only cares about himself, not Americans.</p>
<p>She said that Democrats have Trump “on the run,” but urged them to not get too comfortable, even as Harris’ campaign has energized Democrats across the nation. Clinton warned Democrats to not rely on the polls, which have shown Harris either gaining on Trump or ahead, and said they must keep campaigning until November.</p>
<p>Since Biden suspended his reelection campaign, after a disastrous June debate that rattled his party’s belief in his ability to defeat Trump, several battleground states that were leaning toward Republicans, such as Georgia, Nevada and Arizona, moved to a “toss-up,”<a href="https://www.cookpolitical.com/analysis/national/national-politics/presidential-campaign-reset-arizona-georgia-and-nevada-move" target="_blank"> according to The Cook Political Report with Amy Walter. </a></p>
<p>“No matter what the polls say, we can’t let up,” Clinton said.</p>

The convention will be held Aug. 19-22. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON — Just a little over a month after she became a candidate for president in the biggest shakeup in generations of presidential politics, Vice President Kamala Harris on Thursday will deliver a widely anticipated speech accepting the Democratic nomination at the party’s convention in Chicago.</p>
<p>Harris’ ascent to the top of the ticket after President Joe Biden changed course and said he would not seek reelection has breathed new life into the Democratic bid, with polls showing Harris — who is already <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/kamala-harris-will-be-democratic-presidential-nominee-dnc-announces" target="_blank">the party’s official nominee</a> after a virtual roll call earlier this month — faring much better than Biden was against Republican rival Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Over the course of four days, Democrats will look to capitalize on their base’s newfound enthusiasm for the campaign, with leading speakers aiming to rally the faithful around the party’s positions on reproductive rights, gun safety and voting rights, while <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/harris-ballot-democrats-work-build-momentum-bigger-youth-vote" target="_blank">making a strong pitch to young voters</a>. Harris will also be expected to further lay out her policy positions.</p>
<p>Harris’ nomination is historic. The daughter of immigrants, Harris is the first Black and South Asian woman selected to lead a major party ticket. She would be the first woman of any race to guide the nation as chief executive.</p>
<p>The party has not released an official detailed schedule of speakers, but a convention official confirmed that “current and past presidents are expected to participate in convention programming.” Biden and two former presidents, Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, as well as former nominee Hillary Clinton, will all speak, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/12/us/politics/dnc-speakers-biden-obama-clinton.html" target="_blank">according to the New York Times.</a></p>
<p>Vice presidential candidate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz is expected to address the convention Wednesday evening, with Harris’ acceptance speech closing out the convention Thursday, the convention official said.</p>
<p>The evening programming block will run from 6:30 p.m. to 11 p.m. Eastern Time on Monday and 7 p.m. to 11 p.m. the rest of the week.</p>
<p>In addition to the usual television broadcasts, the convention will livestream on several social media platforms, including YouTube, X, Instagram and TikTok. The official live stream will be available on <a href="https://demconvention.us9.list-manage.com/track/click?u=d68a84b1a4b0303a9452770cd&amp;id=e86e03e670&amp;e=a21b6b7198" target="_blank">DemConvention.com</a>.</p>
<p>Scores of Democratic caucus and council meetings, as well as state delegation breakfasts and gatherings, are also scheduled throughout the week’s daytime hours. Media organizations and outside groups are also holding daytime events that will feature Democratic officeholders and candidates.</p>
<p>Protests are also expected over the Biden administration’s handling of the Israel-Hamas war, with the backdrop of a <a href="https://minnesotareformer.com/2024/04/08/israel-hamas-war-sets-progressive-and-young-voters-on-collision-course-with-white-house/" target="_blank">delegation of uncommitted voters</a> who oppose the war.</p>
<p>As many as 25,000 protestors are expected over the course of the convention, according to DemList, a newsletter for Democratic officials and allies.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">A contest transformed</h4>

	
<p>Harris’ entry into the race, nearly immediately after Biden <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/president-joe-biden-bows-out-reelection-campaign-harris-vows-win-nomination-8" target="_blank">announced on July 21</a> he would no longer seek reelection, energized Democrats distressed over Biden’s poor showings in polls against Trump, whose reelection bid Biden turned back in 2020.</p>
<p>A Monmouth University <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_US_081424/" target="_blank">poll published Aug. 14</a> showed a huge jump in enthusiasm for Democrats. The survey found 85% of Democratic respondents were excited about the Harris-Trump race. By comparison, only 46% of Democratic respondents said in June they were excited about a Biden-Trump race.</p>
<p>Harris is also seeing better polling numbers in matchups against Trump, with battleground-state and national surveys consistently shifting toward the Democratic ticket since Biden left the race.</p>
<p>Polls of seven battleground states <a href="https://www.cookpolitical.com/survey-research/2024-swing-state-project/fight-redefine-2024-race-president" target="_blank">published</a> by The Cook Political Report With Amy Walter on Aug. 14 showed Harris narrowly leading in five states — Arizona, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin — and tied in Georgia and trailing in Nevada. All were improvements from Biden’s standing in the same poll in May.</p>
<p><a href="https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3902" target="_blank">An Aug. 14 survey from Quinnipiac University</a> showed Harris with a 48%-45% edge in Pennsylvania. The 3-point advantage for Harris was within the poll’s margin of error.</p>
<p>Democrats hope to carry the momentum through the convention. Polls typically favor a party during and immediately after its national party gathering.</p>
<p>Despite the recent polling, Harris and Walz continue to describe themselves <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkwZ_A49hb8" target="_blank">as underdogs in the race</a>.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Campaign themes</h4>

	
<p>In her short time on the campaign trail, Harris has emphasized a few core messages.</p>
<p>She’s made reproductive rights a central focus, including the slogan “We are not going back” in her stump speech after describing Republicans’ position on abortion. Additionally, a Texas woman who had to leave the state for an emergency abortion will speak at the DNC, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/texas-woman-who-left-state-abortion-back-harris-convention-2024-08-15/" target="_blank">according to Reuters.</a></p>
<p>Harris has also played up her background as a prosecutor, drawing a contrast with Trump’s legal troubles.</p>
<p>Walz has highlighted his working-class background and military service, while attacking Republican positions to restrict reproductive rights and ban certain books in schools.</p>
<p>Walz’s <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/walz-first-solo-speech-vp-candidate-touts-dem-tickets-labor-union-ties" target="_blank">first solo campaign stop</a> since Harris selected him as her running mate was at a union convention, where he emphasized his union background as a high school teacher.</p>
<p>Walz was not initially considered the favorite to be Harris’ running mate, but his appeal as a Midwesterner with a record of winning tough elections and enacting progressive policies <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/minnesota-gov-tim-walz-picked-harris-her-running-mate-democratic-ticket" target="_blank">led to his selection</a> Aug. 6.</p>
<p>Harris has faced criticism for not sitting down for a formal media interview or holding a press conference since she became a candidate.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Platform in flux</h4>

	
<p>Democrats have not finalized their platform for 2024. Adopting a party platform is generally among the official items at a convention.</p>
<p>The party set <a href="https://democrats.org/news/dnc-releases-2024-party-platform-draft-outlining-historic-record-and-bold-agenda-for-president-biden-and-vice-president-harris-to-finish-the-job/" target="_blank">a draft platform</a> in July just eight days before Biden dropped his reelection bid. The document centered on the theme of “finishing the job” and mentioned Biden, then the presumptive nominee, 50 times and Harris 12.</p>
<p>Party spokespeople did not respond to an inquiry this week about plans for an update to the platform.</p>
<p>Reproductive rights will likely be a focus point of any policy wishlist.</p>
<p>Harris, during her time as vice president, has led the administration’s messaging on reproductive rights after the Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to an abortion in the summer of 2022.</p>
<p>In her campaign speeches, she has often stressed the need to “trust women” and that the government should not be deciding reproductive health.</p>
<p>Harris has often promised that if she is elected, she will restore those reproductive rights, but unless Democrats control a majority in the U.S. House and 60 Senate votes, it’s unlikely she would be able to achieve that promise.</p>
<p>Since <a href="https://tennesseelookout.com/2022/06/24/updated-u-s-supreme-court-overturns-right-to-abortion-in-landmark-decision/" target="_blank">Roe v. Wade was overturned</a> in that Supreme Court decision, Democrats have campaigned on reproductive rights that expand beyond abortion and include protections for in vitro fertilization.</p>
<p><a href="https://democrats.org/where-we-stand/party-platform/" target="_blank">The 2020 party platform</a> focused on recovering from the coronavirus pandemic, the economy, quality health care, investing in education, protecting democracy and combating climate change.</p>
<p>Democrats are likely to continue to criticize the Project 2025 playbook — a blueprint by the Heritage Foundation, a think tank, to implement conservative policies across the federal government should Trump win in November.</p>
<p>Trump has disavowed the document, but has not detailed his own policy plans.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Chicago conventions</h4>

	
<p>The Democratic National Convention will take place in Chicago, a city with a long history of hosting the event. Democrats have held their convention in Chicago 11 times, first in 1864 and most recently in 1996.</p>
<p>This year’s will be the first in-person Democratic National Convention since 2016. It was upended due to the coronavirus pandemic and held virtually in 2020.</p>
<p>Throughout the four-day convention, there will be speeches and side events hosted by state Democratic party leaders.</p>
<p>The ceremonial roll call vote with delegates on the convention floor will take place Tuesday. The vice presidential nomination speech by Walz will be Wednesday night and on Thursday night, Harris will give her nomination acceptance speech.</p>
<p>The city is also preparing for massive protests from several groups on reproductive rights, LGBTQ protections, housing and an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, <a href="https://www.wbez.org/government-politics/dnc-2024/2024/08/12/dnc-democratic-national-convention-protests-kamala-harris-israel-gaza-lgbtq-reproductive-rights-cpd-police" target="_blank">according to WBEZ News. </a></p>
<p>The City Council of Chicago in January approved a ceasefire resolution, with Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson the tiebreaker, making it the largest city to call for an end to the Israel-Hamas war, in which<a href="https://apnews.com/article/gaza-war-hamas-dead-graves-40000-988d16b648e06e222f04964dc9440da0?taid=66bdedd74b96700001cc25c8&amp;utm_campaign=TrueAnthem&amp;utm_medium=AP&amp;utm_source=Twitter" target="_blank"> more than 40,000 Palestinians have died</a>.</p>
<p>The war followed an Oct. 7 attack from Hamas, in which <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/longform/2023/10/9/israel-hamas-war-in-maps-and-charts-live-tracker" target="_blank">nearly 1,200 people</a> were killed in Israel and hundreds taken hostage.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Road to nomination</h4>

	
<p>Harris’ acceptance speech will cap a five-year journey to her party’s nomination.</p>
<p>In 2019, the California senator announced a bid for president in the next year’s election, but <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/12/03/784443227/kamala-harris-drops-out-of-presidential-race" target="_blank">dropped out</a> before the first primary or caucus votes were cast after she failed to catch on with Democratic voters.</p>
<p>Biden later picked her as a running mate, and the two defeated Trump and then-Vice President Mike Pence in the 2020 election.</p>
<p>Biden launched a reelection campaign for 2024, but stepped aside after a disastrous debate performance in June spurred questions about his ability to campaign and serve for another four-year term.</p>
<p>After Biden bowed out, Harris <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/democratic-delegates-swiftly-give-harris-enough-support-clinch-presidential-nomination" target="_blank">quickly secured 99%</a> of delegates <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/kamala-harris-officially-becomes-democratic-presidential-nominee" target="_blank">to become the party’s likely nominee</a>. The virtual five-day vote secured her official nomination.</p>
<p>With less than three months until Election Day, Harris and Walz already have sprinted through battleground states including Arizona, Pennsylvania and North Carolina.</p>
<p>Their campaign has also pulled in more than $300 million, according to the campaign. Official Federal Election Commission records will be released in mid-October.</p>
<p>Harris and Trump have <a href="https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2024/08/08/trump-agrees-to-sept-10-debate-with-harris-claims-two-more-upcoming/" target="_blank">agreed to a Sept. 10 </a>debate hosted by ABC News in Philadelphia. Trump proposed two more debates, and Harris has said she would be open to another one between the first debate and Election Day.<br />
Walz and Republican vice presidential candidate Sen. J.D. Vance of Ohio have <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/mark-your-calendar-vp-candidates-walz-and-vance-debate-oct-1" target="_blank">agreed to an Oct. 1</a> debate on CBS News, in New York City.</p>

<p>Vance also argued for more debates against Walz, including one on CNN on Sept. 18.</p>

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)</p><p>CHICAGO — Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump Wednesday underwent questioning from a National Association of Black Journalists panel in a turbulent session during which he falsely claimed Vice President Kamala Harris “happened to turn Black” during her political career.</p>
<p>Through the roughly 35-minute combative event, the former president rarely answered questions, lied and exaggerated, attacked Harris, the likely Democratic presidential nominee, and criticized one of the Black journalists interviewing him, ABC News correspondent Rachel Scott.</p>
<p>“I think it’s disgraceful that I came here in good spirit,” Trump said. “I love the Black population of this country.”</p>
<p>The discussion was also moderated by Kadia Goba, a politics reporter at Semafor, and Harris Faulkner, a Fox News anchor.</p>
<p>Many NABJ members strongly opposed Trump’s visit, especially <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/what-a-stupid-question-trump-demeans-three-black-female-reporters-in-two-days/2018/11/09/272113d0-e441-11e8-b759-3d88a5ce9e19_story.html" target="_blank">given his treatment of high-profile Black women</a> journalists, and the announcement of his appearance sparked a major backlash. Members were also critical about the lack of transparency around the invitation to Trump and the inclusion of a moderator from the conservative Fox network.</p>
<p>Trump attacked ABC’s Scott and called her questions “rude” and her media outlet a “fake news network.”</p>
<p>Scott asked Trump why Black voters should trust him, especially after Trump has made false claims that political rivals such as former President Barack Obama were not born in the United States, has <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/trump-dines-with-white-supremacist-renewing-questions-about-gops-leadership-and-values" target="_blank">dined with a white supremacist</a> at his Florida residence and has slammed Black journalists.</p>
<p>“I don’t think I’ve ever been asked a question in such a horrible manner,” Trump said.</p>

<p>Scott pressed Trump about Republican members of Congress who have referred to Harris, who is the first Black woman and woman of Asian American descent to serve as vice president, as a so-called DEI hire. She asked if that was acceptable language.</p>
<p>Trump didn’t answer the question and asked Scott to define DEI, which she said stood for diversity, equity and inclusion.</p>
<p>Trump then questioned whether Harris was Black.</p>
<p>“I didn’t know she was Black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black and now she wants to be known as Black,” Trump said. “So I don’t know, is she Indian or is she Black?”</p>
<p>Harris attended Howard University, a historically Black college in Washington, D.C., and is a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority Inc., a historic Black sorority. Her father is Jamaican, and her late mother was an Indian immigrant.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Harris in Houston</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Harris, who was endorsed by President Joe Biden after he bowed out of a reelection campaign, was invited by NABJ to take questions as well, but her confirmation is pending, the organization said. She was traveling Wednesday to Houston for events including a campaign stop.</p>
<p>NABJ President Kenneth Lemon said that the organization is working on a virtual session with Harris in September.</p>
<p>On Trump’s participation in the panel, Harris campaign Black Media Director Jasmine Harris, who is not related to the vice president, said in a statement, “Let’s remember exactly who this man is.”</p>
<p>“Not only does Donald Trump have a history of demeaning NABJ members and honorees who remain pillars of the Black press, he also has a history of attacking the media and working against the vital role the press play in our democracy,” she said.</p>
<p>Harris campaign Communications Director Michael Tyler said in a statement that Trump’s behavior during the interview was hostile.</p>
<p>“Trump lobbed personal attacks and insults at Black journalists the same way he did throughout his presidency – while he failed Black families and left the entire country digging out of the ditch he left us in,” Tyler said. “Donald Trump has already proven he cannot unite America, so he attempts to divide us.”</p>
<p>White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, asked at the White House press briefing about Trump’s visit to the convention, said, “That’s a campaign stop for him.”</p>
<p>The Trump campaign has used the invitation to argue that the former president has <a href="https://www.donaldjtrump.com/news/98364d47-2468-4df3-a21b-43517338eb12" target="_blank">grown support among Black voters.</a> Before Biden suspended his campaign in mid-July, a majority of Black voters aligned with voting for Biden, about 77%, and about 18% of Black voters indicated they would vote for Trump in the 2024 presidential election, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/race-and-ethnicity/2024/05/20/an-early-look-at-black-voters-views-on-biden-trump-and-election-2024/" target="_blank">according to a May Pew Research Center report</a>.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">NABJ fact-checking</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>In an email to members Wednesday morning, Lemon stressed that the organization’s invitation was not an endorsement and that there would be <a href="https://www.politifact.com/article/2024/jul/31/live-trump-fact-check-nabj-convention/" target="_blank">live fact-checking from PolitiFact</a> during the session. Members who attended were not allowed to ask questions.</p>
<p>“While we acknowledge the concerns expressed by our members, we believe it is important for us to provide our members with the opportunity to hear directly from candidates and hold them accountable,” Lemon said. “We also want to provide our members with the facts.”’</p>
<p>Nichelle Smith, an independent investigative journalist from Virginia, said after the panel that it was clear where Trump stood with the Black community.</p>
<p>“I thought he was horribly rude to Rachel Scott and I commend her and the other woman on the panel for not soft balling and asking hard questions out the gate because I doubt he has rarely been confronted with hard questions by Black women,” she said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">NABJ tradition</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Inviting a presidential candidate during an election year is an NABJ tradition since 1976. Former presidents have attended and participated in either a press conference or other question-and-answer formats, such as George W. Bush, Bill Clinton and Obama. In 2016, <a href="https://www.poynter.org/reporting-editing/2016/journalists-grill-hillary-clinton-at-nabjnahj-conference/" target="_blank">Hillary Clinton attended</a>, but Trump, who was also invited, did not.</p>
<p>The announcement late Monday that Trump would show up caused a firestorm among NABJ members. Karen Attiah, a columnist with the Washington Post, resigned from her position as NABJ Convention Co-chair.</p>
<p>“While my decision was influenced by a variety of factors, I was not involved or consulted with in any way with the decision to platform Trump in such a format,” Attiah, who was the 2019 NABJ Journalist of the Year, said.</p>
<p>April Ryan, a White House correspondent for TheGrio, a media company geared toward Black Americans, and NABJ’s 2017 Journalist of the Year, objected to the session<a href="https://x.com/AprilDRyan/status/1818280170077196559" target="_blank"> in a social media post.</a></p>
<p>“The reports of attacks on Black women White House correspondents by the then president of the United States are not myth or conjecture, but fact,” she said.</p>
<p>During his first term, Trump often sparred with the White House press corps, but <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/09/business/media/trump-retaliation-reporters-april-ryan.html" target="_blank">he was particularly harsh when it came to Black women</a> journalists, such as Ryan, Abby Phillip from CNN and Yamiche Alcindor, a White House correspondent for PBS.</p>
<p>Ryan, who typically bore the brunt of those attacks, said the decision to hold a panel with Trump was “a slap in the face to the Black women journalists … who had to protect themselves from the wrath of this Republican presidential nominee who is promoting an authoritarian agenda that plans to destroy this nation and her democracy with his Project 2025.”</p>
<p>Editorial Director of Epicenter NYC Femi Redwood, who chairs NABJ’s LGBTQ+ task force, <a href="https://x.com/femiredwood/status/1818310461462339848" target="_blank">wrote in </a>a social media post that the panel was not made aware of Trump’s invite and objected, “considering the damage he has caused Black queer and trans people — including those who are journalists and members of NABJ.”</p>
<p>“I’m disappointed that in a space where so many queer and trans members still feel vulnerable will now feel even more unsafe due to Trump being invited and the possibility of his most vicious followers coming to the hotel to support him,” she said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Some defenders</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Some NABJ members did defend the decision, such as Leroy Chapman Jr., the editor-in-chief of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.</p>
<p>“Here is what we need to ‘normalize’ — candidates for office standing before journalists, answering questions,” he said <a href="https://x.com/AJCLeroyChapman/status/1818236975062634621" target="_blank">in a social media post.</a></p>
<p>A handful of pro-Trump supporters were able to attend the event, such as radio personality P Rae Easley of Chicago, who cheered when Trump went on stage.</p>
<p>In a States Newsroom interview, she said that Trump has done a lot for the Black community.</p>
<p>“You got to be a fool to continue to support the policies” of the Biden administration, she said.</p>
<p>Goba asked about Trump’s support for giving police officers immunity. She asked about Sonya Massey, an unarmed Black woman who called 911 for help and was shot and killed by a deputy.</p>
<p>“Why should someone like that officer get immunity?” Goba asked.</p>
<p>Trump said that he didn’t know the case well and said an officer could make an “innocent mistake.”</p>
<p>“Sometimes very bad decisions are made, they’re not made from an evil standpoint, but they’re made from the standpoint of they made a mistake,” Trump said.</p>
<p>Scott, who covers Congress, asked about the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol and about the law enforcement officers who were injured by the mob of pro-Trump supporters. She asked Trump if Jan. 6 rioters who have been convicted in the courts should be pardoned.</p>
<p>Trump didn’t answer the question and brought up Minnesota, criticizing protests there and across the nation that erupted after a video was publicized showing a white police officer kneeling on the neck of George Floyd, a Black man, who died.</p>
<p>The officer, Derek Chauvin, was later convicted of murder.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">J.D. Vance questions </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Goba asked Trump about his running mate, Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, and his comments demeaning single women, calling them “childless cat ladies.”</p>
<p>Trump never answered the question and went off-topic, attacking Democrats and <a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/apr/08/donald-trump/donald-trump-explains-his-abortion-policy-with-fal/" target="_blank">falsely claiming that they were allowing abortions after birth</a>.</p>
<p>Scott also asked Trump about comments Vance has made about how people with children should be allowed to have more votes than those without.</p>
<p>“One of the bedrock principles of American life is, one person, one vote,” Scott said. “I just want to be clear here, is that the position of your campaign?”</p>
<p>Trump said that the campaign did not believe families should receive more votes and defended Vance.</p>
<p>“He is very family oriented,” Trump said.</p>
<p>Trump then veered into immigration and <a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/jan/12/donald-trump/trumps-claim-that-millions-of-immigrants-are-signi/" target="_blank">falsely claimed that noncitizens were voting in federal elections</a>, which is already illegal and rarely happens.</p>
<p>After the event, Trump Senior Advisor Lynne Patton issued a statement, criticizing the media for “unprofessional commentary directed toward” the former president.</p>
<p>“Today’s biased and rude treatment from certain hostile members of the media will backfire massively,” Patton said. “This will be their undoing in 2024.”</p>

Trump during a July 13 campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Cheatle’s resignation <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/secret-service-director-faces-mounting-calls-resign-over-trump-assassination-attempt" target="_blank">follows an intense congressional hearing</a> where Democrats and Republicans demanded she step down after they grew dissatisfied with her answers about how a gunman was able to get within shooting range of the former president. In the hearing, Cheatle noted that the Secret Service was told about a suspicious person two to five times before the shooting.</p>
<p>According to an email <a href="https://apnews.com/article/secret-service-director-trump-rally-8b1b13cece2ff25590c81093032dceb4" target="_blank">obtained by The Associated Press</a>, Cheatle said to her staff that she took “full responsibility for the security lapse.”</p>
<p>Ronald L. Rowe, the U.S. Secret Service Deputy Director will serve as acting Director of the Secret Service, Department of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas said in a statement.</p>
<p>“I appreciate his willingness to lead the Secret Service at this incredibly challenging moment, as the agency works to get to the bottom of exactly what happened on July 13 and cooperate with ongoing investigations and Congressional oversight,” Mayorkas said. “At the same time, the Secret Service must effectively carry on its expansive mission that includes providing 24/7 protection for national leaders and visiting dignitaries and securing events of national significance in this dynamic and heightened threat environment.”</p>
<p>The Secret Service declined to comment and deferred to DHS.</p>
<p>“I am responsible for leading the agency, and I am responsible for finding the answers to how this event occurred and making sure that it doesn’t happen again,” Cheatle said during Monday’s House Committee on Oversight and Accountability hearing.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Task force will still investigate</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, said even though Cheatle has stepped down, he still plans to continue with plans to form a bipartisan task force to investigate the security failures that led to the attempted assassination, in which <a href="https://penncapital-star.com/campaigns-elections/trump-campaigns-in-western-pennsylvania-with-rally-in-butler-county/" target="_blank">Trump was shot and his right ear injured. </a></p>
<p>“Her resignation is overdue,” Johnson told reporters. “It certainly was the director, but there may be others in the line of authority who are also culpable in what happened in the errors and mistakes there.”</p>
<p>Johnson said the task force will continue “to ensure that those mistakes do not happen again.”</p>
<p>On Trump’s social media site, Truth Social, the former president wrote that the Biden administration “did not properly protect me, and I was forced to take a bullet for Democracy. IT WAS MY GREAT HONOR TO DO SO!”</p>
<p>In a statement, President Joe Biden thanked Cheatle for her service and said he plans to appoint a new director soon.</p>
<p>“As a leader, it takes honor, courage, and incredible integrity to take full responsibility for an organization tasked with one of the most challenging jobs in public service,” Biden said.</p>
<p>He added that an independent review, which he directed the Department of Homeland Security to undertake shortly after the shooting, will “get to the bottom of what happened on July 13.”</p>
<p>“We all know what happened that day can never happen again,” Biden said.</p>
<p>Sen. Chuck Grassley, Republican of Iowa, and Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, Democrat of Nevada,<a href="https://www.grassley.senate.gov/news/news-releases/grassley-and-cortez-masto-next-secret-service-director-must-be-senate-confirmed" target="_blank"> issued a joint statement</a> in which they said they have introduced bipartisan <a href="https://www.grassley.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/protect_act1.pdf" target="_blank">legislation</a> that would require all future directors of the Secret Service be subject to confirmation by the Senate and serve a single 10-year term.</p>
<p>“Our bill is a crucial step toward providing the transparency and accountability that Congress and the American people deserve from the Secret Service,” Grassley said. “In light of former Director Cheatle’s resignation, Congress must now move quickly to pass our legislation and put a qualified individual at the agency’s helm.”</p>
<p>Cortez Masto said that by requiring the director of the Secret Service to be confirmed by the Senate, this will “ensure the same level of oversight as other federal law enforcement agencies and support our hardworking agents in doing the best job they can.”</p>
<p>Mayorkas also praised Cheatle for her work, noting her 29 years of service.</p>
<p>“Over the past two years, she has led the Secret Service with skill, honor, integrity, and tireless dedication,” Mayorkas said in a statement. “She is deeply respected by the men and women of the agency and by her fellow leaders in the Department of Homeland Security.”</p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. Supreme Court Friday upheld a federal law that bars people subject to domestic violence restraining orders from owning a firearm.</p>
<p>In an 8-1 decision on United States v. Rahimi, Chief Justice John Roberts <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/22-915_8o6b.pdf" target="_blank">wrote in the opinion </a>that “our Nation’s firearm laws have included provisions preventing individuals who threaten physical harm to others from misusing firearms.”</p>
<p>“When an individual has been found by a court to pose a credible threat to the physical safety of another, that individual may be temporarily disarmed consistent with the Second Amendment,” Roberts wrote.</p>
<p>Justice Clarence Thomas, a staunch advocate of the Second Amendment, was the lone dissent.</p>
<p>Thomas argued that the question before the court was not if someone can have their firearms taken away under the Second Amendment, but instead whether the “Government can strip the Second Amendment right of anyone subject to a protective order — even if he has never been accused or convicted of a crime. It cannot.”</p>
<p>The White House and gun safety advocates welcomed the long-awaited decision as a major victory.</p>
<p>“No one who has been abused should have to worry about their abuser getting a gun,” President Joe Biden said in a statement. “As a result of today’s ruling, survivors of domestic violence and their families will still be able to count on critical protections, just as they have for the past three decades.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">2022 decision</h4>

	
<p>This was the first major test of the 2022 Supreme Court decision — New York State Rifle &amp; Pistol Association v. Bruen — that struck down a New York law limiting carrying firearms in the open in a decision from the high court that <a href="https://wisconsinexaminer.com/2022/06/23/u-s-supreme-court-expands-gun-rights-in-striking-down-new-york-concealed-carry-law/" target="_blank">greatly expanded gun rights</a>. Thomas wrote that decision.</p>
<p>Because of the Bruen decision, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit vacated Zackey Rahimi’s conviction on the grounds that the federal law violated his Second Amendment rights.</p>
<p>In 2019, Rahimi <a href="https://www.justice.gov/media/1304601/dl?inline#:~:text=In%20December%202019%2C%20Rahimi%20and,knocking%20her%20to%20the%20ground." target="_blank">assaulted</a> his girlfriend in Arlington, Texas, and threatened to shoot her if she told anyone, according to the Department of Justice. That led to a restraining order that suspended his handgun license and prohibited him from possessing firearms.</p>
<p>But Rahimi did not adhere to that order and then threatened another woman with a gun, and two months later opened fire in public five times.</p>
<p>J. Matthew Wright, a federal public defender in North Texas who argued for his client, Rahimi, declined to comment on the decision.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Roberts says appeals court was wrong</h4>

	
<p>Roberts argued the court’s decision in Bruen does “not help Rahimi,” and said the 5th Circuit’s decision was wrong in its methodology.</p>
<p>Roberts said instead of reviewing the circumstances in which the federal law “was most likely to be constitutional, the panel instead focused on hypothetical scenarios where the provision might raise constitutional concerns.”</p>
<p>He said that lower courts have misunderstood the methodology the high court used in the Bruen decision and that those “precedents were not meant to suggest a law trapped in amber.”</p>
<p>Roberts said that lower courts should discern “[w]hy and how the regulation burdens” on the Second Amendment right “are central to this inquiry.”</p>
<p>“For example, if laws at the founding regulated firearm use to address particular problems, that will be a strong indicator that contemporary laws imposing similar restrictions of similar reasons fall within a permissible category of regulations,” he said. “As Bruen explained, a challenged regulation that does not precisely match its historical precursors ‘still may be analogous enough to pass constitutional muster.’”</p>
<p>Liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote a concurring opinion in which she said while she agreed with the Rahimi decision, she still believed Bruen was wrongly decided. However, she added the decision “clarifies Bruen’s historical inquiry.”</p>
<p>“Rather than asking whether a present-day gun regulation has a precise historical analogue, courts applying Bruen should ‘conside(r) whether the challenged regulation is consistent with the principles that underpin our regulatory tradition,’” she said.</p>
<p>Sotomayor said in the Rahimi case, the government did not identify a “founding-era or Reconstruction-era law that specifically disarmed domestic abusers,” but that it didn’t need to because there is “shared principle” in restricting gun use by those who pose a threat.</p>
<p>“History has a role to play in Second Amendment analysis, but a rigid adherence to history, (particularly history predating the inclusion of women and people of color as full members of the polity), impoverishes constitutional interpretation and hamstrings our democracy,” she said.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Historical precedent</h4>

	
<p><a href="https://tennesseelookout.com/2023/11/08/u-s-supreme-court-considers-case-dealing-with-gun-rights-and-domestic-violence/" target="_blank">During oral arguments in November before the court</a>, U.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, representing the Biden administration, argued that the 5th Circuit misinterpreted the Bruen decision.</p>
<p>She said there is historical precedent in the ability of Congress to “disarm those who are not law-abiding, responsible citizens.”</p>
<p>Under a 1994 federal law, anyone who has been convicted in any court of a “misdemeanor crime of domestic violence,” and, or, is subject to domestic violence protective orders, is prohibited from purchasing and having possession of firearms and ammunition.</p>
<p>During those oral arguments, the justices — both liberal and conservative — seemed to side with Prelogar’s argument that the federal law is in line with the longstanding practice of disarming dangerous people and does not violate an individual’s Second Amendment rights.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10209983/" target="_blank">More than half of female homicide victims are killed</a> by current or former male intimate partners. Firearms are used in more than 50% of those homicides.</p>
<p>More than two dozen states have laws that prevent someone subject to an order in a domestic violence case from buying or possessing a gun and ammunition.</p>
<p>Some of those states <a href="https://giffords.org/lawcenter/gun-laws/policy-areas/who-can-have-a-gun/domestic-violence-firearms/" target="_blank">include</a> Alabama, Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia and Wisconsin. Virginia <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/northam-signs-landmark-gun-control-bills-recommends-tweaks-to-two-others/">enacted laws</a> in 2016 and 2020 to establish and strengthen gun laws to protect domestic violence survivors.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Protecting victims</h4>

	
<p>Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/attorney-general-merrick-b-garland-statement-supreme-courts-decision-united-states-v-rahimi" target="_blank">statement</a> the decision upheld a law that “protects victims by keeping firearms out of the hands of dangerous individuals who pose a threat to their intimate partners and children.”</p>
<p>“As the Justice Department argued, and as the Court reaffirmed today, that commonsense prohibition is entirely consistent with the Court’s precedent and the text and history of the Second Amendment,” Garland said.</p>
<p>Angela Ferrell-Zabala, the executive director of the gun safety advocacy group Moms Demand Action, said in a statement that the court’s decision will ensure that “millions across the country will be protected over the desires of gun rights extremists.”</p>
<p>“This is a win for the gun safety movement and another loss for the gun lobby hellbent on putting lives in danger,” Ferrell-Zabala said.</p>
<p>Douglas Letter, the chief legal officer of the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, said in a statement that he hopes lower courts will follow the advice from Friday’s ruling.</p>
<p>“Guns are the number one weapon of choice for domestic abusers, and there is no reason why anyone who is a known danger should be permitted access to firearms,” Letter said.</p>

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced Tuesday $300 million in funding for more than 60 groups seeking to diversify American agricultural exports.</p>
<p>“USDA is pleased to be able to provide the startup capital to tap into these opportunities,” Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said on a call with reporters Monday night previewing the announcement.</p>
<p>In total, 66 organizations will be funded under the new Regional Agricultural Promotion Program, or RAPP. The USDA <a href="https://fas.usda.gov/programs/regional-agricultural-promotion-program" target="_blank">launched</a> the $1.4 billion program in October in order to develop new export markets for U.S. food and agricultural products beyond the traditional partnerships with Canada, Mexico, the European Union and China.</p>
<p>“What this program really provides is an opportunity for us not only to expand geographically the opportunities for trade, but also the products that can be made available,” Vilsack said. “It’s a tremendous opportunity for us to diversify in a variety of different ways to grow market opportunity.”</p>
<p>The program focuses on tapping U.S. exports into new markets in regions such as South and Southeast Asia, Latin America, the Middle East and Africa.</p>
<p>“When you have the major markets, as we’ve had, where 60 to 65% of what we export goes into four or five markets, that can create a sense of complacency,” Vilsack said.</p>
<p><strong>‘The riskiest business in the world’</strong></p>
<p>Vilsack said the funding would be an important step in building wealth in rural areas of the United States.</p>
<p>“We want to make sure our foreign-market development programs and agricultural trade in general work for the full spectrum of American agricultural producers, regardless of their size, their location, their product or target market,” he said. “By investing in exports, we’re investing in the future of American agriculture and rural communities.”</p>
<p>Michigan Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow, who leads the Senate Committee on Agriculture, joined the call with reporters. She said that USDA investing in exports is crucial to growing American agriculture.</p>
<p>“The bottom line is (to) create new revenue for the folks that have the riskiest business in the world,” Stabenow said. “This is a really important way to support them.”</p>
<p>According to a list provided by the USDA, some of the grant recipients include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Hazelnut Marketing Board in Oregon and Washington state will receive $455,000 to conduct market research and trade missions in several countries in Africa.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The U.S. Dairy Export Council, based in Virginia, will receive $10 million to expand its presence in Africa by using the funds to study and develop dairy import regulations and regulatory frameworks in those markets.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The U.S. Meat Export Federation based in Colorado will be awarded $21 million to expand its export efforts to new markets throughout Africa. It will also expand its investment in the convenience-store industry in South Korea, Central America and Colombia.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The Brewers Association in Colorado will be awarded $2 million to partake in the craft beer scene in Southeast Asia, by participating in the region’s premier brewing trade show and festival and bring buyers from that region to top trade shows in the US.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The Cranberry Institute in Massachusetts will receive $1 million to conduct trade education seminars and other events to identify opportunities in India, Brazil, Colombia and Southeast Asia.</li>

(Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)</p><p>WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden responded Thursday to weeks of protest on college campuses calling for a ceasefire in Gaza with a brief statement that the right to protest should be protected, but “not the right to cause chaos.”</p>
<p>“We are not an authoritarian nation where we silence people or squash dissent,” Biden said from the White House’s Roosevelt Room. “In fact, peaceful protest is in the best tradition of how Americans respond to consequential issues. But neither are we a lawless country.”</p>
<p>Biden said that the student-led protests have not made him reconsider policy in the Middle East and that he did not believe the National Guard should be authorized in response to protests across the country.</p>
<p>He criticized the protests that have led to classes being canceled.</p>
<p>“Dissent is essential to democracy, but dissent must never lead to disorder or to deny the rights of others so students can finish a semester or finish their college education,” Biden said. “Order must prevail.”</p>

<p>Students have set up encampments to protest the Israel-Hamas war at about 30 college campuses across the country, including <a href="https://lailluminator.com/2024/04/30/protestors-tulane/" target="_blank">Tulane University in Louisiana</a> and the <a href="https://wisconsinexaminer.com/2024/05/01/police-dismantle-uw-madison-anti-war-encampment-protests-make-over-a-dozen-arrests/" target="_blank">University of Wisconsin-Madison</a>. Some have turned violent.</p>
<p>Fights broke out Tuesday night at UCLA when counter-protesters attempted to dismantle an encampment set up by protesters on the university’s campus, according to <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/05/01/1248433624/protests-campus-ucla-universities-israel-gaza-palestinians" target="_blank">NPR. </a></p>
<p>“Violent protest is not protected,” Biden said. “Peaceful protest is.”</p>
<p>Student protesters have called for a ceasefire and for their institutions to divest from businesses that are tied to Israel, including companies that make weapons that have been used in the war.</p>
<p>More than 34,000 Palestinians have died in nearly seven months of war, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.</p>
<p>Universities have called in police to sweep the encampments, leading to about 1,300 arrests, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/may/02/where-are-the-us-college-campus-protests-and-what-is-happening" target="_blank">according to The Guardian</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Calls from Congress</strong></p>
<p>Lawmakers have also called on higher education institutions to quell the protests, and have raised concerns about antisemitism.</p>
<p>The House on Wednesday <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-speaker-leading-congressional-push-curb-campus-protests-over-gaza" target="_blank">passed a bipartisan bill</a> that would require the  Department of Education to use the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s definition of antisemitism.</p>
<p>Republicans and some Democratic advocates of the bill have argued that the protests are a form of antisemitism.</p>
<p>Critics of the bill say it could chill freedom of speech at educational institutions.</p>
<p>Nationwide protests began at Columbia University in New York on April 17 after the university’s president, Minouche Shafik, <a href="https://edworkforce.house.gov/calendar/eventsingle.aspx?EventID=410264" target="_blank">testified before</a> the House Education and Workforce committee about antisemitism on college campuses.</p>
<p>Students pitched tents to establish a “Gaza Solidarity Encampment.” A day later Shafik authorized the New York Police Department to sweep the area. NYPD officers arrested 108 students – the largest mass arrest on Columbia’s campus since 1968, <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2024/05/02/timeline-the-gaza-solidarity-encampment/" target="_blank">according to the independent student newspaper the Columbia Spectator. </a></p>
<p>After that sweep, students returned and stayed for two weeks until Tuesday, when hundreds of NYPD officers entered Columbia’s campus and cleared the encampments and Hamilton Hall, which students occupied, <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2024/04/30/nypd-sweeps-occupied-hamilton-hall-arrests-dozens/" target="_blank">according to the Columbia Spectator.</a></p>

(C-SPAN screenshot)</p><p>WASHINGTON — During a speech in Madison, Wisconsin on Monday, President Joe Biden touted his administration’s efforts to provide student debt relief through several new proposals, such as canceling accrued interest.</p>
<p>“While (a) college degree still is a ticket to the middle class, that ticket is becoming much too expensive,” Biden said. “Things are a lot different from when college tuition was more affordable and borrowing for colleges, repaying those loans was reasonable.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/biden-proposes-new-student-debt-relief-plan-millions-borrowers" target="_blank">The new proposals </a>announced earlier Monday, if finalized, would include a one-time cancellation of all accrued interest for 23 million borrowers; cancellation of the full amount of student loan debt for 4 million borrowers; and providing more than 10 million borrowers with at least $5,000 in student debt relief, among other initiatives.</p>
<p>As Biden makes his bid for another term, his stance on providing debt relief for student loan borrowers has evolved since he won the 2020 presidential election.</p>
<p>In 2021, during a town hall, a voter from Racine, Wisconsin asked Biden if he would support student loan debt cancellation and <a href="https://wisconsinexaminer.com/2021/03/25/this-racine-voter-asked-biden-to-cancel-student-debt-shes-not-giving-up/" target="_blank">he bluntly replied that he would not, </a>and instead said he would support congressional action on the issue.</p>
<p>The White House believes <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/04/08/president-joe-biden-outlines-new-plans-to-deliver-student-debt-relief-to-over-30-million-americans-under-the-biden-harris-administration/" target="_blank">the new proposals</a> are narrowly targeted enough that they will survive any anticipated legal challenges in order to avoid an outcome similar to last summer, when the <a href="https://washingtonstatestandard.com/2023/06/30/us-supreme-court-rules-against-biden-administration-student-loan-debt-relief-plan/" target="_blank">Supreme Court struck down</a> the Biden administration’s earlier version of student debt cancellation.</p>
<p>“Today, too many Americans, especially young people, are saddled with unsustainable debts in exchange for a college degree,” Biden said in Madison.</p>
<p>Student debt forgiveness remains a key issue for voters, especially young ones. <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/israel-hamas-war-sets-progressive-and-young-voters-collision-course-white-house" target="_blank">The administration has begun to lose support</a> from some young voters who back a ceasefire in Gaza and are frustrated with the administration’s support of Israel in its war against Hamas that has led to the death of more than 30,000 Palestinians, according to the health ministry in Gaza.</p>
<p>The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a center-leaning think tank, has not estimated the cost of the new proposal, but in a statement Monday argued against any debt cancellation.</p>
<p>“This new plan will cost tens of billions of dollars at a time when we should be working to reduce the debt, and by worsening inflationary pressures it’s likely to lead the Fed to keep interest rates higher for longer,” Maya MacGuineas, the president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said in a statement.</p>

(Photo by Ariana Figueroa/States Newsroom)</p><p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. House on a bipartisan vote passed a short-term funding extension Thursday intended to give lawmakers a bit more time to wrap up work on the annual spending bills — trying to dodge a shutdown despite election year politics and narrow margins.</p>
<p>The stopgap spending bill, sometimes called a continuing resolution, or CR, would keep funding mostly flat for programs funded in six of the full-year bills through March 8 and for programs in the other six bills through March 22. That means Congress will face another deadline just next week for action.</p>
<p>The House <a href="https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/202458" target="_blank">voted 320-99</a> to approve the stopgap <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/7463/text" target="_blank">bill</a>, which now goes to the Senate, where any one lawmaker can slow down the approval process, pushing it past the Friday midnight deadline.</p>
<p>A Senate failure to send the bill to President Joe Biden before then would result in a partial government shutdown for the departments of Agriculture, Energy, Housing and Urban Development, Transportation and Veterans Affairs.</p>
<p>Other agencies, like the Food and Drug Administration and military construction projects, would also be closed except for essential staff until a stopgap bill is enacted.</p>
<p>“While at the time of passing our last continuing resolution I had hoped we would not need this measure, we owe it to the American people to do our due diligence in reaching the end of this process,” the top Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, Rep. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, said on the House floor. “I appreciate the respectful bipartisan cooperation that took place to put forward this continuing resolution and move us closer to the finish line.”</p>
<p>GOP Rep. Chuck Fleischmann of Tennessee, an appropriator, acknowledged that many of his Republican colleagues would be upset with another CR, but he noted the slim majority in the GOP and that the bill gives Congress more time to pass the remaining appropriations bills.</p>
<p>“We are where we are,” he said. “This negotiation has been difficult, but to close the government down at a time like this would hurt people who should not be hurt.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Border security </h4>

	
<p>Republicans like Rep. Andy Biggs of Arizona and Bob Good of Virginia expressed their frustration about border security, and said House Republicans have not leveraged the threat of shutting down the federal government to push for changes in immigration policy.</p>
<p>“We just keep spending money and we keep the policies that are in place,” Biggs said.</p>
<p>House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana said during a Thursday press conference that the bill texts for the first package of six spending bills will be released this weekend and members will be given at least 72 hours to read the bills before voting.</p>
<p>“This is a bipartisan agreement in the end, but it sticks to the numbers, the agreement on spending, it does not go above that,” Johnson said. “It will increase a bit, defense spending, but there will be real cuts to non-defense discretionary spending.”</p>
<p>Johnson added that after the remaining appropriations bills are done by the March 22 deadline, he wants to quickly move on to fiscal year 2025, as well as other issues, such as immigration.</p>
<p>Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said Thursday morning the only way for Congress to accomplish anything during divided government is through bipartisanship.</p>
<p>“This agreement is proof that when the four leaders work together, when bipartisanship is prioritized, when getting things done for the American people takes a high priority, good things can happen, even in divided government,” Schumer said. “And I hope this sets the stage for Congress to finish the appropriations process in a bipartisan way very soon.”</p>
<p>Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, said he appreciated the “commitment to see this process through and make good on this essential governing responsibility.”</p>
<p>“As I said earlier this week, government shutdowns never produce positive outcomes. That’s why Congress is going to avoid one this week,” McConnell said. “Leaders in both parties and both houses have agreed to a plan that would keep the lights on while appropriators complete their work and put annual appropriations bills on a glide path to becoming law.”</p>
<p>Congress has used a series of these stopgap funding measures to extend its deadlines for passing the dozen annual appropriations bills after failing to meet an Oct. 1 deadline.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Deep disagreements</h4>

	
<p>House Republicans and Senate Democrats have had fundamental disagreements about spending levels and the policy that goes into the bills for months.</p>
<p>Those differences began after Biden <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/biden-budget-asks-25-tax-billionaires-boosts-domestic-and-defense-spending" target="_blank">submitted his budget request</a> for fiscal year 2024 in March 2023, starting off the annual process.</p>
<p>The disputes appeared to abate a bit after Biden and then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/biden-mccarthy-say-they-have-brokered-debt-limit-deal-avert-us-default" target="_blank">reached agreement on total spending levels</a> in May 2023 at the same time they brokered a bipartisan agreement to address the nation’s debt limit.</p>
<p>House GOP appropriators moved away from that agreement after McCarthy experienced pressure from especially conservative members to significantly cut spending on domestic programs below the agreement.</p>
<p>The original batch of House spending bills also included dozens of very conservative GOP policy initiatives, drawing rebukes from Democrats and impeding the path toward a final bipartisan agreement.</p>
<p>A faction of far-right House Republicans <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-votes-remove-kevin-mccarthy-speaker" target="_blank">ousting</a> McCarthy of California in early October and then spending weeks disagreeing about who should lead them also delayed the process.</p>
<p>Johnson, after becoming speaker, <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/partial-government-shutdown-week-away-johnson-says-hell-stick-spending-deal" target="_blank">renegotiated the spending levels</a> for defense and domestic discretionary programs with Biden in January, starting off the process of merging the GOP bills from the House with the broadly bipartisan bills approved by the Senate Appropriations Committee.</p>
<p>The spending deal sets spending on defense programs at $886.3 billion and provides $772.7 billion for non-defense discretionary spending.</p>
<p>Congressional leaders and the four lawmakers that lead the Appropriations committees in both chambers <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/congress-brokers-deal-government-spending-deadlines-trying-avoid-shutdown" target="_blank">announced Wednesday</a> they’d reached final agreement on six bills and had an agreement for another stopgap spending bill to bridge the gap.</p>
<p>Those bills, which will make up the first so-called “minibus,” include Agriculture-FDA, Commerce-Justice-Science, Energy-Water, Interior-Environment, Military Construction-VA and Transportation-HUD.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">March 22 deadline</h4>

	
<p>The remaining six bills, the toughest to negotiate, haven’t yet garnered bipartisan, bicameral agreement, but the statement said they “will be finalized, voted on, and enacted prior to March 22.”</p>
<p>That spending package is supposed to include the Defense, Financial Services and General Government, Homeland Security, Labor-HHS-Education, Legislative Branch and State-Foreign Operations government funding bills.</p>
<p>Should Congress approve all dozen of the bills before the March 22 final deadline, and Biden signs them, that would place lawmakers 174 days behind their deadline.</p>
<p>That would be the latest members have completed work on all the bills since fiscal 2017, when they wrapped up work 216 days into the fiscal year, <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R46595" target="_blank">according to the nonpartisan</a> Congressional Research Service.</p>
<p>Congress wrapped up work on all the bills during fiscal 2018 by March 23, but that was 173 days behind their deadline. The difference between this fiscal year and then is due to leap day.</p>
<p>The process of funding the government is expected to start anew on March 11 when Biden submits his budget request for fiscal 2025.</p>

(Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)</p><p>WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden huddled with top congressional leaders at the White House on Tuesday amid a crunch over government funding as well as a familiar stalemate over assistance to two major allies — and no solution immediately in sight.</p>
<p>Lawmakers leaving the meeting, which lasted about an hour, said it was worthwhile, even though it didn’t lead to any agreements that would avoid a partial government shutdown from beginning this weekend or clear a Senate-passed package of aid to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan.</p>
<p>“It was a productive meeting on the government shutdown, we are making good progress … (and) the speaker said unequivocally he wants to avoid a government shutdown,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York said following the meeting, referring to House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican.</p>
<p>Johnson faces tensions and demands in the House. Congressional leaders and the Biden administration have agreed to total spending levels for each of the dozen annual appropriations bills, but far-right conservative lawmakers are pressuring Johnson to include policy riders that Democrats have said are unacceptable.</p>
<p>Schumer said it’s likely Congress will need to approve another continuing resolution, or CR, to avoid a partial government shutdown.</p>
<p>Those stopgap spending bills continue the prior fiscal year’s funding levels and policy until Congress reaches agreement on full-year spending bills.</p>
<p>Johnson, who has remained noncommittal on putting assistance to Ukraine on the House floor for a vote, said House Republicans are still “pursuing and investigating all the various options on that.”</p>
<p>“We will address that in a timely manner,” Johnson said at the White House of the global supplemental package.</p>
<p>“The first priority of the country is our border and making sure it’s secure,” Johnson said, adding that he’s “optimistic” the House can prevent a partial shutdown.</p>
<p>Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, said after returning to the Capitol that the meeting went well.</p>
<p>“Well, mainly we talked about keeping the government open, which I think we all agree on,” McConnell said. “And I think we’re making some real headway on the appropriations process.”</p>
<p>Time is short and the House does not return from recess until Wednesday night.</p>
<p>Congress has until Friday at midnight to either pass the Agriculture-FDA, Energy-Water, Military Construction-VA and Transportation-HUD spending bills, or to pass a stopgap spending bill for the federal agencies funded within those four bills.</p>
<p>Congress has until March 8 to pass the other eight remaining appropriations bills for the fiscal year that began back on Oct. 1; otherwise those departments and agencies would begin a shutdown.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘Hope springs eternal’</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>McConnell said during a press conference Tuesday afternoon he believes Congress could pass the four bills due Friday without using a stopgap spending bill to extend that deadline.</p>
<p>“I think we’re getting close on the first four bills; hopefully that won’t require another short-term CR,” McConnell said. “And hope springs eternal.”</p>
<p>Schumer, speaking at a separate press conference inside the Capitol on Tuesday afternoon, said negotiators on the full-year government spending bills are “greatly narrowing the ground of where the disputes are.”</p>
<p>“A key here is making sure that the government doesn’t shut down, which means extending government funding after the deadlines if we can’t reach agreement,” Schumer said.</p>
<p>A White House statement on the meeting said Biden “emphasized that the only path forward is through bipartisan funding bills that deliver for the American people and are free of any extreme policies.”</p>
<p>“The President also emphasized the urgent need for Congress to continue standing with Ukraine as it defends itself every day against Russia’s brutal invasion,” the White House statement said. “He discussed how Ukraine has lost ground on the battlefield in recent weeks and is being forced to ration ammunition and supplies due to Congressional inaction.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Global aid stalled</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The Senate <a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_votes/vote1182/vote_118_2_00048.htm" target="_blank">voted</a> 70-29 in mid-February <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-senate-sends-house-95-billion-aid-package-ukraine-israel-taiwan" target="_blank">to approve a $95 billion emergency spending bill </a>that would provide military and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan.</p>
<p>The vote came after months on hold as Oklahoma Republican Sen. James Lankford, Connecticut Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy and Arizona independent Sen. Kyrsten Sinema <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/details-proposed-major-overhaul-us-immigration-law-global-aid-package-unveiled" target="_blank">negotiated a bipartisan bill </a>to address border security and immigration policy at the insistence of GOP leaders.</p>
<p>Republican senators ultimately <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-senate-kills-immigration-overhaul-hits-stalemate-israel-ukraine-aid" target="_blank">blocked that compromise agreement from moving forward</a>, saying it didn’t go far enough. Johnson’s opposition to the agreement was one of the factors that toppled the bipartisan compromise.</p>
<p>Johnson has been skeptical about passing the Senate-approved assistance package ever since, saying it should include measures to address border security and U.S. immigration.</p>
<p>Johnson said Tuesday following the White House meeting that he met one-on-one with the president and pushed for the southern border to be addressed.</p>
<p>“They understand the catastrophe at the border is affecting everyone and it is top of mind for all the American people,” he said.</p>
<p>Schumer said the discussion about assistance to Ukraine was “the most intense I’ve ever encountered in my many meetings in the Oval Office,” because of the “urgency of supporting Ukraine and the consequences to the people of America, to America’s strength if we don’t do anything.”</p>
<p>Schumer said that while Johnson said he wants policy changes at the southern border, “we made it clear to him, we can’t tarry for the war could be lost” in Ukraine.</p>
<p>McConnell said during the afternoon press conference that he hopes the House will take up the Senate-approved Ukraine bill and pass it without making change, since if they were to amend the legislation, it would have to go back to the Senate, slowing down the process.</p>
<p>“Not only do we not want to shut the government down, we don’t want the Russians to win in Ukraine,” McConnell said. “And so we have a time problem here. And the best way to move quickly and get the bill to the president would be for the House to take up the Senate bill and pass it.”</p>

<p>“This action will particularly help community college borrowers, low-income borrowers, and those struggling to repay their loans,” Biden said in a statement. “And it’s part of our ongoing efforts to act as quickly as possible to give more borrowers breathing room so they can get out from under the burden of student loan debt, move on with their lives and pursue their dreams.”</p>
<p>This initiative builds on the Biden administration’s effort to cancel federal student loan debt following last year’s U.S. Supreme Court decision that struck down the White House’s plan for a one-time cancellation of up to $10,000 for federal borrowers. Student loan borrowers who had received Pell Grants — federal aid to help low-income students pay for higher education — could have qualified for an additional $10,000 in forgiveness.</p>
<p><a href="https://washingtonstatestandard.com/2023/06/30/us-supreme-court-rules-against-biden-administration-student-loan-debt-relief-plan/" target="_blank">Hours after the Supreme Court struck down the plan</a>, the White House announced its SAVE plan, along with a one-year off-ramp program that would not report borrowers to creditors if they failed to make loan payments once repayment started back up in October.</p>
<p>“In the wake of the Supreme Court’s decision on our student debt relief plan, we are continuing to pursue an alternative path to deliver student debt relief to as many borrowers as possible as quickly as possible,” Biden said. “I won’t back down from using every tool at our disposal to get student loan borrowers the relief they need to reach their dreams.”</p>
<p>So far, 6.9 million borrowers have enrolled in SAVE, and of those borrowers, 3.9 million have a $0 monthly payment.</p>
<p>Under the new plan, SAVE calculates payments based on a borrower’s income and family size and forgives balances after a set number of years. The Department of Education has estimated that most borrowers will save about $1,000 per year under the new plan.</p>
<p>Borrowers who are in the former payment plan — known as the Revised Pay as You Earn plan — will automatically be enrolled in the SAVE program.</p>
<p>The states with the highest number of borrowers enrolled in the program include Texas, with 591,700, California with 597,300, Florida with 475,800, New York with 374,300 and Pennsylvania with 289,800.</p>

Virginia is one of 37 states that will receive federal funding to add more electric school buses. (Sarah Vogelsong/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>WASHINGTON — The Biden administration announced Monday $1 billion in funding for more than 2,700 electric and low-emission school buses across 37 states.</p>
<p>This is a second part of funding of a $5 billion, five-year initiative from the bipartisan infrastructure law. In total, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Clean School Bus Program has awarded nearly $2 billion and funded approximately 5,000 electric and low-emission school buses nationwide.</p>
<p>On a call with reporters, EPA Administrator Michael S. Regan said that many school buses “rely on internal combustion engines that emit toxic pollution in to the air.”</p>
<p>“Not only are these pollutants harmful to the environment, but they can also be harmful to the health and well-being of every student, every bus driver and every resident in surrounding communities,” he continued.</p>
<p>Out of the 2,737 school buses, 95% will be electric, the White House said. There are <a href="https://www.ntsb.gov/Advocacy/safety-topics/Pages/schoolbuses.aspx#:~:text=%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8BEvery%20day%20across,school%20and%20school%2Drelated%20activities." target="_blank">roughly half a million school buses</a> across the U.S. used by public schools. A recent Office of Inspector General’s report found that EPA’s Clean Bus Program could be delayed by local utility companies trying to meet demand for electric school buses.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.epaoig.gov/sites/default/files/reports/2023-12/_epaoig_20231227-24-p-0012_cert.pdf" target="_blank">The report</a> found that because “EPA’s 2022 rebate application did not require applicants to coordinate with their utility companies before applying for rebates … the Agency may be unable to effectively manage and achieve the program mission unless utility companies can meet increasing power supply demands for electric school buses.”</p>
<p>In response to that report, Regan said that he is in contact with electric utilities across the country and “they’re excited about (electric vehicles) period, whether it be school buses, whether it be transit or whether it be cars and trucks.”</p>
<p>“I have no doubt that our electricity system can handle this transition,” he said.</p>
<p>Regan said that low-income public school districts and tribal communities make up about 86% of the projects selected to receive funding. Some of those funding mechanisms include grants, rebates and contracts.</p>
<p>States that were given multiple awards for clean energy school buses include Arkansas, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Michigan, Missouri, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Oregon and Washington state, among others.</p>
<p>States that have received single awards that go toward school buses, infrastructure and program costs include:</p>
<p><strong>Virginia</strong></p>
<p>$17 million for 57 school buses</p>
<p>Alabama</p>
<p>$5.9 million for 15 school buses</p>
<p>Iowa</p>
<p>$5.9 million for 15 school buses</p>
<p>Kentucky</p>
<p>$6.9 million for 17 school buses</p>
<p>Maryland</p>
<p>$4.7 million for 50 school buses</p>
<p>New Jersey</p>
<p>$18.9 million for 42 school buses</p>
<p>Nevada</p>
<p>$7.7 million for 25 school buses</p>
<p>New York</p>
<p>$68.9 million for 200 school buses</p>
<p>Pennsylvania</p>
<p>$47.3 million for 120 school buses</p>
<p>West Virginia</p>

<p>WASHINGTON — The 2024 battle for control of Congress is underway in the states, accompanying the accelerating race for the presidency.</p>
<p>Republicans are preparing to funnel money and staff into a select few Senate races in an effort to flip that chamber back to their control, while Democrats are looking toward the districts President Joe Biden won as their pathway back to the majority in the House.</p>
<p>The campaigns are expected to be especially close, with the state and national parties spending millions of dollars, all against the backdrop of the presidential campaigns.</p>
<p>It’s possible that the House and Senate will continue to be split between the parties, but political observers see the prospect of a big switch. If current trends continue through the year, the Senate could well swing from Democratic to Republican control, and the House could flip from the GOP to Democrats.</p>
<p>The margins are tight. House Democrats only need a gain of five seats to regain power and Senate Republicans only need two, come November.</p>
<p>The 2024 Senate map is favorable for Republicans, who are defending 11 seats compared to 23 for Democrats. The GOP has a decent chance of picking up its two needed seats in states that have voted more conservatively in recent years, such as <a href="https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2023/06/23/u-s-sen-sherrod-browns-gop-challengers-familiar-faces-offering-new-messages/" target="_blank">Ohio</a> and <a href="https://dailymontanan.com/2023/02/22/u-s-sen-jon-tester-announces-he-will-seek-re-election-in-2024/" target="_blank">Montana</a>. The two Democratic incumbents there — Sherrod Brown and Jon Tester — will also be campaigning in states that former President Donald Trump easily won in 2016 and 2020.</p>
<p>In the House, <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-republicans-back-formal-impeachment-inquiry-against-biden" target="_blank">GOP leaders have launched an impeachment inquiry</a> into Biden that could risk reelection chances for the 18 Republicans who represent swing districts carried by Biden.</p>
<p>Republicans are also going up against new redistricting maps in the South. Democrats are favored to pick up three seats there — Alabama, Florida and Louisiana — and potentially gain anywhere from two to six GOP-held seats in New York.</p>
<p>House Republicans have struggled all year to govern with their slim majority, and to unify behind a Republican speaker of the House. It took Kevin McCarthy 15 rounds of votes to win the gavel last January. Then, 10 months later, eight Republicans and Democrats voted to <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-votes-remove-kevin-mccarthy-speaker" target="_blank">remove him from the position. </a></p>
<p>That move was not only followed by three weeks of infighting, but any legislative work — including advancing government funding by a quickly approaching deadline — was halted. House Republicans <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/mike-johnson-louisiana-picked-newest-gop-nominee-us-house-speaker-8" target="_blank">finally </a>tapped Rep. Mike Johnson from Louisiana as their speaker.</p>

Gonzales notes in his latest <a href="https://www.insideelections.com/news/article/new-year-new-house-ratings" target="_blank">ratings</a> that “Republicans still have a narrow advantage to maintain their majority, but the presidential race hovers over the entire fight for the House.”</p>
<p>“If the race for the White House is competitive, then the fight for the House should be a close, district-by-district battle,” Gonzales said. “But if the presidential race turns into a lopsided affair, then the presidential winner will likely bring the House majority with them.”</p>
<p>With <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/new-york-republican-george-santos-expelled-us-house-bipartisan-vote" target="_blank">a recent expulsion</a> of GOP freshman George Santos, who was plagued by scandal, and McCarthy’s early retirement, the balance of power for House Republicans is now 220-213. That means Johnson can only afford to lose three GOP members on party-line votes.</p>
<p>The first year of the 118th Congress also <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/congress-was-full-postponements-2023-now-2024-could-be-even-less-productive-0" target="_blank">didn’t involve much governing</a> to tout on the campaign trail.</p>
<p>So far, only 34 bills and resolutions have become law out of 724 votes this year. In 2022, for comparison, 549 votes were held and 248 bills and resolutions became law, according to the Clerk of the House.</p>
<p>The Cook Political Report with Amy Walter <a href="https://www.cookpolitical.com/ratings/house-race-ratings" target="_blank">rates</a> 24 House races as “toss ups,” with 14 of those seats held by Republicans and 10 by Democrats.</p>
<p>Sabato’s Crystal Ball at the UVA Center for Politics <a href="https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/a-republican-senate-in-a-divided-government/" target="_blank">projected</a> in late December that in the House, “court rulings in key redistricting cases, coupled with the political fallout from the Republicans’ internal chaos, gives Democrats a fighting chance to recapture the lower chamber.”</p>
<p>The report, from Thomas F. Schaller, noted that “one has to go back to the late 1800s to find an instance of divided government taking the form of a Republican Senate and a Democratic president and House.”</p>
<p>“Since 1968, all five of the other six possible permutations of divided government have occurred <em>except</em> Republicans controlling just the Senate,” he wrote.</p>
<p>Another challenge for House Republicans is that Johnson for the first time is tasked with raising millions of dollars for the party. Last year, McCarthy raised about $24 million for the GOP’s political action committee, according to Open Secrets.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Redrawn districts</h4>

	
<p>The majority could be made with a handful of races. Several federal court orders require the redrawing of congressional districts that will boost Democrats’ chances of flipping seats.</p>
<p>However, that’s not the case for North Carolina. The delegation is split between seven Republicans and seven Democrats, but the GOP-controlled state legislature adopted a map that greatly favors Republicans.</p>
<p>Under <a href="https://ncnewsline.com/2023/12/19/voting-rights-groups-file-sweeping-lawsuit-against-nc-redistricting-plans/" target="_blank">the new North Carolina map</a>, it’s expected that Republicans are favored for 10 seats and Democrats three. One seat held by a Democrat is rated as a “toss up,” according to The Cook Political Report with Amy Walter.</p>
<p>Several Democrats — Reps. Jeff Jackson, Wiley Nickel and Kathy Manning — have announced they would not seek reelection, arguing that they were gerrymandered out of their seats.</p>
<p>However, a coalition of voting rights groups and several Black voters filed a lawsuit against that new map. The suit, <a href="https://ncnewsline.com/briefs/black-and-latino-voters-sue-over-new-north-carolina-congressional-districts/" target="_blank">following another earlier</a>, argues that the new map violates federal law under the Voting Rights Act by racially gerrymandering seats in the state legislature and congressional districts.</p>
<p>But the new map that favors Republicans in North Carolina could be offset by the New York map.</p>
<p>A recent ruling from New York’s highest court has Democrats eyeing two to six current GOP swing districts that Biden won, making the state a battleground for the 2024 elections. The current New York delegation is made up of 15 Democrats and 11 Republicans.</p>
<p>A new congressional seat in Alabama is <a href="https://www.cookpolitical.com/ratings/house-race-ratings" target="_blank">rated</a> as “likely Democrat,” according to The Cook Political Report with Amy Walter.</p>
<p>Additionally, <a href="https://lailluminator.com/2023/12/15/5th-circuit-denies-louisianas-appeal-in-congressional-redistricting-case/" target="_blank">Louisiana </a>was ordered by the U.S. Supreme Court to draw a second majority-Black district before the 2024 elections that will likely favor Democrats. Republicans currently hold five of the six congressional seats in Louisiana.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Will it be a GOP Senate?</h4>

	
<p>Republicans are on track to regain control of the Senate, though Democrats in red states hope to hold them off against the odds.</p>
<p>The West Virginia Senate seat currently held by Joe Manchin III is highly expected to shift to GOP control <a href="https://westvirginiawatch.com/2023/11/09/manchin-will-not-seek-reelection-to-u-s-senate-in-2024-will-hit-to-road-to-unite-the-middle/" target="_blank">after the centrist Democrat retires. </a></p>
<p>Republican Gov. Jim Justice and Rep. Alex Mooney are among the leading candidates in the Republican primary, scheduled for May 14.</p>
<p>In Montana, the Republican primary on June 4 will determine who faces Tester in the general election. And Ohio voters will choose on March 19 which GOP Senate candidate moves onto the November ballot.</p>
<p>Arizona is another pickup opportunity for Republicans.</p>
<p>Sen. Kyrsten Sinema narrowly won as a Democrat six years ago, but she’s since switched her affiliation to independent. And she hasn’t yet said if she’ll run for reelection, leaving Democrats unclear about whether she could pull votes away from their official nominee. The primary is set for Aug. 6.</p>
<p>The Arizona, Montana and Ohio Senate races are all <a href="https://www.cookpolitical.com/ratings/senate-race-ratings" target="_blank">rated</a> as “toss ups” by The Cook Political Report with Amy Walter.</p>
<p>Another four races for seats currently held by Democrats are rated as “lean Democrat,” meaning those campaigns are considered “competitive,” though “one party has an advantage.”</p>
<p>The 11 Senate seats that Republicans will defend in November are rated as either likely or solid Republican, meaning they aren’t considered “competitive.”</p>
<p>Democrats currently hold 48 seats in the Senate, though two other independents, Maine’s Angus King and Vermont’s Bernie Sanders, are reliable blue votes, as is Sinema. That effectively gives Democrats a 51-seat majority.</p>
<p>Republicans hold the other 49 seats, meaning they’ll need at least two pickups to regain control of the floor and committees.</p>
<p>While Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, would very much like to become majority leader once again, there’s always the possibility of another 50-50 split.</p>
<p>That would leave Senate control up to the presidential election, since Democrats held the majority during the first two years of the Biden administration thanks to the power given to Vice President Kamala Harris under the Constitution to break tie votes.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Money, money, money</h4>

	
<p>As is the case with nearly all modern elections, results will come down to turnout and fundraising.</p>
<p>Following the money has become somewhat complicated, given all candidates have their personal campaign accounts, many have political action committees, or PACs, and the political parties have their own central fundraising committees.</p>
<p>That alphabet soup includes the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and National Republican Senatorial Committee in the Senate. In the House, it’s the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and National Republican Congressional Committee.</p>
<p>Open Secrets, the nonpartisan nonprofit organization that closely tracks campaign spending, reports the amount of money spent to win election to the House and the Senate has risen considerably.</p>
<p>Candidates winning a seat in the House spent on average about $840,000 in 2000, but that price tag has steadily increased ever since, reaching $1.4 million in 2010 and $2.8 million in 2022.</p>
<p>Politicians hoping to become a U.S. senator have experienced a similar trend, though the cost of winning is significantly higher for the upper chamber.</p>
<p>Senators spent about $7.3 million on average to win election in 2000, before that figure rose to $9.8 million in 2010 and $26.5 million during the 2022 elections.</p>
<p>Campaign spending can go much higher than that average, especially when Republicns and Democrats zero in on a few races in attempts to flip a chamber to their party’s control.</p>
<p>Senate candidates in Georgia spent $255 million during the 2022 cycle. In Pennsylvania, another competitive race, candidates spent $167 million. And in Florida, they spent $130 million, <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/elections-overview/most-expensive-races" target="_blank">according to</a> Open Secrets.</p>
<p>The most expensive House election during 2022 was in California’s 47th District, where candidates spent nearly $32 million. Democrat Katie Porter, who is now running for Senate in the primary, won that race.</p>
<p>The 14th Congressional District in Georgia came in second, with candidates spending nearly $30 million. Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene ultimately won that seat.</p>
<p>The third-and-fourth-most expensive House races were in the California districts held by former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, and McCarthy.</p>
<p>House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, a Louisiana Republican, had the fifth-most-expensive House race in the state’s 1st Congressional District. Candidates there spent more than $20 million.</p>
<p>With control of the House, Senate and White House all in front of voters this November, it’s likely that campaign spending records will be set once again.</p>

(Drew Angerer/Getty Images)</p><div id="modal-ready">
<p>WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden signed an<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/12/06/fact-sheet-president-biden-signs-historic-executive-order-to-usher-in-the-next-era-of-tribal-self-determination/" target="_blank"> executive order</a> Wednesday that would make it easier for tribal nations to access and invest federal funding on their own terms.</p>
<p>“It’s hard work to heal the wrongs of the past and change the course and move forward,” Biden said. “But the actions we are taking today are key steps into that new era of tribal sovereignty and self-determination.”</p>
<p>Leaders from tribal nations gathered at the Interior Department for the 2023 White House Tribal Summit, where the Biden administration unveiled dozens of new actions from the federal government affecting Native Americans.</p>
<p>They included land stewardship partnerships, cleanup of historical sites and finalization of regulations for the return of human remains and sacred items taken without consent and kept in museums and across federal agencies.</p>
<p>Biden said that “new era” will be “grounded in dignity and respect that recognizes your fundamental rights to govern and grow on your own terms.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Pipeline for federal funds</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The executive order also creates a “one-stop-shop” for federal funding to be available to tribes and Native American businesses through a database called the <a href="https://www.bia.gov/atc" target="_blank">Tribal Access to Capital Clearinghouse</a>, which was launched at the Tribal Summit, the White House said.</p>
<p>The order directs the federal government to address any shortfalls of existing federal funding for tribes.</p>
<p>“As a result of this executive order, Tribes will spend less of their resources cutting through bureaucratic red-tape to apply or comply with federal administrative requirements and use federal dollars more effectively,” the White House said in a fact sheet about the executive order. “No longer will Tribes be faced with seemingly unnecessary and arbitrary limitations when they are accessing critical funding for public safety, infrastructure, education, energy, and much more.”</p>
<p>Biden said he is backing an effort by the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, which is made up of six Nations — the Mohawks, Oneidas, Onondagas, Cayugas, Senecas and Tuscarora Nation — to compete under its own flag in the 2028 Olympics in lacrosse.</p>
<p>The Haudenosaunee Confederacy invented the sport more than 2,000 years ago.</p>
<p>“Their ancestors invented the game,” Biden said. “Their circumstances are unique, and they should be granted an exception to field their own team at the Olympics.”</p>
<p>The White House also announced more than 190 new co-stewardships with tribal nations to manage federal lands, waters and resources important to those tribes.</p>
<p>There is a co-stewardship agreement with the Department of Commerce, more than 70 co-stewardship agreements with Interior and more than 120 co-stewardship agreements with the U.S. Department of Agriculture.</p>
<p>The Biden administration announced early steps into a co-stewardship cleanup of a sacred site from nuclear waste. The tribal partnership with the U.S. Department of Energy will manage cleanup at Rattlesnake Mountain, or “Laliik,” in Washington state.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Meat processing grants</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The summit also released a progress <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2023.12.04-TNS-Progress-Report.pdf" target="_blank">report</a> that details various actions the Biden administration has taken to strengthen relationships with tribes and the federal government.</p>
<p>At the summit, USDA also announced a partnership to help restore and expand tribal bison. The agency is also announcing its first Indigenous Animals Meat Processing Grant for processing animals such as bison.</p>
<p>Additionally, the White House announced a final rule for the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, which will begin the process of returning Indigenous human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects and objects of cultural patrimony to tribal nations and Native Hawaiian Organizations.</p>
<p>“The regulatory changes streamline the requirements for museums and federal agencies to inventory and identify human remains and cultural items in their collections,” the White House said in a fact sheet.</p>
<p>U.S. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, the first Native American Cabinet secretary, a former member of Congress from New Mexico and a member of the Pueblo of Laguna, said in a statement that the final rule is important in giving Indigenous communities authority in the repatriation process.</p>
<p>“The Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act is an essential tool for the safe return of sacred objects to the communities from which they were stolen,” she said. “Finalizing these changes is an important part of laying the groundwork for the healing of our people.”</p>

<p>WASHINGTON — As Congress negotiates the White House’s $106 billion <a href="https://washingtonstatestandard.com/2023/10/20/israel-ukraine-global-aid-and-border-funding-would-hit-106-billion-under-biden-request/" target="_blank">supplemental aid request</a> for Israel, Ukraine and U.S. border security, fights over immigration policy have tied up the request.</p>
<p>The White House sent <a href="https://idahocapitalsun.com/2023/10/20/israel-ukraine-global-aid-and-border-funding-would-hit-106-billion-under-biden-request/" target="_blank">its proposal</a> that includes nearly $14 billion in supplemental border security funding to Congress in late October, but it will likely look different after going through the House and Senate.</p>
<p>Congress only has a couple of weeks until recess to pass the supplemental measure. A small bipartisan group of six senators in the Senate is trying to put together a border security package.</p>
<p>Those six senators include Democrats Chris Murphy of Connecticut and Michael Bennet of Colorado, independent Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona and Republicans Thom Tillis of North Carolina, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and James Lankford of Oklahoma.</p>
<p>However, Democrats object to some of those Republicans’ attempts to change asylum requirements and place more limits on humanitarian parole, as well as include a hard-line immigration bill passed in the House and advocated by Republicans.</p>
<p>Here’s a look at what’s in the White House request and where negotiations stand:</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What’s in the White House’s proposal?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.dhs.gov/news/2023/10/20/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-supplemental-funding-request" target="_blank">On Oct. 20, President Joe Biden released a request</a> for added funding to focus on border enforcement, deterrence and diplomacy.</p>
<p>The plan would beef up hiring. It includes 1,000 additional U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers and resources for U.S. Homeland Security investigations; an additional 1,300 Border Patrol agents; 300 Border Patrol processing coordinators; an additional 1,600 asylum officers and support staff; 30 new U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services officers to process work authorization documents; and 1,470 additional attorneys and support staff to match the 375 new immigration judge teams to help reduce the more than 2.5 million-case backlog in immigration courts.</p>
<p>The request also asks for additional funding for removal flights, additional beds at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities, and $1.4 billion in Shelter and Services Program grants to local governments and nonprofits for temporary food, shelter, and other services for recently arrived migrants.</p>
<p>This would aid border towns, as well as several cities that have taken in a majority of migrants, such as Chicago, New York City and Washington, D.C., among others.</p>
<p>It would also give Southwest Border ports of entry the technology to enhance inspection capabilities, such as fentanyl detection.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Is a pathway for Dreamers part of this request?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>No. A pathway to citizenship for the 800,000 people in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, who were brought into the country without authorization when they were children, is not part of these border security talks.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What’s the House position?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana wants to include in the supplemental aid package provisions of H.R. 2, <a href="https://georgiarecorder.com/2023/05/11/u-s-house-passes-bill-to-reinstate-trump-era-immigration-policies/" target="_blank">an immigration bill that House Republicans passed in May</a>.</p>
<p>H.R. 2 is a symbolic border security package that mirrors Trump-era immigration policies. It would resume the hundreds of miles of construction of a border wall, strip funding from nonprofits that aid migrants, beef up staffing of Border Patrol agents and restrict the use of humanitarian parole programs that the Biden administration has used to allow nationals from Haiti, Cuba, Nicaragua, Afghanistan, Ukraine and Venezuela to work temporarily in the U.S.</p>
<p>It’s a nonstarter for Democrats in the Senate.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What are the disagreements in the Senate?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Senate Democrats don’t agree with including H.R. 2 in the supplemental package, and Senate Democrats also oppose changes that Republicans want to make to the asylum and humanitarian parole system. The Biden administration has relied heavily on the parole system.</p>
<p><a href="https://arkansasadvocate.com/2023/02/21/biden-administration-proposes-major-new-limits-on-asylum-at-the-border/" target="_blank">The Biden administration already earlier this year placed new restrictions on asylum</a> that resulted in criticism from Democrats and lawsuits from immigration advocacy groups.</p>
<p>Nearly a dozen Senate Democrats have already said they are concerned about the permanent changes that Senate Republicans now want to the asylum and parole system.</p>
<p>Similarly, a group of nearly 200 immigration rights organizations sent a <a href="https://humanrightsfirst.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Joint-Statement-on-Asylum-Negotiations_December-2023-.pdf" target="_blank">letter</a> to Congress urging lawmakers to not make changes to asylum requirements or humanitarian parole and instead use funds “to improve asylum processing; reduce backlogs and work permit waiting times; resource states, localities and community shelter and support services; and fund legal counsel.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What are changes to the parole system that Senate Republicans want?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Republicans want a limit on Biden’s authority to create humanitarian programs by prohibiting the U.S. Department of Homeland Security from using broad criteria to grant humanitarian parole, according to <a href="https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/senate_republican_working_group_one_pager.pdf" target="_blank">a one-page summary</a> by GOP Sens. Lankford, Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Graham.</p>
<p>The GOP proposal would narrow the scope of the parole statute so that parole is only used in rare circumstances. It would also limit the time parole is granted to one year instead of two years.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What are the changes to asylum that Senate Republicans want?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Senate Republicans want to raise the bar for initial credible fear of persecution screenings that migrants present to asylum officers who decide whether a person can reside in the U.S. while their case is being presented before an immigration judge.</p>
<p>Now, to claim asylum under the fear of persecution, migrants must show there is a “significant possibility” they will face persecution. Republicans want to change that language and require asylum seekers to demonstrate that “more likely than not” they would face persecution if they remain in their home country.</p>
<p>Republicans have argued this would “weed out” meritless claims for asylum, but Democrats have contended it would deny lifesaving protection for vulnerable people.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Where are talks now?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>There is no agreement in the Senate or House and negotiations continue.</p>
<p>Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York has made it clear to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Johnson that any border security agreement has to be bipartisan. Schumer has raised concerns about Johnson wanting to include H.R. 2 provisions in the Senate’s supplemental border security package.</p>
<p>“Democrats are willing to work with Republicans on commonsense, realistic border security, but we can’t have the hard right essentially say it’s H.R. 2 or nothing,” Schumer said in a floor speech. “If Speaker Johnson, or for that matter the negotiators, feel they have to listen to what Speaker Johnson can pass just amongst his caucus, we’ll never get anything done.”</p>
<p>Schumer said he plans to hold a vote on the supplemental package as soon as the week of Dec. 4.</p>

(Mark Wilson/Getty Images)</p><div id="modal-ready">
<p>WASHINGTON — Members of a U.S. House committee on Tuesday grilled the head of the General Services Administration over the agency’s recent decision to place the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s new headquarters in Maryland instead of Virginia.</p>
<p>“The process — or lack thereof — raises many questions that need to be answered,” the chair of the House Oversight and Accountability Committee, James Comer of Kentucky, said in his opening remarks.</p>
<p>Maryland and Virginia members of the committee also battled over the decision at the hearing. Democratic Rep. Gerry Connolly of Virginia said he wants the committee to push for an inspector general’s report on the process, and Comer agreed to do so.</p>
<p>GSA last week <a href="https://www.marylandmatters.org/2023/11/08/maryland-confirmed-as-pick-for-new-fbi-headquarters/" target="_blank">picked the Greenbelt, Maryland, site over the Springfield, Virginia</a>, and Landover, Maryland, options for the FBI, which gained praise from Maryland lawmakers but ire from Virginia lawmakers, who criticized the move as political and scrutinized the decision.</p>
<p>Robin Carnahan, the administrator of GSA, said she was confident in the process that the agency underwent in making its decision to relocate the new FBI headquarters from its current location on Pennsylvania Avenue in downtown D.C.</p>
<p>“I am proud of the work that our team did,” she said. “This was inevitable that someone was going to be disappointed, between two states that were working very hard to land this facility.”</p>
<p>The top Democrat on the committee, Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, defended the new site location and pointed out that a site in Virginia wasn’t even considered until 2014.</p>
<p>“The Greenbelt site that was chosen by the site selection authority has the lowest overall cost to taxpayers,” Raskin said.</p>
<p>The Maryland and Virginia delegations pitched their states to the GSA in March, which was required in a provision in a government spending package. In 2005, the FBI’s Asset Management Plan indicated the agency would soon need a new headquarters because of the building’s structural and space issues.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Wray rebuke</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>GOP Rep. Clay Higgins of Louisiana asked Carnahan about a letter that FBI Director Christopher Wray sent to GSA, in which<a href="https://www.marylandmatters.org/2023/11/09/fbi-director-slams-selection-process-for-a-new-hq-in-maryland-while-lawmakers-squabble/" target="_blank"> he rebuked the new location</a>. Wray wrote the FBI “identified concerns about a potential conflict of interest involving the site selection authority and whether changes that individual made in the final stage of the process adhered to the site selection criteria.”</p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="K9P8sYMlxA"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/11/09/fbi-director-slams-selection-process-for-a-new-hq-in-maryland-while-lawmakers-squabble/">FBI director slams selection process for a new HQ in Maryland while lawmakers squabble</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;FBI director slams selection process for a new HQ in Maryland while lawmakers squabble&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/11/09/fbi-director-slams-selection-process-for-a-new-hq-in-maryland-while-lawmakers-squabble/embed/#?secret=Nnr0JKLdii#?secret=K9P8sYMlxA" data-secret="K9P8sYMlxA" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p>Wray didn’t identify the person involved, but a <a href="https://www.gsa.gov/reference/freedom-of-information-act-foia/foia-library" target="_blank">trove of documents</a> released by the GSA showed the ultimate decision was made by Nina Albert, the GSA’s former commissioner of public buildings.</p>
<p>Albert, who left GSA in October, previously worked for the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, which owns the Greenbelt site.</p>
<p>Carnahan said she referred the letter to GSA’s legal counsel to review the process and said there was no merit found to “the suggestion that there was a conflict, or potential conflict (of interest).”</p>
<p>Connolly, however, said Albert “parachuted” into the agency and “unilaterally overturned and redirected the evaluation of these new weighted criteria.”</p>
<p>Connolly questioned why the GSA changed its five criteria in picking a new location in July. The GSA criteria included FBI mission requirements, access to transportation, site development flexibility, sustainability and equity and cost.</p>
<p>Proximity to the FBI mission-related locations moved from 35% to 25%, transportation access moved from 25% to 20%, site development flexibility stayed at 15%, sustainability and equity increased from 15% to 20% and cost increased from 10% to 20%.</p>
<p>Carnahan pushed back on the notion that Albert “overturned” the decision.</p>
<p>“You ended up picking one side over the other, and that raises serious questions about the process,” Connolly said.</p>
<p>Ohio Republican Rep. Jim Jordan also questioned how long Albert was in the position.</p>
<p>Carnahan said that Albert came to work at GSA in 2021.</p>
<p>Maryland Rep. Glenn Ivey asked Carnahan if she believed there was a conflict of interest because Albert previously worked for Metro.</p>
<p>“What I have said from the beginning, what was most important to me, is that we have a fair and transparent process when making this decision,” she said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Downsizing the government footprint</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>On the broader subject of government property, several Republicans pressed Carnahan on how GSA would downsize office space due to federal employees who are doing telework.</p>
<p>GOP Rep. Virginia Foxx of North Carolina asked Carnahan how much the agency is spending to maintain office buildings.</p>
<p>Carnahan said that half of the agency’s portfolio is made up of leases and the other half is owned. She added that 23 buildings are in the process of being put up for sale, which would mean a reduction of 3.5 million square feet of office space.</p>
<p>GOP Rep. Jake LaTurner of Kansas pressed Carnahan about the number of employees that are fully remote versus in the office every day.</p>
<p>“My position is that when you have backlogs or acquisitions to get information from the government, we’re paying for office space for these folks to show up to work every day, they ought to be showing up to do their job,” LaTurner said.</p>
<p>She said that 40% of their workforce is remote because those jobs are typically tech.</p>
<p>“We can get more talent if we can have (remote jobs) spread out all over the country,” Carnahan said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Comer-Moskowitz exchange</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>There was a small outburst during the hearing between Comer and Florida Democratic Rep. Jared Moskowitz.</p>
<p>Moskowitz criticized Comer for his impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden and his family’s business dealings overseas. Moskowitz said those hearings have yet to find evidence and slammed Comer for his own business dealings with his brother.</p>
<p>Comer said that when their father died, his brother could not afford to buy the family farm, so Comer bought the land for him.</p>
<p>The conversation became heated, with Comer saying the allegations were “bulls&#8212;” multiple times, and then drew attention to Moskowitz’s outfit — a blue suit.</p>
<p>“You look like a Smurf here just goin’ around with all this stuff,” Comer said.</p>
<p>Eventually, Democratic Rep. Kweisi Mfume of Maryland quelled the heated exchange and the hearing continued.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. House Republicans on Wednesday voted for Louisiana’s Mike Johnson as speaker in a chamber that has been frozen for more than three weeks after former Speaker Kevin McCarthy was ousted.</p>
<p>In a 220-209 party-line vote, all Republicans present backed Johnson. All Democrats present voted for Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York.</p>
<p>Republican Conference Chair Elise Stefanik of New York nominated Johnson, 51, who represents his state’s 4th District, saying the conservative congressman “epitomizes what it means to be a leader.”</p>
<p>“Today is the day that House Republicans will humbly look in our hearts and elect Mike Johnson as speaker of the people’s House,” Stefanik said.</p>
<p>Democratic Conference Chair Pete Aguilar of California nominated Jeffries, calling him a “far contrast from who Republicans nominated.”</p>
<p>“The most pressing needs of everyday Americans are his North Star,” Aguilar said.</p>
<p>Johnson, who does not have a strong bipartisan track record, will be tasked with working with the Democratic-controlled Senate on a quickly approaching Nov.17 government funding deadline, and critical legislation such as the recent nearly $106 billion supplemental request from the Biden administration to fund Ukraine, Israel and global aid and U.S border security.</p>
<p>Johnson has voted against several recent bipartisan pieces of legislation such as the infrastructure law, a gun safety bill signed into law and the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act.</p>
<p>Johnson was one of more than 100 House Republicans who voted to block Pennsylvania and Arizona’s 2020 presidential election results following the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.</p>
<p>In advance of the joint session of Congress on Jan. 6 Johnson led a <a href="https://mikejohnson.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=715" target="_blank">statement</a> with 36 fellow Republicans outlining opposition to the Electoral College results in Georgia and Michigan as well.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. House Republicans Tuesday voted to tap Minnesota’s Tom Emmer as speaker following five rounds of ballots — but Emmer quit the race just four hours later, after he was attacked by the GOP’s most powerful figure, former President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>After beating six candidates, Emmer, the No. 3 Republican, faced an uphill battle to coalesce more than 20 hard-right Republican holdouts loyal to Trump, who took to social media shortly after the vote to warn that electing Emmer would be a “tragic mistake.”</p>
<p>“He never respected the Power of a Trump Endorsement, or the breadth and scope of MAGA,” Trump, also a 2024 candidate for president, wrote about Emmer on his site, Truth Social. “He is totally out-of-touch with Republican Voters.”</p>
<p>Emmer, 62, who represents a safe GOP district that includes parts of the western and northern Twin Cities suburbs, the city of St. Cloud and rural areas in between, had continued to meet with holdouts on Tuesday afternoon following the closed-door conference vote.</p>
<p>Emmer quickly left the meeting later Tuesday, dogging reporters chasing after him. He declined to comment before entering a black car. Lawmkers said he dropped out a short time later.</p>
<p>With Emmer out, Republicans will have to begin their nomination process anew and it was unclear how that would proceed.</p>
<p>Emmer would have had to get nearly all of the 221 Republican votes on the House floor, as all Democrats are expected to vote for Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. In the final secret ballot, Emmer earned 117 GOP votes, a long way from the 217 needed for the speaker’s gavel if all Republicans are present and voting.</p>
<p>In a roll call conference vote, again behind closed doors, on whether a member would support him on the floor, Emmer’s support grew to 186, according to several lawmakers in the meeting.</p>
<p>Several Republicans leaving Tuesday’s meeting, such as Reps. Steve Womack of Arkansas and Dusty Johnson of South Dakota, acknowledged that Emmer did not have the votes needed to become speaker, but still remained hopeful that Emmer could narrow that gap.</p>
<p>Womack said that because the conference had a roll call ballot, Emmer can see which Republicans were holdouts.</p>
<p>“I expect that Tom would want to meet with the individuals that are not calling his name and see if there is something he can say or do that could bring them around and help shore up their requisite 217,” Womack said. “If he can’t do that, then he’s got to make a decision as to whether he goes to the floor.”</p>
<p>Womack added that there are some members that will always be against Emmer, but he did not name them.</p>
<p>“What I just saw in that room illustrates to me that there are some people that are pretty well dug in and are not going to support the current designee,” he said.</p>
<p>For example, Georgia’s Rick Allen, had already stated he will never vote for Emmer because the Minnesota Republican voted<a href="https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2022513" target="_blank"> to codify same-sex marriage, according to CNN.</a></p>
<p>Johnson said that Emmer was working on flipping those holdouts.</p>
<p>“People with concerns are coming forward, and he’s taking them head on,” Johnson said.</p>
<p>When asked how many members voted against Emmer in the roll call vote, Mike Waltz of Florida said “too many.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Third GOP nominee</h4>

	
<p>Emmer was the third Republican nominee for speaker.</p>
<p>The first, Louisiana’s Steve Scalise <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/scalise-drops-out-race-us-house-speaker" target="_blank">never brought his nomination for a floor vote</a> and the second, Ohio’s Jim Jordan, was <a href="https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2023/10/20/jim-jordan-again-rejected-in-bid-for-u-s-house-speaker-and-gop-struggles-to-regroup/" target="_blank">tossed aside</a> by the party after his third and final unsuccessful floor vote for the speaker’s gavel.</p>
<p>The House has been without a speaker for 21 days.</p>
<p>Emmer, who serves in GOP leadership as the Republican whip, had the endorsement of former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, but would have had to court members and allies of the far-right House Freedom Caucus who are aligned closely with Trump.</p>
<p>On Monday, Emmer posted a video in which he said he has always “gotten along” with Trump, who is also the current GOP front-runner in the 2024 presidential election.</p>
<p>In a Monday campaign stop in New Hampshire, Trump was asked if he’d endorse Emmer. The former president said he’d “always gotten along with” Emmer, but said he was trying to allow House Republicans to choose their own leader.</p>
<p>Emmer posted <a href="https://twitter.com/GOPMajorityWhip/status/1716536001819017487" target="_blank">a video clip of the appearance to X</a>, saying as speaker, he would continue the pair’s “strong working relationship.”</p>
<p>However, by Tuesday, Trump had posted about his opposition to Emmer on his social media site.</p>
<p>Emmer was also one of the few candidates running for the speakership who voted to certify the 2020 election results.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The speaker campaign</h4>

	
<p>On Monday night, as they tried again to elect a speaker, House Republicans heard pitches from eight of their colleagues who had filed by a Sunday deadline. Pennsylvania’s Dan Meuser was also a candidate but dropped out in the middle of the <a href="https://www.penncapital-star.com/government-politics/u-s-house-republicans-mull-eight-new-candidates-for-speaker-in-advance-of-votes/" target="_blank">closed-door candidate forum</a>.</p>
<p>Those GOP <a href="https://newjerseymonitor.com/2023/10/23/nine-republicans-are-running-for-u-s-house-speaker-heres-your-guide-to-the-field/" target="_blank">lawmakers who ran</a> for the speaker’s gavel included Reps. <a href="https://alabamareflector.com/2023/10/23/alabama-congressman-gary-palmer-to-run-for-u-s-house-speaker/" target="_blank">Gary Palmer of Alabama</a>, <a href="https://floridaphoenix.com/2023/10/20/floridas-byron-donalds-is-now-a-candidate-for-u-s-house-speaker/" target="_blank">Byron Donalds of Florida</a>, Austin Scott of Georgia, <a href="https://lailluminator.com/2023/10/21/another-louisiana-republican-joins-u-s-house-speaker-fray/" target="_blank">Mike Johnson of Louisiana</a>, <a href="https://michiganadvance.com/2023/10/21/rep-bergman-says-his-hat-is-in-the-ring-for-u-s-house-speaker/" target="_blank">Jack Bergman of Michigan</a>, Kevin Hern of Oklahoma and Pete Sessions of Texas.</p>
<p>Early Tuesday, Scalise, the House majority leader, said the goal is for Republicans to unify behind a nominee and get back to legislative work that has been stalled since McCarthy was <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-votes-remove-kevin-mccarthy-speaker" target="_blank">ousted earlier this month. </a></p>
<p>“There’s a lot of work to do,” Scalise said. “All of these things are bills that are ready to go that we want to move.”</p>
<p>Whoever becomes speaker will be tasked with a quickly approaching <a href="https://ncnewsline.com/2023/09/30/ditching-ukraine-aid-u-s-house-in-bipartisan-vote-passes-bill-to-avert-shutdown/" target="_blank">Nov. 17 deadline for government funding</a> and a nearly <a href="https://ncnewsline.com/2023/10/20/israel-ukraine-global-aid-and-border-funding-would-hit-106-billion-under-biden-request/" target="_blank">$106 billion supplemental aid request</a> from the White House for Ukraine, Israel and global aid and U.S. border security. Emmer will also have to lead in moving must-pass legislation such as the <a href="https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2023/08/01/massive-defense-bill-approved-by-u-s-senate-but-deep-partisan-divide-with-house-looms/" target="_blank">annual defense bill</a> and five-year <a href="https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/2023/10/09/farm-bill-stalled-amid-u-s-house-speaker-battle-delay-of-spending-bills/" target="_blank">reauthorization of the farm bill</a>.</p>
<p>On top of legislative duties the new speaker will have to balance striking deals with a White House and Senate controlled by Democrats while also fundraising and protecting vulnerable Republicans and expanding the House’s slim GOP majority in the 2024 elections.</p>
<p>McCarthy said he wants to see the party move beyond its deep fractures and that there must be “consequences” for the eight Republicans who voted with Democrats to oust him.</p>
<p>“It’s frustrating because it’s just a few, these eight, working with all the Democrats to ruin the reputation of the Republicans, but we’ll earn it back,” the California Republican said.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Five ballots for Emmer</h4>

	
<p>Republicans went through five secret ballots on Tuesday to get to a nominee. Some candidates withdrew their names prior to voting to speed the process along, such as <a href="https://alabamareflector.com/2023/10/24/gary-palmer-withdraws-from-u-s-house-speaker-race/" target="_blank">Palmer</a> and Meuser.</p>
<p>Sessions was dropped in the first round of ballots; Bergman in the second round; Scott in the third round; Hern in the fourth round; and Johnson in the fifth round. Donalds withdrew in the fourth round.</p>
<p>Because Republicans have struggled to rally behind one candidate, Rep. Mike Flood of Nebraska asked all speaker candidates and GOP lawmakers to sign a unity pledge.</p>
<p>But there were clear signs of dissent.</p>
<p>For the first four rounds of secret ballots, six lawmakers voted either present or for others besides the announced candidates, stirring concern that a candidate may not be able to gain the support of the majority of the conference on the floor.</p>
<p>Bill Huizenga of Michigan said as the final ballot was ongoing, he had a message for those Republicans who voted present: “We got to figure this out. Stop voting present, stop voting for other people. We have two candidates.”</p>
<p>One of those who voted present, Troy Nehls of Texas, said that Emmer had no chance of becoming speaker and that as Republicans, “we are, again, back to where we started.”</p>
<p>Rep. Brett Guthrie of Kentucky said Emmer asked the holdouts to remain in the room after an up-or-down roll call vote to discuss differences.</p>
<p>“So when I left, several people who voted different than Emmer were at the microphone,” he said.</p>
<p>Rep. Ann Wagner of Missouri said she hoped Emmer’s approach would rebuild trust among the conference.</p>
<p>“This is really good because it also does away with this feeling that there are any kind of backroom deals going on or that people are, you know, getting their wish lists,” Wagner said, referring to one-on-one meetings that other speaker candidates have held.</p>
<p>In January, McCarthy made a secret handshake deal with far right conservatives before he won on a 15th ballot.</p>
<p>Mario Díaz-Balart of Florida said that while Donalds was his first choice, he wanted to unify around Emmer whom he described as “honorable.”</p>
<p>As whip “he has the relationships. If he can’t pull it together then we’re running into some very, very difficult times,” he said.</p>
<p>House Democrats continued to criticize the GOP Tuesday.</p>
<p>“Chaos and dysfunction continue to be the order of the day in the House Republican majority. Today is day 21 without a speaker, and the other side is back to square one,” Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar said at a press conference.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Emmer finances, fundraising</h4>

	
<p>Known in Congress as a promoter of cryptocurrency, Emmer’s own finances are remarkably traditional, according to personal financial reports required of members of Congress.</p>
<p>In his most recent annual report, filed in May, Emmer listed only one asset, an investment account worth between $15,000 and $50,000, and one liability, a mortgage of between $100,000 and $250,000.</p>
<p>He listed no stock holdings, transactions, gifts or other finances — a rarity for congressional financial disclosures that are<a href="https://alabamareflector.com/2023/02/07/tuberville-among-four-in-alabama-congressional-delegation-to-invest-in-corporate-stocks/" target="_blank"> often</a><a href="https://westvirginiawatch.com/2023/07/11/manchin-earned-476k-in-2022-from-family-coal-company-congressional-disclosures-show/" target="_blank"> more</a><a href="https://mainemorningstar.com/2023/09/19/maines-u-s-senators-among-stock-holding-members-of-congress-financial-disclosures-show/" target="_blank"> complicated</a>.</p>
<p>A prolific fundraiser as the former head of the House Republican campaign operation, Emmer has raised millions from the cryptocurrency sector and promoted the technology in the House, where he sits on the Financial Services Committee.</p>
<p>He raised $2 million for the National Republican Congressional Committee in the 2022 cycle from the political action committee of Ryan Salame, the former co-CEO of FTX, a crypto firm that went bankrupt after serious allegations of fraud.</p>
<p>Immediately following that scandal, Emmer<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/ftx-failure-divides-lawmakers-how-tough-get-crypto-regulation" target="_blank"> maintained</a> that the FTX example should not undermine the promise of cryptocurrency itself.</p>
<p>For the current campaign cycle, Emmer has raised a combined $3.7 million for his own campaign and for his leadership PAC. He’s raised $230,000 from contributors in the securities and investment industry — more than any industry other than “retired,” according to the nonprofit campaign spending tracking group Open Secrets.</p>

</p><p>WASHINGTON — U.S. House Republicans Monday night gathered behind closed doors to hear the pitches of eight candidates for the speaker’s gavel, as the chamber approaches three weeks without a speaker.</p>
<div id="modal-ready">
<p>Monday’s nearly three-hour meeting was meant to produce a leading GOP candidate, so that when Republicans vote behind closed doors on Tuesday, there will be a new speaker designate who can be brought to the House floor for a vote. Ohio’s Rep. Jim Jordan on Friday was cast aside by the conference after he failed to gain enough support on the floor.</p>
<p>“We heard tonight, a really strong vision laid out by each of them. Everybody has a lot of the same goals in mind,” said Majority Leader Steve Scalise of Louisiana, who was briefly the nominee two weeks ago before bowing out. “We need to get moving on our agenda.”</p>
<p>The<a href="https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/2023/10/23/nine-republicans-are-running-for-u-s-house-speaker-heres-your-guide-to-the-field/" target="_blank"> eight Republican men who have declared their candidacy</a> for speaker of the House are Reps. <a href="https://alabamareflector.com/2023/10/23/alabama-congressman-gary-palmer-to-run-for-u-s-house-speaker/" target="_blank">Gary Palmer of Alabama</a>, <a href="https://floridaphoenix.com/2023/10/20/floridas-byron-donalds-is-now-a-candidate-for-u-s-house-speaker/" target="_blank">Byron Donalds of Florida</a>, Austin Scott of Georgia, <a href="https://lailluminator.com/2023/10/21/another-louisiana-republican-joins-u-s-house-speaker-fray/" target="_blank">Mike Johnson of Louisiana</a>, <a href="https://michiganadvance.com/2023/10/21/rep-bergman-says-his-hat-is-in-the-ring-for-u-s-house-speaker/" target="_blank">Jack Bergman of Michigan</a>, Tom Emmer of Minnesota, Kevin Hern of Oklahoma and Pete Sessions of Texas.</p>
<p>Rep. <a href="https://www.penncapital-star.com/blog/u-s-rep-dan-meuser-of-pennsylvania-says-hes-a-candidate-for-speaker-of-the-house/" target="_blank">Dan Meuser of Pennsylvania</a> declared himself a candidate on Sunday but he dropped out of the race during the closed-door meeting Monday night.</p>
<p>“I came in late. I have other commitments that I want to adhere to, largely leading President Trump’s campaign in Pennsylvania. And, we have great candidates,” Meuser said.</p>
<p>Meuser said former President Donald Trump supported his decision to exit the speaker race “based upon the situations at hand and with some of the other members that are in so as we get a strong speaker,” but stopped short of endorsing another candidate.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Majority vote</h4>

	
<p>According to House Republican <a href="https://www.gop.gov/conference-rules-of-the-118th-congress/" target="_blank">rules</a>, any nominee must get a majority of the vote of the conference in the closed-door meeting. Because there are eight candidates, it could take a while before Republicans rally around a speaker designate.</p>
<p>If none receives a majority during the first ballot, the candidate with the least votes would be removed from the ballot and another round of voting would begin.</p>
<p>With 221 House Republicans, a candidate needs the support of 111 to become the speaker nominee in the conference vote. However, the nominee would likely need 217 votes on the floor if all Republicans are present and voting.</p>
<p>The GOP’s speaker designate can only afford to lose a handful of votes on the House floor, as all Democrats are expected to vote for House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York for speaker.</p>
<p>Any Republican speaker will have to walk a delicate line negotiating with the White House and Democratic-controlled Senate on must-pass legislation like an annual defense bill, and aggressively fundraise for the Republican Party as well as protect vulnerable Republicans and expand their slim House majority in the upcoming 2024 elections.</p>
<p>The next speaker of the House will also be tasked with an upcoming <a href="https://ncnewsline.com/2023/09/30/ditching-ukraine-aid-u-s-house-in-bipartisan-vote-passes-bill-to-avert-shutdown/" target="_blank">Nov. 17 deadline on government funding</a>, as well as nearly <a href="https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2023/10/23/israel-ukraine-global-aid-and-border-funding-would-hit-106-billion-under-biden-request/" target="_blank">$106 billion in supplemental aid request from the White House </a>for Israel, Ukraine and U.S. border security.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Unity pledge</h4>

	
<p>House Republicans have been unable to pick a successful candidate to replace former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, who was <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-votes-remove-kevin-mccarthy-speaker" target="_blank">ousted in early October</a> by eight Republicans voting with all Democrats. Following his removal, McCarthy said he would not run again, but has said the decision is ultimately up to the Republican conference.</p>
<p>Jordan brought his candidacy to the floor<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/jim-jordans-bid-be-us-house-speaker-ends-after-rejection-gop-closed-meeting" target="_blank"> three times</a>. With each vote, he continued to lose GOP support.</p>
<p>Following Jordan’s losses, House Republicans held a secret vote in which Jordan failed to garner enough votes from his fellow GOP lawmakers to continue as the nominee.</p>
<p>The first speaker candidate, Louisiana’s Scalise, never called a floor vote, stepping down <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/scalise-drops-out-race-us-house-speaker" target="_blank">a day after he was selected</a> as the nominee after he realized he couldn’t reach the 217 votes needed to become speaker.</p>
<p>To avoid continued struggles to come together in unity behind a candidate, Nebraska Rep. Mike Flood unveiled <a href="https://flood.house.gov/media/press-releases/congressman-flood-launches-unity-pledge-speakers-race" target="_blank">a unity pledge</a> Friday, urging his Republican colleagues to sign and give their support for the speaker designate, regardless of who becomes the candidate.</p>
<p>“I wanted to start this process, this election, with us understanding that we have to be unified to the end of it,” Flood said to reporters.</p>
<p>As of Monday night, all eight candidates signed the pledge, Flood said.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Damage to GOP</h4>

	
<p>Several Republicans, such as Reps. Dusty Johnson of South Dakota and Ralph Norman of South Carolina, said that Republicans ultimately have to pick a speaker because the last few weeks have been damaging to the party.</p>
<p>“Hopefully, small groups of members who have stood in the way of us getting work done in the past understand how incredibly damaging the last four weeks have been,” Johnson said, referring to the beginning of the month when McCarthy was removed.</p>
<p>Norman argued that “there is no perfect speaker,” and that Republicans need to unify behind a candidate.</p>
<p>Following the Republican candidate forum, House Rules Committee Chair Tom Cole of Oklahoma said that all the candidates were good and that he hopes a new speaker can be picked quickly.</p>
<p>Rep. Brett Guthrie of Kentucky said he supports Flood’s unity pledge.</p>
<p>“I think anybody asking for our votes should commit to supporting whoever wins. That’s the only way we’re gonna govern, if we become a majority,” Guthrie said on his way into the candidate forum.</p>
<p>“Anybody who gets 51% at the end of the day, we walk across the street, hold hands and vote for that person … And that’s the way it should be,” said Rep. Vern Buchanan of Florida.</p>
<p>Rep. Matt Gaetz, who sparked McCarthy’s ouster earlier this month, said he thought the candidates did “a great job” in the forum.</p>
<p>“I was most heartened by those who wanted to advance single-subject spending bills rather than link disparate issues like Ukraine funding and Israel funding together,” the Florida Republican said.</p>
<p>Rep. Victoria Spartz of Indiana said she’s pleased to see “competition and vibrancy.”</p>
<p>“I think it’s important for us to govern, but I truly think it’s a good process. This institution is so broken, so only crisis maybe will help, for the American people, to make us work,” Spartz said.</p>
<p>She added that she has “concerns” with some of the candidates, not specifying who, but said she wanted “to give people a chance.”</p>
<p>Whichever candidate gets a majority of the vote will coordinate with North Carolina’s Patrick McHenry, who has been serving as speaker pro tempore, to bring the nomination to the floor for a vote.</p>
<p>McCarthy handpicked him for the role under a procedure established in the wake of the 9/11 attacks to ensure continuity of government. <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/scalise-drops-out-race-us-house-speaker" target="_blank">It’s unclear what legislative authority</a> McHenry has, and House Republicans last week <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-gripped-paralysis-again-after-gop-punts-proposal-speaker-pro-tem" target="_blank">punted on adopting a resolution</a> that would temporarily allow McHenry to move legislation.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">A range of experience</h4>

	
<p>Of all the candidates, Minnesota’s Emmer is the highest ranking Republican.</p>
<p>Emmer has the advantage of already being a member of House GOP leadership and party insider, with connections as a former National Republican Congressional Committee head.</p>
<p>But Emmer, the current House majority whip, is facing criticism from the far right. Emmer did not support Trump’s false 2020 election victory claims, and voted to certify the Electoral College count.</p>
<p>However, he did sign onto a lawsuit out of Texas challenging election results in swing states that Biden won in 2020.</p>
<p>Like Emmer, Palmer also sits in a GOP House leadership position, as chair of an advisory committee known as the Republican Policy Committee.</p>
<p>Hern, who at one point owned two dozen McDonald’s franchises, chairs the Republican Study Committee, a body that has promoted a conservative agenda among House GOP lawmakers since the 1970s.</p>
<p>Hern said the closed-door meeting had a good turnout and he was happy to answer questions from his GOP colleagues. He said they asked “questions of concern about where our conference currently is and where it needs to go.”</p>
<p>Donalds, who belongs to the far-right House Freedom Caucus, received floor nominations for speaker last week and in January during the course of more than a dozen ballots that finally declared McCarthy the winner.</p>
<p>Donalds, first elected in 2020, defended his legislative record, pointing to his time as a Florida state legislator.</p>
<p>“I know the legislative process,” he said. “I’ve worked with our colleagues up here to get a lot of policies done.”</p>
<p>Donalds added that he spoke with Trump but did not answer reporters who asked if the former president would endorse him.</p>
<p>“The president is going to watch us do our process,” he said. “I think he’s gonna be happy with who’s gonna be the next speaker of the House.”</p>
<p>The former president did endorse Jordan, who co-founded the House Freedom Caucus, and struggled to win the support of more centrist Republicans. Members who voted against Jordan also received death <a href="https://kentuckylantern.com/2023/10/19/members-of-u-s-house-gop-describe-threats-sparked-by-votes-against-jim-jordan-for-speaker/" target="_blank">threats</a> and other threatening messages from Jordan allies.</p>
<p>Scott briefly challenged Jordan but lost an internal secret ballot on Oct. 13. Scott is vice chairman of the House Committee on Agriculture, where he chairs the panel on General Farm Commodities, Risk Management, and Credit. He is also the co-chair of the Congressional Crop Insurance Caucus.</p>
<p>He said that many of the candidates running are similar and “there are no personal differences between us.”</p>
<p>“It’s just a matter of being able to do things and get the ball rolling in the right direction,” Scott said. “I’m committed to a House that operates and functions.”</p>
<p>Scott added that he did not specify a plan for government spending to Republicans, but “laid out a path forward for us as a conference.”</p>
<p>Johnson chairs the House Judiciary Committee’s Subcommittee on Constitution and Limited Government, and chairs the Congressional Long Range Strike Caucus.</p>
<p>Bergman, a former lieutenant general in the U.S. Marines and commercial airline pilot, does not hold a leadership position on any committees or caucuses, but he does sit on three House committees, including Armed Services and Veterans Affairs.</p>
<p>Sessions, who has served in Congress for over two decades and was a former head of the NRCC, currently sits on two House committees.</p>
<p>“We’re gonna find out what people think,” Sessions said about whether Republicans would support his nomination.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON — Ohio Republican Jim Jordan is no longer the Republican nominee for speaker of the U.S. House.</p>
<p>Shortly after a failed floor vote Friday on Jordan’s bid, Republicans held a closed-door meeting where Jordan failed to garner enough votes from his fellow GOP lawmakers to stay in the race as their nominee.</p>
<p>“I told the (Republican) conference it was an honor to be their speaker designee,” Jordan said to reporters.</p>
<p>The floor vote was Jordan’s third attempt this week to win sufficient support from Republicans, who hold a slim majority in the House.</p>
<p>“We’ll have to go back to the drawing board,” former Speaker Kevin McCarthy told reporters.</p>
<p>Louisiana’s Steve Scalise said that Republicans will pick a new nominee and come back to their quandary on Monday.</p>
<p>North Carolina’s Patrick McHenry, who has been serving as speaker pro tempore, told reporters that the plan is to have a floor vote for speaker on Tuesday.</p>
<p>A candidate forum for a new speaker designee will be held Monday night at 6:30 p.m. Eastern. Republican Rep. Kevin Hern of Oklahoma told reporters shortly after Jordan’s rejection that he would run.</p>
<p>“I just voted for my good friend Jim Jordan to stay as our Speaker Designate, but the conference has determined that he will no longer hold that title. We just had two speaker designates go down. We must unify and do it fast. I’ve spoken to every member of the conference over the last few weeks. We need a different type of leader who has a proven track record of success, which is why I’m running for Speaker of the House,” Hern wrote on X Friday afternoon.</p>
<p>Rep. Austin Scott of Georgia, who briefly challenged but lost to Jordan in conference on Oct. 13, said he will enter the race again.</p>
<p>“If we are going to be the majority we need to act like the majority, and that means we have to do the right things the right way. I supported and voted for Rep. Jim Jordan to be the Speaker of the House. Now that he has withdrawn I am running again to be the Speaker of the House,” Scott wrote on X.</p>
<p>Rep. Jack Bergman, who had been mulling a bid, said Friday afternoon that his “hat is in the ring.”</p>
<p>“And I feel confident I can win the votes where others could not. I have no special interests to serve; I’m only in this to do what’s best for our Nation and to steady the ship for the 118th Congress,” he wrote on X.</p>
<p>Reports on X from news media indicated that Tom Emmer of Minnesota and Byron Donalds of Florida will also run.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. House rejected Ohio’s Jim Jordan as a candidate for speaker on Tuesday in the first round of voting, though the chamber was expected to potentially conduct additional votes on Jordan’s bid later in the day.</p>
<p>Jordan, co-founder of the far-right Freedom Caucus and one of the lawmakers who bolstered former President Donald Trump’s false claims about the 2020 election, was unable to clinch the votes needed to hold the gavel amid concerns about his agenda and frustrations with his history inside and outside of Congress. The House has now gone two weeks without a speaker.</p>
<p>Twenty Republicans, including Rep. Jen Kiggans of Virginia, as well as all Democrats, voted against Jordan on the first ballot.</p>
<p>​​Florida Rep. Gus Bilirakis was the only Republican who didn’t vote.</p>
<p>House Republican Conference Chair Elise Stefanik, of New York, said in her nomination speech that Jordan is a “patriot” who would “go after corruption and deliver accountability.”</p>
<p>“Jim is the voice of the American people who have felt voiceless for far too long,” Stefanik said. “Whether as Judiciary chair, conservative leader, or representative for his constituents in west central Ohio, whether on the wrestling mat or in the committee room, Jim Jordan is strategic, scrappy, tough and principled.”</p>
<p>House Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar, of California, nominated New York Rep. Hakeem Jeffries for speaker, saying he was the clear candidate for anyone who wanted a bipartisan path ahead.</p>
<p>“The choice before us is simple, come together on a bipartisan path forward, or take us over the cliff,” Aguilar said. “Abandon the extremism that is preventing us from getting things done, or triple down on division and dysfunction.</p>
<p>&#8220;A vote today to make the architect of a nationwide abortion ban, a vocal election denier and an insurrection insider to the speaker of this House would be a terrible message to the country and our allies,” Aguilar said.</p>
<p>There was no majority of the vote needed to elect a speaker, with Jeffries receiving 212 votes and Jordan receiving 200, while other lawmakers got some of the Republican votes.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">McCarthy ousted two weeks ago</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The stalemate comes two weeks after eight House Republicans and Democrats <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-votes-remove-kevin-mccarthy-speaker" target="_blank">voted to remove Kevin McCarthy as speaker </a>about nine months into his tenure.</p>
<p>McCarthy had to hold 15 separate votes in January before he was able to become speaker and only after making several agreements behind closed doors with far-right members of the party.</p>

<p>After McCarthy announced he wouldn’t try again to become speaker, Louisiana’s Steve Scalise and Jordan <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/louisianas-steve-scalise-and-ohios-jim-jordan-jump-race-us-house-speaker" target="_blank">announced their bids</a> for the role.</p>
<p>Scalise, currently the majority leader, <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/scalise-nominated-us-house-gop-speaker-closed-door-meeting" target="_blank">won the first secret ballot nomination vote</a> within the House Republican Conference. But he never scheduled a floor vote and <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/scalise-drops-out-race-us-house-speaker" target="_blank">withdrew from the race</a> after just one day.</p>
<p>Jordan had said after losing the first nomination vote that he would back Scalise on the floor, but several of his followers refused to back their party’s speaker nominee.</p>
<p>House Republicans huddled again Friday to take a second nomination vote for speaker, choosing between Jordan and Georgia’s Austin Scott.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/ohios-jordan-latest-us-house-gop-nominee-speaker-after-days-turmoil" target="_blank">Jordan won that nomination vote</a>, but another secret ballot taken afterward showed that more than 50 House Republicans said they wouldn’t support him during a floor vote.</p>
<p>That <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/jim-jordan-gains-support-vote-nears-us-house-speaker-outcome-still-doubt" target="_blank">gap dwindled over the weekend and throughout Monday </a>as several Republicans, who said they would never back Jordan during a floor vote, announced public support.</p>
<p>Several holdouts remained heading into Tuesday’s floor vote, leaving Jordan short of the roughly 217 votes he would need to become speaker.</p>
<p>Those holdouts maintained their opposition throughout the first ballot on Tuesday afternoon.</p>
<p>“I’m voting for a good, solid, conservative Republican. That’s the only kind of person I’ll vote for,” Rep. Carlos Giménez of Florida said immediately following the vote.</p>
<p>Rep. Dusty Johnson of South Dakota said he anticipated that Jordan might not have all the votes on the first ballot, but he said he remained hopeful that those GOP holdouts would flip.</p>
<p>“A lot of the people who are holding out are very reasonable people,” Johnson said. “It’s my assessment that when people stay at the table that a deal is possible.”</p>
<p>Rep. Lori Chavez-DeRemer of Oregon, who voted for McCarthy on the first ballot, said she did so because he was the closest Republican to secure the necessary 217 votes, but noted that she would “continue to reassess where things stand as this process plays out.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Attempt to expand McHenry powers</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Pennsylvania GOP Rep. Mike Kelly <a href="https://kelly.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/kelly.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/kellpa_030_xml.pdf" target="_blank">introduced a resolution</a> Monday night to elect Rep. Patrick McHenry as speaker pro tempore for up to 30 days. Approving that resolution would expand McHenry’s powers beyond what they are as the speaker pro tempore by designation, Kelly said.</p>
<p>Under the resolution, McHenry, a North Carolina Republican, would stay in the role until Nov. 17 — the same day government funding is set to expire — or until a new speaker is elected, whichever is first.</p>
<p>McHenry has been serving as the speaker pro tempore by McCarthy’s designation under a process put in place to ensure continuity of government following the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.</p>
<p>Chavez-DeRemer said she feared the chaos of the last few weeks would only continue under a Jordan speakership. With the Republican conference still bitterly divided, she said the chamber should empower McHenry.</p>
<p>“Until we can find clear consensus among the Republican Conference, it’s time to give expanded authority to Speaker Pro Tempore McHenry so the House can resume governing,” she <a href="https://twitter.com/RepLCD/status/1714327863694959013" target="_blank">wrote on X</a>, formerly Twitter.</p>

(Win McNamee/Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON — Louisiana Republican Rep. Steve Scalise withdrew from the race for U.S. House speaker on Thursday evening, just one day after his colleagues nominated him for the role.</p>
<p>“Our conference still has to come together and it’s not there,” Scalise told reporters. “I was very clear we have to have everybody put their agendas on the side and focus on what this country needs. This country is counting on us to come back together, this House of Representatives needs a speaker and we need to open up the House again.”</p>
<p>Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan was the only other declared candidate for speaker. He was <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/scalise-nominated-us-house-gop-speaker-closed-door-meeting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">narrowly beaten by Scalise during the conference vote Wednesday</a> and quickly pivoted to backing Scalise while encouraging those who supported him to back Scalise as well.</p>
<p>After announcing he would withdraw his nomination, Scalise did not say whether he would back Jordan for speaker.</p>
<p>“I’m sure there will be a lot of people that look at it,” Scalise said of future candidates for speaker. “But it’s got to be people that aren’t doing it for themselves and their own personal interests.”</p>
<p>While Scalise got a majority of the 221 votes during the closed-door conference meeting, more than a dozen Republican lawmakers said they wouldn’t vote to elect him speaker on the floor.</p>
<p>Scalise announced his decision to step aside following the second meeting of the House Republican Conference on Thursday. The group met for about three hours in the afternoon and then regrouped in a room in the Capitol building’s basement around 7:30 p.m. Eastern.</p>
<p>Georgia’s Marjorie Taylor Greene and Virginia’s Bob Good were among those who said they wouldn’t back Scalise during a floor vote.</p>
<p>The U.S. House has been without a speaker for more than a week after eight GOP lawmakers and Democrats <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-votes-remove-kevin-mccarthy-speaker" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voted to remove California Rep. Kevin McCarthy </a>from the post after just nine months.</p>
<p>Following Scalise’s nomination withdrawal, McCarthy said that Scalise will still be the party’s majority leader.</p>
<p>He called out the eight Republicans who voted with Democrats to remove him as speaker.</p>
<p>“How do you let 4% of the conference do this to the entire country?” McCarthy said. “I just think the conference as a whole has to figure out their problems, solve it, and select a leader.”</p>
<p>The chamber has been essentially frozen since then, with North Carolina Rep. Patrick McHenry filling the role of speaker pro tempore. There are still questions on<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/how-does-frozen-us-house-function-without-speaker-everyones-got-opinion" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> how the chamber can function</a> in the absence of a speaker.</p>
<p>The pro tem job, created following the 9/11 terrorist attacks to ensure continuity of government, is not clearly defined in House rules.</p>
<p>A House procedure expert told States Newsroom during an <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/theres-still-no-speaker-us-house-could-patrick-mchenry-be-solution" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interview</a> on Thursday that the chamber could temporarily elect McHenry, or any other House member, to the role if they wanted to begin moving resolutions or bills.</p>
<p>Some House Republicans have begun suggesting the party do just that if they cannot elect a speaker on the floor soon.</p>
<p>Support for Jordan is already growing with House Republicans. Jim Banks of Indiana <a href="https://twitter.com/RepJimBanks/status/1712617988573069685" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted on X</a>, formerly Twitter, that he would support Jordan as speaker.</p>
<p>“Jim Jordan is a conservative fighter who can unite our party and he continues to have my full support to be the next Speaker of the House,” Banks wrote.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. House Republicans elected Louisiana Rep. Steve Scalise as their nominee for speaker Wednesday following a secret ballot vote in a closed-door conference, according to Republicans leaving the meeting.</p>
<p>“We need to make sure we’re sending a message to people all throughout the world, and that the House is open and doing the people’s business,” Scalise told reporters after the meeting.</p>
<p>Scalise did not confirm whether he had all the votes from his party to take the gavel, but said “we’re gonna have to go upstairs on the House floor and resolve this and get the House reopened again.”</p>
<p>The next step for Scalise, who currently is the majority leader, will be garnering the support of nearly all his GOP colleagues to win a floor vote to become speaker, replacing former Speaker Kevin McCarthy of California.</p>
<p>The nominee picked in the conference meeting only needed to get the backing of a majority of the 221 House Republicans, but Scalise will need about 217 on the floor before he can hold the gavel.</p>
<p>When asked whether he would vote for Scalise, Rep. Scott Perry of Pennsylvania, chair of the far-right House Freedom Caucus, said, “We’re going to go figure it out. Vote’s pretty close.”</p>
<p>“We need to quit having this place run the way it’s run,” he added on how he could be convinced to support the Louisiana Republican.</p>
<p>Rep. Kevin Hern of Oklahoma told reporters as he left the meeting that he will run for House majority leader.</p>
<p>Republicans haven’t yet announced when a floor vote will take place. The House briefly came into session at 3 p.m. and then adjourned.</p>
<p>Reps. Frank Lucas of Oklahoma, Ashley Hinson of Iowa and John James of Michigan gave nominating speeches for Scalise. His path to the nomination was smoothed when Republicans tabled a proposal by Texas Republican Chip Roy to change the rules on how a nominee was selected.</p>
<p>The other candidate was Ohio’s Jim Jordan, chair of the House Judiciary Committee.</p>
<p>Reps. Kelly Armstrong of North Dakota, Erin Houchin of Indiana and Mike Carey of Ohio nominated Jordan.</p>
<p>Reps. Tim Burchett of Tennessee and Matt Gaetz of Florida who voted to oust McCarthy said they would support Scalise on the floor.</p>
<p>“Long live Speaker Scalise,” Gaetz, who filed the motion to vacate McCarthy, said.</p>
<p>The new speaker will have several crises to address as soon as the swearing-in is over.</p>
<p>The first task will likely be addressing the situation in Israel, which is under an ongoing attack from Hamas and possibly other organizations.</p>
<p>Scalise said if elected speaker, one of the first orders of business for the House is to pass a resolution showing the United States support for Israel.</p>
<p>Congress will need to approve supplemental funding <a href="https://kansasreflector.com/2023/10/10/biden-denounces-deadly-hamas-attack-on-israel-theres-no-justification-for-terrorism/" target="_blank">expected to be requested</a> by President Joe Biden, an issue that will garner strong bipartisan support. Biden has <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/biden-denounces-deadly-hamas-attack-israel-theres-no-justification-terrorism" target="_blank">said</a> he wants Congress to take “urgent action” on Israel’s security needs.</p>
<p>Scalise, if elected speaker, will need to work with the Democratic Senate to pass some type of government funding bill ahead of a Nov. 17 deadline. Additional aid to Ukraine could be attached to that package, or a bill carrying aid to Israel.</p>
<p>Scalise also would be tasked with fundraising, protecting centrist Republicans and wrangling far-right conservatives to support his agenda.</p>
<p>However, there are some GOP lawmakers who still plan to vote for Jordan on the House floor, such as Rep. Max Miller of Ohio.</p>
<p>He said he’d back Jordan “because he’s not in leadership.”</p>
<p>“Trust has been shattered in that room,” Miller said. “The only way, in my opinion, that you regain that trust is with a whole new set of people.”</p>
<p>Florida Rep. Kat Cammack said after the closed-door meeting she doesn’t believe Scalise will get the votes needed on the floor to become speaker.</p>
<p>“I think that what’s going to happen at three o’clock is going to be a continuation of the chaos that has plagued the House.”</p>

<p>WASHINGTON — Dissident Republicans in the U.S. House voted with Democrats on Tuesday to oust Kevin McCarthy as speaker, a historic move that came just nine months after he secured the gavel following days of negotiating with the GOP’s right flank and 15 rounds of voting.</p>
<p>It wasn’t immediately clear after the vote how the House would proceed in the coming days, having entered uncharted territory. No speaker has <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/HMAN-104/pdf/HMAN-104-pg142.pdf" target="_blank">ever before been removed </a>by the House. North Carolina Rep. Patrick McHenry was named speaker pro tem until the election of a new speaker, and he sent the House into a recess.</p>
<p>The 216-210 vote on a motion to vacate, which Florida Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/florida-rep-matt-gaetz-files-motion-oust-mccarthy-us-house-speaker" target="_blank">filed</a> Monday evening, capped off months of growing dissent among a small group of House Republicans.</p>
<p>Republican Reps. Andy Biggs of Arizona, Ken Buck of Colorado, Tim Burchett of Tennessee, Eli Crane of Arizona, Gaetz, Bob Good of Virginia, Nancy Mace of South Carolina and Matt Rosendale of Montana voted to remove McCarthy.</p>
<p>They also <a href="https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2023518" target="_blank">voted against tabling the motion</a>, which took place just before the vote and would have stopped the process from moving forward.</p>
<p>&#8220;The American people need a speaker who will fight to keep the promises Republicans made to get the majority, not someone who cuts fiscally irresponsible deals that get more Democrat votes than Republican votes,&#8221; said Good in <a href="https://twitter.com/RepBobGood/status/1709288188261343327" target="_blank">a post on X Tuesday</a>.</p>
<p>Warren Davidson of Ohio, Cory Mills of Florida and Victoria Spartz of Indiana voted against tabling, but for keeping McCarthy as speaker.</p>
<p>All House Democrats present voted to declare the office of the speaker vacant.</p>
<p>Immediately after the House was declared in recess, Republicans crowded McCarthy for handshakes, hugs and pats on the back.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Only three motions to vacate in history</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>So far, there have only been three instances where a motion to vacate was filed, one in March 1910, one in July 2015 and the one this month.</p>
<p>McCarthy said before the vote that he was calling Gaetz’s bluff, though he appeared to accept he would be ousted as speaker.</p>
<p>“At the end of the day, if you throw a speaker out that has 99% of their conference, that kept the government open and paid the troops — I think we’re in a really bad place for how we’re going to run Congress,” McCarthy said.</p>
<p>The California Republican said he believed his support for passing a bipartisan short-term spending bill on Saturday, preventing a partial government shutdown, was the “right decision.”</p>
<p>“I stand by that decision and at the end of the day, if I have to lose my job over it, so be it,” McCarthy said. “I’ll continue to fight.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">McCarthy excoriated </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Gaetz and other hard-line conservatives have publicly rebuked McCarthy for not holding to a private deal he struck with them in January in order to secure the speakership.</p>
<p>The group of GOP lawmakers, some of whom are in the Freedom Caucus, have lamented McCarthy striking an agreement with President Joe Biden in May to avoid a default on the nation’s debt and for relying on Democratic votes to pass the short-term government spending bill.</p>
<p>Gaetz, speaking Monday on the floor, called on McCarthy to detail whether he had brokered a private deal with Biden to hold a vote on legislation that would provide additional aid to Ukraine in its fight against the Russian invasion. He also criticized McCarthy for reportedly adding border security to those talks.</p>

<p>“I get that a lot of folks might disagree with my perspectives on the border or Ukraine,” Gaetz said. “But could we at least agree that no matter how you feel about Ukraine or the Southern border, they each deserve the dignity of their own consideration and should not be rolled together.”</p>
<p>House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries released a “Dear Colleague” letter just before the vote announcing House Democrats would vote to vacate the chair.</p>
<p>“Given their unwillingness to break from MAGA extremism in an authentic and comprehensive manner, House Democratic leadership will vote yes on the pending Republican Motion to Vacate the Chair,” Jeffries wrote.</p>
<p>The group of Republican dissenters who voted to remove McCarthy represents a small fraction of the House Republican Conference, many of whom backed McCarthy on the floor Tuesday and defended his record.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">GOP supporters: ‘He did the right thing’</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>“He’s being punished because he did the right thing on Saturday and made sure that the government didn’t shut down, and we bought more time to continue the appropriations process,” GOP Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma told reporters.</p>
<p>Cole offered the motion to table on behalf of McCarthy.</p>
<p>Arkansas GOP Rep. Steve Womack told reporters before the vote the motion to vacate was a distraction and a “fool’s errand.”</p>
<p>Womack, who sits on the Appropriations Committee, said Republicans should focus on clearing all 12 appropriations bills before the new mid-November deadline.</p>
<p>“We just took the country to the brink of a shutdown for the purpose of what? Moving the rest of our appropriation bills,” Womack said. “We need to finish our work, and the only way to do that is to pass the rule and get these bills across the floor and move to the Senate in conference.”</p>
<p>Rep<strong>. </strong>Dusty Johnson of South Dakota told reporters Gaetz’s push for a motion to vacate showed there are “middle school grudges” against McCarthy.</p>
<p>“I think that Matt (Gaetz) is making a huge error,” Johnson said. “I think America is gonna be less well off because of his efforts. I think chaos has not served this country.”</p>

<p>Republican Rep. Stephanie Bice of Oklahoma told reporters she was skeptical of the motivations some have stated for removing McCarthy as speaker.</p>
<p>“This isn’t about the appropriations process, and don’t be fooled. (Gaetz) wants to talk about the fact that we should have been doing our (appropriations) work in August. Look, it didn’t happen. So now is the time, and instead of focusing on that for the next 43 days, we’re going to be focusing on this,” Bice said.</p>
<p>GOP Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania told reporters that Republicans should focus on clearing legislation to fully fund the government and work on getting aid to Ukraine.</p>
<p>“If we vacate the chair, the government will shut down, our credit rating will go down, interest rates will go up,” Fitzpatrick said. “Ukraine will be victimized and lose that war to Russia. That is what is at stake here.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Democrats cheer behind closed doors</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Democrats huddled behind closed doors for nearly 90 minutes Tuesday morning to plot a path forward and allow members to speak for up to one minute about the motion to vacate. Rounds of applause and some cheering could be heard from the hallway outside the meeting.</p>
<p>Democratic lawmakers said after the meeting that McCarthy hadn’t built trust.</p>
<p>New Hampshire Democratic Rep. Annie Kuster told reporters the party had “unity of purpose” ahead of the vote.</p>
<p>“What has happened that all of you have witnessed and the American people have witnessed is that the current speaker has chosen to cater to a very extreme element that, in my view, it’s sort of a post-truth world,” Kuster said. “I think you can see that within his own caucus, but you can certainly see it in the way he’s treated us and the American people.”</p>
<p>Congressional Progressive Caucus Chair Pramila Jayapal, a Washington state Democrat, told reporters that the House GOP could “wallow in their pigsty of incompetence and inability to govern.”</p>
<p>Jayapal said that Republican infighting about who their speaker should be was not an issue that Democrats felt the need to solve. She also noted that McCarthy has repeatedly broken trust with Democrats, making the party reluctant to help him keep the speakership.</p>
<p>“Nobody trusts Kevin McCarthy, and why should we? He has broken his commitment over and over again,” Jayapal said.</p>
<p>McCarthy, Jayapal said, has made a series of decisions that have eroded any support he would have had from Democrats. Those include his public comments following the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol by pro-Trump rioters, his decision to walk away from a spending agreement he and Biden brokered earlier this year and his decision to withhold bringing a bill to the floor that would provide additional aid to Ukraine.</p>

<p>“Kevin McCarthy stood on the House floor and said one thing and then talked to Donald Trump and immediately did something else,” Jayapal said. “He has supported the insurrectionist president that enabled January 6 to happen and tried to obstruct the peaceful transfer of power.”</p>
<p>Jeffries, a New York Democrat, told reporters before the vote the party would “continue to put people over politics and to fight to make life better for everyday Americans.”</p>
<p>“From the very beginning that has been our objective and it will continue to be our sole focus,” Jeffries said. “We encourage our Republican colleagues, who claim to be more traditional, to break from the extremists.”</p>
<p>Jeffries said that Democrats were “ready, willing and able to work together with GOP lawmakers.&#8221;</p>
<p>“But it is on them to join us to move the Congress and the country forward,” Jeffries said.</p>
<p>Rep. Richard Neal, a Massachusetts Democrat, told reporters after the closed-door meeting there wasn’t “a lot of goodwill in that room for Kevin McCarthy.”</p>
<p>“If you’re gonna negotiate, you have to negotiate with somebody you can trust who can actually keep their word,” Neal said. “And there’s not been a lot of evidence that Kevin McCarthy has kept his word along the way.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Disputes over spending, Ukraine</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Just hours before a shutdown would have begun this weekend, Congress approved a short-term bill to fund the government until Nov. 17. The House passed the stopgap measure in a <a href="https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2023513?Page=2" target="_blank">335-91</a> vote, with 90 Republicans opposing it. Senators approved the bill <a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_votes/vote1181/vote_118_1_00247.htm#position" target="_blank">88-9</a>, with nine Republicans opposed.</p>
<p>The deal didn’t include additional funding for Ukraine, though Biden said Sunday that he and McCarthy <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/next-battle-congress-over-ukraine-aid-biden-presses-house-speaker-vote" target="_blank">agreed</a> to find the votes needed to pass a supplemental package with military assistance and humanitarian relief for the war-torn country as it resists further invasion by Russia.</p>
<p>The stopgap funding bill to avert a government shutdown was not the only time McCarthy worked with Democrats to avert financial calamity. In May the speaker <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/biden-mccarthy-say-they-have-brokered-debt-limit-deal-avert-us-default" target="_blank">brokered</a> a deal with Biden to raise the debt ceiling and keep the U.S. from defaulting on its loans.</p>
<p>The deal, signed into law as the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/3746?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%22fiscal+responsibility+act%22%7D&amp;s=1&amp;r=1" target="_blank">Fiscal Responsibility Act</a>, included agreed-upon spending levels for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1.</p>
<p>McCarthy has been <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/government-shutdown-nears-us-house-gop-fails-pass-one-month-spending-plan" target="_blank">unable to unify</a> his far-right members around the established spending levels during this year’s appropriations process, bringing the federal government within hours of a partial shutdown.</p>
<p>House lawmakers on the far-right of the spectrum have been browbeating McCarthy since before he took the gavel.</p>
<p>McCarthy’s path to the speakership in January took 15 ballots as more than a dozen far-right conservatives blocked him during a four-day stalemate.</p>
<p>The California Republican won on the 15th ballot after <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-gop-backs-mccarthy-speaker-after-tense-and-chaotic-late-night-session-25" target="_blank">several concessions</a> to the ultra-conservative wing of his party, including a change to the motion to vacate that will allow any one member to essentially call for a no-confidence vote on the speaker.</p>
<p>McCarthy also reserved spots on key committees for far-right members and entered a handshake deal with members of the House Freedom Caucus, promising to cut spending levels.</p>

(Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)</p><div id="modal-ready">
<p>WASHINGTON — A sweeping government shutdown appeared inevitable on Friday, with the U.S. Senate stuck in a procedural holding pattern on its bipartisan stopgap bill and divided U.S. House Republicans unable to pass their short-term spending bill.</p>
<p>Both chambers of Congress must approve and President Joe Biden must sign government funding legislation before midnight on Saturday, otherwise a funding lapse would begin on Oct. 1.</p>
<p>But mid-afternoon Friday, a month-long funding <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/BILLS-118hr5525ih/pdf/BILLS-118hr5525ih.pdf" target="_blank">bill</a> packed with steep spending cuts drafted by some of the more conservative members of the House GOP <a href="https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2023511?Page=2" target="_blank">failed</a> to pass, 198-232. Twenty-one Republican members opposed it. The measure would have had no future in the Democratic-controlled Senate.</p>
<p>House leaders following that vote announced they will be in session and voting on Saturday, though on what was not immediately clear ahead of a GOP conference meeting in the late afternoon.</p>
<p>The mood lagged in the U.S. Capitol on Friday, where workers and law enforcement chatted in the hallways and cafeterias about the prospect of working without pay.</p>

<p>More than 3.5 million federal employees <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/disaster-nears-millions-federal-workers-paychecks-would-be-hold-shutdown" target="_blank">would either work without pay or be furloughed</a> if the government shuts down. Federal employees would receive back pay after the shutdown ends, though that provision has not extended to federal contractors in the past.</p>
<p>U.S. troops, roughly 1.3 million people, <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/active-duty-military-would-work-without-pay-shutdown-white-house-warns" target="_blank">would be required to work without pay </a>until the shutdown ends.</p>
<p>A partial government shutdown wouldn’t have broad impacts on so-called mandatory spending programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, because those accounts are not predominantly funded through the annual appropriations process.</p>
<p>A shutdown would have varying effects on the dozens of departments and agencies that do rely on Congress to approve new spending bills each year.</p>
<p>Those include the departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Education, Energy, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, Interior, Justice, Labor, State, Transportation, Treasury and Veterans Affairs. Almost all services for veterans would continue, however.</p>
<p>Other activities were affected as well by the looming shutdown — former President Jimmy Carter’s 99th birthday party at the Carter Center in Atlanta was <a href="https://georgiarecorder.com/2023/09/29/with-shutdown-looming-celebration-for-jimmy-carters-99th-birthday-starts-early/" target="_blank">moved up </a>to Saturday instead of Sunday.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Border security and spending cuts</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>During debate on the failed GOP bill, Ohio Republican Rep. Jim Jordan said the legislation would fund the government, cut spending and “secure the border.” GOP lawmakers attached a border security bill they passed earlier this year to the short-term funding bill.</p>
<p>“Three simple, common sense things, but the most important of those three is … the border situation,” Jordan said.</p>
<p>Florida Democratic Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz said the stopgap spending bill would be a “gift basket to far-right extremists” that will “slingshot” the federal government into a shutdown.</p>
<p>“The gutting cuts in this bill do not continue current funding like we’ve historically done in continuing resolutions,” she said. “Instead, this so-called CR slashes cancer and Alzheimer’s research, defunds the police, undercuts allies like Israel and Ukraine.”</p>
<p>House Republicans’ stopgap spending bill would have cut funding below current levels, resulting in billions less available for federal departments and agencies. The departments of Defense, Homeland Security and Veterans Affairs would have been exempted from those cuts.</p>

<p>White House budget director Shalanda Young argued during a Friday briefing that Speaker Kevin McCarthy should stick to the spending deal <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/biden-mccarthy-say-they-have-brokered-debt-limit-deal-avert-us-default" target="_blank">he and the president brokered </a>in May.</p>
<p>“The speaker wanted to set toplines, we set them,” Young said.</p>
<p>Young criticized House Republicans for not agreeing to the Senate stopgap bill that would last through Nov. 17 to give lawmakers more time to come to an agreement to pass the 12 appropriations bills into law.</p>
<p>“This is not hard,” Young said. “It is not meant to come back and negotiate and redo things we just agreed to do three months ago. It is to keep the government open to give congressional negotiators more time on long-term bills.”</p>
<p>McCarthy, a California Republican, said during a press conference before the House vote that he would likely keep trying to pass a short-term funding bill ahead of the Oct. 1 deadline.</p>
<p>“You have watched me time and again — have you ever known me to quit after one time if it doesn’t succeed?” McCarthy said. “I don’t stop.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Senate working on stopgap</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The Senate <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-senate-moves-short-term-spending-bill-struggle-avoid-shutdown-days-away" target="_blank">released a broadly bipartisan stopgap spending bill</a> earlier this week and has since taken two procedural votes to advance the measure.</p>
<p>But that chamber’s rules don’t allow the Senate to vote on final passage before the Saturday midnight deadline without the consent of all 100 lawmakers.</p>
<p>Kentucky’s GOP Sen. Rand Paul has said he won’t allow a vote as long as the $6.1 billion in additional aid for Ukraine is in the legislation. But party leaders in the Senate aren’t seriously considering removing the Ukraine money.</p>
<p>And Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, the senior GOP senator from Kentucky, warned against forcing a government shutdown Thursday, saying it would be “an actively harmful proposition.”</p>
<p>“Instead of producing any meaningful policy outcomes, it would actually take the important progress being made on a number of key issues and drag it backward,” McConnell said.</p>
<p>Republican senators are trying to draft an amendment to the stopgap bill that would increase spending on border security and make policy changes, a move they hope would encourage House GOP leaders to put the bill on the floor.</p>
<p>Senate Minority Whip John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, said Friday that everything was still “up in the air,” but that he was “hopeful” senators would work out an agreement before the deadline.</p>
<p>“I still think there’s something that can get through here before the deadline tomorrow night,” Thune said. “What exactly it looks like, I think, is still not totally resolved.”</p>
<p>Indiana Republican Sen. Mike Braun said following a closed-door meeting Friday afternoon that “nothing’s really coming together” because there are “too many moving parts at this stage.”</p>

<p>It wasn’t clear if there would be enough GOP support for the bipartisan Senate CR to move past a procedural hurdle Saturday that requires at least 60 votes, Braun said.</p>
<p>“It looks like probably what’s going to have to happen is something with clarity is going to have to come out of the House,” Braun said. “And I don’t know what that would be, because there was a vote that just didn’t work.”</p>
<p>The stalemate, he said, is at the “worst point” since he’s been a senator.</p>
<p>Alabama Republican Sen. Katie Britt said senators want to make sure whatever they vote on is “compatible” with their House Republican colleagues.</p>
<p>“So we’ll see what they come up with in the morning. In the meantime, we’re going to continue to work on these measures,” Britt said. “We want to be prepared.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Veterans health, WIC, SNAP, parks</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Among agencies, the Department of Veterans Affairs would be largely exempt from the impacts since the VA is funded in advance, a rare exception to how Congress typically handles federal funding for so-called discretionary programs, which make up about one-third of annual federal spending.</p>
<p>The VA says that about 15,620 of its 450,000 employees would be furloughed during a shutdown and several of its programs would be put on hold, including the education call center or GI Bill hotline, career outreach and permanent headstone installations at veterans’ cemeteries.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/government-shutdown-wont-affect-health-care-or-most-benefits-veterans-va-says" target="_blank">Veterans would continue receiving</a> health care as well as education and pension benefits.</p>
<p>Almost 7 million people within the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, also called WIC, <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/food-benefits-low-income-families-risk-government-shutdown" target="_blank">could lose access to the program</a> during a partial government shutdown.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="o0rTp58c4g"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/09/25/food-benefits-for-low-income-families-at-risk-in-a-government-shutdown-white-house-says/">Over 127K Virginians could lose WIC benefits in government shutdown, White House says</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Over 127K Virginians could lose WIC benefits in government shutdown, White House says&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/09/25/food-benefits-for-low-income-families-at-risk-in-a-government-shutdown-white-house-says/embed/#?secret=6JzGeXXKYb#?secret=o0rTp58c4g" data-secret="o0rTp58c4g" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p>U.S. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said Monday that the “vast majority of WIC participants would see an immediate reduction and elimination of those benefits, which means the nutrition assistance that’s provided would not be available.”</p>
<p>Vilsack, a former Iowa governor, said that the USDA has a contingency fund for WIC, but that it would only last a day or two.</p>
<p>He added that another nutrition program, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly known as food stamps, has enough funding to last the month of October in the event of a government shutdown. There are about 40 million low-income people who rely on SNAP.</p>
<p>“Now, if the shutdown were to extend longer than that, there would be some serious consequences to SNAP,” Vilsack also said on Monday.</p>
<p>Vilsack added that amid a partial government shutdown, it will be <a href="https://wisconsinexaminer.com/2023/09/27/the-farm-bill-is-on-the-verge-of-expiring-congress-is-months-away-from-a-new-version/" target="_blank">nearly impossible for Congress to pass a new farm bill.</a> Every five years, lawmakers must write a sweeping farm bill to set policy and funding levels for farm, food, nutrition and conservation programs.</p>
<p>This year’s farm bill is set to expire Sept. 30, but lawmakers typically finish it by the end of the year. The 2018 farm bill was signed into law in December of that year.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/nearly-all-national-park-sites-close-during-government-shutdown" target="_blank">National Park officials would need to close off access</a> to most of the country’s 425 parks, recreation areas and national historic sites during a shutdown.</p>

<p>The IRS would continue processing certain payments, maintaining its computer networks and printing and designing tax forms for the upcoming year. However, some taxpayer services will <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/266/IRS-FY24LapsePlan.pdf" target="_blank">cease</a> during the non-filing season. Call sites that respond to taxpayer questions will be closed during a funding lapse.</p>
<p>Several sources of federal aid to states will also be affected, Tim Storey, the CEO of the National Conference of State Legislatures, said in a written statement Friday.</p>
<p>“A shutdown creates uncertainty for states and impedes access to vital federal programs,” Storey said. “While states may not feel the immediate effects, critical state services that receive federal funding such as (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families), disaster relief efforts, cybersecurity and child nutrition may be put in jeopardy if Congress does not come to an agreement quickly.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Road projects on track</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Most federal funding for highways and transit, including the daily reimbursements to state departments of transportation and transit agencies, will continue without interruption.</p>
<p>Those programs are funded through the Highway Trust Fund, not annual appropriations. The trust fund was reauthorized in the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law. The law also provided five years of advanced appropriations for highway and transit spending, meaning that the workers at the U.S. Department of Transportation who process those payments can remain at work with pay through a partial shutdown.</p>
<p>That means federal money for construction of roads, bridges and transit would continue to flow to state coffers.</p>
<p>“If it’s a highway or mass transit project everybody should be at work and fully funded and able to do all of the things on Oct. 2 that they were able to do on Sept. 29,” Jeff Davis, a senior fellow at the national transportation think tank Eno Center for Transportation, said on a Friday webinar.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Air turbulence ahead</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Air travel, meanwhile, could see disruptions.</p>
<p>Air traffic controllers, considered essential to protect life and safety, would be required to work without pay.</p>
<p>Federal employees were <a href="https://www.gsa.gov/system/files/2023_GSA_Payroll_Calendar-R1pdf.pdf" target="_blank">scheduled</a> to receive a regular paycheck Friday, before a potential partial shutdown. The first paycheck they miss would be Oct. 13, if the partial shutdown is still ongoing then.</p>
<p>If a funding lapse persists that long, the air traffic controllers could begin work slowdowns, leading to air travel delays and cancellations.</p>
<p>Air traffic controllers are forbidden by law from striking, but the last partial shutdown saw several <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/06/politics/ten-air-traffic-controllers-shutdown/index.html" target="_blank">call in sick</a> rather than work without pay.</p>
<figure id="attachment_35428" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Reagan_natl-scaled.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-35428" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Reagan_natl-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1707" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Reagan_natl-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Reagan_natl-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Reagan_natl-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Reagan_natl-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Reagan_natl-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Reagan_natl-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Reagan National Airport. (Skyhobo / Getty Images)</p></figure>
<p>“Imagine the pressure that a controller is already under every time they take their position at work,” Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said at a Sept. 27 news conference. “And then imagine the added stress of coming to that job from a household with a family that can no longer count on that paycheck.”</p>
<p>In addition to hurting morale in the short-term, a shutdown would ruin training programs for air traffic controllers, Buttigieg said.</p>
<p>“We would immediately have to stop training new air traffic controllers and furlough another 1,000 controllers who are already in the training pipeline,” he said. “The complexity of the hiring and training process means even a shutdown lasting a few days could mean we will not hit our staffing and hiring targets next year.”</p>
<p>Other employees that would be required to work during the partial government shutdown include those in the Transportation Security Administration under the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.</p>
<p>Of the nearly 61,000 TSA employees, the agency expects nearly 58,000 to continue security checks across the nation’s airports.</p>
<p>In addition to funding lapses for most federal programs, the authorization for the Federal Aviation Administration expires at midnight Saturday, meaning that the trust funds that operate outside the normal appropriations process could not fund operations as they do for highways.</p>
<p>Even a short-term funding bill without an FAA extension is in practice the same as not having a short-term bill, Davis said.</p>
<p>“The budget authority is not available because the underlying trust fund from which it’s drawn doesn’t exist at the moment,” he said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Parks to shutter</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Almost all National Park Service sites that they are physically able to block access to <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/nearly-all-national-park-sites-close-during-government-shutdown" target="_blank">would close</a>.</p>
<p>“At NPS sites across the country, gates will be locked, visitor centers will be closed, and thousands of park rangers will be furloughed,” the Interior Department, which oversees the NPS, <a href="https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/government-shutdown-will-close-americas-national-parks-impede-visitor-access" target="_blank">said Friday</a>.</p>
<p>States and nonprofit groups can work with the federal government to fund park operations. The governors of Arizona and Utah have said they will seek such agreements this year. But even those sites may see a disruption in access as agreements are finalized and funding is secured.</p>
<p>Mount Rushmore National Monument in South Dakota, for example, was closed for the first three days of the 16-day shutdown in 2013. After a blizzard, the park reopened for the last three days of the shutdown with the help of nonprofit donations and an agreement with South Dakota’s state government, Cheryl Schreier, the former Mount Rushmore superintendent, said in a Friday interview.</p>
<p>Park sites stayed open with a minimal workforce during the 2018-2019 shutdown. U.S. Senate Energy and Natural Resources ranking Republican John Barrasso of Wyoming called for the Interior Department to do the same this year and criticized the decision to close parks.</p>
<p>“The Biden administration has the ability to keep our nation’s parks open and accessible,” he said in a statement. “Instead, they’re deliberately trying to make a government shutdown as painful as possible for American families and visitors alike.”</p>
<figure id="attachment_34277" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG_8209-scaled.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-34277" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG_8209-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1707" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG_8209-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG_8209-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG_8209-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG_8209-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG_8209-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG_8209-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Hikers in Shenandoah National Park. (Sarah Vogelsong / Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p>But the Government Accountability Office said the decision to keep parks open during the shutdown <a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/b-330776.pdf" target="_blank">was illegal</a>. And park advocates have said remaining open without enough workers created problems.</p>
<p>Visitors to Mount Rushmore during the 2018-2019 shutdown “were very confused,” Schreier said. Trash and even human waste piled up as visitors couldn’t find open bathrooms.</p>
<p>Law enforcement officials, not visitor services employees, comprised most of the workforce.</p>
<p>“It makes it difficult when you don’t have, obviously, the adequate staff,” Schreier said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Historic, cultural sites to close</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Public tours of the U.S. Capitol will cease, as the Congressional Visitor Center would close down during a funding lapse. This includes tours of the complex’s storied dome.</p>
<p>U.S. Capitol Police will continue to report to work to secure the complex, but they will do so without pay.</p>
<p>“I’ve sent my membership updates to prepare for a shutdown if it happens, which it looks like it will,” said Gus Papathanasiou, chairman of the USCP Labor Committee. “I’m hoping a shutdown doesn’t happen because with the cost of living higher than ever, this shutdown will create an enormous hardship.”</p>
<p>Workers with the Architect of the Capitol, the office charged with maintaining the Capitol buildings and grounds, will continue to work in a limited capacity without pay.</p>
<p>USCP officers and Capitol maintenance staff will receive back pay upon the end of a shutdown.</p>
<p>The Smithsonian museums and the National Zoo will remain open until at least Oct. 7, even if a partial government shutdown is triggered this weekend, according to the institution’s contingency <a href="https://www.si.edu/sites/default/files/about/smithsonian-federal-lapse-plan.pdf" target="_blank">plan</a> released Thursday.</p>
<p>The institution, which employs nearly 4,000 across its several locations, will continue to use fund balances from prior years until they are exhausted.</p>
<p>Just over 1,100 Smithsonian workers will remain on the job during the shutdown to care for animals, continue lab experiments, maintain library archives and secure the facilities.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Student loan repayments</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Federal student loan repayment officially begins Oct. 1, and regardless of a shutdown, those payments are still due.</p>
<p>“Even if extreme House Republicans needlessly shut down the government, loan payments will continue to be due starting this month,” a spokesperson from the Department of Education said in a statement to States Newsroom.</p>
<p>The Biden administration did <a href="https://newhampshirebulletin.com/2023/08/28/heres-what-to-know-about-new-federal-policies-for-repaying-student-loans/" target="_blank">launch a one-year on-ramp program </a>where borrowers with federal student loans won’t be faulted for not repaying their loans. However, interest will still accrue.</p>
<p>Education Secretary Miguel Cardona, in a <a href="https://www2.ed.gov/about/shutdown/contingency-plan-2021.pdf" target="_blank">contingency plan</a>, said the department would furlough 90% of its staff. There are about 4,000 full-time and part-time employees.</p>
<p>Programs that would still run because they are mandatory include Pell Grants and Federal Direct Student Loans.</p>
<p>Some programs that would lapse include the development and awarding of grants. The Office for Civil Rights would pause its reviews and investigations and guidance and regulatory actions.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON — As Congress barrels toward a partial government shutdown, the White House Monday warned that a program that helps millions of low-income families afford healthy food could see substantial cuts.</p>
<p>The White House released a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/09/25/extreme-house-republicans-chaos-is-marching-america-toward-a-shutdown-that-would-jeopardize-vital-nutrition-assistance-for-nearly-7-million-vulnerable-moms-and-young-children/" target="_blank">state-by-state breakdown</a>, estimating that nearly 7 million people who rely on the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, also known as WIC, could be at risk of losing funds to purchase select food and receive vouchers for vegetables and fruit.</p>
<p>The program provides financial support for those who are low income and pregnant or nursing, as well as for children up to 5 years old.</p>
<p>U.S. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said during a Monday White House briefing that WIC recipients could feel the impact of the shutdown within days.</p>
<p>“Millions of those moms, (babies) and young children would see a lack of nutrition assistance,” he said.</p>
<p><iframe id="datawrapper-chart-xWXMu" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" title="WIC recipients affected by a government shutdown" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/xWXMu/1/" height="695" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" aria-label="Table" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();</script></p>
<p>Vilsack, Iowa’s former governor, said some states have leftover WIC benefits and “could extend (WIC) for a week or so.”</p>
<p>“The vast majority of WIC participants would see an immediate reduction and elimination of those benefits, which means the nutrition assistance that’s provided would not be available,” he said.</p>
<p>In Virginia, over 127,000 WIC recipients including more than 72,000 children and 28,000 infants could lose their benefits.</p>
<p>Additionally, new eligible participants could face a backlog.</p>
<p>“Without the urgent investment of additional funds, state WIC offices could soon be forced to consider waiting lists for prospective participants — a drastic step not seen in nearly 30 years,” Kate Franken, board chair of the National WIC Association, which is the non-profit advocacy arm of WIC, said in a statement.</p>
<p>The impending shutdown comes after President Joe Biden <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/05/31/u-s-house-approves-debt-limit-package-sending-it-to-senate-with-just-days-until-default-deadline/" target="_blank">made a deal</a> with Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy earlier this year to raise the debt ceiling. <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/05/31/debt-limit-deal-hits-turbulence-in-congress-as-leaders-prep-for-vote/" target="_blank">That deal </a>set maximum spending levels for the next fiscal year.</p>
<p>However, only one of the 12 appropriations bills has been passed by the House, and a handful of far-right Republicans are <a href="https://idahocapitalsun.com/2023/09/21/shutdown-inches-closer-as-u-s-house-gop-fails-to-pass-defense-bill-lawmakers-exit-d-c/" target="_blank">pushing for steeper cuts</a>, even if it means a partial government shutdown.</p>
<p>“House Republicans have turned their backs on the bipartisan budget deal that a large majority of them voted for just a few months ago and proposed a continuing resolution (CR) that makes devastating cuts to programs that millions of hardworking Americans count on,” the White House said in a press release.</p>
<p>A continuing resolution, or CR, is regularly used to keep the government funded for weeks or a couple of months while the House and Senate finish work on the 12 annual spending bills.</p>
<p>Without a CR by Saturday, the end of the fiscal year, a partial shutdown will occur and programs that have discretionary funding, like WIC, will lapse.</p>
<p>Funding for WIC is not mandatory spending, meaning the program won’t be automatically funded regardless of a government shutdown. It’s funded through the Agriculture appropriations bill, which has not been passed by Congress.</p>
<p>The White House criticized the Agriculture appropriations bill the House passed out of its committee that did not include the supplemental funding the Biden administration requested.</p>
<p>“Without the Administration’s funding request, states could soon be forced to institute waiting lists for WIC, causing mothers and children to lose access to the vital nutrition assistance,” the White House said.</p>
<p>WIC funding is distributed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food and Nutrition Service to states through a formula. The share of eligible people who participate in WIC can vary between states — <a href="https://www.fns.usda.gov/wic/eligibility-and-program-reach-estimates-2020" target="_blank">for example</a> California, Massachusetts, and Minnesota, have a coverage rate for WIC by over 60%.</p>

<p>With the pause of more than three years on federal student loan repayments coming to an end in October and the Supreme Court’s summer decision to strike down the White House’s one-time debt relief program, the Department of Education has rolled out several repayment and loan forgiveness programs. One of those initiatives is the Saving on A Valuable Education, or SAVE, plan that for some borrowers could result in no monthly payments.</p>
<p>“Our top priority is to support borrowers as they prepare to return to repayment with the tools and resources that they need,” Jason Miller, deputy director for management at the Office of Management and Budget, said on a call with reporters Tuesday.</p>
<p><a href="https://washingtonstatestandard.com/2023/08/22/heres-what-to-know-about-new-federal-policies-for-repaying-student-loans/" target="_blank">The new income-driven repayment plan</a> calculates payments based on a borrower’s income and family size and forgives balances after a set number of years. The Department of Education has estimated that most borrowers will save about $1,000 per year under the new plan.</p>
<p>Borrowers who are currently in the Revised Pay as You Earn plan will automatically be enrolled in the SAVE program.</p>
<p>Democrats, such as U.S. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York, are expecting legal challenges.</p>
<p>“While there will be those that will challenge this in court, the administration has carefully crossed the legal t’s and dotted the legal i’s,” Schumer said in a statement following the opening of <a href="https://studentaid.gov/idr/" target="_blank">applications</a> for the SAVE program on Aug. 22.</p>
<p>So far, the states with the highest number of borrowers enrolled in the program are Texas, with 345,800, California with 331,600, Florida with 291,100, New York with 212,800 and Pennsylvania with 170,200. Virginia has 104,800 borrowers enrolled.</p>
<p>James Kvaal, the undersecretary of education, said no borrowers will owe payments if they make $15 an hour while supporting a family, and that borrowers will not see their balances grow due to unpaid interest “as long as they keep up with their payments.”</p>
<p>“We’re not just lowering payments for today’s borrowers, we’re helping entire families and communities, and we’re making paying for college more affordable for millions of future students,” Kvaal said.</p>
<p>Borrowers who have defaulted on their student loans at any point will be able to enroll in the SAVE program through the <a href="https://studentaid.gov/announcements-events/default-fresh-start" target="_blank">Fresh Start program</a>, which is a one-time program for those who have defaulted on federal student loan repayment.</p>
<p>Even though the pause on federal student loans is set to end in October, borrowers will still have a year of leniency to begin repayments, but interest will accrue starting this month. The program starts Oct. 1 and will extend until Sept. 30 of next year.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON — Following the U.S. Supreme Court’s summer ruling against 40 million federal student loan borrowers who would have qualified for debt relief, the Biden administration crafted a year-long delay in repayments.</p>
<p>The policy, known as an on-ramp, is set to begin next month.</p>
<p>Additionally, hours after the Supreme Court’s decision, the Department of Education unveiled a new repayment plan for those with federal student loans, known as Saving on a Valuable Education, or SAVE.  The new income-driven repayment plan calculates payments based on a borrower’s income and family size and forgives balances after a set number of years.</p>
<p>The administration estimates more than 20 million borrowers will benefit. Borrowers can apply <a href="https://studentaid.gov/announcements-events/save-plan" target="_blank">here</a>. The Department of Education, in collaboration with groups like the Student Debt Crisis Center, UnidosUS and the NAACP, is launching a campaign to publicize the new program.</p>
<p>“This plan is a game changer for millions of Americans, many of whom are putting off having children, buying their first home, or even starting a business because they can’t get out from under their student loans,” said White House Domestic Policy Advisor Neera Tanden on a call with reporters on Monday. “Student loans will be manageable.”</p>
<p>Last year, the Biden administration rolled out a debt forgiveness plan for borrowers with federal student loans that would have been a one-time cancellation of up to $10,000. Borrowers who had received Pell Grants — federal aid to help low-income students pay for higher education — could qualify for an additional $10,000 in forgiveness.</p>
<p><a href="https://newhampshirebulletin.com/2023/06/30/us-supreme-court-rules-against-biden-administration-student-loan-debt-relief-plan/" target="_blank">The conservative bloc of the Supreme Court on June 30 </a>ruled that the Biden administration did not have the legal authority to enact that one-time student debt relief program. The case was filed by Republican attorneys general of Nebraska, Missouri, Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas and South Carolina who argued the Biden administration overstepped its reach.</p>
<p>Following that decision from the court, the Biden administration initiated rulemaking through the Higher Education Act to try again to enact debt relief and finalized a rule for the new repayment plan known as SAVE.</p>
<p>Here are some questions and answers about the on-ramp policy and SAVE plan.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">When does the on-ramp program start?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Federal student loan repayments are set to resume in October, but while borrowers have a year of leniency to begin repayments, interest will continue to accrue starting in September. The on-ramp program starts Oct. 1 and will extend until Sept. 30 of next year.</p>
<p>“Financially vulnerable borrowers who miss monthly payments during this period are not considered delinquent, reported to credit bureaus, placed in default, or referred to debt collection agencies,” according to a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/06/30/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-new-actions-to-provide-debt-relief-and-support-for-student-loan-borrowers/" target="_blank">fact sheet</a> released by the White House.</p>
<p>The Department of Education did not respond to questions from States Newsroom asking how the agency would prevent loan servicers from reporting borrowers to credit bureau or debt collectors.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">How is the on-ramp policy different from the pause on federal student loan repayments?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The pause on federal student loan repayments was first put in place by the Trump administration in 2020 at the start of the coronavirus pandemic and has been extended several times.</p>
<p>The pause meant those with federal student loans did not have to repay, and no interest accrued. With this new policy, interest will still accrue, but borrowers have a year before having to start paying back their loans.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What does a final rule for the SAVE plan mean?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www2.ed.gov/policy/highered/reg/hearulemaking/2021/idrfactsheetfinal.pdf" target="_blank">This is an income-driven repayment plan</a> that the Department of Education said will cut borrowers’ monthly payments in half. The <a href="https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/biden-harris-administration-launches-most-affordable-repayment-plan-ever-transforming-income-driven-repayment-cutting-undergraduate-payments-half-and-preventing-unpaid-interest-accumulation?utm_content=&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_name=&amp;utm_source=govdelivery&amp;utm_term=" target="_blank">official launch </a>of the application was Tuesday.</p>
<p>“This is a giant step forward in decreasing the burden of crushing debt that rests on so many borrowers’ shoulders,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement. “Low-income students, whose burdens will be cut in half, and most other students, who will never pay more than 5% of their income, will breathe a sigh of relief across every corner of America.</p>
<p>“While there will be those that will challenge this in court, the administration has carefully crossed the legal t’s and dotted the legal i’s. The fight to cancel student debt is far from over, but this is a massive step in the right direction. President Biden deserves accolades and support for this action.”</p>
<p>A borrower could save more than $1,000 per year on payments compared to other income-driven repayment plans. And, depending on income levels, it will allow more than 1 million additional borrowers to make $0 monthly payments without their interest accruing, the Department of Education estimates.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">How does the SAVE plan work?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Borrowers with undergraduate loans will pay 5% of their discretionary income, rather than the 10% required under previous income repayment plans. Borrowers with undergraduate and graduate loans will pay a weighted average between 5% and 10% of their incomes.</p>
<p>The White House said a borrower’s monthly payment will be based on their discretionary income, defined in the plan as the difference between their adjusted gross income and 225% of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services poverty guideline amount for the family size. Borrowers who earn a minimum wage of $15 an hour will not have to make a monthly payment.</p>
<p>According to the Department of Education, that means borrowers will not owe loan payments if they are a single person earning $32,800 or less or a family of four earning $67,500 or less, though the amounts are higher in Alaska and Hawaii.</p>
<p>The plan also forgives loan balances after as little as 10 years of payment, rather than 20 years under previous income repayment plans. The plan also does not charge borrowers with unpaid monthly interest as long as those borrowers are making their monthly payments.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Who qualifies for the SAVE student loan repayment plan?</h4>

	 </strong></p>
<p>Most federal student loan borrowers are going to qualify for this plan. However, those with Direct PLUS loans to parents and certain other loans will not qualify for it; the list can be found <a href="https://studentaid.gov/announcements-events/save-plan" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>Borrowers signed up for the current Revised Pay as You Earn (REPAYE) plan will automatically be enrolled in SAVE.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">How is SAVE different from previous federal student loan repayment plans?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>With this plan, if your calculated payment ends up to be less than the amount of interest that accrues every month, that remaining interest will be forgiven. The previous plan did not have that element, so borrowers were continuing to see their balances grow.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON —  Two years ago, Farzana Jamalzada and her husband made the difficult decision to separately flee Afghanistan, after U.S. troops withdrew from the country and the Taliban took over.</p>
<p>It took days for the couple to be reunited at an airport in Qatar, where Jamalzada would show people a picture of her husband on her phone, asking them if they had seen him.</p>
<p>Once reunited, they were settled in the U.S. through the Biden administration’s humanitarian parole program for Afghans that extended protections for two years, allowing them to work and live in the U.S. Because Jamalzada worked for the U.S. government in Afghanistan, she was able to apply for a Special Immigrant Visa, which is available to those who were translators, interpreters or professionals employed by or on behalf of the U.S. government in Afghanistan or Iraq.</p>
<p>“It has been two years and every day we are in an uncertain situation,” she said in an interview with States Newsroom. “It is very frustrating.”</p>
<p>Legislation in Congress known as the Afghan Adjustment Act would allow Afghan refugees to apply for permanent legal residency after undergoing additional vetting, but it’s failed to advance. Without congressional action on a pathway to citizenship, most of the more than 76,000 Afghan refugees who came to the U.S. after the Taliban takeover are stuck in legal limbo.</p>
<p>The humanitarian program under which they arrived in the U.S., known as Operation Allies Welcome, does not provide a pathway to citizenship. But Afghans enrolled can apply for asylum, and those who qualify can apply for a Special Immigrant Visa. Claims for asylum and the Special Immigrant Visa have a major backlog.</p>
<p>“For most Afghans, they’re in this kind of limbo status and waiting to see,” said Julia Gelatt, the associate director of the Migration Policy Institute’s U.S. immigration policy program.</p>
<p>Jamalzada and her husband, now settled in New York City, have a hearing for their green cards scheduled for Sept. 12, but their work authorization expires at the end of August. The two-week gap means neither will be legally allowed to work in the U.S., risking termination from their jobs.</p>
<p>“You don’t have peace of mind,” she said. “Being away from your country, your family, you’re alone in a very strange world, and yet you don’t have that support,” she said, referring to permanent protections in the U.S.</p>
<p>Jamalzada, now 27, said she prays that either her and her husband’s work visas are reauthorized or that Congress passes the Afghan Adjustment Act.</p>
<p>For 20 years, the U.S. government relied on Afghans to help the government and military <a href="https://www.cfr.org/timeline/us-war-afghanistan" target="_blank">following the 2001 invasion</a>. Afghans worked as interpreters and helped run aid programs. Jamalzada worked on women’s empowerment projects with the United States Agency for International Development and at the Afghan presidential palace.</p>
<p>“Keep your promise and support the people who stood on your side and helped you,” she said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Parole set to expire</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Operation Allies Welcome evacuated and paroled 76,200 Afghans from August 2021 to September 2022.  <a href="https://www.wrapsnet.org/documents/FY%202023%20Reception%20&amp;%20Placement%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf" target="_blank">A majority settled in areas</a> with large military bases such as Texas, California, Maryland, Virginia, Washington and New York.</p>
<p>But two years after the fall of Kabul, only a fraction — fewer than 10%  — in the humanitarian parole program have secured permanent protections, through either asylum or the Special Immigrant Visa, said Krish O’Mara Vignarajah, the president of the Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service. Her organization has helped settle more than 14,000 Afghans in the U.S.</p>
<p>“One of the biggest issues, I think, that remains uncertain is whether they will be allowed to remain permanently, and that relates to the Afghan Adjustment Act,” she said.</p>
<p>While those who worked for the U.S. government can apply for the Special Immigrant Visa program, many Afghans had to flee the country without the proper documentation needed to show their employment history.</p>

<p>“Part of that was because if they had the documentation on them, and were caught by the Taliban, that could be a death sentence,” O’Mara Vignarajah said.</p>
<p>O’Mara Vignarajah added that other Afghans applied for refugee status in other countries through Operation Allies Welcome and are waiting to be resettled in the U.S.</p>
<p>“The grim reality is that they’re likely waiting for years,” she said.</p>
<p>Laila Ayub, an immigration attorney and co-director of Project Afghan Network for Advocacy and Resources, said many Afghans have had no choice but to try to find a way into the U.S., even while they are waiting for their parole to be accepted by Operation Allies Welcome.</p>
<p>“We increasingly have been assisting people who have made a very long and difficult journey to the Southern border,” she said.</p>
<p>U.S. border agents apprehended more than 2,100 Afghans last year.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Grassley blocks resettlement plan</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The closest Congress came to providing a quick pathway to citizenship for Afghans was last year, through the Afghan Adjustment Act, when Democrats controlled the House and Senate. However, those efforts were blocked by Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, and the bipartisan proposal was not included in an omnibus spending bill.</p>
<p>Grassley objected to the security and vetting processes for those Afghans.</p>
<p>He, along with several Senate Republicans, now are backing another bill by GOP Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, known as the Ensuring American Security and Protecting Afghan Allies Act.</p>

<p>That <a href="https://www.grassley.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/ensuring_american_security_and_protect_afghan_allies_act.pdf" target="_blank">bill</a> would apply to those Afghans who were evacuated and who are ineligible for an immigration status that leads to a green card for citizenship. Those evacuees would be eligible for a four-year conditional resident status, to allow for vetting, and, upon successful completion, would become green card holders.</p>
<p>“The Biden Administration’s disastrous departure from Afghanistan caused a chaotic migration from the region, and our government repeatedly failed to thoroughly evaluate evacuees arriving in the United States,” Grassley said in a statement. “This bill restores order to the system by ensuring Afghan evacuees are able to assimilate while preserving American security and better supporting those who provided direct support to the United States military.”</p>
<p>However, the bill would limit the president’s authority to establish humanitarian parole programs, which the Biden administration has used as part of its immigration policy. It’s designated parole programs for nationals of Ukraine, Nicaragua, Haiti, Cuba and Venezuela.</p>
<p>The Cotton bill “is definitely throwing a wrench” in gaining support for the Afghan Adjustment Act, said Jennie Murray, president and CEO of the National Immigration Forum.</p>
<p>“We have used (humanitarian parole) several times in U.S. history across party lines, different presidents have used it, and it’s an important tool that we have to be able to use at a moment like World War II or the Cuban missile crisis,” she said. “It’s something that presidents have to be able to use, and so we’re very worried about that competitive legislation.”</p>
<p>Murray helped out evacuation efforts for Afghans when she worked for Upwardly Global, where she worked to put together a workforce plan for those Afghans arriving in the U.S.</p>
<p>She said a potential last shot at getting permanent protections for Afghans is through the National Defense Authorization Act, an annual must-pass defense policy measure.</p>
<p>“They cannot go back to Afghanistan,” she said. “They cannot go back to the Taliban-led state because they partnered with us.”</p>
<p>The NDAA does not currently include any provisions for a pathway to citizenship for those Afghans, but Murray notes that the measure is still in conference between the House and the Senate.</p>
<p>When the House passed its version of the NDAA, a bipartisan group of lawmakers reintroduced the Afghan Adjustment Act in the Senate and in the House.</p>
<p>Democratic U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota sponsored the bill in the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/2327?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22afghan+adjustment+act%22%5D%7D&amp;s=1&amp;r=2" target="_blank">Senate</a> and Republican Rep.

<p>WASHINGTON — The Department of Justice and Department of Education <a href="https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/ocr-questionsandanswers-tvi-20230814.pdf?utm_content=&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_name=&amp;utm_source=govdelivery&amp;utm_term=" target="_blank">jointly released guidance </a>on Monday to colleges and universities about how to consider race in admissions decisions, following the <a href="https://tennesseelookout.com/2023/06/29/us-supreme-court-strikes-down-use-of-affirmative-action-in-college-admissions/" target="_blank">Supreme Court’s summer decision</a> that struck down affirmative action in higher education.</p>
<p>Education Secretary Miguel Cardona, on a call with reporters, said higher education institutions can continue to participate in targeted outreach programs in underserved communities as a way to recruit students from a diverse background.</p>
<p>“Remember, nothing in the court’s decision denied the value of diversity in education,” he said.</p>
<p>Cardona said in the coming weeks, the agency will issue a report that outlines comprehensive strategies for colleges and universities to “lawfully cultivate diverse applicant pools and achieve (a) diverse student body.”</p>
<p>“These resources provide some clarity about the admissions practices for achieving racial diversity that remain lawful,” Cardona said.</p>
<p>On June 29, in a 6-3 decision, the conservative bloc of the Supreme Court ruled that the admissions processes at Harvard University and <a href="https://ncnewsline.com/2023/06/29/unc-leaders-faculty-and-political-leaders-react-to-u-s-supreme-court-decision-on-admissions/" target="_blank">the University of North Carolina</a> violated the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment because those institutions considered race in acceptances.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/letters/colleague-20230814.pdf?utm_content=&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_name=&amp;utm_source=govdelivery&amp;utm_term=" target="_blank">guidance</a> acknowledges that following the Supreme Court’s decision,  higher institutions may have to redouble “efforts to recruit and retain talented students from underserved communities, including those with large numbers of students of color.” Some of those efforts might also include a “greater focus on fostering a sense of belonging for students currently enrolled,” according to the guidance.</p>
<p>Colleges and universities can also partner with school districts in underserved communities by “supporting improved access to high quality advanced courses, and investing time and resources into programs that identify and nurture students’ potential.” By doing so, “colleges and universities can ensure that more students will be prepared to apply to colleges and universities, gain admission, succeed, and graduate,” the department said.</p>
<p>Associate Attorney General of the United States Vanita Gupta said on the call with reporters that the Supreme Court’s decision “should not be used as an excuse to turn away from long-standing efforts to make those institutions more inclusive.”</p>
<p>“On the top line issue of considering race and admissions, colleges and universities can and should continue to ensure that their doors are open to those students of all backgrounds, including students of color, who possess the characteristics necessary to succeed and contribute on college campuses and in the world,” Gupta said.</p>
<p>The guidance clarifies that the court’s decision does not prevent higher education institutions from reviewing data on race and ethnicity, but that “institutions should ensure that the racial demographics of the applicant pool do not influence admissions decisions.”</p>
<p>The top Democrat on the U.S. House Education and Workforce Committee, Rep. Bobby Scott of Virginia, said in a statement that Monday’s guidance “can serve as a resource to help colleges and universities understand the Court’s decision as they commit to pursue diverse campuses.”</p>
<p>He added that the Department of Education should also investigate “how race unjustly permeates many other policies and practices in our educational system.”</p>
<p>“This is important because race-conscious admissions policies were able to provide a counterbalance to factors — such as inequitable K-12 schools, racially biased admissions tests, and developmental and legacy admissions — that have discriminatory impact against students of color,” he said.</p>

<p>Torres Small said the investments will help “deliver real-life, applicable solutions to make our food system stronger, while at the same time inspiring a next generation of students and scientists who will help us meet tomorrow’s agricultural challenges.”</p>
<p>1890 Land-Grant Institutions are a byproduct of a Civil War-era law that gave land to dozens of universities, including the HBCUs, but <a href="https://www.hfa.ucsb.edu/news-entries/2021/1/27/the-truth-behind-land-grab-universities#:~:text=The%20Truth%20Behind%20Land%2DGrant%20Universities&amp;text=A%20seemingly%20harmless%20Civil%20War,at%20the%20University%20of%20Cambridge." target="_blank">the land had been forcibly taken from Indigenous tribes.</a> In total, nearly 11 million acres were taken from more than 250 tribes, <a href="https://www.landgrabu.org" target="_blank">according to a project</a> published in High Country News.</p>
<p>“USDA looks forward to the impact these visionary projects will have in improving the supply of affordable, safe, nutritious and accessible food and agricultural products, while fostering economic development and rural prosperity in America,” NIFA Director Manjit K. Misra said in a statement.</p>
<p>Many of the projects are geared toward sustainable practices in farming. U.S. agriculture contributes to about <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/natural-resources-environment/climate-change/#:~:text=However%2C%20the%20emissions%20profile%20for,carbon%20dioxide%20(EPA%202022)." target="_blank">11.2% of greenhouse gas emissions</a>, and the Biden administration has focused on “climate smart” farming practices.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="https://cris.nifa.usda.gov/cgi-bin/starfinder/0?path=fastlink1.txt&amp;id=anon&amp;pass=&amp;search=R=99118&amp;format=WEBFMT6NT" target="_blank">one project</a> at North Carolina A&amp;T State University was awarded about $250,000 to conduct farm trials of biodegradable mulches, which would be an alternative to plastic mulch.</p>

<p>And in Nashville, <a href="https://cris.nifa.usda.gov/cgi-bin/starfinder/0?path=fastlink1.txt&amp;id=anon&amp;pass=&amp;search=R=99221&amp;format=WEBFMT6NT" target="_blank">a project </a>at Tennessee State University was awarded $100,000 to evaluate climate resiliency in legume species, which are crops such as snow peas, chickpeas and lentils, that are crucial to fixing nitrogen into the soil to improve soil health.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/biden-harris-administration-provide-804000-borrowers-39-billion-automatic-loan-forgiveness-result-fixes-income-driven-repayment-plans" target="_blank">The $39 billion in debt relief</a> will come through fixes to mismanagement of the agency’s income-driven repayment plans. Many long-time borrowers, including those who had been making payments for 20 years or more, were denied relief they were eligible for under the repayment plans. Qualified payments that were made were not accounted for.</p>
<p>“For far too long, borrowers fell through the cracks of a broken system that failed to keep accurate track of their progress towards forgiveness,” U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona said in a statement.</p>
<p>Starting Friday, the Department of Education will begin to notify those 804,000 borrowers of their forgiveness, and within 30 days their debts will be wiped out.</p>
<p>The plan includes borrowers with Direct Loans or Federal Family Education Loans held by the department (including Parent PLUS loans of either type) who have reached a forgiveness threshold specified by the department.</p>
<p>“By fixing past administrative failures, we are ensuring everyone gets the forgiveness they deserve, just as we have done for public servants, students who were cheated by their colleges, and borrowers with permanent disabilities, including veterans,” Cardona said.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/04/01/1089750113/student-loan-debt-investigation" target="_blank">A 2022 NPR investigation</a> found numerous problems with the agency’s handling of IDR plans, which are meant to help low-income borrowers. Loan servicers failed to keep track of borrowers’ progress toward forgiveness and payment histories were not properly transferred from one loan servicer to another.</p>
<p>Under IDR, after 20 years of payments, a borrower’s loan plan should be forgiven. But <a href="https://www.nclc.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/IB_IDR.pdf" target="_blank">a 2021 report </a>from the National Consumer Law Center found that more than 4 million borrowers had been making payments for at least 20 years, but only 32 had their debts canceled under the plan.</p>
<p>Because of this issue, the<a href="https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/department-education-announces-actions-fix-longstanding-failures-student-loan-programs" target="_blank"> Department of Education announced in 2022</a> that it would conduct an adjustment and fix past inaccuracies.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/new-federal-student-loan-repayment-plan-aimed-low-income-borrowers" target="_blank">The Department of Education in early January announced</a> its plans to overhaul the income-driven repayment plan.</p>
<p>Under the new plan, monthly payments would decline to 5% of a borrower’s income — down from 10% — and the repayment timeline for loan forgiveness would be decreased to 10 years from 20 or 25 if the initial loan is less than $12,000.</p>
<p>The announcement Friday followed the Supreme Court’s decision in late June <a href="https://missouriindependent.com/2023/06/30/u-s-supreme-court-rules-against-biden-administration-student-loan-debt-relief-plan/" target="_blank">to strike down the Biden administration’s student debt relief program</a> that would have canceled up to $20,000 in student loan debt for some borrowers.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/with-student-loan-forgiveness-halted-white-house-says-685k-virginia-borrowers-eligible-for-relief/" target="_blank">https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/with-student-loan-forgiveness-halted-white-house-says-685k-virginia-borrowers-eligible-for-relief/</a></p>
<p>The Department of Education is now going through a rulemaking process to cancel that student loan debt under the Higher Education Act, an action likely to face the same legal challenges as the initial debt relief program.</p>
<p>Under the Biden administration, the Department of Education has canceled about $116 billion in student loan debt for borrowers who were misled by for-profit institutions, borrowers with disabilities and those with loans through Public Service Loan Forgiveness.</p>
<p>​​<a href="https://educationdata.org/how-many-people-have-student-loans" target="_blank">More than 43 million </a>Americans have student loan debt, and the Federal Reserve <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/SLOAS" target="_blank">estimates</a> that the total U.S. student loan debt is more than $1.76 trillion.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON — Top lawmakers on the U.S. House Education and Workforce Committee Tuesday unveiled a bipartisan health care legislative package that would require accurate billing practices by hospitals, price transparency and hidden fee disclosures.</p>
<p>Education and Workforce Committee Chair Virginia Foxx said the four bipartisan bills will help increase transparency for patients.</p>
<p>“The Committee is rectifying these issues by marking up four bipartisan bills designed to increase transparency, promote accurate billing practices, and expand health care options for workers and their families,” the North Carolina Republican said in a statement. “By putting forth legislative measures that codify transparent practices, we are delivering lower costs and more options to the American people.”</p>
<p>The bill, <a href="https://www.congress.gov/118/bills/hr4509/BILLS-118hr4509ih.pdf" target="_blank">H.R. 4509</a>, is known as the Transparency in Billing Act, and is backed by Foxx with the top Democrat on the committee, Rep. Bobby Scott of Virginia. It would “require group health plans and health insurance issuers offering group health insurance coverage to only pay claims submitted by hospitals that have in place policies and procedures to ensure accurate billing practices, and for other purposes.”</p>
<p>“Transparency in health care is essential for fostering meaningful competition, which keeps costs in check for both consumers and employers,” Scott said in a statement.</p>
<p>If signed into law, that bill would go into effect in January of next year.</p>
<p>Another bill in the package,<a href="https://www.congress.gov/118/bills/hr4507/BILLS-118hr4507ih.pdf" target="_blank"> H.R. 4507</a>, written by Republican Rep. Bob Good of Virginia and Democratic Rep. Mark DeSaulnier of California, would “promote transparency in health coverage and reform pharmacy benefit management services with respect to group health plans.”</p>
<p>Good and DeSaulnier are the top lawmakers on the Health, Employment, Labor, and Pensions Subcommittee.</p>
<p>The price transparency for a group health plan and a health insurance issuer offering group health insurance would include disclosures of claims payment policies and practices, periodic financial disclosure, information on cost-sharing and payments with respect to any out-of-network coverage, and data on enrollment, disenrollment, rating practices and the number of ​​claims that are denied, among other requirements.</p>
<p>The third bill was introduced by Republican Rep. Lori Chavez-DeRemer of Oregon and Democratic Reps. Mark Takano of California and Kathy Manning of North Carolina.</p>
<p>That bill, <a href="https://edworkforce.house.gov/uploadedfiles/health_data_act_text.pdf" target="_blank">the Health DATA Act</a>, would ensure that fiduciaries “are not contractually restricted from receiving cost or quality of care information about their plan.”</p>
<p>A fiduciary is someone who runs a health insurance plan based solely in the interest of participants and beneficiaries.</p>
<p>The fourth bill,<a href="https://www.congress.gov/118/bills/hr4508/BILLS-118hr4508ih.pdf" target="_blank"> H.R. 4508</a>, introduced by Democratic Rep. Joe Courtney of Connecticut and Republican Rep. Erin Houchin of Indiana, aims to strengthen compensation disclosure requirements for pharmacy benefit managers and third party administrators to fiduciaries.</p>
<p>The committee will mark up all four bills on <a href="https://edworkforce.house.gov/calendar/eventsingle.aspx?EventID=409371" target="_blank">Wednesday at 10:15 a.m.</a> Eastern.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON — Congress began moving the bipartisan debt limit package forward Tuesday, though frustrations with provisions in the bill could make for narrow passage in the U.S. House and U.S. Senate.</p>
<p>Conservative Republicans and progressive Democrats both aired their disappointment with the agreement <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/biden-mccarthy-say-they-have-brokered-debt-limit-deal-avert-us-default" target="_blank">forged over the weekend</a>, but only GOP lawmakers are looking to possibly remove Kevin McCarthy as speaker because of the deal.</p>
<p>U.S. House Freedom Caucus Chair Scott Perry said Tuesday that conservative Republicans will do whatever they can to block the legislation, arguing the agreement “totally fails to deliver” on conservative priorities.</p>
<p>Perry, a Pennsylvania Republican, declined to directly answer questions about whether the group of about a dozen conservative lawmakers at the press conference would use the so-called motion to vacate to remove McCarthy as speaker.</p>
<p>“I am focused on defeating this bill,” Perry said. “What happens post that … we will decide once we’ve determined the disposition of this bill.”</p>
<p>Texas GOP Rep. Chip Roy said there will be a “reckoning” if the debt limit package moves forward following a floor vote, and North Carolina Rep. Dan Bishop indicated he may move for the floor vote to oust McCarthy as speaker.</p>
<p>The House is expected to vote on Wednesday around 8:30 p.m. Eastern to send the legislation to the Senate, where lawmakers need to approve the measure before Monday. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/treasury-secretary-pinpoints-june-5-earliest-date-us-debt-default" target="_blank">warned last week</a> that if the debt limit is not addressed before that date, the country would begin a default.</p>
<p>The House Rules Committee took up the bill Tuesday afternoon, a requirement for all major legislation heading to the floor. The House must vote Wednesday to approve the rule before it can move on to formally debate and vote on the bill.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Concern among progressives</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Democrats will be key to moving the bill through the Republican-controlled House, even if some of their members are not entirely happy with the outcome.</p>
<p>Congressional Progressive Caucus Chair Pramila Jayapal said Tuesday the group was undergoing its whip count and determining whether to take an official position on the package.</p>
<p>Jayapal, a Washington Democrat, said the Republican Party “did not win any major concessions on spending” in the agreement but said the legislation does include some provisions she is “seriously concerned about.”</p>
<p>Jayapal said she is in talks with the White House about how exactly the handshake agreements that aren’t included in bill text would work, especially the promise that some of the funds being clawed back will be redirected to domestic spending in the annual appropriations bills.</p>
<p>She also expressed concerns about the changes to work requirements for two federal safety net programs — Temporary Assistance for Needy Families and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program — and for energy permitting.</p>
<p>“That is a significant problem,” Jayapal said. “I’ve said before that the United States is the only industrialized country that puts these kinds of bureaucratic red tape requirements on people who are just trying to get food for their families.”</p>
<p>Office of Management and Budget Director Shalanda Young, who had a heavy hand in negotiations, said during a White House press briefing Tuesday the deal “represents a compromise, which means no one gets everything that they want, and hard choices had to be made.”</p>
<p>Young said the agreement with House Republican leaders protects key legislative priorities of the Biden administration, such as the climate provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act.</p>
<p>Here’s a look at what’s in the <a href="https://docs.house.gov/billsthisweek/20230529/BILLS-118hrPIH-fiscalresponsibility.pdf" target="_blank">99-page bill</a>:</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Debt limit</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The bill would suspend the nation’s debt limit through Jan. 1, 2025, meaning whoever wins the 2024 presidential election will likely negotiate the next agreement with that Congress.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Federal government spending levels</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The agreement would cap discretionary spending at $886.35 billion for defense and $703.65 billion for nondefense during fiscal 2024, set to begin Oct. 1. That’s about a 3% increase for defense and roughly flat funding for nondefense.</p>
<p>Spending levels for the following fiscal year, 2025, would be set at $895.21 billion for defense and $710.69 billion for nondefense. That would represent about a 1% boost for nondefense accounts.</p>
<p>Discretionary spending accounts for about one-third of federal spending, while mandatory spending on programs like Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security make up the other two-thirds.</p>
<p>Nondefense accounts fund the vast majority of federal departments and agencies, including Agriculture, Homeland Security and Veterans Affairs, while defense funding goes predominantly to the Pentagon.</p>
<p>Some of the spending on nondefense programs would be paid for by moving around, or repurposing, unspent COVID-19 funding and part of the $80 billion Democrats approved last year for the Internal Revenue Service.</p>
<p>In order to actually achieve those spending levels, the House, Senate and Biden administration must reach agreement on all dozen of the annual appropriations bills in the months ahead.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Tax code</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The deal doesn’t include any changes to the tax code, something President Joe Biden pushed for but McCarthy rejected.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Work requirements</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The legislation doesn’t alter Medicaid eligibility, but it does make changes to the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Changes to all three were pushed for by Republicans.</p>
<p>TANF recipients could experience some changes to the program on Oct. 1, 2024, while others would go into place a year later on Oct. 1, 2025.</p>
<p>The program now requires states to have 50% of TANF recipients working, though states can lower that threshold based on how much their caseload has fallen since 2005, according to a White House official.</p>
<p>This legislation would set that year to 2015, give states two years to implement the changes and “allow states to do things like spending additional TANF dollars and in exchange being able to get a lower work participation rate because of that,” according to the White House official.</p>
<p>SNAP’s current work requirements for many able-bodied adults extend from age 18 through 49. This bill text says it would raise the ceiling to age 51 during the current fiscal year, to age 53 during the fiscal year slated to begin Oct. 1 and to 55 during fiscal 2025.</p>
<p>Veterans, homeless individuals and people 24 or younger who were in the foster care system when they turned 18 wouldn’t be subject to SNAP’s time limits, according to the White House.</p>
<p>The changes to SNAP would sunset on Oct. 1, 2030.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Energy permitting</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Members of both political parties <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/overhaul-federal-permitting-part-debt-limit-deal-not-easy-it-sounds" target="_blank">have expressed interest </a>in overhauling how the federal government permits energy projects under the National Environmental Policy Act, known as NEPA.</p>
<p>NEPA requires federal agencies to consider the environmental effects of major federal actions, and the process can take years. Democrats have sought to speed construction for renewable energy projects, and Republicans have complained for years that the burdens of federal permitting restrict development.</p>
<p>The bill amends NEPA by limiting requirements on some projects and requires environmental reviews to be completed in a one- to two-year time frame.</p>
<p>Separately, the White House agreed to streamline permits for the more than <a href="https://www.mountainvalleypipeline.info/overview/" target="_blank">$6 billion Mountain Valley Pipeline</a>, a decision that has angered environmentalists and climate-conscious Democrats.</p>
<p>West Virginia Sens. Joe Manchin III, a centrist Democrat, and Shelley Moore Capito, a Republican, have lobbied for the approval of the outstanding permits for the more than 300 miles of Mountain Valley Pipeline, also known as MVP, that would deliver gas from West Virginia into Virginia.</p>
<p>As part of the deal, the White House agreed to expedite permits for the long-disputed Appalachian natural gas pipeline, which has been halted due to court cases brought by environmentalists who have fought for years to prevent its construction.</p>
<p>Permits for the Mountain Valley Pipeline will be issued within 21 days after the debt ceiling bill is signed into law, according to the bill text. It also bars any judicial review of permits issued for the pipeline project by any government agency.</p>
<p>“I am pleased Speaker McCarthy and his leadership team see the tremendous value in completing the MVP to increase domestic energy production and drive down costs across America and especially in West Virginia,” Manchin, the chair of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources panel, said in a statement. “I am proud to have fought for this critical project and to have secured the bipartisan support necessary to get it across the finish line.”</p>
<p>The MVP has had more than 500 violations in state environmental laws, regulations and permit conditions, <a href="https://appvoices.org/resources/reports/MVP_Report_2023_AppalachianVoices.pdf" target="_blank">according to a report</a> by the environmental group Appalachian Voices.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">COVID-19 funds</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The agreement rescinds, or claws back, about $28 billion in some of the unspent federal funding that was approved during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Federal student loan repayment pause</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The bill would codify the end of the pause on federal student loan repayments by August and bar the administration from reinstating a pause on repayments unless approved by Congress.</p>
<p>The Biden administration<a href="https://kansasreflector.com/2022/11/27/student-loan-repayment-pause-extended-by-white-house-amid-legal-battles-over-relief-plan/" target="_blank"> announced last year</a> its plans to resume requiring repayments on student loans either after the Supreme Court’s decision on the administration’s student debt cancellation policy or 60 days after June 30.</p>
<p>A pause on student loan repayments was first enacted in 2020 by the Trump administration due to the coronavirus pandemic, and was later extended by the Biden administration.</p>
<p>The Biden administration’s one-time student debt cancellation has been a target for Republicans. <a href="https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2023/05/24/biden-student-debt-relief-plan-revoked-in-u-s-house-vote/" target="_blank">Last week</a>, the House voted to overturn the policy that would cancel up to $20,000 in federal student loan debt for borrowers who qualify. The Senate is expected to vote on the resolution of disapproval this week; if passed, it would block the policy. The White House has vowed to veto it.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Internal Revenue Service funding</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The agreement would allow Congress to pull $10 billion during fiscal 2024 and another $10 billion during fiscal 2025 from the IRS to pay for other domestic spending initiatives, according to the White House.</p>
<p>The money would come from the $80 billion boost to the IRS that Democrats approved last August as part of their signature climate change, health care and tax package known as the Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA.</p>
<p>The $20 billion clawback provision is not in the bill text, which only includes a $1.39 billion rescission to that IRS funding.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WASHINGTON — A U.S. default on its debt would have a significantly broader impact on federal operations, financial markets and the global economy than recent government shutdowns that have left ordinary Americans largely untouched.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the two have been confused frequently during debate over the debt limit, the federal government has had considerable practice with partial government shutdowns during the past decade — unlike a default on the debt, which would be uncharted territory. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has warned default could come as soon as June 1 without an agreement between Congress and President Joe Biden.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Government shutdowns don’t hit payments for Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid, since Congress places those programs in the mandatory category that’s exempt from the annual government funding process and therefore predominantly exempt from funding lapses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A default would potentially reduce payments that keep millions of households afloat, as well as payments to states and providers for health care for elderly and low-income Americans. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Government shutdowns don’t affect the financial markets that much anymore, meaning Americans’ retirement accounts typically don’t start shrinking the longer a lapse in government operations extends. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Economists expect that would be much different in an unprecedented debt default. </span></p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Virginia has a lot at stake if the debt ceiling isn’t resolved&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/05/15/virginia-has-a-lot-at-stake-if-the-debt-ceiling-isnt-resolved/embed/#?secret=FdDUhyURJc#?secret=LAjhLrqfRD" data-secret="LAjhLrqfRD" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">William Galston, Ezra K. Zilkha chair and senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution, said partial government shutdowns and a default on the debt are “almost like mirror images of each other.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In the first case, there’s money available but no plan to authorize and appropriate expenditures of that money. That’s when the government shuts down,” explained Galston, who served as a top domestic official in the Clinton administration. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When you reach the debt limit, the government has already enacted programs — some of which are permanent programs, like Social Security and Medicare — but it no longer has the money to pay for them, because it can’t borrow what it needs to fill the gap between what it’s taking in and what it would have to put out,” he added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That even includes the military. The Pentagon is bracing for a series of “severe” and unknown consequences for troops and national security should lawmakers fail to address the debt ceiling, officials told States Newsroom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Because there is no precedent for a default, it is difficult to know the precise impacts on specific federal programs. But what’s clear is that, without the ability for the federal government to borrow funds, there is a very real potential that any government program or payment would be halted or severely delayed,” a Pentagon spokesperson said in an emailed statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Here are more of the specific ways a default could roll across America:</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Social Security</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the U.S. government defaults, payments to the estimated </span><a href="https://www.ssa.gov/news/press/factsheets/basicfact-alt.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">67 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> people who are relying on Social Security this year could be delayed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social Security is the </span><a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF11615" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">largest</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> government program in terms of how many Americans are affected by it, including retired workers and dependents, people with disabilities and surviving dependents of deceased workers who count on Social Security payments as a major source of income. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A temporary disruption in payments to those who depend on Social Security income to pay their own bills could result in “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">impacts that would ripple through the economy at-large,” </span><a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/default-would-have-a-catastrophic-impact-on-the-economy/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wrote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Jean Ross, a senior fellow for economic policy at the liberal-leaning Center for American Progress.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the end of 2022, roughly 48.6 million retired workers along with 2.7 million of their dependents relied on Social Security checks that averaged $1,825 a month, according to the Social Security Agency. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. </span><a href="https://www.ssa.gov/oact/STATS/table4a3.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">spent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> $1.2 trillion on Social Security benefits in 2022.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The short story here is that U.S. taxpayers owe people money because of legislation enacted in the past. We can talk about what kinds of recent legislation have pushed up federal borrowing means, but in fact some of this legislation was passed 90 years ago,” said Wendy Edelberg,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> director of The Hamilton Project and a senior fellow in economic studies at the liberal-leaning Brookings Institution, on a call Thursday with a group of economists.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We owe interest to those who have lent to the U.S. by purchasing Treasury securities. We owe (money to) doctors and hospitals who have treated Medicare and Medicaid patients, and millions of people are entitled to benefits,” said Edelberg.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Social Security Administration referred all questions about a possible default to the U.S. Treasury. Treasury did not respond to an inquiry for more information.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Veterans benefits</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Veterans Administration Press Secretary Terrence Hayes said he does not have a “blueprint for what happens to the VA” if lawmakers do not strike a deal in the coming days. The Treasury Department will soon exhaust all special accounting maneuvers it has been using since January when the U.S. hit its $31.4 trillion debt ceiling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Because there is no precedent for a default, it is difficult to know the precise impacts on specific federal programs. But what is clear is that, without the ability for the federal government to borrow funds, there is a very real potential that any government program or payment would be halted or severely delayed,” Hayes said in an emailed statement to States Newsroom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Treasury makes payments totaling $25 billion on behalf of the VA each month, according to the agency.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There are 4 million disabled veterans whose payments are scheduled for June 1, and those payments are now uncertain,” said Edelberg, citing recent estimates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A more detailed list of those payments, according to the VA’s figures, include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$12 billion per month in benefits payments to more than 7.1 million veterans and their families</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$4.8 billion per month in pay to more than 451,000 VA employees</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$2.6 billion per month to community providers caring for roughly 900,000 veterans per month</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$1.8 billion per month to medical and other contractors, on over 114,000 contracts</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$835 million per month in pharmacy costs, for roughly 57,000 monthly payments</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$3 billion per month for other costs, including to small and veteran-owned businesses</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hayes also said there is a risk that the VA’s vendors could decide “to reduce or completely cease providing goods and services to VA if payment was uncertain.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As President Biden has made clear, a default would be catastrophic for the American people and for our nation’s veterans,” he said.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Medicare and Medicaid</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Government payments to physicians, skilled nursing homes, hospitals and insurance companies could lag behind if lawmakers do not raise the U.S. borrowing limit so that the government can pay its bills on time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of September 2022, more than </span><a href="https://www.cms.gov/pillar/expand-access" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">65 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Americans were enrolled in Medicare, the federal program that pays for health care for Americans age 65 and up and certain younger people with disabilities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Medicare plans are categorized into four options — parts A, B, C and D — that range from inpatient hospital stay coverage to prescription drug benefits and various medical services in between. As of 2022, 49 million Americans relied on Medicare Part D for prescription drug coverage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Private practices, hospitals, and community health centers, many of which run on tight budgets and rely on timely payments for providing services, would be in the unprecedented situation of being unsure of whether they will be paid for providing care to patients covered by Medicaid and Medicare,” said Antoinette Kraus, spokesperson for the advocacy group Pennsylvania Health Access Network. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A default would create tremendous uncertainty for doctors and patients alike. Patients who are receiving treatment for a serious health condition or who require regular care for a disability or chronic condition could find themselves unable to get the care they need,” Kraus said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Low-income individuals, including children, disabled or pregnant persons and seniors, can receive health care coverage under Medicaid, a joint federal-state program that provides medical and long-term care.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of the more than 93 million Americans enrolled in some form of Medicaid, 46.2% were children, according to January </span><a href="https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/program-information/medicaid-and-chip-enrollment-data/report-highlights/index.html#:~:text=93%2C008%2C246%20individuals%20were%20enrolled%20in,individuals%20were%20enrolled%20in%20CHIP." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> released by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is very likely that federal Medicaid payments to states would, along with many other obligations of the federal government, be delayed,” said Kate McEvoy, head of the National Association of Medicaid Directors. “Default is a very different scenario from an impasse in settling the federal budget, in which case payments for Medicaid and other entitlements continue to be made.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most nursing home residents </span><a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF10343" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rely</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Medicaid and Medicare to cover their care, meaning a potential default is especially alarming to the industry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With the long term care industry already experiencing a historic workforce crisis and recovering from the pandemic, any disruption of lifeline reimbursements will result in devastating consequences for our nation’s most vulnerable individuals who need access to care. However, we remain optimistic that policymakers will come to a solution,” said a spokesperson for the American Health Care Association and National Center for Assisted Living, which identifies itself as the largest association in the U.S. representing long-term care facilities.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Federal employees</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During a partial government shutdown, exempt federal employees report to work without pay, while non-exempt federal workers are sent home without pay — a situation Congress remedies once they reach a funding agreement. The exempt employees keep the government functioning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">American Federation of Government Employees Public Policy Director Jacqueline Simon said a default on the debt that lasts long enough for federal employees to miss a paycheck would be a vastly different experience than what they’ve dealt with during past shutdowns. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The union, which represents 750,000 workers within the federal government and the District of Columbia’s local government, hasn’t sent any guidance to its members about what to do if they don’t get paid during a default. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is an unprecedented situation and operations will be in uncharted waters,” Simon said. “And there’s no way to make guidance based on law.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Public safety employees, Simon said, have worked without pay during past partial government shutdowns with a promise they’d get paid eventually when a bipartisan agreement was struck — something she expects they would do after a debt default is resolved. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In previous shutdowns, public safety employees have been called into work, expected to show up to work with the promise that they’d get paid eventually when the appropriations bills pass,” Simon said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I assume there’d be a similar kind of situation where you don’t even need appropriations bills to pass, you just need the default to end,” she said, later adding that because the United States has never defaulted, “nobody really knows.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Substance use prevention and recovery, mental health</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. is facing a staggering drug overdose epidemic, and many states and local governments rely on </span><a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R46426" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">federal grants</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for prevention and treatment efforts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drug overdose rates in the U.S. have risen fivefold in the past two decades, according to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db457.htm#:~:text=Drug%20overdose%20deaths%20have%20risen,increased%20from%2017.1%20to%2019.6." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> published in December. In 2021 </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the CDC </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/nchs_press_releases/2022/202205.htm" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tracked</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a record 107,622 overdose deaths — of which 71,238 were due to manmade, illegal fentanyl substances, an issue in the crosshairs of both Democrats and Republicans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Illicit fentanyl ending up in other drugs — for example, counterfeit prescription pills, cocaine and heroin — has been the target of </span><a href="https://www.dea.gov/onepill" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">federal agencies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the subject of multiple congressional hearings and </span><a href="https://idahocapitalsun.com/2023/01/26/u-s-house-gop-takes-aim-at-fake-pills-containing-deadly-fentanyl-sold-on-social-media/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">roundtables</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, or SAMHSA, administers two major grant programs: one for substance abuse prevention and treatment services, the other for mental health services. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The agency, housed under the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, </span><a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R46426" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">devoted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 65% of its $5.89 billion program budget in 2020 to treatment programs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facilities that receive federal dollars could be in limbo if the government defaults.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s a little hard to tell. I don’t know if the publicly funded facilities would stop accepting patients or if they would assume that it’s going to be paid at a later date. And, you know, it’s just so unclear and up in the air because this is such an unusual situation,” said Mark Dunn, director of public policy for the National Association of Addiction Treatment Providers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SAMHSA did not respond to requests for comment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin </span><a href="https://www.appropriations.senate.gov/hearings/review-of-the-presidents-fiscal-year-2024-budget-request-for-the-department-of-defense" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">told</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Senate appropriators on May 11 that a potential default brings uncertainty for the over </span><a href="https://demographics.militaryonesource.mil/chapter-1-total-military-force" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">3.4 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> military personnel and the U.S. military’s global presence and commitments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There is substantial risk to our reputation,” Austin testified. “Again, we are viewed as being a source of stability globally. And we always pay our debts, and there’s just a number of things that we’re working with allies and partners on and that would come into question as to whether or not we’ll be able to execute programs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But most importantly, this will affect the livelihood of our troops and our civilians. We won’t be able to pay people like we should and, and I think that’s something that China and everybody else can exploit,” he continued.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">USDA food assistance</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One in four Americans, from infants to seniors, participate in one of the 15 food and nutrition assistance programs offered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of those programs offer monthly assistance, such as the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, referred to as WIC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the government defaults, monthly payments to more than </span><a href="https://fns-prod.azureedge.us/sites/default/files/resource-files/34SNAPmonthly-5.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">42.5 million Americans on </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">SNAP, and monthly payments to the more than 6 million families on WIC, could be delayed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The recent bill that House Republicans barely </span><a href="https://wisconsinexaminer.com/2023/04/26/u-s-house-gop-pushes-through-debt-ceiling-increase-coupled-with-massive-spending-cuts/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">passed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that would </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">temporarily raise the U.S. borrowing limit also tightened access to food and assistance for low-income Americans by </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">expediting the effective dates for safety net work requirements — from 2025 to 2024 for SNAP.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SNAP already has </span><a href="https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/work-requirements" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">two sets of work requirements.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another program that could be affected if there are delays in payments is the Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations, where each month USDA sends packed foods to about </span><a href="https://fns-prod.azureedge.us/sites/default/files/resource-files/fdpir-program-fact-sheet-2020-for%20website.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">84,000 individuals on Native American reservations.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A USDA spokesperson said in an email that the exact impact of certain federal programs can depend on uncertain factors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But what’s clear is that, without the ability for the federal government to borrow funds, there is a very real potential that any government program or payment would be halted or severely delayed,” the spokesperson said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">S</span><a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/chart-gallery/gallery/chart-detail/?chartId=104891#:~:text=The%20USDA%27s%20National%20School%20Lunch,schools%20and%20residential%20childcare%20institutions." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">chool lunches</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which USDA provides for more than 30 million children each day, could also be affected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other child nutrition programs that could get wrapped up in payment delays include the National School Lunch Program, School Breakfast Program, Child and Adult Care Food Program, Summer Food Service Program and the Special Milk Program.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lisa Davis, the senior vice president of the No Kid Hungry campaign at Share Our Strength, said in an email that a default would have a devastating impact on families and individuals who rely on food assistance programs such as SNAP. Share Our Strength is a national organization that aims to end child hunger and poverty in the U.S.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Not only is SNAP being used as a bargaining chip in these negotiations, but the people who benefit from this critical program will be some of the individuals hit hardest if a government default becomes reality,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Farmers could also run into problems if there are delays to any USDA payments, ranging from crop insurance payouts to new loans for expanding farming operations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">USDA </span><a href="https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2023/05/01/usda-providing-130-million-assistance-help-farmers-facing-financial" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in early May an additional $130 million in </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">automatic financial assistance for qualifying farm loan program borrowers who are facing financial risk. Those who qualify will receive automatic payments from the Farm Service Agency, but those funds could be delayed if the country were to default on its debt.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Homeland security</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the U.S. government were to default, it would mean the U.S. Department of Homeland Security would have to delay payments to various private contractors such as those that run </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Immigration and Customs Enforcement </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">detention facilities, and even delays in grants to nonprofits that provide aid and transportation to migrants seeking asylum.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It would also mean that the more than </span><a href="https://www.tsa.gov/news/press/factsheets/tsa-glance" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">50,000 </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transportation Security Administration</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> employee</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">s across more than 440 airports could have their paychecks delayed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to States Newsroom’s request for comment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Court proceedings before immigration judges would also be delayed. There is already a more than </span><a href="https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/us-immigration-backlogs-mounting-undermine-biden" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1.6 million backlog of cases</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Department of Justice, which handles immigration court proceedings, did not respond to States Newsroom’s request for comment.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Highways and transit</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Highway Trust Fund, which sends money from federal gas and diesel taxes to states for road and transit maintenance and construction, could also see a rare disruption in outlays.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On paper, the trust fund has a healthy balance — it was </span><a href="https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/highwaytrustfund/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$94.2 billion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the beginning of April.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But if Treasury doesn’t have the money to actually spend, that could mean payments from the trust fund would be delayed, said Jeff Davis, a transportation spending expert and senior fellow at the Eno Center for Transportation, a nonpartisan think tank.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After making debt service payments, there’s no clear indication what already-obligated spending would take priority, putting highway and transit funds on par with scores of other programs, Davis said, cautioning that his analysis was provisional because it was not backed by precedent or Treasury Department guidance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think they’re going to have to wait in line with everybody else,” Davis said of Highway Trust Fund payments if the debt limit is hit. “Just because there’s theoretically that much money in the trust fund doesn’t make a difference if there’s actually no dollars in the Treasury.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Conservation</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conservation advocates won a huge legislative victory in 2020 when Congress passed the Great American Outdoors Act that provided $900 million annually for the Land and Water Conservation Fund and removed the fund from the annual appropriations process by classifying it as mandatory spending.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prior to 2020, the fund, which is filled by fees on offshore oil and gas development and used to protect national parks and forests, wildlife refuges, coasts and other natural areas and provides matching grants for state and local recreation projects, was subject to periodic fights over its funding levels and — at times — its continued existence. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proponents considered the 2020 law approving the fund in perpetuity a once-in-a-generation victory. Montana Republican U.S. Sen. Steve Daines, a leading proponent of the measure, thanked then-President Donald Trump “for signing the most important piece of conservation legislation in over 50 years.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But a default could reintroduce the uncertainty proponents thought they’d erased with the 2020 law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A default would be an economic disaster across the board — even in ways we don’t know yet,” U.S. House Natural Resources ranking member Raúl Grijalva, an Arizona Democrat, said in a written statement. “The Treasury would likely have to make tough calls about extraordinary measures to redirect mandatory funds to pay our debt, so even widely beloved programs like the Land and Water Conservation Fund could be at-risk.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A spokeswoman for the U.S. Interior Department, which manages the fund, declined to comment on what would happen in a potential default.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We can’t speculate on unforeseen circumstances,” the spokeswoman, Melissa Schwartz, wrote in an email.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similarly, Daines spokeswoman Rachel Dumke declined to entertain the possibility of default.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Senator Daines does not see a default on the national debt as an option and he is calling on President Biden to make a deal with Speaker McCarthy as soon as possible to avoid a crisis,” she wrote in an email.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Housing assistance</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development said in an email that “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">without the ability for the federal government to borrow funds, there is a very real potential that any government program or payment would be halted or severely delayed.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">HUD handles rental assistance, housing vouchers, claims of unfair housing practices, obtaining affordable loans and public housing, among other things.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Some of HUD’s key agency programs and initiatives, which play a vital role for Americans across the country, could be halted or severely delayed … which would impact our nation’s most vulnerable communities,” the spokesperson said.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/hud_no_23_045" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the agency announced more than 2,400 grants totaling $5.6 billion in funding for 1,200 communities across the U.S. for community development, homeless assistance and affordable housing. Payments to those programs could be delayed if the government defaults.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WASHINGTON — U.S. House Republicans on Friday passed a bill </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">designed to empower parents to inspect books and other teaching materials in local public schools, but Democrats sharply criticized the measure, saying it would censor teachers and ban books.</span></p>
<p>The legislation, called the<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/5?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22HR5%22%5D%7D&amp;s=1&amp;r=1" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Parents Bill of Rights,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> passed on </span><a href="https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2023161?Page=2" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a 213-208 vote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It would codify federal education law to give parents and legal guardians access to school curricula, library books and other teaching materials, give parents advance notice prior to medical or mental health screenings, and mandate a standard number of parent-teacher meetings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has vowed the bill will not be taken up in that Democratic-controlled chamber, the parental bill of rights represents a top priority for Republicans in the states and in Congress.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sending a child to public school does not terminate parental rights at the door,” Rep. Erin Houchin, R-Ind., said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill, sponsored by Rep. Julia Letlow, R-La., comes after a wave of </span><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/whats-next-expanded-dont-say-gay-bill-and-restrictions-preferred-pronouns-kids" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recently passed state laws</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that </span><a href="https://lailluminator.com/2023/02/08/u-s-house-gop-preps-for-debates-on-parents-rights-school-vouchers-and-transgender-athletes/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">center</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on restricting classroom discussion or lessons dealing with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">sexual orientation, gender identity and race. While Florida passed a “Don’t Say Gay” bill that has drawn national attention, bills with similar aims failed to clear Virginia&#8217;s General Assembly during the last session. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Letlow said the bill is about “one simple and fundamental principle,” which is to make sure that parents “always have a seat at the table when it comes to their child’s education.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You have a right to get the basic information about your children&#8217;s education. &#8230; The Parents Bill of Rights is an important step towards protecting children and dramatically strengthening the rights of parents,” House Speaker Kevin McCarthy said on the House floor.  </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">GOP opponents</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Five Republicans voted against the bill: Matt </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gaetz of Florida, Andy Biggs of Arizona, Ken Buck of Colorado, Matt Rosendale of Montana and Mike Lawler of New York. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ten Democrats did not vote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats argued many of the requirements in the measure are already in place at public schools. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, parents already have access to a school’s budget and are allowed to speak at public school board meetings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This bill does not give parents any more rights than they already have,” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rep. Mary Gay </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scanlon</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, D-Penn., said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The top Democrat on the Education and Workforce Committee, Bobby Scott of Virginia, said the legislation is meant “to score political points and scare parents into thinking that schools do not have their best interests at heart.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schumer, the U.S. Senate leader, called the bill “Orwellian to the core” and said it “will not see the light of day here in the Senate.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Biden administration </span><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/SAP-H.R.-5-Parents-Bill-of-Rights-Act.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said in a statement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that it does not support the bill “in its current form because the bill does not actually help parents support their children at school.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Book bans</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of the debate was on whether the bill would lead to more bans on books, particularly books about the LGBTQ+ community and people of color. Thousands of books from LGBTQ+ authors and authors of color, or stories that feature LGBTQ+ and characters of color, </span><a href="https://www.penncapital-star.com/civil-rights-social-justice/lgbtq-community-people-of-color-in-the-crosshairs-of-banned-book-movement/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have been banned in schools.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/5" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">H.R. 5 </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> threatens to open the floodgates to book bans, more restrictions on what can be said in the classroom, and attempts to rewrite history and censor facts, all at the expense of our students,” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scanlon</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> said. “While it sounds benign, this bill will be used to eliminate classroom conversations about racism and the American story or portrayals of LGBTQ people in books.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans pushed back on that criticism. Education and Workforce Committee Chair Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., said that there is nothing in the bill that bans books.</span></p>

<p>But many Republicans used books about the LGBTQ+ community as examples of books that should not be allowed in schools.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Parents, is this something you want your children to read?” Rep. Ralph Norman, Republican of South Carolina, asked after he listed several books as an example, all ones that center LGBTQ+ stories such as “This Book Is Gay,” and “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Juliet Takes a Breath.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The top Democrat on the House Rules Committee, Rep. Jim McGovern of Massachusetts, said the bill is going to be “weaponized by far right groups,” which he argued is already happening with the banning of thousands of books across the country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s going to force teachers to decide between staying silent and teaching something that certain politicians in their state don&#8217;t like,” he said. “It&#8217;s already happening, for God&#8217;s sake.”</span></p>
<p><a href="https://missouriindependent.com/2023/03/09/gop-bill-mandating-federal-parents-bill-of-rights-passed-by-u-s-house-committee/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the markup of the bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in early March, which lasted more than 16 hours, Democrats on the House Education and Workforce Committee argued that the bill creates a burden of reporting requirements on schools, diverts resources and personnel away from families and “opens the door to dictate what students can and cannot read or learn.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the amendments on the House floor introduced by Rep. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andrew </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Garbarino</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, R-N.Y., stated that nothing in the bill “shall be construed as authorizing or granting parents the right or ability to deny any student who is not their child from accessing any books or other reading materials that are otherwise available in the library of their child’s school.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scott of Virginia said that Democrats agree with the amendment, but the nature of the amendment “exposes a problem with the underlying bill,” which he said </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">shows the bill bans books.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You should not be able to ban books for other children or other parents’ children,” Scott said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The amendment passed on a voice vote.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Transgender students</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., introduced two amendments to the bill specifically aimed at transgender students. One </span><a href="https://amendments-rules.house.gov/amendments/BOEBER_027_xml230322154921226.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">amendment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would require that parents be notified if a public school allows a transgender student to compete in an “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">athletic program or activity that is designated for women or girls.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Women’s sports are under attack,” she said, adding that she is a sponsor of </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/734?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22H.R.+734%2C%22%5D%7D&amp;s=1&amp;r=1" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">H.R. 734,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which bans transgender girls from competing in school sports consistent with their gender identity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That bill passed out of the House Education and Workforce Committee in </span><a href="https://minnesotareformer.com/2023/03/09/national-ban-on-transgender-athletes-in-girls-sports-passed-by-u-s-house-panel/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">early March</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and would amend Title IX to require student athletes to compete in sports in accordance with “a person’s reproductive biology and genetics at birth,” with the bill’s language specifically targeting transgender girls.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another </span><a href="https://amendments-rules.house.gov/amendments/BOEBER_028_xml230322155009878.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">amendment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Boebert would require parents to be notified if a public school allows a transgender student to use the bathroom that aligns with their gender. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scott pushed back and said Republicans should stop “disparaging trans youth.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t think we need a federal law to tell students which bathroom to use,” Scott said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both amendments were accepted by a voice vote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The amendments specifically tailored toward transgender students are part of a national campaign by Republican lawmakers and conservative groups in the states to restrict the rights of people in the LGBTQ community, particularly transgender youth.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What&#8217;s in the bill?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislation passed by the U.S. House would add language to the federal Education and Secondary Education Act of 1965, stating that parents or legal guardians who have children in publicly funded schools have the right to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Review curriculum</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Know if a state changes educational standards</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Review a school’s budget</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Review a list of books and materials in the school library</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Address the school board</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be informed about violent activity at the school</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be informed of any plans to eliminate “gifted or talented programs”</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meet with teachers twice a year</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill would also add language to the 1974 Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Require parental consent “for the use of technology in the classroom for purposes of educating the student”</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make available to parents for inspection all instructional materials, teacher’s manuals, books and films, among other items</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prohibit schools from using student information for marketing and other non-educational uses</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Require notice and consent from parents for any school medical examinations, which is defined as a screening that “involves the exposure of private body parts, or any act during such examination or screening that includes incision, insertion, or injection into the body, or a mental health or substance use disorder screening,” with the exceptions of hearing, vision or scoliosis screenings</span></li>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WASHINGTON — On the second anniversary of the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, President Joe Biden on Friday awarded citizen medals to 14 Americans who protected democracy and law enforcement officers who defended the Capitol.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Two years ago on Jan. 6 our democracy was attacked,” Biden said at the White House. “Our democracy held because ‘We the People’ did not flinch. ‘We the People’ endured. ‘We the People’ prevailed.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is Biden’s first time in his presidency awarding the Presidential Citizens Medal, which is the second-highest award an American citizen can receive, second to the Presidential Medal of Freedom. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden told the recipients that “history will remember your names, remember your courage, remember your bravery, remember your extraordinary commitments to your fellow Americans.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among recipients of the Presidential Citizens Medal were </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fulton County, Georgia, election workers Shaye Moss and Ruby Freeman, a mother and daughter who were targeted by </span><a href="https://georgiarecorder.com/2022/06/21/trump-led-pressure-campaign-on-state-election-officials-jan-6-panel-says/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump administration officials and falsely accused </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">of voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ruby and Shaye, you don&#8217;t deserve what happened to you,” Biden said. “But you do deserve the nation&#8217;s eternal thanks for showing that dignity and grace of ‘We the People.’” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other recipients included:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.azmirror.com/2023/01/04/rusty-bowers-detailed-trumps-pressure-campaign-in-private-j6-committee-testimony/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rusty Bowers,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the former speaker of the Arizona House who resisted pressures to overturn 2020 election results</span></li>

</ul>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Jan. 6 attack</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Jan. 6, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">hundreds of pro-Trump supporters stormed the Capitol in an attempt to prevent members of Congress from certifying the results of the 2020 presidential election. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump was impeached for a second time for his role in the insurrection, and a special investigative panel </span><a href="https://kansasreflector.com/2022/12/19/u-s-house-jan-6-panel-refers-trump-for-criminal-charges-including-inciting-insurrection/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">unanimously voted </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">to refer him and others to the Justice Department for potential criminal charges, including inciting or aiding an insurrection.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The special House panel investigating Jan. 6 also </span><a href="https://kansasreflector.com/2022/06/21/trump-led-pressure-campaign-on-state-election-officials-jan-6-panel-says/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">found that Trump was directly </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">involved in efforts to pressure state officials in Georgia, Arizona and elsewhere to overturn the 2020 election results in their states. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of those officials who were pressured were awarded the Presidential Citizens Medal at the White House.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s not an exaggeration to say America owes you … a debt of gratitude, one we can never fully repay unless we live up to what you did,” Biden said to the recipients.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The president also posthumously awarded medals to law enforcement officers who died following the insurrection. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those officers include the late Brian Sicknick, a Capitol Police officer </span><a href="https://www.uscp.gov/media-center/press-releases/medical-examiner-finds-uscp-officer-brian-sicknick-died-natural-causes" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">who was injured </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">while responding to the Jan. 6 attack and later died, and two officers who died by suicide</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Jeffrey Smith and Howard Liebengood.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Others receiving medals were:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harry Dunn, a Capitol Police officer who defended the Capitol during the insurrection and experienced racist slurs and harassment from the rioters </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Caroline Edwards, who was the first law enforcement officer who was injured by the rioters and continued to defend the Capitol after suffering a traumatic brain injury</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michael Fanone, who served as a Metropolitan Police Department officer and was injured as he defended the Capitol during the attack. He later resigned and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">has pushed for congressional Republicans to acknowledge their role in spreading the false narrative that the 2020 presidential election was stolen.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aquilino Gonell, who served as a Capitol Police sergeant and was injured during the attack </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eugene Goodman, the U.S. Capitol Police officer who is credited with diverting rioters from the Senate floor, allowing senators and staff to evacuate</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Daniel Hodges, a Metropolitan Police Department officer who was injured while defending the Capitol</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">House ceremony</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Separately, U.S. House Democratic leaders and members held a ceremony earlier in the day to remember the five law enforcement officers who died following the Jan. 6 insurrection. Following the attack, four law enforcement officers died by suicide.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The violent insurrectionists stormed the Capitol and attempted to halt the peaceful transfer of power,” House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries said. “They failed because of the bravery and valor of the United States Capitol Police and the Metropolitan Police Department officers who fought heroically to defend our democracy.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Family members of the officers read their loved one&#8217;s name, followed by a bell to signify their remembrance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those officers included Sicknick, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gunther Hashida, Kyle DeFreytag, Smith and Liebengood.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The children of U.S. Capitol Police Officer Billy Evans read their father’s name. Evans died in a second attack on the Capitol in April 2021 when a driver rammed his car into a barricade on the north complex of the Capitol, slamming into Evans and another officer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeffries later called for 140 seconds of silence to acknowledge the 140 law enforcement officers who were injured on Jan. 6.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former Democratic U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who was inside the Capitol during the insurrection, thanked the family members of the officers “for considering us worthy to share your grief” and “to honor your loss.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We will always carry the memory of their families in our hearts,” the California Democrat said. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://georgiarecorder.com/2023/01/05/d-c-nears-jan-6-anniversary-with-warnings-about-extremism-awards-for-courage/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A handful of House Democrats</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and dozens of veterans the day before the second Jan. 6 anniversary </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">held a press conference to call on the incoming House Republican leaders to condemn political violence and hold their members who supported the attack accountable for their actions.</span></p>

</p><div id="modal-ready">
<p>WASHINGTON — In a last-minute push, U.S. senators are working on a bipartisan agreement to create a pathway to citizenship for undocumented people who were brought to the United States as children.</p>
<p>But the success of any major immigration deal appears unlikely, as a lame-duck session of Congress dwindles into its last days. Democrats are set to lose control of the House come January, making the prospect of an agreement next year much more difficult.</p>
<p>U.S. Sens. Kyrsten Sinema, an Arizona Democrat, and Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican, are still in talks on a draft proposal that would create a pathway to citizenship for up to 2 million undocumented people, often referred to as Dreamers, who are either enrolled in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program or would qualify for it. There is no legislative text and no deal has been finalized, Tillis told States Newsroom.</p>
<p>The possible agreement would also extend the <a href="https://newjerseymonitor.com/briefs/u-s-district-court-strikes-down-use-of-title-42-to-expel-migrants/" target="_blank">controversial Title 42 policy</a>, which allows the United States to turn away noncitizens seeking asylum during a health crisis, and allocate funding for border security. The outline would also include a pathway to citizenship for those under Temporary Protected Status, which is <a href="https://miracoalition.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/TPS-factsheet_May-2022.pdf" target="_blank">more than 350,000 people. </a></p>
<p>“We hope that those talks come to fruition,” U.S. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, told reporters at the U.S. Capitol on Tuesday.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Court ruling</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>More than 600,000 currently enrolled DACA recipients are in limbo after <a href="https://idahocapitalsun.com/2022/10/06/daca-ruled-unlawful-by-federal-appeals-court-but-program-continues-for-now/" target="_blank">a recent 5th Circuit Court of Appeals ruling</a> upheld a lower court decision that determined the DACA program to be unlawful — though current recipients are not yet affected — and blocked the government from accepting new applications.</p>
<p>Many immigration advocates have argued that it’s clear that DACA will be deemed illegal by the courts, leaving uncertainty for hundreds of thousands of Dreamers.</p>
<p>U.S. Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin of Illinois has said for weeks that he knows of roughly four or five Senate Republicans who are interested in striking a deal to pass legislation to create a pathway to citizenship for undocumented people enrolled in DACA. But Senate Democrats would need 10 Republican votes to overcome the filibuster threshold to pass such legislation.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/SenatorDurbin/status/1599832836445392896" target="_blank">On Twitter,</a> Durbin said he was interested in reviewing the draft proposal between Tillis and Sinema.</p>
<p>“I am determined to do everything in my power to help deliver a Christmas miracle for Dreamers,” Durbin wrote on Twitter.</p>
<p>Tillis said that he and Sinema have been talking for months about a possible immigration deal and felt that they had made progress. He said the framework for creating a pathway to citizenship for those under DACA “is more or less settled,” and the sticking point is “getting the final bricks of the foundation for border security — that&#8217;s still up in the air.”</p>
<p>As for timing of the proposal, Tillis did not say if a deal could be finished by the end of Congress’ lame-duck session.</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s gonna take a little while to get a draft that we would be comfortable with publishing,” Tillis said.</p>
<p>U.S. Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey, chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who has been pushing for a pathway to citizenship for DACA recipients, told States Newsroom that he has some concerns with the framework.</p>
<p>The extension of Title 42 and how asylum is treated were among his concerns, he said.</p>
<p>“Magical things can happen,” Menendez said. “But by the same token, you know, the clock is ticking.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">No details circulated</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Many senators said they are aware of the Sinema-Tillis framework but have yet to see any written specifics.</p>
<p>Republican Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania told reporters at the Capitol Monday that he knew of the Tillis-Sinema agreement, “but I have not seen the details.”</p>
<p>Republican Sen. Mike Rounds of South Dakota told reporters at the Capitol Monday that he was skeptical an immigration deal could be passed before the end of the lame-duck session. He said any deal on immigration would have to include border security.</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s not something you can airdrop,” he said, a term commonly used in Washington about proposals that have not seen any committee or floor action. He added that his office has not received any bill text of the proposal.</p>
<p>In 2018, Rounds and independent Sen. Angus King of Maine <a href="https://www.collins.senate.gov/newsroom/senators-unveil-bipartisan-amendment-protect-dreamers-strengthen-border-security" target="_blank">tried to pass an immigration proposal</a> that would have created a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers and provided $25 billion to the Trump administration to build a wall along the U.S -Mexico border.</p>
<p>White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said during a press briefing Monday that the administration was aware of a proposal but had not seen details.</p>
<p>“The president has repeatedly called on Congress to permanently protect Dreamers, farmworkers, essential workers, and others and to provide them with the pathway to citizenship,” she said. “So, that is certainly a priority for the president.  But we haven&#8217;t seen the detailed proposal, so I can&#8217;t comment … about that from here.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Advocates want ‘real solutions’</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Immigration advocates have lobbied <a href="https://minnesotareformer.com/2022/10/11/immigration-advocates-call-again-for-daca-renewal-in-congress-as-possible-end-looms/" target="_blank">Democrats for weeks</a> to pass a last-effort piece of legislation to give DACA recipients a permanent pathway to citizenship.</p>
<p>Greisa Martinez Rosas, the CEO of United We Dream, the largest youth immigration advocacy group, said in a <a href="https://unitedwedream.org/press/the-clock-is-ticking-we-need-real-solutions/" target="_blank">statement</a> that time to pass any DACA-related legislation is running out.</p>
<p>“We’ve heard of many leaked memos, conversations and ‘deals’ over the last 40 years,” Martinez Rosas said. “We don’t need DC gossip, we need real solutions, we need a pathway to citizenship now.”</p>
<p>Similarly, more than 70 mayors signed a bipartisan letter urging Congress to “enact permanent protections for Dreamers during the lame duck session.”</p>

(AiRVA Photography)</p><p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. Senate on Thursday voted to codify an agreement the White House brokered between rail unions and freight companies in order to avoid a catastrophic rail strike, but fell short of enough votes to include paid sick leave for workers.</p>
<p>The Senate backed the rail deal on an 80-15 vote and rejected the House-passed sick leave proposal <a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_votes/vote1172/vote_117_2_00371.htm" target="_blank">52-43,</a> despite pleas from independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. Sixty votes were required for passage.</p>
<p>Both of Virginia&#8217;s Democratic senators, Tim Kaine and Mark Warner, supported the sick leave proposal as well as the rail deal.</p>
<p>In a joint statement, the senators said they were &#8220;disappointed&#8221; with the sick leave bill failure.</p>
<p>&#8220;The workers who keep our trains and economy running are invaluable. They need and deserve paid sick leave,&#8221; Warner and Kaine wrote. &#8220;Especially after COVID, the notion of seven days of paid sick leave for full-time workers is basic common sense.&#8221;</p>
<p>The bill imposing the agreement now goes to President Joe Biden’s desk. Senators also rejected <a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_votes/vote1172/vote_117_2_00370.htm" target="_blank">25-70</a> a proposal by Alaska Republican Dan Sullivan and Arkansas Republican Tom Cotton to extend the cooling-off period for talks to continue.</p>
<p>Sanders called out railroad companies for refusing to give their workers paid sick leave and penalizing those who do take time off, calling the practices “barbaric.” He voted against codifying the September agreement.</p>
<p>“I gotta say that they are maybe the worst case of corporate greed that I have seen,” Sanders said of the freight rail carriers. “These guys are making record-breaking profits, giving their CEOs huge compensation packages.”</p>

<p>But Democrats said the looming rail strike had the potential to upend U.S. shipping and commerce just before the holidays, and Biden on Monday called for Congress to impose the agreement.</p>
<p>“The Senate cannot leave until we get the job done,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, said ahead of the votes Thursday.</p>
<p>“Working together, we have spared this country a Christmas catastrophe in our grocery stores, in our workplaces, and in our communities,” Biden said after the Senate vote.</p>
<p>“I know that many in Congress shared my reluctance to override the union ratification procedures,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;But in this case, the consequences of a shutdown were just too great for working families all across the country. And, the agreement will raise workers’ wages by 24%, increase health care benefits, and preserve two person crews. I have long been a supporter of paid sick leave for workers in all industries — not just the rail industry — and my fight for that critical benefit continues.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Buttigieg and Walsh to the Hill</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>With the cooling-off period ending soon, giving the unions the authority to strike starting Dec. 9, Biden sent U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and U.S. Labor Secretary Marty Walsh to Capitol Hill to brief Senate Democrats on the railroad labor deal ahead of the vote.</p>
<p><a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/LSB/LSB10861" target="_blank">Congress has the authority to intervene</a> under the Railway Labor Act, which governs disputes between railway carriers and labor unions.</p>
<p>The Senate Republicans who joined a majority of Democrats in backing paid sick leave included Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas, Josh Hawley of Missouri, John Kennedy of Louisiana, Mike Braun of Indiana, Marco Rubio of Florida and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina.</p>
<p>Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock, who is currently on the campaign trail in advance of the Georgia runoff election, did not vote. Sen. Chris Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, did not vote because <a href="https://twitter.com/ChrisMurphyCT/status/1598380415793958915" target="_blank">he tested positive</a> for COVID-19 Thursday morning and is currently isolating.</p>
<p>Senators said they had to act. “We need to figure out a way to get this working,” Sen. Bob Casey, a Pennsylvania Democrat, said, adding that it would be devastating to workers and the economy if the strike were to occur.</p>
<p>Sen. Joe Manchin III expressed concern about Congress setting a precedent by intervening in a rail strike but ultimately said he would vote for the agreement. Following the briefing he attended with Walsh and Buttigieg, he said he felt the deal was fair.</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s still the best proposal out there, and it&#8217;s what we should be voting for,” Manchin, a West Virginia Democrat, said.</p>
<p>Manchin voted against giving workers seven days of paid sick leave.</p>
<p>The scramble for Congress to pass a rail deal came <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-intervene-rail-workers-strike-heeding-biden-call" target="_blank">after the president</a> directed Congress to adopt the agreement between rail workers and operators that the White House helped facilitate in September, which was based on recommendations from an emergency board that Biden established in July.</p>
<p>Biden, calling himself “a proud pro-labor president,” said that while he was supportive of the unions, he could not let the dispute create an economic disaster.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">September deal</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>In September, four of the 12 rail unions voted against endorsing the deal, voicing their opposition to a lack of paid sick leave. All 12 unions — representing 115,000 freight rail workers — need to agree on a contract, and if one doesn’t agree, workers represented by the others don’t cross the picket line.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-votes-avert-calamitous-rail-strike-senate-prospects-murky" target="_blank">The House on Wednesday</a> voted to pass the agreement and separately added seven days of paid sick leave, though workers wanted more. Railroad workers are not currently guaranteed a single paid sick day. Rail companies refused to agree to paid sick leave.</p>
<p>The agreement the White House helped facilitate would give workers a 24% raise over five years, from 2020 to 2024; one additional personal day; and some protection from the rail carriers’ punitive attendance policies so that workers can take time off for medical needs without fear of discipline. The White House suggested to the unions that they withdraw their request for paid sick leave.</p>
<p>The Association of American Railroads, which is the trade group that represents the railroad companies, urged the Senate to pass the September agreement and reject Sanders’ push to include paid sick leave.</p>
<p>“The Senate must now act quickly to implement the historic deals reached at the bargaining table and already ratified by eight of twelve unions,” AAR CEO Ian Jefferies said in a <a href="https://www.aar.org/news/house-votes-to-avert-strike-railroads-call-on-senate-to-pass-clean-package/" target="_blank">statement</a>. “Unless Congress wants to become the de facto endgame for future negotiations, any effort to put its thumb on the bargaining scale to artificially advantage either party or otherwise obstruct a swift resolution would be wholly irresponsible and risk a timely outcome to avoid significant economic harm.”</p>
<p>But Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, criticized freight owners and their use of precision scheduled railroading, <a href="https://www.freightrailreform.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/RCC-Issue-Brief_Precision-Scheduled-Railroading.pdf" target="_blank">a method </a>of streamlining rail operations.</p>
<p>“This is an industry that has been wildly profitable,” Warren said. “They&#8217;ve doubled their profits during the pandemic, they&#8217;ve done $125 billion in stock buybacks, and they&#8217;ve cut the workforce by 30%, and the way they have been so profitable is by doing something they call precision scheduling, which means in fact, every single worker has to be available roughly 365 days. That leaves no room for people to get sick, for people to get injured.”</p>
<p>AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler said in a <a href="https://aflcio.org/press/releases/afl-cio-stands-rail-workers-calls-congress-pass-paid-sick-days" target="_blank">statement</a> that the agreement from the White House fell short and urged Congress to “do the right thing by passing paid sick days for rail workers.”</p>
<p>“To be clear, rail companies could do the right thing today and grant workers paid sick leave,” she said. “But they&#8217;ve refused, putting profits over people. That&#8217;s how we got here.”</p>

(Scott Elmquist / Style Weekly) </p><p>WASHINGTON — U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Monday said the House will take up legislation to ratify an agreement between rail workers and operators in order to avert a nationwide rail strike.</p>
<p>“This week, the House will take up a bill adopting the Tentative Agreement — with no poison pills or changes to the negotiated terms — and send it to the Senate,” the California Democrat said in a statement. “It is my hope that this necessary, strike-averting legislation will earn a strongly bipartisan vote, giving America’s families confidence in our commitment to protecting their financial futures.”</p>
<p>The announcement follows President Joe Biden’s call on Monday directing Congress to adopt the agreement reached in September, which was based on recommendations from an emergency board that Biden established in July.</p>
<p>That agreement would give workers a 24% raise over five years, from 2020 to 2024; one additional personal day; and some protection from the rail carriers&#8217; punitive attendance policies so that workers can take time off for medical needs without fear of discipline.</p>
<p>But paid sick leave was not on the table and the board recommended to the unions that they withdraw their proposal to have 15 paid sick days.</p>
<p>The way rail unions work is that all 12 unions — representing 115,000 freight rail workers — need to agree on a contract, and if one doesn’t agree, workers represented by the others don’t cross the picket line.</p>
<p>Eight of the 12 voted to adopt and ratify the union’s tentative agreement, so the unions went into a cooling-off period that was set to end Dec. 9, meaning the unions then could strike.</p>
<p>The unions that did not ratify the September deal are the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employes Division-International Brotherhood of Teamsters, the International Association of Sheet Metal, Air, Rail and Transportation Workers, the Brotherhood of Railroad Signalmen and the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers, which represent roughly more than half of rail workers.</p>
<p>“The most common sticking point for BMWED, BRS and IBB Members has been the lack of quality-of-life improvements, namely the lack of paid sick leave,” according to BMWED’s <a href="https://www.bmwe.org/secondary.aspx?id=718" target="_blank">website</a>. “BMWED, BRS and IBB have made paid sick leave proposals to the railroads, but the railroads have made it clear that they will neither engage in any meaningful discussions nor accept any sort of proposal regarding such.”</p>
<p>Biden said that he is concerned about no paid sick leave for rail workers and that he has pressed for legislation to enact it.</p>
<p>“Every other developed country in the world has such protections for its workers,” Biden said in a statement. “But at this critical moment for our economy, in the holiday season, we cannot let our strongly held conviction for better outcomes for workers deny workers the benefits of the bargain they reached, and hurl this nation into a devastating rail freight shutdown.”</p>
<p>These negotiations over employee pay, ability to take time off for medical appointments and paid sick leave have been going on since 2019 between labor unions representing railway employees and the National Carriers’ Conference Committee, which represents the railway carriers.</p>
<p><a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/LSB/LSB10861" target="_blank">Congress has the ability to intervene</a>, due to the Railway Labor Act, which governs disputes between railway carriers and labor unions.</p>
<p>“We are reluctant to bypass the standard ratification process for the Tentative Agreement — but we must act to prevent a catastrophic nationwide rail strike, which would grind our economy to a halt,” Pelosi said.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ryan Young, the executive assistant director of the Intelligence Branch at the FBI, said at the hearing that the agency was treating these bomb threats as domestic terrorism and they were the agency’s top priority. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s meant to inflict harm within the African American population,” Young told lawmakers, </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/03/17/most-hbcu-bomb-threats-may-be-coming-from-one-juvenile-fbi-official-tells-congress/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">who convened the House Oversight Committee hearing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">grill federal law enforcement officials as to why those individuals making bomb threats to HBCUs had not yet been caught.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The House and Senate, in a bipartisan vote, </span><a href="https://www.marylandmatters.org/2022/03/08/u-s-house-condemns-bomb-threats-made-against-hbcus/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">passed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a resolution condemning the bomb threats made to HBCUs, and several congressional hearings on the threats to minority institutions have been held.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The FBI said in the Monday statement that it is still investigating two sets of unrelated threats that appear to have originated overseas. One set primarily targeted 19 HBCU institutions from Feb. 8 to March 2. A second series of threats began on June 7 in which more than 250 colleges — including seven HBCUs — and more than 100 high schools and two junior high schools have received either bomb or active shooter threats, or both. </span></p>

<p>In Virginia, shortly after two bomb threats were made against Hampton University and Norfolk State University in late February, Gov. Glenn <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2022/02/26/virginia-hbcu-security/" target="_blank">Youngkin announced he would ask the General Assembly for additional funding</a> to increase security at the state&#8217;s HBCUs. The budget deal passed this summer ultimately included $4 million for campus safety and security initiatives, including $1 million to each of Virginia State University, Norfolk State University and the cities of Richmond and Hampton to support efforts at Virginia Union University and Hampton University, respectively.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The FBI said this year alone, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">more than 50 HBCUs, places of worship “and other faith-based and academic institutions across the country have received racially motivated threats of violence.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The agency said in its statement: “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hate-fueled and racist threats of violence cause the victims real distress. These threats disrupt the learning environment and the education of college students, as well as other citizens. The FBI will not tolerate anyone trying to instill fear in any community, especially one that has experienced violence and threats of violence historically. The FBI will continue to vigorously pursue anyone responsible for these ongoing threats with help from our law enforcement partners at the federal, state, and local levels.”</span></p>

Parker Michels-Boyce for The Virginia Mercury</p><p>WASHINGTON — A federal appeals court on Monday issued a nationwide injunction indefinitely blocking the Biden administration&#8217;s student debt relief program in response to a challenge by six GOP-led states.</p>
<p>The unanimous<a href="https://ecf.ca8.uscourts.gov/opndir/22/11/223179P.pdf" target="_blank"> ruling </a>by the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals in St. Louis came after the six states — Nebraska, Missouri, Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas and South Carolina — argued that the loan relief program threatens those states’ future tax revenues and that the plan by the Biden administration overrode congressional authority.</p>
<p>“The injunction will remain in effect until further order of this court or the Supreme Court of the United States,” according to the <a href="https://ecf.ca8.uscourts.gov/opndir/22/11/223179P.pdf" target="_blank">order</a> by a three-judge panel.</p>
<p>Those judges are <a href="https://www.ca8.uscourts.gov/opinion-authordissent?last_name=Shepherd&amp;first_name=Bobby&amp;flag=aut" target="_blank">Bobby E. Shepherd</a> and <a href="https://www.ca8.uscourts.gov/opinion-authordissent?last_name=Erickson&amp;first_name=Ralph&amp;flag=aut" target="_blank">Ralph R. Erickson</a>, both President George W. Bush appointees, and <a href="https://www.ca8.uscourts.gov/judge-grasz" target="_blank">L. Steven Grasz,</a> a President Donald Trump appointee.</p>
<p>The White House in a statement defended the program, which has been the subject of several lawsuits.</p>
<p>“We are confident in our legal authority for the student debt relief program and believe it is necessary to help borrowers most in need as they recover from the pandemic,” said White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre. “The administration will continue to fight these baseless lawsuits by Republican officials and special interests and will never stop fighting to support working and middle class Americans.”</p>
<p>The Biden administration <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/biden-student-debt-relief-plan-thrown-out-texas-judge-new-applications-halted" target="_blank">stopped accepting applications</a> for its student debt relief program last week following a decision from a Texas judge on Thursday that struck down the program, calling it “unconstitutional.” The Department of Justice has filed an appeal of that decision. Current applications are being held by the Department of Education.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Missouri connection</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>A federal judge in <a href="https://missouriindependent.com/briefs/judge-rejects-gop-challenge-to-student-loan-forgiveness-program/" target="_blank">Missouri originally rejected </a>the six-state lawsuit, ruling that those states lacked legal standing to pursue a case on the grounds that they will be harmed in the future.</p>
<p>However, the appeals court found that in Missouri, that state had shown likely injury, as a major loan servicer that is based in the state — the Missouri Higher Education Loan Authority, known as MOHELA — would lose revenue because of the debt relief program.</p>
<p>“Due to MOHELA’s financial obligations to the state treasury, the challenged student loan debt cancellation presents a threatened financial harm to the state of Missouri,” according to the panel. “Missouri, therefore, likely has legal standing to bring its claim. And since at least one party likely has standing, we need not address the standing of the other states.”</p>
<p>The three-judge panel decided against restricting the injunction to those six states because it would “be impractical and would fail to provide complete relief,” and because MOHELA has loans nationwide.</p>
<p>“Given MOHELA’s national role in servicing accounts, we discern no workable path in this emergency posture for narrowing the scope of relief,” according to the order.</p>
<p>​​<a href="https://educationdata.org/how-many-people-have-student-loans" target="_blank">More than 43 million </a>Americans have student loan debt, and the Federal Reserve <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/SLOAS" target="_blank">estimates</a> that the total U.S. student loan debt is more than $1.76 trillion.</p>
<p>The Biden administration’s plan would forgive up to $10,000 for eligible student loan borrowers, while the recipients of Pell Grants could apply for up to $20,000 in debt relief. The program is intended to assist borrowers who in 2021 earned no more than $125,000 per year and couples who earned up to $250,000 per year.</p>
<p>More than 26 million student loan borrowers applied for the program, and 16 million have been accepted, according to Jean-Pierre.</p>
<p>Student loan repayments have been paused since early 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic and are set to resume Jan. 1. The Biden administration has not announced if it will extend a pause on student loan repayments.</p>

(Ralph Freso / Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON — Young Black and Latino voters were critical in holding off the Republican “red wave” in several battleground states for U.S. Senate seats and in tight U.S. House races in the midterm elections, according to analyses by researchers and grassroot organizations.</p>
<p>Young, diverse voters between the ages of 18 and 29 had the <a href="https://circle.tufts.edu/2022-election-center" target="_blank">second-highest youth voter turnout </a>in almost three decades, with youth voter turnout at 31% in the nine battleground states of Florida, Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina, New Hampshire, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, according to estimates by the Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement, an institute at Tufts University.</p>
<p>Control of the Senate is not yet decided but is down to three races — Nevada, Arizona and a runoff election in Georgia — and control of the House is <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/which-party-controls-congress-it-could-be-days-or-weeks-we-know" target="_blank">still unknown</a>. Earlier predictions and polling had forecast a Republican “red wave” leading to a takeover of Congress at least in the House.</p>
<p>The center, which studies young voters, also <a href="https://circle.tufts.edu/2022-election-center#youth-voter-registration-state-by-state" target="_blank">found</a> in analyses of exit polling data that 89% of Black youth and 68% of Latino youth voted for a Democratic U.S. House candidate.</p>
<p>Young voters particularly played a key role in the Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Georgia races, the center found.</p>
<p>In the Wisconsin governor election, Democratic incumbent Tony Evers won his reelection by a slim margin, 51% to 48%. About 70% of young voters backed Evers compared to 30% for his Republican challenger Tim Michels, the center found in analyzing exit poll data.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Gen Z</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Adding to the influence of the youth vote, this is also the first election cycle that members of Gen Z, the generation born between 1997 and 2012, are eligible to run for Congress. Rep.-elect Maxwell Alejandro Frost, D-Fla., won his race this week, at 25 becoming the first Gen Z member of Congress and also the first Afro Cuban member.</p>
<p>Compared to earlier generations, Gen Z is the most diverse, <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/the-avenue/2020/07/30/now-more-than-half-of-americans-are-millennials-or-younger/" target="_blank">with more than half people of colo</a>r. In addition, one in five members of Gen Z identify as LGBTQ, according to a <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/389792/lgbt-identification-ticks-up.aspx" target="_blank">Gallup survey</a>.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden also acknowledged youth voter turnout <a href="https://coloradonewsline.com/briefs/biden-midterm-elections-good-democracy/" target="_blank">during a midterm election briefing</a> with reporters Wednesday afternoon, and thanked those voters for helping Democrats hold onto competitive House seats and flip a Senate seat in Pennsylvania, electing Democrat John Fetterman.</p>
<p>Organizations like <a href="https://nextgenamerica.org/our-impact/" target="_blank">NextGen</a> have worked to register more than 1.4 million young voters and helped get 2.6 million young voters to the polls in 2020 — the largest youth voter turnout in an election cycle.</p>
<p>In the Georgia U.S. Senate race, which is heading to a runoff election next month, young voters backed U.S. Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock by 63% to 36% compared to his GOP opponent, Herschel Walker, according to estimates from exit polling from the Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Latino voting power</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Héctor Sánchez Barba, the executive director and CEO of Mi Familia Vota, an organization that works to build Latino voting power, said during a briefing with reporters that the Latino voting bloc is a young population, with 30% of Latino voters ranging in age from 18 to 29, which is “10 years younger than the national average.” He added that 30% of Latinos are under the age of 18.</p>
<p>“So when we&#8217;re talking about the Latino vote, we&#8217;re not always talking about the transactional way that sometimes our vote is analyzed in swing states,” he said. “We as an organization are every day in the communities investing in the long-term democracy.”</p>
<p>Latinos are the second-largest voting bloc, said Yvonne Gutierrez, managing director of Latino Victory, which works to help progressive Latino candidates get elected to office and increase Latino voter participation.</p>
<p>Gutierrez said early on, Latino Victory worked on the ground in key states like Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado and Texas to endorse Democratic candidates, along with states like Oregon that have emerging Latino populations.</p>
<p>“Latino voters are delivering for Democrats and a formidable pillar of the Democratic coalition, and we need the investment, ongoing continued investment that happens year to year, not a helicopter in at the point of the election cycle,” she said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Support in congressional races</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Voto Latino, an organization that works to register Latinos to vote, <a href="https://votolatino.org/media/press-releases/voto-latino-celebrates-democratic-victories-following-midterm-elections/" target="_blank">found</a> in election eve polling in Arizona that Latinos backed Democratic U.S. Sen. Mark Kelly over GOP challenger Blake Masters. As of 4 p.m. Eastern on Thursday, with 70% of votes reported, Kelly has a lead over Masters, with 51% of the vote.</p>
<p>In Nevada, Latinos in polling supported Democratic U.S. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto over her GOP challenger Adam Laxalt, according to Voto Latino. Final results of that race will not be known until sometime next week, but as of 4 p.m. Eastern Thursday, with 83% of votes reported, Cortez Masto was trailing Laxalt with 47.6% of the vote compared to his 49.5%.</p>
<p>In Pennsylvania, where Democrats flipped a GOP U.S. Senate seat, Latinos supported Fetterman in polling by a large margin, Voto Latino said.</p>
<p>Latinos also were thought to have contributed to important wins in U.S. House races such as in Colorado, where Democratic U.S. Rep.-elect Yadira Caraveo, a pediatrician and state representative, <a href="https://coloradonewsline.com/briefs/caraveo-kirkmeyer-8th-congressional-district-colorado/" target="_blank">beat</a> her GOP challenger Barbara Kirkmeyer, a state senator, in Colorado’s newly drawn 8th Congressional District. The district is split evenly between the parties in voter affiliation and has the highest percentage of Latinos among congressional districts in the state.</p>
<p>Caraveo will become the first Latina to represent Colorado in Congress.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Siding with Democrats</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Clarissa Martinez De Castro, the vice president of UnidosUS Latino Vote Initiative, said that in the midterm elections, Latinos overwhelmingly voted for Democrats in every state except for Florida, where Latinos voted to reelect Republican U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, who is Cuban American, and Gov. Ron DeSantis.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/election/2022/exit-polls/florida/governor/0" target="_blank">an exit poll by CNN</a>, DeSantis won about 58% of the Latino vote, compared to Democratic challenger and former Florida Gov. Charlie Crist, who got 40% of the Latino vote.</p>
<p>Republicans have invested in the Sunshine State for decades, working to court the Latino vote in Florida, primarily by painting Democrats as communists, playing on the fears of regimes and dictators that many Latinos in the state previously fled, said Kenny Sandoval, the vice president of campaigns and partnerships at Voto Latino.</p>
<p>Sandoval expressed frustration that despite Latinos continuing to vote for Democrats, engagement in the community is often an afterthought.</p>
<p>“Latino voters and especially young Latino voters are among the most essential communities, and the Democratic coalition will be the fastest growing, yet what we saw was Latino voters, and the campaigns who engage them, remained an afterthought for Democratic fundraisers throughout the election cycle because they bought into the false and unsupported argument that Republicans have made serious inroads in the Latino community,” he said.</p>
<p>Martinez De Castro said that Hispanic voters are generally issue-based voters.</p>
<p>“As voters, Hispanics generally reject extremes and taking away rights from people, as illustrated by these voters’ views on abortion, for example, where 76% have stated that regardless of their personal belief, they do not believe abortion should be illegal or that that decision should be taken out away from everybody else,” she said.</p>
<p>Yanira Merino, the national president of the Labor Council for Latin American Advancement, said many Latinas went to the polls in the “wake of the attack on reproductive rights,” after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to abortion access this summer.</p>
<p>LCLAA is a nonprofit, nonpartisan Latino organization affiliated with the AFL-CIO labor organization and the Change to Win labor federation.</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s imperative to note the Latino vote must not be taken lightly and that investment into engagement of this group is a must, and it cannot be an afterthought,” she said.</p>

Biden said the application is easy and fast. It will allow every borrower with an income of $125,000 or less ($250,000 for married couples) to have up to $10,000 in debt forgiven, or $20,000 forgiven [&#8230;]]]></description>

<p>Biden said the application is easy and fast. It will allow every borrower with an income of $125,000 or less ($250,000 for married couples) to have up to $10,000 in <a href="https://missouriindependent.com/2022/08/24/biden-to-wipe-out-10000-in-student-loan-debt-for-many-borrowers/" target="_blank">debt forgiven</a>, or $20,000 forgiven for those with Pell Grants. Those income levels have to have been met during 2020 or 2021.</p>
<p>No documents need to be uploaded with the application, Biden said.</p>
<p>Late Friday, <a href="https://studentaid.gov/debt-relief/application" target="_blank">a beta version</a> of the student loan forgiveness application was released by the Department of Education. Biden said 8 million borrowers were able to fill out the application “without a glitch.”</p>
<p>The White House <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/08/24/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-student-loan-relief-for-borrowers-who-need-it-most/" target="_blank">estimated</a> that 43 million borrowers would qualify for some relief.</p>
<p>Those who qualify have until December 31, 2023, to fill out the application.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">GOP lawsuit</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The president called out Republicans for attacking the debt relief program, as well as Republican-led states that filed a lawsuit to prevent borrowers from applying for financial relief. <a href="https://missouriindependent.com/briefs/ag-joins-five-others-in-suing-the-biden-administration-to-stop-student-debt-cancellation/" target="_blank">The suit argues</a> Congress did not approve the debt cancellation and the Department of Education is misusing its emergency authority.</p>
<p>“Their outrage is wrong and hypocritical,” Biden said. “I don&#8217;t want to hear from Republican officials who had hundreds of thousands of dollars, even millions of dollars, in pandemic relief loans — PPP loans — who now attack working-class Americans for getting relief.”</p>
<p>https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/how-many-virginians-no-longer-qualify-for-student-loan-relief-its-hard-to-say/</p>
<p>U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona also joined the president for the announcement. Cardona said the department is working to make borrowers with private loans eligible for debt relief.</p>
<p>“We are working on pathways there to support those,” Cardona said. “But we&#8217;re moving as quickly as possible to provide relief to as many people as possible.”</p>
<p>The administration quietly dropped a section of borrowers — nearly 800,000 — from qualifying for the student loan forgiveness plan if they have loans administered through the now-defunct <a href="https://studentaid.gov/help-center/answers/article/what-types-of-loans-fall-under-ffel-program" target="_blank">Federal Family Education Loan program </a>or <a href="https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/types/loans/perkins" target="_blank">Perkins Loans</a>, following a lawsuit from a half-dozen Republican-led states.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/missouri-judge-hears-lawsuit-challenging-biden-student-debt-relief-plan" target="_blank">A Missouri judge</a> will issue a decision on the lawsuit filed by attorneys general from Missouri, Nebraska, Arkansas, Kansas and South Carolina and on behalf of Iowa’s governor.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/education/new-lawsuit-from-small-business-group-seeks-to-block-biden-student-debt-relief-plan" target="_blank">Another lawsuit</a>, filed in Texas, seeks to block the program, arguing that the Biden administration did not ask for public comment before moving forward with its action.</p>
<p>​​<a href="https://educationdata.org/how-many-people-have-student-loans" target="_blank">More than 43 million </a>Americans have student loan debt, and the Federal Reserve <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/SLOAS" target="_blank">estimates</a> that the total U.S. student loan debt is more than $1.75 trillion.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Watch out for scams</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Biden also warned of a scam in which callers will pretend to be from the federal government and ask about assisting a borrower with student loan debt.</p>
<p>“Let&#8217;s be clear,” Biden said. “Hang up. You never have to pay for any federal help from the student loan program.”</p>
<p>He said student loan repayment, which has been paused since early 2020, will resume in January.</p>
<p>Under Biden&#8217;s plan, those borrowers who continued to pay off their loans during the student loan freeze in the early stages of the pandemic <a href="https://studentaid.gov/announcements-events/covid-19/payment-pause-zero-interest" target="_blank">are allowed to get reimbursed</a> for payments made beginning March 13, 2020, by<a href="https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/repayment/servicers" target="_blank"> contacting their loan servicers</a> to request a refund.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WASHINGTON — Members of Congress are fanning out to every district in the country, leaving the wonky floor debates on Capitol Hill behind for the campaign trail in advance of the crucial Nov. 8 midterm elections. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats are fighting to hold their razor-thin majorities in the U.S. House and U.S. Senate, citing two years of victories on infrastructure, climate and prescription drug coverage. Republicans — whose early expectations they’d sweep the House were tempered after a Supreme Court abortion ruling — are trying to convince voters they need to balance the scales by putting them in charge of one or both chambers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GOP candidates are attempting to tie Democrats to inflation, crime, fears about immigration and </span><a href="https://maristpoll.marist.edu/polls/bidens-job-approval-rating-the-midterm-elections/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an unpopular president</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But they’re </span><a href="https://www.penncapital-star.com/dc-bureau/republicans-in-congress-shy-away-from-campaigning-on-national-abortion-platform/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">shying away</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from talking about a national abortion ban in the wake of the court’s decision to overturn two previous cases declaring abortion a constitutional right — while Democrats are seeking something of a nationwide referendum on abortion access.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adding to the tension in an unusual midterm election, Republican election deniers are </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/interactive/2022/election-deniers-running-for-office-elections-2022/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">on the ballot</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in many states. Election officials have </span><a href="https://coloradonewsline.com/2022/08/03/election-officials-at-u-s-senate-hearing-describe-threats-spread-of-misinformation/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">described</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">threats and a spread of misinformation. Polls in the tightest races aren&#8217;t giving a clear indication of who voters want in office, often switching from one week to the next or putting both candidates within the margin of error.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The polling uncertainty has left party leaders to funnel as much cash and attention to key races as possible, with Senate battles in Georgia, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Wisconsin drawing the most media and cash. Spending overall is expected to top a record $9.3 billion by the time the election is over</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/elections-overview/cost-of-election?cycle=2020&amp;display=T&amp;infl=N" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to Open Secrets</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican not up for reelection this year, pegs the chances the GOP regains that chamber as dead even. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re in a bunch of close races. I think we have a 50-50 shot of getting the Senate back,” McConnell said the last week of September. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McConnell sidestepped a question during the same press conference about whether he was being “overly dismissive” about the role abortion might play with suburban women, who tend to swing between voting for Democrats and Republicans. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think that issue is playing out in different ways in different states,” McConnell said, countering that the three biggest national issues Republicans will pound away at during the campaign will be “inflation, crime and open borders.” </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Voting on abortion? Or inflation?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Kansas </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">— </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a state dominated by Republicans </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">— </span><a href="https://kansasreflector.com/2022/08/02/kansas-voters-defeat-abortion-amendment-in-unexpected-landslide-1/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">residents overwhelmingly voted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this summer to reject a constitutional amendment that would have allowed state lawmakers to enact abortion restrictions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s been the only ballot question about abortion since the Supreme Court’s ruling in June, though California, Kentucky, Michigan and Vermont residents </span><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/abortion-access-ballot-november-these-states" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">will vote on abortion ballot questions</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">on election day. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A September </span><a href="https://maristpoll.marist.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/NPR_PBS-NewsHour_Marist-Poll_Politics_USA-NOS-and-Tables_202209021321.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">poll</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">NPR, PBS NewsHour and Marist National, a survey research center, found </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">inflation was the number one voting issue for Americans, with 30% saying it was “top of mind” when they thought about how they’d vote in November&#8217;s election. That figure was down from 37% in a July poll. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abortion came in second, with 22% of people surveyed citing it as a top issue, up from 18% in July. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Supreme Court&#8217;s decision on Dobbs this summer has had a major impact on electoral politics heading toward the midterm elections,&#8221; Lee M. Miringoff, director of the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion, said in a statement accompanying the poll. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abortion has likely been the most significant factor in improving Democrats’ chances in the past few months, Erin Covey, an analyst with the forecasting group Inside Elections, said in an interview.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet the inflation issue is also powerful. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The consumer price index, which is the average market basket of consumer goods and services bought by a household, has </span><a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">shown</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a continued increase in the cost of shelter, food, medical costs and education. The CPI determined that food has increased 11.4% over the last year — the largest 12-month increase since May 1979.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But despite economic concerns, the poll still found that Democrats have a 4-point advantage over Republicans in this upcoming election, primarily due to the Supreme Court’s decision.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Tight races</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats have seized upon abortion as an issue to motivate their base and get new voters to the polls, but it’s unclear if those new voter registrants, particularly women, are due to the Supreme Court’s abortion ruling and if that will help Democrats win tight races.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In every election since 1980, women have always outnumbered men in regard to voter registrations, </span><a href="https://cawp.rutgers.edu/facts/voters/gender-differences-voter-turnout" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to data compiled</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Democratic data firm </span><a href="https://insights.targetsmart.com/the-targetsmart-voter-registration-dashboard.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">TargetSmart</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which tracks voter registrations, found that there was a spike in registrations of women voters following the early leak of the Dobbs decision, but voter registrations in 2018 and 2020 were still higher than voter registrations when Roe v. Wade was overturned on June 24.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite their struggles dealing with the abortion issue, Republican leaders in the U.S. House still expect they’ll regain control. But key Democrats have become more outspoken in recent weeks, saying voters will keep them in the majority. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Democratic Leader Steny Hoyer and Congressional Progressive Caucus Chair Pramila Jayapal have all said they expect to hold onto the House. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pelosi, a California Democrat, said this week on CBS&#8217; “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” that overturning Roe v. Wade had a significant impact on how Democrats are approaching the midterm campaigns, leading to “a whole different attitude on the part of some about whether we could win.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I feel just watching each of the races — forgive me for saying this, in a very cold-blooded way, as to which races we can win, to ensure that we not only hold the House, but we increase our number,” Pelosi said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jayapal, of Washington state, said on a call with reporters she plans to campaign for at-risk progressive Democrats in the coming weeks, noting that many of the CPC’s members are also in the so-called Frontline program, which directs resources to Democrats in swing districts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We think progressives can win in tough districts and have shown it over and over again,” Jayapal said.  </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Democrats’ pitch</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic candidates are running on what they call a raft of accomplishments over the last two years of unified government, touting infrastructure, climate change and prescription drug prices, among others, Tommy Garcia, a spokesman for House Democrats’ campaign arm, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said. They are also focused on what they call Republican candidates’ extremism.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A Democratic majority will build on this historic progress, continue fighting to lower the cost of living for working families, and restore </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roe</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s abortion protections that Republican judges ripped away,” Garcia said in a written statement. “Voters will reject the GOP’s plan to ban abortion nationwide, throw out votes if they don&#8217;t like the results of an election, gut Social Security and Medicare, and stir up fear for their own benefit.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">President Joe Biden’s approval rating has ticked up since Democrats notched a few victories this summer, passing bills on gun violence and climate, health and taxes, as well as granting student loan debt relief. Moderate drops in gas prices from record highs earlier this year have also helped, Covey said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, polling in individual races has not shown a massive shift toward Democratic candidates, she said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Biden’s approval has gone up a bit, the generic ballot a little bit better. And obviously, we have seen Democratic over-performance in special elections,” she said. “In terms of the polling on an individual level, there hasn&#8217;t been a significant shift towards that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Analysts still rate a Republican takeover of the House as the most likely outcome, though the prospect of a landslide election is less probable, she added.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Who’s at risk?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has 39 members in its Frontline program, naming them as at risk of losing reelection. The House’s current party breakdown is 220 Democrats, 212 Republicans and three vacancies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The National Republican Congressional Committee, the House GOP’s campaign arm, placed 75 Democrats on its “</span><a href="https://www.nrcc.org/2022/06/09/nrcc-expands-target-list-to-75-following-conclusion-of-redistricting/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">target list</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” after all states completed their redistricting processes in June. The cohort includes all of the Frontline Democrats, except Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey and Pat Ryan of New York. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Cook Political Report with Amy Walter, however, has 30 House races </span><a href="https://www.cookpolitical.com/ratings/house-race-ratings" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in the “toss-up” category,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with 20 of those held by Democrats, nine controlled by GOP members and one new district in Colorado.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cook places 194 House seats as leaning toward Democratic control while 211 seats are favored for Republicans. That means the GOP needs to win fewer of the 30 toss-up races to reach the 218 seats needed to control the chamber. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While every House seat is up for reelection for another two-year term, just one-third of the Senate will face voters on Nov. 8, since members are elected to six-year terms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the Senate races, Cook </span><a href="https://www.cookpolitical.com/ratings/senate-race-ratings" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rates</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the Georgia, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin races as toss-ups. The Arizona, Colorado and New Hampshire races lean toward a Democrat winning. And the Florida, North Carolina and Ohio races lean toward a Republican victory.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nine Senate seats held by Democrats are expected to stay blue, while 15 seats up this cycle that are held by Republicans are in the solidly GOP category. The Utah Senate race is classified as likely going to a Republican, according to Cook’s ratings. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pennsylvania, where Democrat John Fetterman faces Republican Mehmet Oz for an open seat, was rated as </span>lean Democrat, but was moved to a toss-up this week, with Cook’s Senate and Governors Editor Jessica Taylor writing that it has become a “margin-of-error” race.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Republicans and Democrats alike admit the race has tightened and that Pennsylvania could be the tipping point state for the Senate majority,” she wrote. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Biden ratings</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Philip Chen, an assistant professor of political science at the University of Denver, said that in the Senate, Democrats have a better chance of picking up more seats because “Republicans are defending a lot of seats, and Democrats are fairly solid in the ones that they&#8217;re holding.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He added that the popularity of the president does come into play. A </span><a href="https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-BIDEN/POLL/nmopagnqapa/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">this month found that Biden’s approval was only 40%, which was actually up from his May low of 36% approval in the same survey.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We really will have to see how much the national mood dissatisfaction with President Biden and (how) things like that really do influence things, (and) how much of it is just the Senate is a tougher battle for Republicans this time around,” Chen said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The National Republican Senatorial Committee has </span><a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/parties/indexp.php?cmte=NRSC&amp;cycle=2022" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">spent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> millions of dollars against Democrats in key states. This election cycle the NRSC has spent more than $9 million against Sen. Mark Kelly in Arizona, and more than $4 million against Sen. Raphael Warnock in Georgia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee has </span><a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/parties/indexp.php?cycle=2022&amp;cmte=DSCC" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">spent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> $10.5 million against Kelly’s Republican opponent, Blake Masters, and $3 million against Warnock’s Republican opponent, Herschel Walker.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden, speaking at a Democratic National Committee reception in New Jersey on Thursday, cited the tendency for the president’s party to lose some power in the first midterms. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Based on statistics, the Democrats are running uphill because of the fact that, with only a couple exceptions, the first term of an incumbent president on the off-year election has been not a good deal most times,” Biden said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He then predicted that Democrats would hold the Senate, possibly picking up “a couple seats,” though he didn’t seem as optimistic about the party’s chances of keeping the House — blaming trends at the state level. Biden pointed out there’s been “​​a lot of gerrymandering in the House across the country, because a lot of governors aren&#8217;t Democratic governors.”</span></p>

(Scott Elmquist/Style Weekly)</p><p>WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden on Thursday announced executive actions that would <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2022/10/06/granting-pardon-for-the-offense-of-simple-possession-of-marijuana/" target="_blank">pardon thousands of people </a>with prior federal offenses of simple marijuana possession.</p>
<p>Biden then called on governors to follow suit with state offenses for simple marijuana possession, saying that “just as no one should be in a federal prison solely due to the possession of marijuana, no one should be in a local jail or state prison for that reason, either.”</p>
<p>The president also directed U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Xavier Becerra and Attorney General Merrick Garland to review how marijuana is classified under federal law as a Schedule I drug, the Drug Enforcement Agency’s most dangerous classification that includes substances like heroin and LSD.</p>
<p>Biden’s executive order to pardon simple possession includes the District of Columbia as well as people convicted in the federal court system.</p>
<p>“Sending people to prison for possessing marijuana has upended too many lives and incarcerated people for conduct that many states no longer prohibit,” Biden said in a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/10/06/statement-from-president-biden-on-marijuana-reform/" target="_blank">statement</a>.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘Failed approach to marijuana’</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The move is intended to address <a href="https://minnesotareformer.com/2021/12/22/federal-law-still-treats-marijuana-as-an-illegal-drug-creating-headaches-for-states/" target="_blank">the country’s “failed approach to marijuana,”</a> a senior administration official said Thursday afternoon minutes before the announcement.</p>
<p>Recreational use of marijuana is legal in 19 states, including Virginia, but there is still a mix of laws related to the drug. In 38 states, marijuana is allowed for medical purposes. Several others consider marijuana illegal in all forms.</p>
<p>Civil rights organizations and researchers have shown that charges for marijuana possession disproportionately affect Black and brown communities. For example, the <a href="https://www.aclu.org/issues/smart-justice/sentencing-reform/war-marijuana-black-and-white" target="_blank">ACLU found</a> that Black people were 3.7 times more likely to be charged with marijuana possession compared to white people.</p>
<p>Police made 663,000 arrests for <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/01/22/four-in-ten-u-s-drug-arrests-in-2018-were-for-marijuana-offenses-mostly-possession/" target="_blank">marijuana-related offenses</a> in 2018, according to FBI data, which amounted to 40% of all drug arrests for that year.</p>
<p>A senior administration official said Thursday that “while white, Black and brown people use marijuana at similar rates, Black and brown people are disproportionately in jail for it.”</p>
<p>Senior administration officials said that even if a person has not been charged with or convicted of marijuana possession, as of Thursday’s date, “the pardon does cover that conduct.”</p>
<p>The Department of Justice will create an administrative process for those who are pardoned to obtain a certificate of their pardon “so that they will have documentation that they can show to law enforcement, employers and others as needed,” a senior administration official said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">States moved first</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>States began decriminalizing or legalizing recreational use of marijuana in 2012, when Colorado and Washington voters passed statewide ballot measures. Over the next decade, 17 more states followed suit. Those states have operated for years in conflict with federal laws that have kept the substance strictly illegal.</p>
<p>Virginia <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/04/07/marijuana-will-be-legal-in-virginia-on-july-1-heres-what-is-and-isnt-permitted-under-the-new-law/" target="_blank">became the first state in the South to legalize marijuana in 2021</a>, although state lawmakers have <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/02/28/house-gop-kills-bill-to-begin-retail-recreational-marijuana-sales-this-year/" target="_blank">struggled to agree on the parameters of a retail market</a>.</p>

<p>The U.S. House <a href="https://newjerseymonitor.com/2022/04/01/u-s-house-votes-to-decriminalize-marijuana-in-federal-law/" target="_blank">passed legislation</a> earlier this year to legalize marijuana nationally, but the bill failed to gain traction in the Senate.</p>
<p>The House <a href="https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2022107" target="_blank">voted 220-204</a> to approve <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3617" target="_blank">the measure</a>, which would fix the split between federal law and law in states where recreational marijuana is legal. Three Republicans joined all but two Democrats in approving the measure.</p>
<p>Democratic lawmakers reacted positively to Biden’s announcement, and several called for full legalization.</p>
<p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said federal drug policies relating to marijuana have harmed communities of color and torn families apart.</p>
<p>“These transformative actions are the latest manifestation of Democrats’ unyielding commitment to justice, especially for those unfairly harmed by cannabis criminalization,” she said in a statement.</p>
<p>“A great first step for equitable treatment under the law — but we can and we will do more when we (expand) our Democratic majorities in November,” Virginia’s Rep. Gerry Connolly <a href="https://twitter.com/ElectConnolly/status/1578110544241983494" target="_blank">said</a>. Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine called the move &#8220;wise and compassionate.&#8221;</p>
<p>U.S. Sen Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, applauded the move in a statement and called for passage of<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/4591" target="_blank"> a bill</a> he sponsored, along with New Jersey Democrat Cory Booker and Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York, that would remove the substance from the list of controlled substances and expunge the records of anyone convicted of a marijuana-related crime.</p>
<p>“Legal protections for victims of the War on Drugs should be codified in law, cannabis should be descheduled and a federal regulatory system should be put in place to protect public health and safety,” he said.</p>
<p>Schumer called the action “historic” and said he hoped it would catalyze further congressional action.</p>
<p>“For far too long, the federal prohibition on cannabis and the War on Drugs has been a war on people, and particularly people of color,” the New York Democrat said in a statement. “President Biden’s action to pardon people convicted of simple marijuana possession under federal law is a huge step forward to correct decades of over-criminalization.”</p>
<p>Chair of the House Education and Labor Committee Bobby Scott, a Virginia Democrat, said in a statement that incarcerating people for possession of marijuana does not keep communities safer and is a waste of federal resources.</p>
<p>“We should instead be using those funds on evidence-based prevention and early intervention initiatives that actually reduce crime and save money,” he said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">GOP ties pardons to crime</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Many more Democrats than Republicans commented on the move, which is in line with most Americans’ views on marijuana. A MorningConsult/Politico <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/10/05/most-voters-back-federal-marijuana-legalization/" target="_blank">poll this month</a> found that 60% of respondents favored legalization.</p>
<p>Republicans who did comment largely framed the initiative as soft on crime. Republicans are making rising crime rates a campaign issue in next month’s elections.</p>
<p>“In the midst of a crime wave and on the brink of a recession, Joe Biden is giving blanket pardons to drug offenders — many of whom pled down from more serious charges,” Sen. Tom Cotton, a Republican of Arkansas, said on Twitter. An earlier version of the tweet, which was deleted after nine minutes, complained of pardons to “pot heads.”</p>
<p>Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, who is retiring this year, said in a statement that the Justice Department should not issue “blanket pardons” and each offender should be looked at individually. Hutchinson was the director of the Drug Enforcement Administration under President George W. Bush.</p>
<p>“As governor I have issued hundreds of pardons to those who have been convicted of drug offenses,” he said. “But in this time of rising crime there should be a clear record of law-abiding conduct before pardons are issued.”</p>
<p>Hutchinson is staunchly anti-legalization and has publicly opposed the proposed constitutional amendment on the Nov. 8 ballot that would create a legal marijuana regime in Arkansas.</p>
<p>Candidates campaigning for Congress quickly weighed in on the announcement as well, with Pennsylvania Democratic Senate candidate John Fetterman saying in a statement that it’s “a massive step towards justice.”</p>
<p>“Too many lives — and lives of Black and brown Americans in particular — have been derailed by this criminalization of this plant,” Fetterman said.</p>
<p>Ohio Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan, who is running for the open Senate seat, tweeted “legalize it” from his congressional Twitter account.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Schedule 1 drug</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Unless Congress changes federal marijuana laws or the president takes further action, marijuana is likely to stay classified as a Schedule 1 drug for the near future.</p>
<p>Senior administration officials said Thursday it will take a while for the HHS secretary and the attorney general to assess if marijuana should stay in the highest classification or drop to a lower category within the DEA’s system.</p>
<p>“The process will take some time, because it must be based on a careful consideration of all of the available evidence, including scientific … and medical information that&#8217;s available,” the senior administration official said, adding that while Biden hasn’t set a timeline he wants the review to be “expeditious.”</p>
<p>The DEA has five schedule classifications for legal and illegal drugs, with Schedule 1 including substances with a high potential for abuse and no medical use. Heroin, LSD and peyote are classified as Schedule 1 drugs along with marijuana.</p>
<p>The next category, Schedule 2, is supposed to host drugs with a high potential for abuse and that can lead to “severe psychological or physical dependence,” according to the DEA. Cocaine, fentanyl, methamphetamine and oxycodone are all currently classified as Schedule 2.</p>
<p>Schedule 3 includes substances with a low to moderate likelihood of physical and psychological dependence, such as anabolic steroids and testosterone. Schedule 4 hosts drugs like Xanax, Valium and Ambien that have a low potential for abuse, according to the DEA. And Schedule 5 includes substances with a lower possibility of abuse than Schedule 4.</p>

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. Senate Rules and Administration Committee on Tuesday passed legislation that would update an 1887 elections law and clarify how electoral votes are certified, with the hopes of averting another attempt to overturn a presidential election.</p>
<p>Sens. Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat, and Roy Blunt, a Missouri Republican, put forth the bill, known as the <a href="https://www.collins.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/text_of_electoral_count_reform_and_presidential_transition_improvement_act.pdf" target="_blank">Electoral Count Reform and Presidential Transition Improvement Act</a>. The aim of the legislation is to deter another Jan. 6 insurrection, in which former President Donald Trump tried to subvert the results of the 2020 presidential election by citing the 19th-century law.</p>
<p>“On that day, enemies of our democracy sought to use this antiquated law to thwart the results of a free and fair election,” Klobuchar said in her opening remarks.</p>
<p>The bill passed on a nearly unanimous vote, 14-1. The only senator present to vote against it was Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican.</p>
<p>Cruz called it a “bad bill” and questioned why Republicans would support it.</p>
<p>“This bill is all about Donald J. Trump,” Cruz said.</p>
<p>Sens. Jeff Merkley, an Oregon Democrat, and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York were not present but voted yes by proxy.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/09/22/u-s-house-passes-bill-reforming-electoral-count-act-to-stop-jan-6-repeat/" target="_blank">The U.S. House passed its version of the bill</a> earlier in September, 229-203, with nine Republicans joining Democrats. Virginia’s House delegation split on party lines, with all Democrats voting for the measure and all Republicans voting against it.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Trump and Pence</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Blunt said there was broad support on both sides of the aisle to update the act after the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, in which Trump pressured former Vice President Mike Pence to block the certification of the 2020 presidential election results. The vice president’s role in the certification of electoral votes isn’t exactly clear in the Electoral Count Act.</p>
<p>“We found out last year it&#8217;s outdated and needed reform,” Blunt said.</p>

<p>Klobuchar, who leads the committee, said it took months of bipartisan effort from the committee and other Senate colleagues to put the bill together.</p>
<p>Sen. Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat, said the committee did not try to “reinvent the wheel” but took a very careful approach to update the law.</p>
<p>“We did spend a lot of time trying to get it right,” Warner said.</p>
<p>He added that he wanted the committee to also consider protecting elections from future cyberattacks.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Bipartisan backing</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The bill has bipartisan support in the Senate.</p>
<p>Sens. Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, and Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, worked to gather the support of 11 Republican and 11 Democratic senators to cosponsor the measure, meeting the 60-vote threshold needed to advance the legislation past a filibuster.</p>
<p>On the Senate floor Tuesday, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, said he “proudly supports” the overhaul of the Electoral Count Act.</p>
<p>“I strongly support the modest changes that our colleagues in the working group have fleshed out after months of detailed discussions,” McConnell said.</p>
<p>The timing on final passage of the bill is still unclear, though it could come up during the lame-duck session of Congress expected after the election.</p>
<p>“We’ll move into next year with this done,” Blunt said.</p>
<p>Schumer has not announced when he will bring the bill to the Senate floor for a vote.</p>
<p>“Make no mistake,” Schumer said in a statement. “(A)s our country continues to face the threat of the anti-democracy MAGA Republican movement — propelled by many GOP leaders who either refused to take a stand or actively stoked the flames of division in our country — reforming the Electoral Count Act ought to be the bare minimum of action the Congress takes.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Senate version</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The Senate bill has two provisions, the Electoral Count Reform Act and the Presidential Transition Improvement Act.</p>
<p>The Electoral Count Reform Act states that the vice president’s role in presiding over Congress when certifying electors is ceremonial and that the vice president does not have the power to object, accept or adjudicate disputes over electors.</p>
<p>Most notably, it also raises the threshold for lawmakers to make an objection to electors. Under current law, only one U.S. House representative and one U.S. senator need to make an objection to an elector or slate of electors. Under the new law, that would be raised to one-fifth of members from both chambers to lodge an objection.</p>
<p>The act also adds several reforms for electors from each state. It identifies each state’s governor as the official responsible for submitting the state&#8217;s official document that identifies the state’s appointed electors and says that Congress cannot accept that document from any official besides the governor.</p>
<p>“This reform would address the potential for multiple state officials to send Congress competing slates,” according to the bill’s summary.</p>
<p>This reform was included because Trump and his campaign tried to replace legitimate slates of electors in several states with fake electors who would cast ballots for Trump, <a href="https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2022/07/14/trump-tweet-invited-wild-mob-to-block-transfer-of-power-on-jan-6-house-panel-says/" target="_blank">an effort detailed by the Jan. 6 committee</a> that is investigating the attack on the Capitol.</p>
<p>The act also provides an expedited judicial review of any challenges made and removes a provision in the law “that could be used by state legislatures to override the popular vote in their states by declaring a ‘failed election’ — a term that is not defined in the law,” according to the bill’s <a href="https://www.collins.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/one_pager_on_electoral_count_reform_act_of_2022.pdf" target="_blank">summary</a>. The bill reforms this by stating a state can move its presidential election day to the following first Monday in November every four years only if needed due to “extraordinary and catastrophic” events.</p>
<p>The Presidential Transition Improvement Act provides “guidelines for when eligible candidates for President and Vice President may receive federal resources to support their transition into office,” according to the bill’s <a href="https://www.collins.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/one_pager_on_presidential_transition_improvement_act.pdf" target="_blank">summary</a>.</p>

(Lynne Terry / Oregon Capital Chronicle) </p><p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. House on Wednesday passed a bill updating a 19th-century law in an attempt to prevent the subversion of future presidential elections.</p>
<p>The Presidential Election Reform Act, which <a href="https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2022449" target="_blank">passed</a> 229-203, is meant to deter a repeat of the insurrection on Jan. 6, 2021, in which the U.S. Capitol was attacked by a mob of pro-Trump supporters trying to stop Congress from certifying the presidential electoral votes.</p>
<p>Nine House Republicans joined Democrats in voting for the measure, <a href="https://rules.house.gov/sites/democrats.rules.house.gov/files/BILLS-117HR8873IH.pdf" target="_blank">H.R. 8873</a>, which would revamp the Electoral Count Act.</p>
<p>“If your aim is to prevent future efforts to steal elections, I would respectfully suggest that conservatives should support this bill,” Rep. Liz Cheney, a Wyoming Republican, said on the House floor. “If instead your aim is to leave open the door for elections to be stolen in the future, you might decide not to support this or any other bill to address the electoral count.”</p>
<p>Cheney, along with Rep. Zoe Lofgren, a California Democrat, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/we-have-a-bill-to-prevent-another-jan-6-attack-cheney-committee-electoral-count-president-11663535092?mod=Searchresults_pos2&amp;page=1" target="_blank">wrote in a Wall Street Journal opinion piece </a>on Sunday that the bill “is intended to preserve the rule of law for all future presidential elections by ensuring that self-interested politicians cannot steal from the people the guarantee that our government derives its power from the consent of the governed.”</p>
<p>On the House floor, Lofgren said the bill “will make it harder to convince people that they have the right to overthrow the election.”</p>
<p>Both lawmakers are part of the House special committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol.</p>
<p>The bill raises the threshold for an objection to a state&#8217;s electoral vote from one member of each chamber to one-third of each chamber, a big increase, and makes it clear that the vice president&#8217;s role in certifying electoral votes is purely ceremonial.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">GOP objections</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>A majority of Republicans pushed back against the bill, with Rep. Rodney Davis of Illinois labeling it partisan and Rep. Bryan Steil of Wisconsin calling the process rushed.</p>
<p>Davis said that Democrats were perpetuating a false narrative that Republicans are election deniers and want to overturn elections, while Steil said that Americans have lost faith in their election system, and the bill does not do anything to quell those fears.</p>
<p>“Will the bill before us boost people’s confidence in our elections process?” Steil asked. “The bill fails the test.”</p>
<p>Virginia&#8217;s U.S. House delegation split on party lines Wednesday, with all Democratic representatives voting for the bill and all Republicans voting against it.</p>
<p>The House Rules Committee held a hearing on the measure Tuesday and voted 9-3 to send the legislation to the House floor. All Democrats in that committee voted for the bill, and all the Republicans who voted opposed it.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Trump actions</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The push to clarify the election certification process comes after former President Donald Trump tried to pressure former Vice President Mike Pence to block the certification of the 2020 presidential election results.</p>
<p>The Jan. 6 insurrection, spurred by Trump, shortly followed. Four people who were part of the mob died, and five police officers responding to the insurrection also died in the days and weeks following.</p>

A group of Republican senators said they would reject the Electoral College votes of several states unless Congress appointed a commission to audit the election results.

<p>Current law allows a congressional representative paired with a senator to object to a state’s electoral votes, which Republicans did. But they were interrupted from their objections when the mob of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol.</p>
<p>Because the vice president’s role in the certification of electoral votes isn’t exactly clear, Trump tried to pressure Pence to not certify the election.</p>

<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Senate version</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The future of the House measure is unclear because the Senate is working on its own legislation.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.marylandmatters.org/2022/08/03/members-of-u-s-senate-committee-consider-bipartisan-changes-to-electoral-count-act/" target="_blank">The Senate held an August hearing</a> where Sens. Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, and Joe Manchin III, a West Virginia Democrat, argued for the need to update the 1887 electoral law.</p>
<p>The senators said the current law is archaic and ambiguous, and that their bill had several reforms, including clarification of the role of the vice president when certifying electoral votes.</p>
<p>Collins announced Wednesday she had 10 Democratic and 10 Republican co-sponsors for the bill, meaning its passage could reach the 60-vote threshold needed to advance past a filibuster in the Senate.</p>
<p>“Our bill is backed by election law experts and organizations across the ideological spectrum,” Collins said in a statement. “We will keep working to increase bipartisan support for our legislation that would correct the flaws in this archaic and ambiguous law.”</p>
<p>Those 10 Senate Democrats include Manchin, Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, Mark Warner of Virginia, Chris Murphy of Connecticut, Ben Cardin of Maryland, Chris Coons of Delaware, John Hickenlooper and Michael Bennet of Colorado and Alex Padilla of California.</p>
<p>The 10 Senate Republicans include Collins, Rob Portman of Ohio, Mitt Romney of Utah, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Thom Tillis of North Carolina, Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, Todd Young of Indiana, Ben Sasse of Nebraska, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Chuck Grassley of Iowa.</p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>WASHINGTON — The Department of Justice did not properly count nearly 1,000 deaths of incarcerated people in jails and prisons, according to a bipartisan report released Tuesday by a U.S. Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs subcommittee.</p>
<p>The 10-month investigation by the U.S. Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, chaired by Georgia Sen. Jon Ossoff, found that DOJ failed to enforce the Death in Custody Reporting Act of 2013, which requires states that receive federal funding to report prison and jail deaths to the agency.</p>
<p>“What the United States is allowing to happen on our watch in prisons, jails and detention centers nationwide is a moral disgrace,” Ossoff, a Democrat, said in his opening statement.</p>
<p>States that fail to follow the law can lose up to 10% of their funding for state and local law enforcement agencies under the Edward Byrne Justice Assistance Grant Program.</p>
<p>“These failures were preventable,” according to the report. “DOJ must act quickly to remedy the outstanding implementation failures, and Congress should continue to monitor DOJ’s implementation efforts.”</p>
<p>The Senate investigations panel held a hearing Tuesday afternoon following the release of the report, during which two witnesses whose family members died in custody in Georgia and Louisiana also testified. Both of the deaths were of people who were pre-trial, which means they had not yet been convicted of a crime.</p>
<p>The Department of Justice did not comment on the subcommittee’s report but pointed to the <a href="https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Henneberg%20Testimony.pdf" target="_blank">testimony</a> of Maureen Henneberg, the deputy assistant attorney general for operations and management in the Department of Justice’s Office of Justice Programs.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Lack of reporting</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>From 2000 to 2019, the Bureau of Justice Statistics collected and made public information about deaths in custody that was provided to DOJ, and then the agency would inform Congress of its data. But DOJ then transferred that task to its Bureau of Justice Assistance, which began collecting data in fiscal year 2020.</p>
<p>Since the transfer, DOJ has not reported the data that the Bureau of Justice Assistance has collected, according to the report.</p>
<p>The report found the agency was not fully cooperating with the panel’s investigation and “DOJ’s resistance to bipartisan Congressional oversight impeded Congress’ ability to understand whether (the Death in Custody Reporting Act) had been properly implemented, delaying potential reforms that could restore the integrity of this critical program.&#8221;</p>
<p>“This information is critical to improve transparency in prisons and jails, identifying trends in custodial deaths that may warrant corrective action — such as failure to provide adequate medical care, mental health services, or safeguard prisoners from violence — and identifying specific facilities with outlying death rates,” the report noted.</p>
<p>In fiscal year 2021, the report found that DOJ “failed to identify at least 990 prison and arrest related deaths; and 70% of the data DOJ collected was incomplete.” Of those deaths, 341 were prison deaths disclosed on states’ public websites and 649 were arrest-related deaths disclosed in a reliable public database.</p>
<p>The report found that the Justice Department did not properly manage the data collection transfer from the Bureau of Justice Statistics to the Bureau of Justice Assistance, and that a majority of the information on deaths that occurred in custody during fiscal year 2021 was incomplete.</p>
<p>About 70% of the records on deaths that occurred in custody were missing at least one data field as required by the reporting law, and about 40% of the records &#8220;did not include a description of the circumstances surrounding the death.”</p>
<p>Andrea Armstrong, a professor of law at Loyola University New Orleans College of Law who studies prison and jail conditions, said that making available data on prison and jail deaths can help prompt reviews of staffing, discipline and mental health protocols.</p>
<p>“Deaths in custody may signal broader challenges in a facility,” she said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Working to fix problems</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Ossoff and Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, the top-ranking Republican on the panel, grilled Henneberg on why the Department of Justice has not fixed its data collection process.</p>
<p>“You’ve utterly failed,” Johnson said. “This isn’t that hard.”</p>
<p>Henneberg said the department is working to fix the issues and many of the underreported death counts are from states.</p>
<p>“The states have no leverage to compel their local agencies to provide the data,” she said.</p>
<p>Additionally, she said that while there is a penalty for states that do not accurately report deaths in custody under the Edward Byrne Justice Assistance Grant Program, the department is concerned that “the penalty may have unintended, negative consequences and has not implemented the penalty.”</p>
<p>Gretta L. Goodwin<b>, </b>the director of homeland security and justice at the U.S. Government Accountability Office, said a review by two investigators found that in one year, the department missed almost 1,000 deaths.</p>
<p>“We believe that&#8217;s an undercount,” Goodwin said.</p>

(Max McCoy / Kansas Reflector)</p><p>WASHINGTON — More than 1,600 book titles across 32 states were banned from public schools during the 2021-22 school year, with the bulk of the ban requests coming from a handful of right-wing groups pushing for censorship of books that feature LGBTQ+ characters and characters of color, a new report issued Monday said.</p>
<p>“What I want to be really clear about is the books are a pretext,” Ashley Hope Pérez, an author of a banned book, said. “(Book banning) is a proxy war on students who share the marginalized identities of the authors and characters in the books under attack.”</p>
<p>In 2015, Pérez wrote “Out of Darkness,” a young adult romance about a Mexican American girl and an African American boy set in the 1930s, but the book was banned from school districts last year.</p>
<p>The states with the most incidents of banning are Texas, Florida, Pennsylvania and Tennessee, according to an updated report <a href="https://pen.org/report/banned-usa-growing-movement-to-censor-books-in-schools/" target="_blank">released Monday</a> by PEN America, a group that is dedicated to fighting book bans and advocates for the First Amendment. Overall, there were 2,532 incidents of banning across the United States.</p>
<p>“[T]he scope of such censorship has expanded drastically and in unprecedented fashion since the beginning of the 2021–22 school year,” the report found.</p>
<p>In total, there are 1,648 unique book titles that were banned in 2021-2022. PEN previously published <a href="https://pen.org/banned-in-the-usa/" target="_blank">a report in April </a>that found 1,586 instances of individual books banned, affecting 1,145 titles, in 86 school districts across 26 states.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Groups demand bans</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The new report found that 50 groups at the state, national and local levels, with as many as 300 chapters, “have played a role in at least half of the book bans enacted across the country during the 2021–22 school year.” Of those groups, 73% were formed in 2021, according to the report.</p>
<p>“Those who are advocating on this issue are within their rights, their freedom of assembly, mobilization, using their voices, and that&#8217;s perfectly appropriate,” Suzanne Nossel, chief executive officer of PEN America, said during a press briefing with reporters Monday.</p>
<p>“But when the end goal is censorship, as a free expression organization, it&#8217;s our obligation to call that out and to point out that even the use of legitimate tactics of expression can sometimes lead to a spurious and speech-defeating result,” she said.</p>
<p>Some of the states with book bans, according to the PEN report, include Idaho, Wisconsin, Michigan, Indiana, Ohio, Georgia, North Carolina, Virginia, Missouri, Iowa, Kansas, Arkansas, Minnesota and New Jersey, among others.</p>
<p>“The unprecedented flood of book bans in the 2021–22 school year reflects the increasing organization of groups involved in advocating for such bans, the increased involvement of state officials in book-banning debates, and the introduction of new laws and policies,” according to the report.</p>
<p>“More often than not, current challenges to books originate not from concerned parents acting individually but from political and advocacy groups working in concert to achieve the goal of limiting what books students can access and read in public schools.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Book Ban Week</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The report was released in connection with Book Ban Week, an annual campaign by the ​​American Library Association and Amnesty International to celebrate the freedom to read and to push back against censorship.</p>
<p>The ALA also<a href="https://www.ala.org/news/press-releases/2022/09/ala-releases-preliminary-data-2022-book-bans" target="_blank"> released its own report </a>that found from Jan. 1 to Aug. 31 of this year, there were 681 attempts to “ban or restrict library resources, and 1,651 unique titles were targeted.”</p>
<p>Some of those groups that have challenged school boards include Moms for Liberty, an organization formed in 2021 that has strong GOP ties and local chapters that “target local school board meetings, school board members, administrators, and teachers” to push right-wing policies, <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/critical-race-theory/unmasking-moms-liberty" target="_blank">as reported by Media Matters.</a> Moms for Liberty has about 200 local chapters across 37 states.</p>
<p>Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis <a href="https://www.momsforliberty.org/news/ron-desantis-parental-rights/" target="_blank">spoke at a Moms for Liberty convention in the summer</a>, where he touted “parental rights” and praised the group for its efforts to get books banned from public schools. In Florida, there are 566 books that are banned, according to the report by PEN.</p>
<p><a href="https://newjerseymonitor.com/2022/04/18/lgbtq-community-people-of-color-in-the-crosshairs-of-banned-book-movement/" target="_blank">Republican lawmakers at the state level</a> are also joining the movement to ban books from public schools and libraries.</p>
<p>Nossel said this idea of “parental rights” is “sort of the rubric that gets used to promote these movements.”</p>
<p>She said it’s beneficial for parents to be involved in their children&#8217;s education, but “that is not what this is about when parents are mobilized in an orchestrated campaign to intimidate teachers and librarians to dictate (to) them certain books be pulled off shelves even before they&#8217;ve been read or reviewed.”</p>
<p>“The trends are very clear that this is a targeted effort,” said Jonathan Friedman, director of free expression and education programs at PEN America and lead writer of the report.</p>
<p>Friedman said that book bans occurred in 138 school districts, representing 5,049 schools, across 32 states. He added that the bans affect nearly 4 million students.</p>
<p>“Overwhelmingly we are seeing people Google what books have LGBTQ content whatsoever. Even just a book that has an illustration of a same-sex interracial couple gets thrown onto one of these lists and ends up banned in some districts,” he said during the press call.</p>
<p>PEN found that 41%, or 674, of the 1,648 unique titles that were banned addressed LGBTQ+ themes or featured main or secondary characters who are LGBTQ+.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Bans tied to ‘sense of power’</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Cheryl Lewis Hudson, an author and publisher specializing in children&#8217;s books celebrating Black culture and Black history, said that book bans are about power and are nothing new. She said the trend of book bans is not only censorship, but erasure of marginalized communities.</p>
<p>“We can recall historically that in the United States, enslaved persons were prohibited by law from learning to read or write, and slave masters really understood that this special control of slaves was a sense of power — if you couldn&#8217;t control slaves’ bodies, you could control their minds by denying them access (to knowledge),” she said.</p>
<p>Hudson said Jim Crow laws prevented her from accessing public libraries, and she was not able to get her first library card until she was 13. She added that the segregated school she attended did not have a library for students.</p>
<p>“So banned books is not new, nor is the access to knowledge, and the data that PEN is providing reveals really alarming trends in terms of access to ideas,” she said.</p>
<p>She and her husband founded a publishing company that published more than 50 books featuring Black historical figures and culture.</p>
<p>Hudson said the common theme in books that are being banned is not the content of the books, but the fact that “the authors of those books are African American, the contributors of those books are from multicultural or non-white backgrounds.”</p>
<p>PEN found that 40%, or 659, of the 1,648 unique titles that were banned had main or secondary characters of color, while 20%, or 338 titles, addressed race and racism.</p>
<p>“So there is a trend and an underlying pattern of white supremacy, really that is challenging the actual existence of people of color in a democracy,” Hudson said.</p>

(Ariana Figueroa / D.C. Bureau, States Newsroom) </p><p>WASHINGTON — Amid K-12 teacher shortages, book bans and attacks over critical race theory, U.S. Education Secretary Miguel Cardona at a meeting with reporters on Wednesday stressed the need for higher salaries to attract prospective educators to the profession.</p>
<p>Cardona also touted the Biden administration&#8217;s <a href="https://tennesseelookout.com/2022/08/24/biden-to-wipe-out-10000-in-student-loan-debt-for-many-borrowe/" target="_blank">recent student debt relief announcement</a> in late August. The White House said President Joe Biden will cancel up to $20,000 in federal student loan debt for Pell Grant borrowers and up to $10,000 for all other borrowers with an income of less than $125,000 for an individual and $250,000 for a household.</p>
<p>But Cardona acknowledged that the one-time student loan cancellation policy did not address the root cause of the student loan crisis and said it “will not fix the long-term issues.”</p>
<p>Cardona spoke to reporters at a breakfast sponsored by the Christian Science Monitor as the Biden administration gears up to promote its successes in advance of the midterm elections.</p>
<p>Cardona said that on the K-12 level, teacher salaries are a key problem.</p>
<p>“Look, we want to recruit students,” he said. “We have to make sure that they&#8217;re not thinking, ‘Well, if I become a teacher, I have to drive Uber on the weekends, or I have to waitress on the weekends to make ends meet.’ That&#8217;s unacceptable.”</p>
<p>He pointed to Montana, where a National Education Association teachers union <a href="https://www.nea.org/about-nea/media-center/press-releases/nea-unveils-new-nationwide-data-educator-pay-and-school-funding" target="_blank">study</a> released in April found the average starting teacher salary is $32,495, the lowest in the nation. Cardona added that many teachers pay for school supplies out of their own pockets.</p>
<p>“If we&#8217;re serious about lifting the profession, if we&#8217;re serious about lifting education, we must invest in our educators,” he said. “Investing in our educators is an investment in our students.”</p>
<p>The same survey found an average starting teacher salary in Virginia of $42,251. With an average overall teacher salary of $58,506, the state ranks 25th in the nation in teacher pay.</p>
<p>While not every school district is experiencing a teacher shortage, and some shortages depend on the subject taught, there are currently 567,000 fewer educators in America’s public schools today than there were before the pandemic, according to an <a href="https://www.nea.org/about-nea/media-center/press-releases/nea-survey-massive-staff-shortages-schools-leading-educator#:~:text=ConductedbyGBAOStrategiesthe,theyloveearlierthanplanned." target="_blank">analysis</a> by the NEA. And nearly all U.S. states suffered a decline in public education jobs, according to <a href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/articles/2020/11/10/nearly-all-states-suffer-declines-in-education-jobs" target="_blank">research</a> from Pew Charitable Trusts.</p>

<p>Cardona did not specifically address recent controversial state laws that bar teachers from teaching about race or LGBTQ+ issues, like Florida’s <a href="https://floridaphoenix.com/2022/03/28/desantis-signs-dont-say-gay-feds-monitoring-for-civil-rights-violations/" target="_blank">“Don’t Say Gay” law</a>, or how conservative media outlets like Fox News air <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/fox-news/fox-news-lying-new-jersey-schools-are-grooming-and-torturing-kids-based-lgbtq-inclusive" target="_blank">segments</a> falsely accusing teachers of “predatory grooming.”</p>
<p>Conservative activists and predominantly White parents also have <a href="https://www.penncapital-star.com/dc-bureau/at-d-c-rally-parents-gop-lawmakers-vow-natl-push-to-get-critical-race-theory-out-of-schools/" target="_blank">pushed the falsehood</a> that schools are teaching critical race theory, an academic framework that says systemic racism is embedded in the legal system. Critical race theory is not taught in K-12 schools.</p>
<p>In many school districts there has also been a drive <a href="https://newjerseymonitor.com/2022/04/18/lgbtq-community-people-of-color-in-the-crosshairs-of-banned-book-movement/" target="_blank">to ban hundreds of books</a>. A majority of those bans have been targeted at books written by authors who are people of color, LGBTQ+, Black and Indigenous, and feature characters from marginalized groups.</p>
<p>Recently, an Oklahoma teacher resigned from her job following a complaint from a parent after she told her students that they could receive an online library card from New York City’s Brooklyn Public Library&#8217;s <a href="https://www.bklynlibrary.org/books-unbanned" target="_blank">Books Unbanned project</a> to access <a href="https://www.oklahoman.com/story/opinion/2022/09/05/banned-books-whats-on-the-forbidden-list-in-some-oklahoma-schools/65468650007/" target="_blank">books the school district banned</a>.</p>
<p>Oklahoma Secretary of Education Ryan Walters called on the state board of education to revoke her teaching certificate, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/09/01/1120576731/an-oklahoma-teacher-gave-her-students-access-to-banned-books-now-shes-under-scru" target="_blank">according to reporting by NPR.</a></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Loan forgiveness</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>In regard to student debt, Cardona said the policy initiatives that the Department of Education is backing to help ease the burden include increasing Pell Grants, reforming <a href="https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/repayment/plans/income-driven" target="_blank">income-based student loan repayment</a>, revamping the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program and providing more transparency to students and parents on the return of investments provided by attending a specific college or university.</p>
<p>The Public Service Loan Forgiveness program “forgives the remaining balance on your Direct Loans after you have made 120 qualifying monthly payments under a qualifying repayment plan while working full-time for a qualifying employer,” according to the Department of Education’s <a href="https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/public-service" target="_blank">website</a>.</p>
<p>“You know, the days of going to college and leaving $150,000 in debt and then getting a job, paying $35,000 a year doesn&#8217;t cut it,” Cardona said. “We have to give parents more information, transparency, too, so they know which institutions they should consider for their children.”</p>
<p><a href="https://educationdata.org/how-many-people-have-student-loans" target="_blank">More than 43 million </a>Americans have student loan debt, and the Federal Reserve <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/SLOAS" target="_blank">estimates</a> that the total U.S. student loan debt is more than $1.75 trillion.</p>
<p>The cost of tuition for higher education is <a href="https://www.ecs.org/clearinghouse/01/04/71/10471.pdf" target="_blank">largely set by local institutional </a>boards such as a state board of education or the state legislature. College tuition inflation has averaged 4.63% each year from 2010 to 2020, according to data from the <a href="https://educationdata.org/college-tuition-inflation-rate" target="_blank">Education Data Initiative</a>, which collects data and statistics about the U.S. education system.</p>
<p>“It is my intention to bring college presidents to the table, to bring the associations that govern them or that represent them to the table,” Cardona said.</p>
<p>Cardona said one tool the Department of Education has to address high tuition costs is the agency’s <a href="https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/" target="_blank">College Scorecard</a>, which provides prospective students and parents with data on college costs, graduation rates and post-college earnings.</p>
<p>He said the federal government can also “provide support and funding for those institutions that we believe are providing an inclusive environment, but also providing a good return on investment.”</p>
<p>“And then it may be that with those universities and colleges, we come up with different practices, that we&#8217;ll work with our partners on the Hill to try to ensure that, you know, throughout the country, our universities are accessible to all students,” he said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Back to school tour</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Cardona is set to kick off <a href="https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/secretary-miguel-cardona-announces-road-success-back-school-bus-tour" target="_blank">a tour </a>in which he and first lady Jill Biden, who will be along for the first two stops, will visit schools to show how communities are helping students recover and thrive after the coronavirus pandemic led to massive school closures.</p>
<p>The first stop is in Knoxville, Tennessee, where Cardona and the first lady will see how the state has worked to recruit and retain educators.</p>
<p>The analysis by the NEA, which is influential in Democratic politics and lobbies at the state and national levels on education policy, found that 55% of educators are &#8220;now indicating that they are ready to leave the profession they love earlier than planned” due to burnout from the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>Cardona also will travel to Pennsylvania, where he and second gentleman Douglas Emhoff will highlight how schools are continuing to help students recover from learning loss and receive mental health support, as well as talk about how teachers and administrations could receive debt relief through the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program.</p>
<p>He’ll also visit schools in North Carolina, Virginia, West Virginia and New Jersey. Virginia stops will include Richmond, Newport News and Harrisonburg schools.</p>

<p>“We preserve life at all costs,” she said in an interview with States Newsroom. “But there is a difference between that which is living, and that which is not yet living.”</p>
<p>Bogard is a rabbi at Central Reform Congregation in St. Louis, which is in the progressive tradition of Reform Judaism. She said that whether it’s the Torah — the first five books of the Old Testament in the Hebrew Bible — or the Talmud — the central text of Rabbinic Judaism and the primary source of Jewish religious law and theology — those pieces of Jewish literature “really draw the difference between life and potential life.”</p>
<p>But with the fall of Roe v. Wade in late June, some members of the Jewish faith as well as other religious groups find their beliefs in deep conflict with state laws that ban or greatly restrict abortion — especially if a pregnant patient’s life is in danger. In Virginia, Democratic Del. Eileen Filler-Corn, the only Jewish woman in the General Assembly, has said restrictions on abortion are &#8220;<a href="https://www.wvtf.org/news/2022-07-04/jewish-community-leaders-will-fight-attempts-to-restrict-abortion-in-virginia" target="_blank">contrary to thousands of years of Jewish law</a> and also Islamic law&#8221; and recently <a href="https://roanoke.com/opinion/columnists/schapiro-left-follows-right-playing-faith-card-in-abortion-fight/article_4ac5f009-bd79-517e-b5cc-86730edc7826.html" target="_blank">launched the Interfaith Reproductive Liberty Coalition with Democratic Del.

<p>Since the Supreme Court&#8217;s <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/19-1392_6j37.pdf" target="_blank">Dobbs v. Jackson Women&#8217;s Health Organization</a> decision, states now are permitted to craft their own laws regarding abortion, and in Bogard’s home state of Missouri, the procedure is <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/fact-sheet/state-facts-about-abortion-missouri" target="_blank">banned</a>.</p>
<p>“Our congregants are heartbroken,” she said. “It’s really violating to be told what you can and can&#8217;t do with your own self.”</p>
<p>Legal challenges are resulting. The enactment of state laws that ban or restrict access to abortion has already sparked a lawsuit in Florida from a liberal Jewish congregation in the Sunshine State. <a href="https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2022/07/12/jewish-community-to-join-aclu-abortion-providers-in-lawsuit-against-ohios-six-week-abortion-ban/" target="_blank">In Ohio, another liberal Jewish congregation</a> is joining the American Civil Liberties Union in a lawsuit against the state&#8217;s six-week abortion ban.</p>
<p>A coalition of three dozen rabbis also <a href="https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2022/07/27/religious-leaders-abortion-law-violates-constitutional-freedoms/" target="_blank">filed</a> a <a href="https://www.supremecourt.ohio.gov/pdf_viewer/pdf_viewer.aspx?pdf=927775.pdf&amp;subdirectory=2022-0803%5CDocketItems&amp;source=DL_Clerk" target="_blank">brief</a> on a separate lawsuit in the Buckeye State, where physicians are challenging the new abortion law in the Supreme Court of Ohio.</p>
<p>Similar lawsuits are anticipated, not only from liberal Jewish congregations, but other religious groups as well.</p>
<p>There’s currently a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas Houston Division filed by the Satanic Temple — not to be confused with the Church of Satan — on behalf of a member who argues the state’s abortion ban violates that temple member’s religious beliefs allowing access to an abortion ritual.</p>
<p>The ritual involves members repeating verses in a mirror to affirm body autonomy and repel any guilt, shame or discomfort that can surface when undergoing an abortion.</p>
<p>“There’s going to be a wave of religious freedom lawsuits,” Rabbi Daniel Bogard, who’s married to Rabbi Karen Bogard, said. “We’re going to find out if this country really believes in religious freedom, or whether this country believes in the freedom of a small minority to impose its will on the rest of us.”</p>
<p>But it’s unclear if these religious-based lawsuits challenging state abortion laws can win in court.</p>
<p>“We&#8217;re very much in the wild, wild west of abortion law and religious law,” said Candace Bond-Theriault, the director of racial justice policy and strategy at Columbia Law School&#8217;s Center for Gender and Sexuality Law.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Jewish law</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>According to Jewish law, a fetus is not considered a full human being and the biblical foundation for this is found in Exodus 21:22 of the Torah, Rabbi Daniel Bogard said.</p>
<p>The translation reads: “When men fight, and one of them pushes a pregnant woman and a miscarriage results, but no other damage ensues, the one responsible shall be fined according as the woman’s husband may exact from him, the payment to be based on reckoning. But if other damage ensues, the penalty shall be life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, burn for burn, wound for wound, bruise for bruise.”</p>
<p>Rabbi Daniel Bogard said that the Jewish legal interpretation of these passages states that a fetus is not a person because the miscarriage results in only monetary compensation, rather than the “life for life” punishment.</p>
<p>There are <a href="https://rcrc.org/jewish/" target="_blank">several other passages</a> in Jewish literature that make the distinction that the life of the person who is pregnant is prioritized.</p>
<p>“If we&#8217;re going to live in a religiously free society, we are each allowed to interpret these verses on our own for our own traditions and a minority in this country can&#8217;t impose their conservative white Christian religiosity on the rest of us,” Rabbi Daniel Bogard said.</p>
<p>The lawsuits challenging abortion laws are predominately filed by congregations that practice Reform Judaism, but Conservative Judaism <a href="https://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/story/conservative-rabbis-strongly-condemn-us-supreme-court-decision-overturn-abortion-rights" target="_blank">also supports access to abortion</a>.</p>
<p>The question of access to abortion gets more restrictive when it comes to Orthodox Judaism, but access to the medical procedure isn’t barred, says Yedida Eisenstat, a fellow at the Center for the Study of Law and Religion at Emory University in Atlanta.</p>
<p>“Abortion in Judaism absolutely does have a place, and within Jewish law, there absolutely is a place for abortion,” she said. “Judaism is not anti-abortion, like Christianity is, so it absolutely does make sense for Jewish congregations to be saying, ‘Hey, this is a violation of our religious rights.’”</p>
<p>Eisenstat specializes in Jewish biblical interpretation and also works as an editorial associate at the Posen Library of Jewish Culture and Civilization.</p>

(Rebecca Rivas / The Missouri Independent)</em></p></figure>
<p>“Judaism doesn&#8217;t have one voice or one opinion or one ruling about everything,” she said, adding that every situation is different and “there’s all this other gray area” when it comes to theoretical cases in Jewish law pertaining to abortion.</p>
<p>And interpretations on abortion in Jewish law, or Halacha, vary across American Jewish denominations.</p>
<p>“We use the theoretical cases to illuminate other cases — just like in American law — so there isn&#8217;t one blanket answer for every situation; every situation has its own nuances,” she said. “And again, that&#8217;s why this is a decision, a very personal decision, not one that the government should be making.”</p>
<p>The Rabbinical Assembly, a major institution of Conservative Judaism, condemned the Supreme Court&#8217;s ruling in Dobbs.</p>
<p>“Denying individuals access to the complete spectrum of reproductive healthcare, including contraception, abortion-inducing devices and medications, and abortions, among others, on religious grounds, deprives those who need medical care of their Constitutional right to religious freedom,” the organization said in a statement.</p>
<p>Orthodox Judaism is typically more aligned with Christian conservative views on religious liberty issues, Eisenstat said, but differs on the belief that life begins at conception.</p>
<p>Following the Dobbs decision, the <a href="https://rabbis.org/rca-opposes-new-york-states-reproductive-health-act/" target="_blank">Rabbinical Council of America</a> and <a href="http://agudathisrael.org/statement-of-agudath-israel-of-america-on-the-ny-reproductive-health-act/?cat=news" target="_blank">Agudath Israel</a>, large organizations that represent Orthodox Jewish communities, urged states to consider exceptions to expand abortion access.</p>
<p>“As the debate over abortion rights enters this new phase, we encourage states to craft policies that will simultaneously express the great value we place on life as well as protecting the rights to abortion when warranted by Jewish law,” the Rabbinical Council of America said in a statement.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Florida lawsuits</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Rabbi Barry Silver is a self-proclaimed “rabbi-rouser.”</p>
<p>He’s an attorney, a social activist, a former Democratic legislator in the Florida House of Representatives and the leader of the Congregation L’Dor va-Dor, a synagogue practicing progressive Judaism in Palm Beach, Florida.</p>
<p>Silver, along with three rabbis, a United Church of Christ reverend, a Unitarian Universalist minister, an Episcopal Church priest and a Buddhist lama, each have filed separate lawsuits challenging the state’s 15-week abortion ban that went into effect July 1. Those suits argue that the new abortion law violates Florida’s state constitution, as well as U.S. constitutional protections for freedom of speech and religion.</p>
<p>The suits also claim the law creates “substantial” burdens on individuals’ ability to practice their faith and a “potential” burden on religious leaders to advise their members. Because of the vagueness of the law, Silver said, rabbis or other religious leaders who counsel their clergy members on abortion could face criminal charges.</p>
<p>“It criminalizes the practice of Judaism as well as all the other religions that are not aligned with fundamentalist Christianity, which is pretty much everybody,” Silver said of Florida’s new abortion law.</p>
<p>Silver’s Congregation L&#8217;Dor Va-Dor also filed a separate suit in June in state court that argues the 15-week abortion ban violates the right to privacy guaranteed by the Florida state constitution.</p>
<p>&#8220;For Jews, all life is precious and thus the decision to bring new life into the world is not taken lightly or determined by state fiat,&#8221; according to the lawsuit. &#8220;As such, the act prohibits Jewish women from practicing their faith free of government intrusion and this violates their privacy rights and religious freedom.”</p>

<p>Silver said he still plans to counsel his congregants who need or are considering abortion care, despite Florida’s new law.</p>
<p>“We do the right thing and if they want to come after us, they can make our day, we&#8217;re not going to stop saying what we need to say. We&#8217;re not gonna stop practicing Jewish law,” he said.</p>
<p>A spokesperson with GOP Gov. Ron DeSantis’ office did not answer questions from States Newsroom about whether the newly passed abortion law prevents Jewish people from practicing their faith.</p>
<p>“Governor DeSantis is pro-life, and we believe HB 5 will ultimately withstand all legal challenges,” a spokesperson with DeSantis’ office wrote in an email to States Newsroom, referring to the abortion law. “The struggle for life is not over.”</p>
<p>Congregation L&#8217;Dor Va-Dor’s suit claiming Florida’s constitution has an explicit right to privacy is “fairly straightforward and would generally be unremarkable,” said Caroline Mala Corbin, a law professor at the University of Miami School of Law.</p>
<p>“Under the existing law, it&#8217;s a no-brainer challenge,” Corbin said.</p>
<p>She added that the Florida Supreme Court has interpreted that language to cover abortion.</p>
<p>“Except that, like the U.S. Supreme Court, the Florida Supreme Court has taken a sharp turn to the right, so just as you have the U.S. Supreme Court completely remake abortion law, it’s a possibility the Florida Supreme Court will as well,” she said.</p>
<p>Corbin said the court could rule several ways in the congregation’s case.</p>
<p>“They might argue, ‘We question your sincerity,’ which would be shocking given how deferential they are to other claims of religious liberty,” she said.</p>
<p>The court could also rule that the congregation did not prove Florida’s abortion law created a substantial burden, or that even if the law prevents someone from practicing their religion, “the state has a compelling reason for its law, and therefore, the state must prevail,” she said.</p>
<p>“So the state might respond, &#8216;Even if this does affect your ability to live your religious truth, the state has a compelling interest in saving lives and therefore the state still prevails,&#8217;” Corbin said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Future cases</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Micah Schwartzman, the director of the University of Virginia School of Law’s Karsh Center for Law and Democracy and the Hardy Cross Dillard Professor of Law, said lawsuits brought on behalf of a group of people, like the one from Silver’s congregation in Florida, rather than a particular individual will have more procedural hurdles to prove the group has standing to sue under state and federal law.</p>
<p>“I&#8217;m not terribly confident about these early lawsuits,” Schwartzman said.</p>
<p>He said he expect to see cases similar to the Satanic Temple&#8217;s case in Texas in which the religious organization filed a suit in federal court on behalf of one of its members.</p>
<p>“I think in the future, we&#8217;re going to see cases that are brought on behalf of particular individuals who are burdened by abortion restrictions or prohibitions,” he said. “And those types (of cases) will have a stronger chance of surviving the preliminary stages of litigation.”</p>
<p>Schwartzman said there’s also the question of religious exemptions, particularly in states that have enacted trigger law bans or near-total bans on abortion, and whether those laws impose a burden on people trying to practice their religion.</p>
<p>State abortion laws are going to have some exemptions for abortion, he said, such as in cases of rape and incest and to protect the life and health of the mother.</p>
<p>“And in those circumstances, courts are going to face the question, &#8216;If these laws have certain secular exceptions, why shouldn&#8217;t they also grant exceptions on religious grounds?&#8217;” he said. “And I think that will be the structure of many challenges that we will see in the future.”</p>
<p>Elizabeth Sepper, a religious liberty, health law and equality scholar at the University of Texas School of Law, said that over the last couple of decades the Supreme Court has “reduced the establishment clause to rubble,” which under the First Amendment prohibits the government from establishing a religion.</p>
<p>When Roe v. Wade was initially issued, Congress passed the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits the use of federal funds to cover the cost of abortions, with some limited exceptions.</p>
<p>Sepper said Congress’ decision to pass a restriction related to abortion in the case of the Hyde Amendment is an example of “an establishment of religion because when legislators pass abortion bans that say ‘Well, human beings come into life at the moment of conception,’ that&#8217;s a doctrine — is a theological stance — that&#8217;s rooted in a particular religious faith.”</p>
<p>“I think some large segment of the population on both sides of the abortion issue understands (that) to be the truth, which is that many abortion bans require religious reasoning,” Sepper said.</p>

(Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden announced Wednesday that he will cancel up to $20,000 in federal student loan debt for Pell Grant borrowers and up to $10,000 for all other borrowers with an income of less than $125,000 for an individual and $250,000 for a household.</p>
<p>Biden also announced his administration is extending a pause on student loan repayments until Dec. 31. The decision comes one week before the expiration of a pause on student loan repayments put in place at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>Despite numerous reports in recent weeks that Biden would take action on student loans, the White House had remained silent, but on Wednesday the president tweeted out his decision prior to remarks scheduled for Wednesday afternoon.</p>
<p>“In keeping with my campaign promise, my Administration is announcing a plan to give working and middle class families breathing room as they prepare to resume federal student loan payments in January 2023,” <a href="https://twitter.com/POTUS/status/1562462774969581570" target="_blank">Biden</a> wrote on Twitter.</p>
<p>Following the announcement, the Department of Education said it will release an application in the weeks ahead that will allow millions of borrowers to claim this new relief.</p>
<p>“Student loan debt has hindered their ability to achieve their dreams — including buying a home, starting a business, or providing for their family,” U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona said in a statement. “Getting an education should set us free; not strap us down!”</p>
<p>The cancellation of student debt will only apply to current borrowers, not future ones, and income levels for the 2020 and 2021 tax years will be considered, a senior administration official said during a Wednesday call with reporters.</p>
<p>The Department of Education estimates that about 8 million borrowers will automatically receive relief because the agency already has those borrowers’ income information on file. That means those borrowers do not have to submit applications.</p>
<p>Borrowers who received Pell Grants, who will benefit from the most relief, are among the students who had the lowest household incomes while in college. They will also be subject to the $125,000 and $250,000 income caps.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">New rule on loans</h4>

<p>The Biden administration is also directing the Department of Education to propose a rule to help current and future borrowers with their loan repayments.</p>
<p>The rule would eliminate monthly interest payments on loans, “so that unlike other existing income-driven repayment plans, no borrower&#8217;s loan balance will grow as long as they make their monthly payments — even when that monthly payment is $0 because their income is low,” according to the department <a href="https://studentaid.gov/debt-relief-announcement/" target="_blank">website</a>.</p>
<p>The proposed rule would also forgive loan balances “after 10 years of payments, instead of 20 years, for borrowers with loan balances of $12,000 or less.” It would also require “borrowers to pay no more than 5% of their discretionary income monthly on undergraduate loans.”</p>
<p>“Middle class borrowers struggle with high monthly payments and ballooning balances that make it harder for them to build wealth,” a senior administration official said.</p>
<p>While many Democrats and progressive advocates were pleased with the announcement, it falls short of the student debt relief campaign platform that Biden ran on.</p>
<p><a href="https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/joe-biden-outlines-new-steps-to-ease-economic-burden-on-working-people-e3e121037322" target="_blank">In a Medium post during the 2020 presidential election</a>, Biden said under his administration he would “forgive all undergraduate tuition-related federal student debt from two- and four-year public colleges and universities for debt-holders earning up to $125,000, with appropriate phase-outs to avoid a cliff.”</p>
<p>He also promised he would “immediately cancel a minimum of $10,000 of student debt per person,” but this recent student debt announcement comes two years into his administration and only after continual pressure from congressional Democrats and advocates.</p>
<p>Some congressional Democrats have urged the White House to cancel up to $50,000 worth of student loans, arguing that because <a href="https://studentaid.gov/data-center/student/portfolio" target="_blank">about 92%</a> of that debt is held by the Department of Education, the administration has the authority to cancel those loans through executive action.</p>
<p><a href="https://educationdata.org/how-many-people-have-student-loans" target="_blank">More than 43 million</a> Americans have student loan debt, and the Federal Reserve <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/SLOAS" target="_blank">estimates</a> that the total U.S. student loan debt is more than $1.75 trillion.</p>
<p><a class="c-link" tabindex="-1" href="https://budgetmodel.wharton.upenn.edu/issues/2022/8/23/forgiving-student-loans" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://budgetmodel.wharton.upenn.edu/issues/2022/8/23/forgiving-student-loans" data-sk="tooltip_parent" data-remove-tab-index="true">A Penn Wharton budget model released</a> Tuesday found that a one-time loan forgiveness of $10,000 would mostly benefit borrowers in the four lowest quintiles of incomes.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.marylandmatters.org/2022/07/29/democrats-in-congress-press-biden-to-extend-pause-on-student-loans/" target="_blank">more than 100 Senate and House Democrats urged</a> the Biden administration to extend the pause on repayment of student loans beyond the Aug. 31 deadline due to inflation and the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. They did not suggest another deadline for repayments to begin in their letter to the president.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Democrats praise Biden</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Democrats did welcome the President’s announcement.</p>
<p>“By delivering historic targeted student debt relief to millions of borrowers, more working families will be able to meet their kitchen table needs as they continue to recover from the challenges of the pandemic,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a statement. “Importantly, this action will help those most in need, easing a financial burden disproportionately harming women and people of color.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/28/pelosi-says-biden-doesnt-have-authority-to-cancel-student-debt-.html" target="_blank">She has previously said</a> that the president does not have the authority to cancel student loans and that the process needs to be done through Congress. She did not mention her previous comments in the statement.</p>
<p>Biden also had said earlier, while in the White House, that he would only cancel up to $10,000 in student loan debt, and only if Congress passes legislation to do so. Administration officials did not address the shift in policy.</p>
<p>While the Democrat-controlled House likely could pass legislation canceling some portion of student loan debt, the evenly divided Senate would need all 50 Democrats on board along with an additional 10 Republicans to get a bill to the president’s desk.</p>
<p>House Education and Labor Committee Chairman Bobby Scott, a Virginia Democrat, said that while the student loan cancellation will provide relief for borrowers, it doesn’t solve the “underlying problems that caused the student debt crisis in the first place,” such as high tuition costs.</p>
<p>“Without reversing the chronic underinvestment in higher education that has driven up tuition costs, and without fixing our student loan system that has made student loans more expensive to take out and harder to pay off, students will continue to take on more debt and borrowers will continue to face rising debt levels,” Scott said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Republicans critical</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>GOP lawmakers sharply criticized the cancellation move.</p>
<p>“At a time of skyrocketing inflation, declining wages, and a national recession, Washington has again turned its back on hardworking Americans in Iowa and across this country,” Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds, a Republican, said in a statement. “President Biden isn&#8217;t canceling student debt, he’s shifting the costs to the taxpayer and to those who worked to pay off their loans in full.”</p>
<p>Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, said in a statement the move was a “slap in the face to every family who sacrificed to save for college, every graduate who paid their debt, and every American who chose a certain career path or volunteered to serve in our Armed Forces in order to avoid taking on debt.”</p>
<p>Overall in Kentucky, there are about 600,000 student loan borrowers who <a href="https://studentloanhero.com/featured/kentucky-student-loans-refinance/#kentucky" target="_blank">have an average balance for federal and private student loans of $30,794</a>.</p>
<p>In March 2020, President Donald Trump issued an emergency pause on student loan repayments, which has now been extended several times by both administrations. The pandemic is still ongoing, and the U.S. has surpassed 1 million COVID-19 deaths.</p>

The Senate worked overnight Saturday into Sunday as they moved toward final passage of Senate budget reconciliation deal, which Senate Democrats have named The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. The final vote was 51-50, with the tie-breaking vote being cast by Vice President Kamala Harris. (Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. Senate, along party lines, passed a sweeping energy, health care, climate and tax package Sunday afternoon, following an overnight marathon of votes that resulted in just a handful of notable changes to the legislation.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.democrats.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/inflation_reduction_act_of_2022.pdf" target="_blank">755-page bill</a> was passed after Vice President Kamala Harris broke a 50-50 tie in the evenly divided Senate. It now heads to the House, where Democratic leaders have announced they will take it up on Friday.</p>
<p>“At last, we have arrived,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said.  Democratic senators broke out into applause as Harris announced passage of the bill, expected to total more than $700 billion.</p>
<p>Schumer, a New York Democrat, said he dedicated the measure to young Americans who have pushed and protested for the Senate to take action on climate change.</p>
<p>“This bill will kick-start the era of affordable clean energy in America,” Schumer said. “It&#8217;s a game changer.”</p>
<p>Senate passage marks a major recovery for President Joe Biden’s domestic agenda, after a larger package the White House largely wrote and pushed for the better part of a year could not win the support of centrist Democratic Sens. Joe Manchin III of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, dimming the prospects of enacting health and tax policy changes and major climate spending.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today, Senate Democrats sided with American families over special interests, voting to lower the cost of prescription drugs, health insurance, and everyday energy costs and reduce the deficit, while making the wealthiest corporations finally pay their fair share,” Biden said in a statement. “This bill also makes the largest investment ever in combating the existential crisis of climate change.”</p>
<p>He also urged the House to pass the bill and send it to his desk to sign into law.</p>
<p>Just two amendments during what is called vote-a-rama were added to the bill, known as the Inflation Reduction Act, after Democratic leaders earlier struck agreements needed to get Sinema and Manchin on board. Under budget reconciliation rules, the legislation only needed a simple majority for passage rather than the usual 60-vote threshold.</p>
<p>In the final stretch of voting and at the last minute, the Senate agreed to an amendment by John Thune, Republican of South Dakota, that made a 15% corporate tax included in the bill apply to fewer businesses owned by private equity firms.</p>
<p>The amendment was backed by Sinema, along with six other Democrats — Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff of Georgia, Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, Jacky Rosen and Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada and Mark Kelly of Arizona.</p>
<p>The revenue lost initially was expected to be paid for by extending the cap on the state and local tax deduction. But that would have drawn opposition from lawmakers in high-tax states like New Jersey who want to get rid of the cap. Instead, Democrats found their offset in another tax provision, dealing with limits on writing off business losses.</p>
<p>In another major change Republicans successfully stripped a provision to cap insulin co-pays at $35 in private health insurance plans, citing budget rules. A similar price cap for Medicare remains in the version of the bill the Senate approved.</p>
<p>The price cap has been a priority for Warnock and likely will become a prime campaign issue for Democrats to use against Republicans who voted to remove it. Similarly, Republicans will try to use many of the amendment votes in the vote-a-rama against Democrats as the midterm campaign heats up.</p>
<p>Seven Republicans did vote with Democrats on the insulin amendment: Bill Cassidy and John Kennedy of Louisiana, Susan Collins of Maine, Josh Hawley of Missouri, Cindy Hyde-Smith of Mississippi and Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan of Alaska.</p>
<p><b>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Progressive changes thwarted</h4>

	 </b></p>
<p>The bill would <a href="https://dailymontanan.com/2022/07/30/climate-spending-in-new-reconciliation-deal-a-turning-point-for-the-u-s-supporters-say/" target="_blank">spend nearly $370 billion on clean energy programs</a>, allow the Medicare health insurance program to negotiate some drug prices beginning in 2026, impose stiffer corporate taxes and bolster Internal Revenue Service enforcement to bring in more than $400 billion in new revenue over 10 years.</p>
<p>Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont pushed an expansion of the child tax care credit and other progressive changes to the legislation, but was defeated repeatedly as Democratic leaders argued the bill needed to remain intact in order to secure those two votes from Manchin and Sinema.</p>
<p>The amendment on the child tax care credit, which expired in December, was shot down, in a vote of 1-97.</p>
<p>Last year Democrats tried to include in an earlier version of their reconciliation bill a <a href="https://kansasreflector.com/2021/12/16/bidens-big-social-spending-bill-caught-in-snags-in-the-senate/" target="_blank">10-year expansion of the program</a>, which would have <a href="https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/publication/104743/expanding-the-child-tax-credit-could-lift-millions-of-children-out-of-poverty_0.pdf" target="_blank">lifted millions of children out of poverty</a>, but Manchin objected to it, arguing the price tag of the provision — in the Build Back Better bill — was too big.</p>
<p>Sen. Sherrod Brown, an Ohio Democrat, said that Democrats will continue to work on an expansion of the child tax credit and noted the “fragile arrangement” of the bill.</p>
<p>Another unsuccessful Democratic amendment came from Warnock, who wanted a provision included in the bill to end a gap in Medicaid coverage for low-income people in his state and others, calling it a “moral moment” for senators.</p>
<p>&#8220;I rise on behalf of nearly 4.5 million Americans in 12 states, including 646,000 Georgians, who a decade after the Affordable Care Act became law, still do not have access to affordable health care. They are the working poor,” Warnock said. “They are being blocked by governors and legislatures.”</p>
<p>But Warnock’s attempt was voted down, after Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden of Oregon said he “tragically” had to oppose it to preserve the substance of the bill. Four other senators voted with Warnock: Collins, Ossoff, Sanders and Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Energy tradeoff</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Sanders also inveighed against the bill’s provisions to expand oil and gas development, despite its billions for cleaner energy sources like wind and solar, which Schumer called “the boldest climate package in U.S. history.”</p>
<p>“The bad news is this bill, as currently written, includes a huge giveaway to the fossil fuel industry,” Sanders said on the Senate floor.</p>
<p>He proposed an amendment that he said would lift out the sections of the bill related to oil and gas leasing, but it failed 1-99.</p>
<p>Sanders’ criticisms of the bill’s climate sections echoed those of the most aggressive environmental advocacy groups, who see the deal between Manchin and Schumer as not strong enough.</p>
<p>The Manchin-Schumer agreement, which formed the basis of the budget package, would require the Interior Department to make 2 million acres of federal land and 60 million acres of federal waters available for oil and gas leasing for the next decade as a condition of leasing other federal lands and waters for solar or wind development.</p>
<p>It’s a move that Brett Hartl, government affairs director at the Center for Biological Diversity, <a href="https://biologicaldiversity.org/w/news/press-releases/manchin-poison-pills-buried-in-inflation-reduction-act-will-destroy-a-livable-climate-2022-07-28/" target="_blank">called</a> “a climate suicide pact.”</p>
<p>Legal and policy debates about furthering oil and gas development in the midst of global climate change have raged since Biden took office and partially stymied an ambitious agenda that began with Biden promising to ban new oil and gas leases on federal lands and waters.</p>
<p>A Louisiana federal judge in <a href="https://lailluminator.com/2021/06/16/federal-judge-halts-biden-pause-on-new-oil-and-gas-leases-across-the-u-s/" target="_blank">a June 2021 decision</a> reversed Biden’s January 2021 executive order to pause new oil and gas lease sales, saying federal law required periodic sales.</p>
<p>But in January 2022, a <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/01/28/1076281662/federal-judge-canceled-gulf-oil-and-gas-leases-climate-change" target="_blank">federal judge blocked drilling in 80 million acres</a> of waters in the Gulf of Mexico, ruling that the Biden administration did not take into consideration the effect greenhouse gas emissions from the lease would have on the planet.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Immigration policy</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Senate Democrats also voted down an amendment from Sen. James Lankford, an Oklahoma Republican, that would have extended Title 42, a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention health policy that allows border patrol officials to turn migrants away at the border during a health crisis, such as the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>If passed, his amendment would have taken $1 million out of the Affordable Care Act in order to keep Title 42 in place. In a 50-50 party-line vote, the amendment was rejected.</p>
<p>Sen. Jon Tester, Democrat of Montana, also introduced an immigration-related <a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_votes/vote1172/vote_117_2_00295.htm" target="_blank">amendment</a> that would have required a comprehensive plan to be put in place before Title 42 is lifted.</p>
<p>Six Democrats voted with all Republicans in favor of the amendment, which fell four votes short of the 60-vote threshold.</p>
<p>Those five vulnerable Democrats, in addition to Tester, included Cortez Masto, Hassan, Warnock, Kelly and Sinema.</p>
<p>Sen. Bob Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, warned late Saturday that he would vote against the bill if any anti-immigration policies were included in the final package.</p>
<p>“I will not only vote no on any immigration amendment introduced, but I will vote no on the final bill if any harmful immigration amendments are adopted,” he said in a statement.</p>
<p>“It has always been my north star to pass a pathway to citizenship for the 11 million undocumented immigrants that call our country home, secure our borders, and fix our broken immigration system, but the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 is not the right legislative vehicle to address these deeply needed reforms to our immigration system.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Taxes, IRS boost</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>In order for Schumer to secure a vote from Sinema, <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/senate-democrats-reach-deal-sinema-big-climate-health-and-tax-deal" target="_blank">he struck an agreement</a> with her to remove from the bill a provision that would have changed the way certain compensation that hedge-fund managers and private equity executives are paid, known as carried interest, is taxed.</p>
<p>Schumer said that Sinema refused to vote with Democrats, “unless we took it out.”</p>
<p>The Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan entity, found that if that provision had stayed in, it could have raised $14 billion in revenue over 10 years.</p>
<p>The Schumer-Sinema agreement would also change a separate provision setting a new 15% minimum tax rate on corporations with $1 billion or more in income.</p>
<p>The bill would give the IRS a total of $<a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IN/IN11977" target="_blank">79.4 billion in funding</a>. Of those funds, $46.5 billion would be given to add 87,000 new IRS jobs to help with tax enforcement and update technologies to enforce taxes on digital assets such as cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>The IRS would also get $25.3 billion for operations support, and $3.2 billion would go toward taxpayer services such as education and filing services. The agency would also get $4.8 billion to update its business systems.</p>
<p>Many Republicans objected to this, including Collins, who added an amendment to prohibit the hiring of 87,000 IRS jobs unless those workers were back in the office and not working remotely.</p>
<p>“Due in large part to lax telework policies, however, the IRS has consistently failed to provide taxpayers with the service they should expect,” Collins said in a statement.  “As a result, tax refunds have been unacceptably delayed, and four out of five phone calls from taxpayers go unanswered.</p>

(Photo Courtesy of the CDC/Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON —  U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra announced Thursday a public health emergency for the monkeypox virus, a declaration that allows the federal government to more quickly assist states with distributing vaccines and conducting testing and public health campaigns.</p>
<p>“We&#8217;re prepared to take our response to the next level in addressing this virus, and we urge every American to take monkeypox seriously and to take responsibility to help us tackle this,” Becerra said during a call with reporters.</p>
<p>More than 6,600 monkeypox cases have been reported in the United States, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/response/2022/us-map.html" target="_blank">according to the latest Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data.</a> The hardest-hit states are New York, California, Illinois, Florida, Georgia and Texas.</p>
<p>There have been no reported deaths to date, but symptoms can last for weeks and can include muscle aches, a painful rash, respiratory symptoms and chills, among other things. The virus is most often spread through direct contact, including personal, skin-to-skin contact.</p>
<p>New York, California and Illinois within the last week have declared a state of emergency due to the virus. But in Florida, <a href="https://floridaphoenix.com/2022/08/03/desantis-scorns-idea-of-monkeypox-emergency-sees-other-states-declarations-as-power-plays/" target="_blank">Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis shut down the idea of declaring a state of emergency</a> for the Sunshine State, even as cases there have climbed to 525, the Florida Phoenix reported.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization has given <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/07/1123262" target="_blank">its highest alert leve</a>l to monkeypox, declaring it a public health emergency of international concern.</p>
<p>Becerra said President Joe Biden&#8217;s administration has delivered more than 600,000 vaccines by partnering with local, state and tribal governments.</p>
<p>States are limited in their access to the vaccine, which requires a two-dose regime, because the federal government <a href="https://www.wsj.com/podcasts/the-journal/the-company-behind-the-world-only-monkeypox-vaccine/b07cb9b3-9835-429f-b869-54e86b3e87ca?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axioslocal_dc&amp;stream=top" target="_blank">can only purchase it from one company in Denmark</a>.</p>
<p>Becerra said the administration has the capacity to administer 80,000 tests per week, and for those who need treatment,  there are 14,000 treatments of an antiviral called tecovirimat, or TPOXX, “that has been shown to help those who have monkeypox.”</p>
<p>HHS in mid-July announced it had purchased another 2.5 million doses of Bavarian Nordic’s JYNNEOS vaccine to respond to the monkeypox outbreak.</p>
<p>Biden administration officials on the call included Robert Fenton, the White House national monkeypox response coordinator; Demetre Daskalakis, the White House national monkeypox response deputy coordinator; Rochelle Walensky, CDC director; Robert Califf, Food and Drug Administration commissioner; and Dawn O’Connell, assistant secretary for preparedness and response at HHS.</p>
<p>Fenton said across the federal government, it’s an “all hands on deck response.”</p>
<p>“We are going to apply lessons learned from the battles we’ve fought, whether it be from the wildfires to COVID responses or to measles,” Fenton said.</p>
<p>“We plan to be responsive leaders, focusing on tackling this and today, the actions we are announcing will allow us … to explore additional strategies to get vaccines and will allow us to get more data from jurisdictions, so we can effectively track and attack this outbreak,&#8221; he continued.</p>
<p>Daskalakis, who helped lead the response to New York City’s measles outbreak and has led HIV and STD health prevention programs, said that the administration is engaging “with the LGBTQI+ community where we saw this virus spreading with the goal of sharing the critical information around the symptoms of monkeypox and best practices to stop its spread.”</p>
<p>“While we know that monkeypox is not exclusively a sexually transmitted virus, we also recognized early on that this virus is spreading more rapidly and differently than you&#8217;ve seen in prior outbreaks,” Daskalakis said. “I think that from the LGBTQ perspective, this is a very clear statement of the value of the lives of people who are in the LGBTQ community.”</p>
<p><a href="https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2022/08/01/congress-mostly-silent-as-states-struggle-to-contain-monkeypox/" target="_blank">Congress has also been slow</a> to hold any hearings or give much attention to monkeypox, which is predominantly affecting the LGBTQ community but can be spread by anyone who is infected.</p>
<p>Following the announcement from HHS, Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney, chairwoman of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, praised the decision, adding that she sent a letter to Becerra in late July urging him to declare a public health emergency.</p>
<p>“This critical step will allow the Biden administration to build on the progress it has already made to expand the availability of vaccines, testing, and treatment nationwide,” she said in a statement, adding that she will “continue to push the administration to use every tool at its disposal to mitigate the threat monkeypox poses to our nation’s public health and ensure testing, vaccines, and treatment are available to those who need it.”</p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>WASHINGTON — U.S. House Education and Labor Committee Chairman Bobby Scott of Virginia has filed a <a href="https://edlabor.house.gov/imo/media/doc/unc_affirmative_action_amicus_brief.pdf" target="_blank">brief</a> along with 64 other House Democrats urging the Supreme Court to uphold <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/03/31/upcoming-u-s-supreme-court-cases-could-curb-colleges-use-of-affirmative-action/" target="_blank">the role that race plays in college admission policies</a> at Harvard University and the University of North Carolina.</p>
<p>“Narrowly tailored admissions policies that recognize race as one criterion — out of many criteria for evaluating prospective students — are a key tool to realize diverse learning environments and address continued educational inequity,” Scott said in a statement issued Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court originally combined the two cases that challenged affirmative action but then separated them — likely because the newest justice, Ketanji Brown Jackson, said she would recuse herself from the Harvard case because she previously held a six-year term on Harvard’s board of overseers. Legal experts have said the court&#8217;s decision could reshape the use of affirmative action in higher education.</p>
<p>The cases are <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/20/20-1199/169941/20210225095525027_Harvard%20Cert%20Petn%20Feb%2025.pdf" target="_blank">Students for Fair Admissions Inc. v. President &amp; Fellows of Harvard College</a> and <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/21/21-707/199684/20211111164129792_UNC%20Cert%20Petition%20-%20Nov%2011%20-%20330pm%20002.pdf" target="_blank">Students for Fair Admissions v. University of North Carolina.</a></p>
<p>Both ask the court to overturn a 2003 decision in <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2002/02-241" target="_blank">Grutter v. Bollinger</a> that upheld the University of Michigan’s practice of considering race in its undergraduate admissions process to achieve a diverse student body.</p>
<p>The Harvard case also questions whether the university is violating the Civil Rights Act by placing a cap on its admittance of Asian American students, which the plaintiff argue discriminates against those students.</p>
<p>“These admissions policies are critical for achieving the promise of equal educational opportunity that remains unfulfilled more than 65 years after the Supreme Court’s historic decision in Brown v. Board of Education,” Scott said.</p>
<p>House Democrats in their brief argue that race-conscious admissions policies are still needed “given the continued underrepresentation of African Americans, Latinos/Hispanics, and many Asian Americans in colleges and universities across the country.”</p>
<p>“Even with the use of a race-conscious admissions program, the University of North Carolina (UNC) ‘continues to face challenges admitting and enrolling underrepresented minorities, particularly African American males, Hispanics, and Native Americans,’” they wrote.</p>
<p>Virginia Rep. Donald McEachin also signed onto the brief. The Supreme Court will hear the cases in the fall.</p>

<p>With the <a href="https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2022410" target="_blank">217-213 vote</a><b>,</b> the bill, <a href="https://www.congress.gov/117/bills/hr1808/BILLS-117hr1808rh.pdf" target="_blank">H.R. 1808</a>, will head to the evenly divided Senate, but it’s unlikely to advance there, as it would need all Democrats on board plus 10 Republicans to get past a filibuster. Sen. Chuck Schumer, the Senate majority leader, has not announced if he plans to bring the weapons ban to the floor for a vote.</p>
<p>“Each year, more children die from gun violence than any other cause,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on the House floor. “Our nation has watched unspeakable horror as assault weapons have been used in massacre after massacre.”</p>
<p>All but five Democrats backed the ban. Only two Republicans voted in favor: Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania and Chris Jacobs of New York.</p>
<p>The five Democrats that split with their party and opposed the ban were Reps. Jared Golden of Maine, Kurt Schrader of Oregon, Ron Kind of Wisconsin and Henry Cuellar and Vicente Gonzalez of Texas.</p>
<p>The push for banning semi-automatic firearms came after they were used in mass shootings  in Uvalde, Texas, where 19 children and two teachers were murdered, and in Buffalo, New York, where a white supremacist murdered 10 Black people at a grocery store. A semi-automatic weapon also was used in a July Fourth shooting in Highland Park, Illinois, where seven people were killed.</p>
<p>The sponsor of the bill, Rep. David Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat, said that movie theaters, places of worship, schools, hospitals and grocery stores have become “bloody battlefield scenes.”</p>
<p>“These weapons have no place in our communities,” he said. “There are more mass shootings than days in the year. This is a uniquely American problem.”</p>
<p>This year alone, there have been 372 mass shootings, according to the <a href="https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/" target="_blank">Gun Violence Archive</a>.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Police funding bills</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The assault weapons ban was originally set to be passed alongside several bills that would provide funding for local police departments, but progressive Democrats raised concerns and pushed for more accountability measures in the police legislation.</p>
<p>“I have heard from the civil rights community, and I have strong concerns with two policing bills we may consider this week,” Rep. Andy Levin, a Michigan Democrat, <a href="https://twitter.com/repandylevin/status/1552062991968993281?s=10&amp;t=UyfZBU7X31bhbCQdRRCT5g" target="_blank">wrote</a> on Twitter. “We should not advance them unless they include robust accountability &amp; oversight provisions in line with those in the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act.”</p>
<p>Rep. Josh Gottheimer, a New Jersey Democrat, is the lead sponsor of <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/BILLS-117hr6448ih/pdf/BILLS-117hr6448ih.pdf" target="_blank">a bill</a> that would authorize a $50 million grant each year for a Justice Department program to assist small local police departments. Another <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/BILLS-117hr6375ih/pdf/BILLS-117hr6375ih.pdf" target="_blank">bill</a> would reauthorize a grant program to hire and increase the pay of local police.</p>
<p>Rep. Val Demings, a Florida Democrat and former Orlando police chief who is running for Republican Sen. Marco Rubio’s Senate seat, sponsored <a href="https://rules.house.gov/sites/democrats.rules.house.gov/files/BILLS-117HR5768RH.pdf" target="_blank">a bill</a> to provide $100 million per year in grants to help police agencies solve violent crimes.</p>
<p>The initiatives come as Democratic leadership has tried to <a href="https://coloradonewsline.com/2022/07/27/defund-the-police-violence-senate/" target="_blank">push back</a> on being seen as a party that wants to “defund the police,” a slogan many members have disavowed, as well as Biden. Republicans have been branding Democrats as not supportive enough of police in advance of the midterm elections.</p>
<p>During a weekly press conference Friday, Pelosi, speaking to the concerns of progressives, said the police bill was not “funding without accountability.” On the House floor, she said that after the August recess, Democrats will pass the police and public safety set of bills.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Weapons ban</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The U.S. House Judiciary Committee <a href="https://sourcenm.com/2022/07/22/u-s-house-panel-advances-assault-weapons-ban-on-party-line-vote/" target="_blank">passed</a> the weapons ban last week on a party-line vote.</p>
<p>The bill bans all semi-automatic rifles that can have a detachable magazine and have a military feature such as a pistol grip, and a detachable stock or grenade launcher, among other features. It also <a href="https://cicilline.house.gov/press-release/house-judiciary-committee-advances-assault-weapons-ban-for-first-time-in-decades" target="_blank">bans</a> “all semi-automatic rifles that have a fixed magazine with the capacity to accept more than 10 rounds.”</p>
<p>The bill, if enacted into law, would not ban current semi-automatic weapons that people own, meaning current firearm owners would have their weapons grandfathered in.</p>
<p>House Republicans opposing the bill argued it would take away semi-automatic weapons from current owners, but Democrats said that is not correct because they would be covered under the grandfather clause.</p>
<p>During debate on the House floor, Rep. Guy Reschenthaler, a Pennsylvania Republican, said the bill was unconstitutional, calling it a “gun grab.”</p>
<p>“Law abiding Americans use firearms every day,” he said.</p>
<p>Rep. Deborah Ross, a North Carolina Democrat, denied that people would lose their guns.</p>
<p>“It simply prevents future sales of assault rifles,” she said, adding that the weapons are “not designed for recreation, they’re designed for combat.”</p>
<p>Rep. Jim Jordan, an Ohio Republican, also accused Democrats of “coming for your guns.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">White House support</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The White House <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/SAP-HR-1808.pdf" target="_blank">issued</a> a statement on Friday in support of the bill.</p>
<p>“40,000 Americans die from gunshot wounds every year and guns have become the top killer of children in the United States,” according to the statement. “As President Biden has repeatedly called for, we must do more to stop this gun violence and save lives.”</p>
<p>House Democrats have held numerous hearings about gun violence in America, most recently this week when the House Oversight and Reform Committee investigated the profits that gun manufacturers made off semi-automatic weapons. CEOs from two gun manufacturers stated at the <a href="https://idahocapitalsun.com/2022/07/27/gun-company-ceos-tell-congress-theyre-not-to-blame-for-mass-shootings/" target="_blank">hearing</a> that they played no role in mass shootings that used their products.</p>
<p>The House passage of the bill follows another gun-related bill that <a href="https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2022/06/27/congress-sends-biden-historic-gun-safety-legislation-with-gop-support/" target="_blank">Biden signed into law</a> in late June following the mass shootings in Texas and New York. That bill, the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, consists of eight provisions, including $750 million for states to enact red flag laws that allow the courts to temporarily remove a firearm from an individual who is a threat to themselves or others; a historic $11 billion in mental health services for schools and families; and a requirement that firearm purchasers under 21 undergo a background check that reviews juvenile and mental health records, among other things.</p>
<p>When Biden was a member of the Senate, he backed a 10-year ban on assault weapons that was passed in 1994, but it lapsed a decade later and Congress never renewed it.</p>
<p><a href="https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2022/06/15/did-the-assault-weapons-ban-of-1994-bring-down-mass-shootings-heres-what-the-data-tells-us/" target="_blank">Research from a group of injury epidemiologists and trauma surgeons has shown</a> that between 2004 and 2017, &#8220;the average number of yearly deaths attributed to mass shootings was 25, compared with 5.3 during the 10-year tenure of the ban and 7.2 in the years leading up to the prohibition on assault weapons.”</p>

(Parker Michels-Boyce/ for the Virginia Mercury)</p><p>WASHINGTON —  Legal experts on Thursday warned lawmakers on the U.S. House Administration Committee that if the U.S. Supreme Court upholds a North Carolina case that embraces a fringe election theory, it will undermine future elections across the country.</p>
<p>“To be blunt, it would be extraordinarily destabilizing,” said Carolyn Shapiro, a law professor at the Chicago-Kent College of Law.</p>
<p>The committee held the hearing in response to concerns that the Supreme Court could uphold the so-called state legislature theory, which argues that the Constitution gives legislatures the ability to regulate federal elections without oversight from state courts.</p>
<p>Conservative activists have pushed the theory, most notably after the 2020 presidential election, when then-President Donald Trump used it to try to overturn election results, said Eliza Sweren-Becker of the Brennan Center for Justice, a liberal nonprofit law and public policy institute.</p>
<p>If the Supreme Court embraces the theory, she said state legislatures could approve partisan gerrymandering, remove constraints on voter suppression tactics and enact different policies for state and federal elections, causing chaos for voters.</p>
<p>Sweren-Becker said that if the Supreme Court upholds the case, the consequences will stretch beyond North Carolina and “wreak havoc on elections nationwide.”</p>
<p>“All this would undermine the public’s already wavering faith in our democracy,” Sweren-Becker said.</p>
<p>She said that federal law would prohibit state legislatures from overturning the results of an election, and that the claim is “not a license to coup.”</p>
<p>“But the notion would open the door to anti-democratic shenanigans and even failed efforts to manipulate our elections, erode trust and ultimately participation in our democracy,” she said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">North Carolina maps</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The court will hear the case, <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/docket/docketfiles/html/public/21-1271.html" target="_blank">Moore v. Harper</a>, next term. The case is about the newly drawn maps for North Carolina’s 14 congressional seats. The North Carolina Supreme Court found the maps violated the state&#8217;s constitution because of gerrymandering.</p>
<p>State Republicans argue that the U.S. Constitution’s elections clause gives state legislatures the ability to define congressional districts without the checks and balances of state constitutions or courts.</p>
<p>The ranking member on the U.S. House panel, Rep. Rodney Davis, an Illinois Republican<b>, </b>said that it was a complicated theory and accused Democrats of “suggesting this theory is all a grand plan by Republicans to steal the (2024) election” and of “us(ing) this theory as a ‘doomsday type scenario’ to fundraise.”</p>
<p>Rep. Barry Loudermilk, a Georgia Republican, said there are still restraints on state legislatures and that he believed they should not be allowed to overrule their own constitutions.</p>
<p>“I don’t want us to jump to conclusions that the Supreme Court would embrace an extreme version of this,” he said.</p>
<p>Rep. G.K. Butterfield, a North Carolina Democrat, asked New York University constitutional law professor Richard Pildes if lawmakers were overreacting in their concern about the Supreme Court upholding the North Carolina case.</p>
<p>If the Supreme Court upheld parts of the theory, it “would have extremely destabilizing consequences,” Pildes said. “Most of them would have significantly destabilizing consequences, and there are a lot of legal uncertainties that would be unleashed under any version of this doctrine.”</p>
<p>Rep. Bryan Steil, a Wisconsin Republican, asked Sweren-Becker if voters provide a type of checks and balances on state legislatures.</p>
<p>“Yes, absolutely,” she said. “And that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s so concerning that this notion could remove the power of voters to enact laws through direct democracy.”</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WASHINGTON — The CEOs of major gun manufacturing companies told a U.S. House panel on Wednesday that their production of AR-15-style guns did not contribute to recent mass shootings that left 29 people dead, and that the killings were due to the actions of individual shooters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ahead of the hearing, the House Oversight &amp; Reform Committee </span><a href="https://oversight.house.gov/sites/democrats.oversight.house.gov/files/2022.07.27%20Supplemental%20MEMO%20for%20the%207-27-2022%20FC%20Gun%20Manufacturer%20Hearing.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">released a report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> showing that five major gun manufacturers made $1 billion in sales from semiautomatic weapon sales over the last decade and sales “skyrocketed” in 2021. A Georgia company, Daniel Defense, saw its revenue from AR-15-style rifles triple from $40 million in 2019 to $120 million in 2021, the report found.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AR-15-style weapons were used in mass shootings earlier this year in Uvalde, Texas, where 19 children and two teachers were killed, and in Buffalo, New York, where a white supremacist targeted a grocery store in a predominantly Black neighborhood and killed 10 Black people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In short, the gun industry is profiting off the blood of innocent Americans,” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the chair of the committee, Rep. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carolyn B. Maloney, a New York Democrat, said in a statement ahead of the hearing, which was held to investigate the manufacturers&#8217; role in gun violence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the July 4 mass shooting in Highland Park, Illinois, that left seven dead, Maloney said the committee is also examining how these companies market AR-15-style weapons to civilians. So far, there have been 371 mass shootings this year, according to the </span><a href="https://www.gunviolencearchive.org" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gun Violence Archive. </span></a></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The committee report found that those companies used “disturbing sales tactics — including marketing deadly weapons as a way for young men to prove their manliness and selling guns to mass shooters on credit — while failing to take even basic steps to monitor the violence and destruction their products have unleashed.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maloney asked two CEOs of gun companies, Marty Daniel of Daniel Defense, LLC, and Christopher Killoy, president and chief executive officer of Sturm, Ruger &amp; Company, Inc., in Connecticut, “How </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">many more American children need to die before your company will stop selling assault weapons?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I believe that these murders are local problems that have to be solved locally,” Daniel said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The weapon used in the Uvalde school shooting and a Las Vegas shooting that left 60 dead was from Daniel Defense, which made $528 million from 2012 to 2021 from AR-15-style rifle sales, according to the committee’s report. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Killoy said that the firearm “is an inanimate object,” and that the firearm is meant to be used as a sporting weapon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maloney said that because gun manufacturers are not going to stop selling assault weapons, Congress will need to take action.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You market weapons of war,” she said to the gun manufacturers. “When someone pulls the trigger, you refuse to accept responsibility.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Democrats are moving to pass a ban on the assault rifles. The House Judiciary Committee passed the bill out of its committee last week on a party-line vote, but a floor vote likely won’t occur until lawmakers return from their August recess, and could be close. </span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">One CEO missing</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is one of several hearings the committee has held on gun violence in America. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nearly all the leaders of the gun manufacturers that the committee requested to testify before them agreed. The only one who did not appear before the committee was Mark P. Smith, the president and CEO of Smith &amp; Wesson Brands, Inc.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans on the committee pushed back against Democrats and argued that the Second Amendment allowed for Americans to have these firearms and that gun manufacturers are not to blame for gun violence. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Gun manufacturers do not cause violent crime — criminals cause violent crime,” the ranking member, Rep. James Comer, a Kentucky Republican, said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GOP members Jim Jordan of Ohio and Clay Higgins of Louisiana inaccurately said that Democrats are trying to take away guns from gun owners. The assault weapons bill that Democrats are trying to pass would grandfather in semiautomatic weapons that gun owners already have.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rep. Byron Donalds, a Florida Republican, said that Congress should not quickly pass laws based on tragedies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In my view, we do not have the ability to just simply pass laws because of tragedy or because of heartache,” he said. “Those tragedies do not change the Second Amendment to the United States.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rep. Jody Hice, a Georgia Republican, said that he was disturbed that Democrats were going after private companies and slammed the hearing, saying it was for “political purposes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is like blaming manufacturers of forks and spoons for obesity,” he said. “The American people have the right to own guns.”</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Gun advertisements</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats raised concerns about how gun manufacturers advertise their AR-15s, particularly advertisements that target young men, drawing parallels between owning an AR-15 and being a solider. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rep. Gerald Connolly, a Virginia Democrat, pulled up an advertisement from </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Daniel Defense</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that showed a soldier with an AR-15 and the slogan “Use what they use.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It would seem to imply that you are encouraging people to purchase military weapons and ‘Use what they use,’” he said to Daniel.  “Is that your intent?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Daniel said that the company sells products to the military “and we market products to civilians based off of our military heritage that we provide the best products that can be bought.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the witnesses, Ryan Busse, a senior adviser at the Giffords Law Center, a gun control advocacy and research center, said that marketing to young men has been a tactic the gun industry has implemented in the last decade. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Giffords Law Center is a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">gun violence prevention organization founded by former U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords after the Arizona Democrat was shot and survived an assassination attempt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Busse said he used to work in the gun industry as an executive, but was pushed out because “there is no place in the industry for anyone who believes in moderation or responsible regulation.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“By 2007, change was happening as most companies began combining guns with the political fear and conspiracy machine of the NRA,” he said in his statement. “It worked very well because the same things that drove NRA radicalization, also drove gun sales.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Busse said that the advertisements that gun manufacturers run are irresponsible and warned lawmakers “that there is much more of this on the way.”</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Marketing to young men</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another witness, Kelly Sampson, senior counsel and director of racial justice at  Brady: United Against Gun Violence, a gun conrol group, said that manufacturers rely on militaristic tropes to market firearms to young men, particularly “those who would oppose the government.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She added that these marketing tactics, also put vulnerable communities at risk, and “such marketing rests on a foundation of longstanding biases (about) Black and Brown people.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These dangerous ads must stop,” Rep. Rashida Tlaib, a Michigan Democrat, said to the gun CEOs. “They’re breeding domestic extremists and putting communities of color, communities that are incredibly vulnerable – especially like children in our schools and minority groups … at risk.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report from the committee also found that the firearm industry has been marketing indirectly and directly to white supremacist groups, “playing on fears of government repression against gun owners and fomenting racial tensions.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The increase in racially motivated violence has also led to rising rates of gun ownership among Black Americans, allowing the industry to profit from both white supremacists and their targets,” according to the report. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report also detailed an ad from a 2017 Daniel Defense inventory catalog that shows an image of a shooter with a tattoo of a Norse symbol known as the Valknot. This symbol is associated with transnational white supremacist groups and is deemed a hate symbol by the Anti-Defamation League, which is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">an international Jewish non-governmental organization that specializes in civil rights law. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a New York Democrat, asked Daniel if he was aware that his company’s advertising department uses symbols associated with white supremacists. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No, I don’t think we do,” Daniel said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Busse said that when he was in the industry, he felt that many gun manufacturers “turned a blind eye” to marketing that attracted white supremacists. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There is an aura and approach in the industry where any single gun customer is good, no matter how detestable their views or their actions may be, and I saw dozens of examples through my career of the acceptance of or looking away from racist things,” he said.   </span></p>

(Official White House Photo by Cameron Smith)</p><p>WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden has tested positive for COVID-19 and is experiencing mild symptoms, the White House announced Thursday morning.</p>
<p>Biden, 79, is fully vaccinated against the virus and has twice received booster doses, according to the statement. He is taking Paxlovid, an antiviral prescription medication that is meant to reduce the severity of symptoms and the duration of illness.</p>
<p>“Consistent with CDC guidelines, he will isolate at the White House and will continue to carry out all of his duties fully during that time,” press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/07/21/statement-from-press-secretary-karine-jean-pierre/" target="_blank">in the statement.</a></p>
<p>“He has been in contact with members of the White House staff by phone this morning, and will participate in his planned meetings at the White House this morning via phone and Zoom from the residence,” she continued.</p>
<p>The White House plans to provide daily updates on Biden’s condition. He will return to work in person when he tests negative.</p>
<p>He tested negative for COVID-19 on Tuesday, the White House said.</p>
<p>Vice President Kamala Harris, who was last with Biden Tuesday, has tested negative, according to a White House official. The White House did not specify when that test was conducted.</p>
<p>Harris is meeting with North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, Thursday, and will later meet with North Carolina state legislators to hold a roundtable discussion about reproductive rights, according to the White House.</p>
<p>Harris spoke with Biden by phone Thursday morning and plans to continue her schedule as planned, according to the official.</p>
<p>“The vice president will remain masked following the advice of the White House medical team,” the official said.</p>
<p>Biden was in Massachusetts on Wednesday to <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/biden-lays-out-new-funds-localities-climate-no-national-emergency-yet" target="_blank">announce action </a>on climate change. Several of Biden’s top staffers traveled with him on Marine One, the helicopter that transports the president and aides from the White House to Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland, where Air Force One takes off and lands.</p>
<p>Those aides included Bruce Reed, deputy chief of staff; Gina McCarthy, national climate adviser; Annie Tomasini, director of Oval Office operations; Jean-Pierre; and Stephen Goepfert, special assistant and personal aide to the president.</p>
<p>U.S. Sens. Ed Markey and Elizabeth Warren as well as U.S. Reps. Jake Auchincloss and Bill Keating, all of Massachusetts, traveled with Biden from Andrews to the outdoor event in Somerset.</p>
<p>White House staff traveling on Air Force One included Vinay Reddy, director of speech writing; Curtis Reid, senior director for multilateral affairs;  and Travis Dredd, trip director.</p>
<p>Biden is also coming off an international trip from last week, along with his first one to the Middle East, where from June 9-16 he traveled to the United Kingdom, Brussels, Geneva, Israel, the West Bank and then Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>During that trip, he met with former British Prime Minister Boris Johnson while he attended the G7 summit. He had another meeting with the president of Turkey, Tayyip Erdogan, and Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p>
<p>Biden also met with Saudi Arabia’s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, who ordered the killing of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi.</p>
<p>He was scheduled to travel to Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, on Thursday to give a speech at the Marts Center at Wilkes University about the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, which is the president’s funding request to Congress to help fund programs aimed at reducing gun violence.</p>
<p>Later on, the president was scheduled to travel to Philadelphia to “participate in a fundraising reception for the Democratic National Committee,” according to the White House’s schedule.</p>
<p>After his visit, he was scheduled to go back to his home in Wilmington, Delaware, for the weekend.</p>
<p>It’s unclear if the president will still be able to attend an event scheduled in Orlando and Tampa, Florida, on Monday. Biden was scheduled to give a speech at the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives Annual Conference in Orlando and another speech at a DNC rally in Tampa.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/quarantine-isolation.html" target="_blank">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> suggests that someone who tests positive for COVID-19 should stay home for at least five days and isolate from others. The CDC advises against all travel.</p>

(Ariana Figueroa/States Newsroom)</p><p>WASHINGTON — A group of U.S. House Democrats Monday called for the passage of legislation that would add four justices to the Supreme Court, following the <a href="https://idahocapitalsun.com/2022/06/24/u-s-supreme-court-overturns-right-to-abortion-in-landmark-decision/" target="_blank">overturning</a> of the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that provided the constitutional right to abortion.</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s an ultra-right-wing Republican Supreme Court,” Rep. Hank Johnson of Georgia said during a press conference outside the Capitol. “It is a Supreme Court where basic freedoms are under assault.”</p>
<p>The bill, <a href="https://www.congress.gov/117/bills/hr2584/BILLS-117hr2584ih.pdf" target="_blank">H.R. 2584</a>, introduced by Johnson, would expand the court from nine to 13 seats. The court’s current ideological makeup is six to three in favor of conservative-leaning justices.</p>
<p>Johnson’s legislation has 58 co-sponsors, all Democrats. They include <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/2584/cosponsors?q=%7B%22cosponsor-state%22%3A%22Virginia%22%7D" target="_blank">two Virginia congressmen:</a> U.S. Reps. Don Beyer, D-Alexandria, and Gerry Connolly, D-Fairfax. However, if passed by the House, the measure would be dead on arrival in the 50-50 Senate, where any bill needs to meet a 60-vote threshold to advance.</p>
<p>Another sticking point is the Biden administration has voiced its opposition to expanding the court. <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/biden-support-expanding-supreme-court-white-house/story?id=85703773" target="_blank">During a foreign trip in June, </a>​​White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters that President Joe Biden “does not agree with” expanding the court.</p>
<p>And House Speaker Nancy Pelosi <a href="https://georgiarecorder.com/2021/04/15/u-s-rep-hank-johnson-leads-dems-supreme-court-expansion-proposal/" target="_blank">last year</a> said she has no intentions of advancing the measure to the House floor.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/1141/cosponsors" target="_blank">Similar legislation</a> to expand the court introduced by Sen. Ed Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, has just two co-sponsors — Elizabeth Warren, also of Massachusetts, and Tina Smith of Minnesota.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Aging out</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Johnson argued that Congress cannot wait for the conservative justices to age out of the Supreme Court. The youngest is Justice Amy Coney Barrett, who is 50, and the oldest is Justice Clarence Thomas, who is 74.</p>
<p>“We don&#8217;t have a generation to wait to reform the court,” Johnson said.</p>
<p>Congress has expanded and shrunk the court <a href="https://harvardlpr.com/2019/05/06/the-supreme-court-has-been-expanded-many-times-before-here-are-four-ways-to-do-it-today/" target="_blank">seven times throughout its existence.  </a></p>
<p>Joining House Democrats were Markey and leaders from progressive organizations such as Take Back the Court Action Fund, Stand Up America, League of Conservation Voters, Demand Justice, Center for Popular Democracy Action and the National Center for Lesbian Rights, among others.</p>
<p>The renewed call to expand the Supreme Court comes after conservative justices issued several controversial decisions this year. They ranged from weakening the separation of church and state to limiting the EPA’s ability to tackle climate change to dismantling gun control laws passed by states.</p>
<p>That was in addition to the reversal of Roe v. Wade. So far, eight states have <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/overview-abortion-laws" target="_blank">banned</a> access to abortions.</p>
<p>Watson Coleman said the current ideological makeup of the court is a threat and that other rights such as same-sex intimacy, same-sex marriage and privacy when it comes to birth control could easily be undone.</p>
<p>Justice Thomas wrote his own concurring opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, arguing that since the court has overturned the constitutional right to an abortion in that case, which was grounded in the 14th Amendment and the due process clause, <a href="https://tennesseelookout.com/2022/06/24/updated-u-s-supreme-court-overturns-right-to-abortion-in-landmark-decision/" target="_blank">other cases that have been rooted </a>in the same right to privacy could all be reconsidered.</p>
<p>“They will come for our right of contraception, they will come for our right for who to love,” Watson Coleman said of Thomas’ concurring opinion.</p>
<p>Levin said this is the first time the Supreme Court has rolled back a constitutional right, especially a “right that the people of this country have had for over 50 years.”</p>
<p>“America is supposed to be a secular democracy, not a theocracy,” Levin said, adding that the conservative justices were imposing their personal beliefs on Americans.</p>

(Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON — U.S. inflation reached a 40-year high for June as prices for gas, food and rent increased, <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm" target="_blank">according to the latest Consumer Price Index</a> from the Bureau of Labor Statistics on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Consumer prices for all items increased 9.1 percent for the 12 months ending in June compared to last year, the biggest year-to-year increase since the period ending in November 1981. May consumer prices were up 8.6 percent.</p>
<p>“While almost all major component indexes increased over the month, the largest contributors were the indexes for shelter, used cars and trucks, medical care, motor vehicle insurance and new vehicles,” according to the report.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden, who is traveling overseas, issued a statement saying the inflation numbers already are out of date because they don’t reflect a decrease of about 40 cents a gallon in average gasoline prices during the last 30 days.</p>
<p>“Those savings are providing important breathing room for American families,” Biden said. “And, other commodities like wheat have fallen sharply since this report.”</p>
<p>White House officials also tried to get ahead of the report on Tuesday, saying the decrease in gas prices is significant. Prices have fallen from $5 a gallon in mid-June to an average of $4.63 nationwide, according to <a href="https://gasprices.aaa.com/" target="_blank">data</a> from AAA.</p>
<p>“That elevated price in June is both out-of-date to where the market is today and out of date to what American consumers, more importantly, are actually experiencing today,” a senior White House official told reporters on the press call.</p>
<p>Polling shows inflation is a problem for Biden, whose approval ratings hit a low of 33 percent in a New York Times/Siena College <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/11/us/politics/biden-approval-polling-2024.html" target="_blank">poll published this week. </a>The Times said widespread worries about inflation and the economy are contributing.</p>
<p>Officials on the call had not seen Wednesday’s CPI report.</p>
<p>White House economic officials on the call also said because of the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, the administration expects oil prices to be in flux. Officials said they do not expect food prices to lower.</p>
<p>“The food commodity prices can be rather volatile,” a senior White House official said. “But unlike with energy and gas and oil, we haven&#8217;t really seen the same kinds of decreases in food over the last month, so that is an ongoing challenge, and it&#8217;s something that we are also paying attention to.”</p>
<p>The CPI report found that the food index increased 1% in June, following a 1.2 % increase the prior month.</p>
<p>Biden in his statement said he will do “everything I can” to continue to drive down gas prices, including pressing industry to increase production. “Oil and gas companies must not use this moment as an excuse for profiting by not passing along savings at the pump,” he said.</p>
<p>He also said he will continue to ask Congress to act on price reduction measures for prescription drugs, health insurance premiums and utility bills, and oppose any measures by Republicans to increase taxes on working people.</p>

(Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON — Eighteen months into the Biden administration, immigration reform has stalled despite campaign promises to reform the system, with the most recent movement on immigration policy doled out by the U.S. Supreme Court and in lower federal courts.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/21-954_7l48.pdf" target="_blank">ruled</a> in favor of the Biden administration in a 5-4 decision on June 30 that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security did not violate federal immigration law when it moved to end the Trump administration’s “Remain in Mexico” policy, known as the <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/migrant-protection-protocols" target="_blank">Migrant Protection Protocols.</a> It was a rare win for President Joe Biden amid a string of defeats at the end of the court’s term, including on abortion and climate change.</p>
<p>DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said during an interview with ABC News on Sunday that the agency is planning to end the Trump-era program that forced migrants seeking asylum to remain in Mexico while their cases were being processed through the U.S. immigration court system. But he said it will take time.</p>
<p>“We need to wait until the Supreme Court’s decision is actually communicated to the lower court, to the federal District Court and the Northern District of Texas, and, once that occurs, the District Court should lift its injunction that is preventing us from ending the program,” Mayorkas said.</p>
<p>There are about 30,000 pending MPP cases, <a href="https://trac.syr.edu/phptools/immigration/mpp1/" target="_blank">according to tracking by Syracuse University.</a></p>
<p>Sen. Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican, criticized the Biden administration for moving to end the “Remain in Mexico” policy.</p>
<p>“This decision will send yet another signal to the trafficking networks and cartels that America’s border is wide open,” Rubio said in a statement. “President Biden’s reckless rhetoric and actions are encouraging illegal immigration and hurting our country.”</p>
<p>https://twitter.com/RepBenCline/status/1542876698928111616?s=20&#038;t=bsPLHQ10uhx0k2Z36oa8pQ</p>
<p>But Sen. Ben Ray Luján, a New Mexico Democrat, said in a statement that the end of the program “is the first step toward remedying years of humanitarian injustice.”</p>
<p>“This dangerous, xenophobic policy established by the Trump administration has forced tens of thousands of vulnerable children, families, and other asylum seekers into unsafe conditions before their asylum requests can even be heard,” he said.</p>
<p>Luján added that he is continuing to work with his colleagues in the Senate “to continue my career-long push to fix our broken immigration system.”</p>
<p>Noting the horrifying discovery of 53 migrants <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/authorities-id-47-migrants-found-dead-abandoned-truck-san-antonio-rcna36931" target="_blank">who died in an abandoned tractor trailer in Texas </a>while attempting to cross into the United States, Mayorkas called for Congress to pass immigration reform. He also defended the administration messaging on deterring migrants from crossing the U.S. border. Republicans have repeatedly attacked Biden on border policy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because the border has been a challenge for decades, ultimately Congress must pass legislation to once and for all fix our broken immigration system,” Mayorkas said during the ABC interview.</p>
<p>Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott was quick to blame Biden for the deaths of the migrants found in the tractor trailer.</p>
<p>“These deaths are on Biden,” Abbott wrote on <a href="https://twitter.com/GregAbbott_TX/status/1541596214705135617" target="_blank">Twitter</a>. “They are a result of his deadly open border policies.”</p>
<p>While aboard Air Force One, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters that “the fact of the matter is the border is closed, which is in part why you see people trying to make this dangerous journey using smuggling networks.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Dreamers’ fate in the courts</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Without congressional action, the nearly 825,000 undocumented people covered by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, known as Dreamers, remain in limbo as oral arguments took place in a lower court in Louisiana on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The program allows children who were brought to the country illegally to obtain documentation for work and allows them to remain in the country.</p>
<p>Texas — in its lawsuit originally with Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Nebraska, South Carolina and West Virginia — argued that DACA placed an undue burden on the states and that the Obama administration didn&#8217;t follow proper procedures when implementing the program.</p>
<p>The program was meant to be a temporary fix, until a path to citizenship for those children, who are now adults, could be put in place by Congress, but in June the program entered its 10th year in place.</p>
<p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, said that Democrats need to be prepared to pass legislation creating a pathway to citizenship should they win the DACA case in the federal appeals court in New Orleans.</p>
<p>“We need to be prepared to make respect for our Dreamers the law of the land,” she said in a statement.</p>
<p>In Biden’s State of the Union Address earlier this year, he said that the country needs to “provide a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers,” and called on Congress to pass a bill, so he could sign it into law.</p>
<p>But any immigration reform has failed to pass Congress and remains largely stuck.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Title 42</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Biden administration has been blocked by conservative judges, including on an attempt to end the controversial Title 42 policy. That Trump-era policy allows the U.S. to expel migrants making asylum claims during a period of health crisis, such as the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>“We shouldn&#8217;t be using a public health law to enforce immigration law,” the president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, Jeremy McKinney, said. “Public health law should be driven by science and not election year politics, especially coming from the same ilk that has opposed every public health measure since COVID started.”</p>
<p>The Biden administration moved to scrap the program, but after Texas sued, <a href="https://lailluminator.com/2022/05/20/federal-judge-title-42-migrant-expulsions/" target="_blank">a Louisiana district court issued a nationwide preliminary injunction</a> and ruled that the White House had to keep the policy in place. The Justice Department has appealed.</p>

<p>Chair Carolyn B. Maloney of New York said she has asked for appearances by <a href="https://oversight.house.gov/sites/democrats.oversight.house.gov/files/2022-07-06.CBM%20to%20Daniel-Daniel%20Defense%20re%20Witness%20Invitation%2001.pdf" target="_blank">Marty Daniel</a> of Daniel Defense, LLC in Georgia, <a href="https://oversight.house.gov/sites/democrats.oversight.house.gov/files/2022-07-06.CBM%20to%20Smith-Smith%20Wesson%20re%20Witness%20Invitation.pdf" target="_blank">Mark P.

<p>Following the July 4 mass shooting in Highland Park, Illinois, that left seven dead, Maloney said the committee is continuing to investigate how these companies market AR-15-style weapons to civilians.</p>
<p>Those are the firearms used in the mass shootings in Uvalde, Texas, and in Buffalo, New York.</p>
<p>“I am deeply troubled that gun manufacturers continue to profit from the sale of weapons of war, including AR-15-style assault rifles that were used by a White supremacist to murder 10 people in Buffalo, New York, and in the massacre of 19 children and two teachers in Uvalde, Texas,” she wrote.</p>
<p>Maloney requested that all three CEOs respond by Friday if they will testify on the hearing set for July 20.</p>
<p>That hearing will “examine the role of the firearms industry in the gun violence epidemic, including with respect to the sale and marketing of assault weapons and the broad civil immunity that has been granted to manufacturers.”</p>
<p>“The information you provided has heightened the Committee’s concern that your company is continuing to profit from the sale and marketing of weapons of war to civilians despite the harm these weapons cause, is failing to track instances or patterns where your products are used in crimes, and is failing to take other reasonable precautions to limit injuries and deaths caused by your firearms,” Maloney wrote to the CEOs.</p>
<p>The hearing follows <a href="https://www.marylandmatters.org/2022/06/09/fourth-grade-survivor-of-uvalde-shooting-tells-congress-i-dont-want-it-to-happen-again/" target="_blank">an early June hearing </a>where several survivors of horrific mass shootings in New York and Texas testified before Congress about the toll gun violence has taken on their lives.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden in late June <a href="https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2022/06/27/congress-sends-biden-historic-gun-safety-legislation-with-gop-support/" target="_blank">signed into law </a>a comprehensive gun safety package passed by Congress, which among its provisions provides funds for states to enact red flag laws and requires those under 21 who want to purchase a firearm to undergo a background check that takes into account a review of juvenile and mental health records.</p>

The House on Friday joined, approving the Senate’s bill<a href="https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2022299?Page=1" target="_blank"> 234-193</a>, with 14 Republicans joining all Democrats.</p>
<p>“We did something exceptional in the Senate,” Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut, the lead negotiator on the gun control legislation, <a href="https://twitter.com/ChrisMurphyCT/status/1540195665925623810" target="_blank">said on Twitter</a>.</p>
<p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said at a press conference ahead of Friday’s vote that while the bill does not have everything that Democrats had hoped for, it’s a start for more gun control.</p>
<p>“Let us not judge the legislation for what it does not do, but for what it does,” she said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Red flag laws</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The bill would provide $750 million for states to enact “red flag laws,” which allow the courts to temporarily remove a firearm from an individual who is a threat to themselves or others, among other provisions.</p>
<p>In a statement, Biden said that he was proud of the legislation Congress passed.</p>
<p>“Kids in schools and communities will be safer because of it,” he said.</p>
<p>Senate Republicans who voted for the bill included Roy Blunt of Missouri, Richard Burr and Thom Tillis of North Carolina, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, Susan Collins of Maine, Joni Ernst of Iowa, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Rob Portman of Ohio and Patrick Toomey of Pennsylvania.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Mass shootings</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>A group of 20 bipartisan senators <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/06/22/u-s-senate-moves-forward-on-gun-safety-legislation/" target="_blank">worked to pass legislation</a> on gun control after the recent mass shootings in Buffalo, New York and Uvalde, Texas.</p>
<p>In Buffalo, a White supremacist targeted a Black neighborhood and killed 10 Black people in a grocery store. And in Uvalde, 19 children and two teachers were murdered, making it the second-deadliest mass shooting since the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre in 2012.</p>
<p>“Families in Uvalde and Buffalo — and too many tragic shootings before — have demanded action,” Biden said late Thursday. “And tonight, we acted.”</p>
<p>There have been 281 mass shootings this year, according to the <a href="https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/" target="_blank">Gun Violence Archive</a>, an independent data collection organization that defines a mass shooting as one in which four or more people have been shot or killed.</p>
<p>The congressional bill, known as the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, would also provide $11 billion in mental health services for schools and families and curb the illegal trafficking of guns known as straw purchases, in which a buyer can acquire a gun for someone else.</p>
<p>Rep. Lucy McBath, Georgia Democrat and gun safety advocate, said that the passage of this bill is just the beginning of Congress’ fight for gun safety. Her son, Jordan, was murdered, and McBath has championed red flag laws.</p>
<p>“This gives us hope,” she said of the bill. “This bill does not answer all of our prayers, but this is hope.”</p>
<p>The last time Congress passed major gun legislation was in 1994, when then-President Bill Clinton signed a ban on assault weapons that spanned 10 years. The ban was not renewed when it expired.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Court decision</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The passage of the bill also follows<a href="https://wisconsinexaminer.com/2022/06/23/u-s-supreme-court-expands-gun-rights-in-striking-down-new-york-concealed-carry-law/" target="_blank"> a recent Supreme Court decision</a> that went in the opposite direction, striking down a concealed carry law in New York and expanding Second Amendment rights.</p>
<p>A major sticking point as lawmakers debated the Senate bill was the closing of the “boyfriend” loophole. The legislation includes a five-year period during which those who are convicted of committing an assault against a romantic partner must wait to obtain a firearm. If no other offenses are committed, then that person will be removed from the National Instant Criminal Background Check System.</p>
<p>Sen. Martin Heinrich, a New Mexico Democrat, said on the Senate floor Thursday said that his sons have to routinely practice school shooter drills.</p>
<p>“That type of experience has become all too common in our country,” he said. “It’s appalling and it&#8217;s unacceptable.”</p>
<p>Heinrich, who added that he is a gun owner himself, said that commonsense gun laws will help curb gun violence not only in his own state, but also across the country.</p>
<p>The bill would also require those under 21 who want to purchase a firearm to undergo a background check that takes into account a review of juvenile and mental health records.</p>
<p>Sen. Debbie Stabenow, a Michigan Democrat, and part of the bipartisan group, said that the provision on red flag laws will give family members a tool to temporary remove a weapon from someone who could harm themselves. Stabenow said that the red flag laws and mental health provisions will help save lives, as a large portion of firearm deaths are due to suicide.</p>
<p>“It really is transformative,” Stabenow said of the funding for mental health services.</p>
<p>Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican who backed the measure, said on the Senate floor Thursday that he felt the bill “makes our country safer without making it any less free.”</p>
<p>Blunt, a member of the bipartisan group, said that the one thing these “mass shootings have in common is a perpetrator that has mental health problems.”</p>
<p>He reiterated that those with mental health problems are not dangerous.</p>
<p>“Mental health is a health issue, and we should treat it as a health issue,” he said.</p>
<p>Blunt said the mental health funding that the bill provides will help those who are in crisis and could potentially harm themselves or others.</p>
<p>Sen. John Hickenlooper said on the Senate floor that mass shootings have become a uniquely American experience, growing since the Columbine school shooting in his state in 1999.</p>
<p>He said a movie theater shooting in 2012 in Aurora, Colorado, where he visited the scene as governor, “still haunts me.”</p>
<p>The nine Senate Democrats and one independent in the bipartisan group that came up with the bill are Murphy, Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, Cory Booker of New Jersey, Chris Coons of Delaware, Martin Heinrich of New Mexico, Mark Kelly of Arizona, Angus King of Maine, Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Debbie Stabenow of Michigan.</p>
<p>The 10 Senate Republicans in the bipartisan group are John Cornyn of Texas, Tillis, Blunt, Burr, Cassidy, Collins, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina,  Portman, Mitt Romney of Utah and Toomey.</p>

(Courtesy of Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday struck down a New York law that made it illegal to carry a firearm in public without showing a special need for protection.</p>
<p>The court ruled that the state’s concealed carry law violates the 14th Amendment of the Constitution — a major decision that expands the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms. The opinion came at the same time Congress is considering new gun control legislation following two deadly mass shootings.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/20-843_7j80.pdf" target="_blank">In a 6-3 decision</a> in <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docket/docketfiles/html/public/20-843.html" target="_blank">New York State Rifle &amp; Pistol Assoc. v. Bruen</a>,  Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas wrote that the court found that New York’s law requiring gun owners to demonstrate a need for self-defense in order to carry a firearm “is demanding.”</p>
<p>“[T]he Second and Fourteenth Amendments protect an individual&#8217;s right to carry a handgun for self-defense outside the home,” Thomas wrote.</p>
<p>The decision has the potential to make similar concealed carry laws unconstitutional in some states. They include California, Delaware, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Connecticut and Rhode Island.</p>
<p>The liberal wing of the court, Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, dissented in the opinion, with Breyer writing the dissent.</p>
<p>“The question before us concerns the extent to which the Second Amendment prevents democratically elected officials from enacting laws to address the serious problem of gun violence,” he wrote.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Biden disappointed</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>President Joe Biden said in a statement that he was disappointed with the Supreme Court&#8217;s decision, and that “we must do more as a society — not less — to protect our fellow Americans.”</p>
<p>“I urge states to continue to enact and enforce commonsense laws to make their citizens and communities safer from gun violence,” Biden said. “For centuries, states have regulated who may purchase or possess weapons, the types of weapons they may use and the places they may carry those weapons.”</p>
<p>The decision came as <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/06/22/u-s-senate-moves-forward-on-gun-safety-legislation/" target="_blank">the Senate is moving to pass bipartisan gun control legislation</a> by the end of this week. Some provisions would provide funding for states to enact their own red flag laws, which allow the courts to temporarily remove a firearm from an individual who poses a threat to themselves or others.</p>
<p>Breyer argued that states might enact different firearm laws based on their makeup. For example, a state like New York, where more than 8 million people live in the city, would have different laws than Montana or Wyoming, “which do not contain any city remotely comparable in terms of population or density,” Breyer said.</p>
<p>“I fear that the Court’s interpretation ignores these significant dangers and leaves states without the ability to address them,” Breyer wrote.</p>
<p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams said in a statement that the ruling will “put New Yorkers at further risk of gun violence.”</p>
<p>“We will work together to mitigate the risks this decision will create once it is implemented, as we cannot allow New York to become the Wild West,” Adams said.</p>
<p>Breyer criticized the court&#8217;s narrow historical approach, rather than taking into account the current gun violence epidemic and recent mass shootings in Buffalo, New York and Uvalde, Texas.</p>
<p>In Buffalo, a White supremacist targeted a grocery store in a predominantly Black neighborhood and murdered 10 Black people. In Uvalde, a gunman targeted an elementary school and killed 19 children and two teachers.</p>
<p>“I fear that history will be an especially inadequate tool when it comes to modern cases presenting modern problems,” Breyer wrote.</p>
<p>But Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito questioned Breyer’s reasoning for bringing up the recent mass shootings in Buffalo and Uvalde.</p>
<p>“And how does the dissent account for the fact that one of the mass shootings near the top of its list took place in Buffalo?” Alito wrote. “The New York law at issue in this case obviously did not stop that perpetrator.”</p>

<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">States opposed to New York law</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Most states broadly grant requests to carry guns outside the home.</p>
<p>Numerous states <a href="https://ago.mo.gov/docs/default-source/press-releases/20-843-tsac-arizona-missouri-et-al.pdf?sfvrsn=e8d56277_2" target="_blank">signed on to an amicus brief</a> in 2021 siding with those challenging New York’s law, Brandon Koch and Robert Nash. They included Missouri, Arizona, Alaska, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Montana, Nebraska, Ohio, and Tennessee. Virginia also allows concealed carry <a href="https://vsp.virginia.gov/services/firearms/resident-concealed-handgun-permits/#ApplicationforaConcealedHandgunPermit" target="_blank">of a gun for holders of a permit</a>, which does not require applicants to list a reason for carrying a firearm.</p>
<p>The two men who brought the case were granted a restrictive license that allowed them to carry their firearms for the purpose of hunting and target shooting.</p>
<p>But Koch and Nash wanted unrestricted licenses to carry concealed handguns for personal protection.</p>
<p>The licensing officer heard their petition and allowed them to carry their firearms for outdoor activities such as camping, fishing and hiking, and allowed Koch to travel with his firearm to and from work. The licensing officer determined that Koch and Nash were prohibited from carrying a concealed weapon in areas “typically open and frequented by the general public.”</p>
<p>Wayne LaPierre, the executive vice president of the National Rifle Association, said in a statement that the decision is a “watershed win for good men and women all across America and is the result of a decades-long fight the NRA has led.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/11/04/supreme-court-justices-skeptical-about-new-york-gun-control-law/" target="_blank">In November of last year,</a> conservative justices on the Supreme Court expressed skepticism during oral arguments about New York’s strict limits on carrying a gun outside the home.</p>
<p>“Carrying a firearm outside the home is a fundamental, constitutional right,” attorney Paul Clement, arguing against the New York law, said in his opening presentation to the court</p>
<p>In reaction on Thursday, gun safety organizations, such as Everytown for Gun Safety, contended that many Americans are in favor of gun control laws.</p>
<p>“Today’s ruling is out of step with the bipartisan majority in Congress that is on the verge of passing significant gun safety legislation, and out of touch with the overwhelming majority of Americans who support gun safety measures,” John Feinblatt, president of Everytown, said in a statement.</p>
<p>“Let’s be clear: the Supreme Court got this decision wrong, choosing to put our communities in even greater danger with gun violence on the rise across the country.”</p>

<p>Senators on a procedural vote late Tuesday <a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_votes/vote1172/vote_117_2_00235.htm" target="_blank">agreed 64-34</a> to start debate on <a href="https://www.murphy.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/bipartisan_safer_communities_act_text.pdf" target="_blank">the gun control bill</a>, which would also have to be passed by the House — which separately has approved more sweeping legislation — before it could go to President Joe Biden’s desk. All 34 votes in opposition were from Republicans, although Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, voted in favor of advancing the bill.</p>
<p>The push for some kind of federal response followed two deadly mass shootings in May. In Buffalo, New York, a White supremacist targeted a Black neighborhood and killed 10 Black people in a grocery store.</p>
<p>In Uvalde, Texas, 19 children and two teachers were murdered, making it the second-deadliest mass shooting since the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre in 2012.</p>
<p><a href="https://floridaphoenix.com/2022/06/13/bipartisan-u-s-senate-deal-on-gun-control-met-with-praise-from-biden-democrats/" target="_blank">A group of 20 bipartisan senators</a> — 10 Republicans, nine Democrats and one independent — hashed out eight provisions in the Senate bill, known as the “Bipartisan Safer Communities Act.”</p>
<p>If passed, it would provide $750 million for states to enact “red flag laws,” which allow the courts to temporarily remove a firearm from an individual who is a threat to themselves or others, and $11 billion in mental health services for schools and families, among other provisions.</p>
<p>“This legislation will strengthen background checks and keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people,” Sen. Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat, and lead negotiator on the bill, said in a statement.</p>
<p>https://twitter.com/MarkWarner/status/1539395928569876482?s=20&#038;t=2GhDP4IDSu05fL4E2hwTew</p>
<p>The bill also closes the “boyfriend” loophole. It includes a five-year period during which those who are convicted of committing an assault against a romantic partner must wait to obtain a firearm. If no other offenses are committed, then that person will be removed from the National Instant Criminal Background Check System.</p>
<p>The bill would also require those under 21 who want to purchase a firearm to undergo a background check that takes into account a review of juvenile and mental health records.</p>
<p>And the legislation would curb the illegal trafficking of guns known as straw purchases, where someone can acquire a gun for someone else.</p>
<p>Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement that senators “will move to final passage as quickly as possible.” He added that while the bill does not have everything that Democrats want, “this legislation is urgently needed.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Mental health funding</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>There is a hefty investment in mental health services in the bill — about $11 billion in funding to improve mental health access for children through the Medicaid program and the <b>Children&#8217;s Health Insurance Program.</b></p>
<p>The bill’s mental health funding for children and their families would:</p>
<p>• Provide $80 million in grants to support pediatric care specialists who want to access mental health expertise in their patients&#8217; treatment.</p>
<p>• Appropriate $60 million over the course of five years for training in mental health for clinicians who treat children.</p>
<p>• Appropriate more than $120 million over four years to provide training for community members and first responders to treat individuals with mental health disorders.</p>
<p>• Provide $250 million for states, the District of Columbia and U.S. territories to enhance community mental health services.</p>
<p>• Appropriate $240 million over four years to increase awareness of mental health among school-aged children, help staff detect mental distress in students and help those students connect with services to help them. There is also $28 million set aside for grants to support trauma care in schools.</p>
<p>• Appropriate $40 million over four years to improve services for children and their families who have experienced trauma.</p>
<p>• Appropriate $150 million to support the implementation of the 24 hour 9-8-8 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline for those in distress.</p>
<p>The bill would also expand mental health services in schools by:</p>
<p>• Providing $500 million through the School Based Mental Health Services Grant Program to increase the number of mental health professionals for schools with districts that demonstrate the need for those services.</p>
<p>• Providing $500 million to the School Based Mental Health Service Professionals Demonstration Grant to train and diversify the pipeline of counselors, social workers and psychologists in schools.</p>
<p>• Providing $1 billion through Title IV-A to support activities to improve conditions for student learning, such as developing positive school climates through evidence-based practices.</p>
<p>• Providing $50 million to the 21st Century Community Learning Centers program, which funds after school and summer programs, with a new focus on programs for older youth.</p>
<p>• Providing $300 million through the STOP School Violence Act to institute safety measures in and around schools, support school violence prevention efforts and provide training to school personnel and students. No funds under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act are allowed to be used to train or equip any person with dangerous weapons in schools.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Senate votes</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The nine Senate Democrats and one independent in the bipartisan group that came up with the bill are Murphy, Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, Cory Booker of New Jersey, Chris Coons of Delaware, Martin Heinrich of New Mexico, Mark Kelly of Arizona, Angus King of Maine, Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Debbie Stabenow of Michigan.</p>
<p>The 10 Senate Republicans in the bipartisan group are John Cornyn of Texas, Thom Tillis of North Carolina, Roy Blunt of Missouri, Richard Burr of North Carolina, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, Susan Collins of Maine, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Rob Portman of Ohio, Mitt Romney of Utah and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>The senators who did not cast a vote on whether to start debate on the guns bill were Republican Sens. Kevin Cramer of North Dakota and Toomey.</p>
<p>But Toomey, who is part of the bipartisan group, issued a statement in support.</p>
<p>“This bipartisan gun safety bill protects the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens while taking steps to make our communities safer,” he said. “It will strengthen background checks, provide federal assistance for state crisis intervention programs, enhance penalties for trafficking and straw purchasing firearms, and invest in school safety and mental health.”</p>
<p>Republican senators who voted against starting debate on the gun-related bill include Sens. John Barrasso and Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming; Marsha Blackburn and Bill Hagerty of Tennessee; John Boozman and Tom Cotton of Arkansas; Mike Braun of Indiana; Mike Crapo and Jim Risch of Idaho; Ted ​​Cruz of Texas; Steve Daines of Montana; Deb Fischer and Ben Sasse of Nebraska; Chuck Grassley of Iowa; Josh Hawley of Missouri; John Hoeven of North Dakota; Cindy Hyde-Smith and Roger Wicker of Mississippi; Jim Inhofe and James Lankford of Oklahoma; Ron Johnson of Wisconsin; John Kennedy of Louisiana; Mike Lee of Utah; Roger Marshall and Jerry Moran of Kansas; Rand Paul of Kentucky; Mike Rounds and John Thune of South Dakota; Marco Rubio and Rick Scott of Florida; Tim Scott of South Carolina; Richard Shelby and Tommy Tuberville of Alabama; and Dan Sullivan of Alaska.</p>

Federal officials first passed legislation requiring states to transition to a centralized 988 number.(Jane Norman/ States Newsroom D.C. Bureau)</p><p>WASHINGTON — U.S. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell on Tuesday said he is comfortable with the bipartisan deal Senate Democrats and Republicans struck on gun control legislation, signaling that he will join in passing a bill when it comes to a vote.</p>
<p>“For myself, I’m comfortable with the framework,” the Kentucky Republican said during a press conference. “And if the legislation ends up reflecting what the framework indicates, I’ll be supportive.”</p>
<p>The push for gun legislation follows the second-deadliest school shooting in a decade, in which 19 children and two teachers were murdered in Uvalde, Texas on May 24. It followed another mass shooting in Buffalo, New York, on May 14, where a white supremacist targeted a Black neighborhood and killed 10 Black people at a grocery store.</p>
<p>A bipartisan group of 20 senators — including 10 Republicans, the number needed to advance a bill past a filibuster — announced a framework early Sunday and are quickly moving to draft the bill’s specific wording.</p>
<p>The lead Democrat on the framework, Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut, said a component of the bill would be an expansion of mental health, with somewhere in the billions for funding. But he did not give more details on how much money will be provided for those services.</p>
<p>“Given the opportunity to spend billions of dollars fixing our mental health system, we would be foolish not to take up that opportunity,” he told reporters Tuesday. “We certainly haven’t announced any numbers — we’re still working on that.”</p>
<p>Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said on the Senate floor that once there is legislative text for the bill, he will quickly call a vote, aiming for passage before the July 4 recess.</p>
<p>“The bipartisan framework is far from perfect, but if passed it will unquestionably save lives and would be the most significant action on guns that the Senate has taken in nearly three decades,” he said. “This is the best chance we’ve had in years to finally tell the American people that, yes, after the horrifying tragedies of Uvalde and Buffalo, this time, this time will be different.”</p>
<p>The framework would provide funding to states to establish red flag laws, which allow the courts or law enforcement to temporarily remove a firearm from an individual who is distressed and poses a harm to either themselves or someone else.  <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/10/06/some-virginia-communities-that-took-pro-gun-rights-stances-are-already-using-the-states-new-red-flag-law/" target="_blank">Virginia passed a red flag law in 2020</a> as part of a suite of gun control legislation pushed by Democrats during their two-year control of both chambers of the General Assembly.</p>
<p>The federal bill would also close the “boyfriend” gun purchase loophole by requiring convicted domestic violence abusers and those subject to domestic violence restraining orders be included in background checks, including “those who have or have had a continuing relationship of a romantic or intimate nature.”</p>
<p>Democratic Virginia Sen. Mark Warner in a <a href="https://twitter.com/MarkWarner/status/1536787807988879361" target="_blank">Tuesday afternoon tweet</a> praised the loophole closure as &#8220;an important provision that will make it harder for domestic abusers to access guns.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;These reforms are long overdue, and I&#8217;m ready to get them done ASAP,&#8221; he wrote.</p>
<p>Finally, the deal would also allocate funding for school resources such as mental health and violence prevention programs and require gun buyers under 21 to undergo a background check that includes a review of juvenile and mental health records.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Access to juvenile records</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Sen. Roy Blunt, a Missouri Republican who is part of the bipartisan coalition, said that an important component of the bill is having access to juvenile records if someone under 21 wants to purchase an assault weapon.</p>
<p>Democrats tried to raise the age of purchasing an assault weapon, the type of firearm used in most mass shootings, from 18 to 21, but the provision was stripped out during negotiations. The legal age to buy a handgun is 21.</p>
<p>“The person in Uvalde, who on his 18th birthday underwent a background check to buy a gun, and since you have no earlier records from 18 available, it’s like that person was born that day,” Blunt said at a press conference.</p>
<p>Blunt said the group is hoping to have the bill text written by the end of this week or next.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">House package</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The Democratic-controlled House passed its own gun control package last week, but it has little chance of being brought to the Senate floor for a vote.</p>
<p>That collection of earlier bills raises the age of purchasing semiautomatic rifles from 18 to 21, creates new requirements for storing guns in a home with children, prevents gun trafficking, requires all firearms to be traceable and closes the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/4168" target="_blank">loophole on bump stocks</a>, devices that increase the rate of fire of semiautomatic weapons, among other things.</p>
<p>The White House and Democratic leaders <a href="https://floridaphoenix.com/2022/06/13/bipartisan-u-s-senate-deal-on-gun-control-met-with-praise-from-biden-democrats/" target="_blank">signaled their support for the Senate framework on Monday</a>, and all pushed for more to be done.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncjrs.gov/txtfiles/billfs.txt" target="_blank">The last time</a> Congress passed major gun control legislation was in 1994, when former President Bill Clinton signed into law a ban on assault rifles, but it was temporary and ended in 2004.</p>
<p>The Senate Democrats and one independent in the bipartisan group along with Murphy are Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, Cory Booker of New Jersey, Chris Coons of Delaware, Martin Heinrich of New Mexico, Mark Kelly of Arizona, Angus King of Maine, Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Debbie Stabenow of Michigan.</p>
<p>The 10 Senate Republicans in the bipartisan group, including Blunt, are John Cornyn of Texas, Thom Tillis of North Carolina, Richard Burr of North Carolina, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, Susan Collins of Maine, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Rob Portman of Ohio, Mitt Romney of Utah and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Gun rights groups</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The National Rifle Association issued a statement following the announcement of the bipartisan agreement saying that the organization would not comment on the framework.</p>
<p>“We will make our position known when the full text of the bill is available for review,” the <a href="https://www.nraila.org/articles/20220612/nra-statement-on-senates-june-12th-bipartisan-agreement" target="_blank">NRA wrote in a statement</a>. “The NRA will continue to oppose any effort to insert gun control policies, initiatives that override constitutional due process protections and efforts to deprive law-abiding citizens of their fundamental right to protect themselves and their loved ones into this or any other legislation.”</p>
<p>​But another large gun rights group, the Gun Owners of America, has already come out opposing the framework and is pressuring senators to oppose the deal.</p>
<p>“There is absolutely NO compromise acceptable to [Gun Owners of America],&#8221; the organization wrote in a statement. “These are our rights, and we shouldn’t surrender an inch of them to anyone.”</p>

<p>The second-deadliest school shooting in a decade in Uvalde, Texas, where 19 children and two teachers were murdered on May 24, sparked pressure on Congress to pass gun control legislation, as well as another mass shooting of 10 Black people on May 14 in Buffalo, New York.</p>
<p>“Families are scared, and it is our duty to come together and get something done that will help restore their sense of safety and security in their communities,” the group of bipartisan senators said in a statement.</p>
<p>“Our plan increases needed mental health resources, improves school safety and support for students, and helps ensure dangerous criminals and those who are adjudicated as mentally ill can’t purchase weapons.”</p>
<p>There is currently no bill text, but the <a href="https://www.murphy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/bipartisan-group-of-senators-announce-agreement" target="_blank">framework</a> would:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Provide funding to states to establish red flag laws.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Allocate funding for school resources such as mental health and violence prevention programs.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Require those under 21 to undergo a background check that includes a review of juvenile and mental health records.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Curb the illegal trafficking of guns known as straw purchasing, where someone can acquire a gun for someone else.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Require that convicted domestic violence abusers and those subject to domestic violence restraining orders are included in background checks, including “those who have or have had a continuing relationship of a romantic or intimate nature.”</li>
</ul>
<p>The nine Senate Democrats and one independent in the bipartisan group are Chris Murphy of Connecticut, Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, Cory Booker of New Jersey, Chris Coons of Delaware, Martin Heinrich of New Mexico, Mark Kelly of Arizona, Angus King of Maine, Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Debbie Stabenow of Michigan.</p>
<p>The 10 Senate Republicans in the bipartisan group are John Cornyn of Texas, Thom Tillis of North Carolina, Roy Blunt of Missouri, Richard Burr of North Carolina, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, Susan Collins of Maine, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Rob Portman of Ohio, Mitt Romney of Utah and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said in a statement that he will schedule a vote for the bill as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>“After an unrelenting wave of gun-related suicides and homicides, including mass shootings, the Senate is poised to act on commonsense reforms to protect Americans where they live, where they shop, and where they learn,” he said.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden said in a statement that the framework “does not do everything that I think is needed, but it reflects important steps in the right direction, and would be the most significant gun safety legislation to pass Congress in decades.”</p>
<p>White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the president supports the framework, but is still pushing for Congress to renew a ban on assault weapons and expand background checks on firearms, and is pushing for the Senate to confirm his nomination to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, Steve Dettelbach.</p>
<p>“The president wants to see Congress act and wants to see this on his desk as quick as possible,” she said during a Monday press briefing.</p>
<p>Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell issued a statement Sunday commending the senators for making progress but didn’t yet endorse the plan.</p>
<p>“I am glad Senators Cornyn and Murphy are continuing to make headway in their discussions. I appreciate their hard work on this important issue,” said the Kentucky Republican. “The principles they announced today show the value of dialogue and cooperation.</p>
<p>“I continue to hope their discussions yield a bipartisan product that makes significant headway on key issues like mental health and school safety, respects the Second Amendment, earns broad support in the Senate, and makes a difference for our country.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncjrs.gov/txtfiles/billfs.txt" target="_blank">The last time</a> Congress passed major gun control legislation was in 1994, when former President Bill Clinton signed into law a ban on assault riffles. But it was a temporary ban that ended in 2004.</p>
<p>“With bipartisan support, there are no excuses for delay, and no reason why it should not quickly move through the Senate and the House,” Biden said. “Each day that passes, more children are killed in this country: the sooner it comes to my desk, the sooner I can sign it, and the sooner we can use these measures to save lives.”</p>
<p>The framework is short on detail, compared to the House’s gun control package passed last week.</p>
<p>The House package raises the age of purchasing semiautomatic rifles from 18 to 21, creates new requirements for storing guns in a home with children, prevents gun trafficking, requires all firearms to be traceable and closes the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/4168" target="_blank">loophole on bump stocks</a>, devices that increase the rate of fire of semiautomatic weapons, among other things.</p>
<p>It most likely would not be brought to the evenly divided Senate for a floor vote. Any successful Senate proposal would need 60 votes to advance beyond a filibuster.</p>
<p>“This bipartisan proposal is a first and necessary step to reduce gun violence in our communities,” Sen. Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat who was not part of the bipartisan group, said in a statement. “Every moment that Congress does not act, another community bears witness to the heartbreaking consequences of gun violence. That’s why the Senate must move quickly to pass this long overdue proposal.&#8221;</p>
<p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a statement that while the Senate proposal is an important step, Congress still needs to do more on gun control.</p>
<p>“America’s epidemic of gun violence has reached a fever pitch — and Democrats will never stop working to end the bloodshed,” Pelosi said. “As we move forward on this bipartisan framework, we are continuing to fight for more life-saving measures: including universal background checks, banning high-capacity magazines and raising the age to buy assault weapons, which must also become law.”</p>
<p>“I joined these negotiations to ensure any agreement addressed illegal gun violence while upholding due process and protecting law-abiding Americans’ 2nd Amendment rights,” Cassidy said in a statement. “This agreement upholds that commitment.”</p>

<p>WASHINGTON — A fourth grader who survived the Uvalde, Texas, school shooting where 19 students and two teachers were murdered told lawmakers Wednesday that she is afraid to go back to school.</p>
<p>“I don’t want it to happen again,” 11-year-old Miah Cerrillo said in a pre-recorded video shown to members of the U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Reform, as Congress debates whether to enact new gun control legislation.</p>
<p>Miah told lawmakers that after her friend sitting next to her was shot and killed by the gunman, she covered herself in her friend&#8217;s blood and pretended to be dead. She moved toward her teacher, who had been killed by the gunman, grabbed her phone and called 911.</p>
<p>Miah was one of several survivors of horrific mass shootings in New York and Texas who testified about the toll gun violence has taken on their lives. They urged Congress to pass legislation to ban assault weapons and high capacity magazines.</p>
<p>“It is my hope that all my colleagues will listen with an open heart as gun violence survivors and loved ones recount one of the darkest days of their lives,” Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney, D-N.Y., the chairwoman of the committee, said in her opening statement.</p>
<p>Kimberly Rubio’s daughter, Lexi, was murdered in the Uvalde school shooting. She told House members that the day of the shooting, Lexi was set to receive a good citizen award as well as be recognized for earning straight As.</p>
<p>To celebrate, Kimberly Rubio told her daughter they would get ice cream after the awards ceremony.</p>
<p>“We told her we loved her, and we would pick her up after school,” she said.</p>
<p>Kimberly Rubio detailed to lawmakers the chaos of trying to find her daughter when the news broke of a shooting at Robb Elementary.</p>
<p>While she and her husband were able to reunite with their 8-year-old son, they searched the local hospital for Lexi.</p>
<p>Still unable to find her daughter, and without a car, Kimberly Rubio took her sandals off — shoes that she planned to wear at the award ceremony — and ran barefoot for a mile to Robb Elementary. She was informed by school district officials that Lexi was among the 19 students killed.</p>
<p>“Somewhere out there, a mom is hearing our testimony and thinking to herself ‘I can’t even imagine their pain,’ not knowing that our reality will one day be hers, unless we act now,” she said.</p>
<p>Zeneta Everhart, the survivor of a mass shooting on May 14 by a White supremacist in Buffalo, New York, told lawmakers that she does not feel safe. <a href="https://www.wkbw.com/news/local-news/buffalo-strong/family-of-buffalo-mass-shooting-survivor-collecting-books-on-racism-and-black-history-to-distribute-to-community" target="_blank">Everhart was at a supermarket in a predominantly Black neighborhood with her son</a>, Zaire Goodman, who was shot in the neck.</p>
<p>“To the lawmakers who feel that we do not need stricter gun laws, let me paint a picture for you: My son Zaire has a hole in the right side of his neck, two on his back and another on his leg caused by an exploding bullet from an AR-15,” she said.</p>
<p>Everhart said there is no reason for someone to have access to an assault weapon like the one used in the shooting and urged lawmakers to pass legislation to ban the firearms.</p>
<p>“If after hearing from me and the other people here today does not move you to act on gun laws, then I invite you to my home to clean Zaire’s wounds so that you may see up close the damage that has been caused to my son and my community,” she said.</p>

    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">School ‘hardening’ argument</h4>

	
<p>Republicans on the committee criticized Democrats for politicizing a tragedy and argued the schools need to be “hardened,” meaning that they have too many doors and need tighter security.</p>
<p>The ranking member, Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., said Democrats were pushing “a radical left-wing agenda” by trying to pass gun control legislation.</p>
<p>Republican Reps. Andrew Clyde of Georgia and Clay Higgins of Louisiana said gun legislation proposed by Democrats would infringe on “law-abiding” Second Amendment users.</p>
<p>But Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., said that firearm injuries are now the <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2201761" target="_blank">leading cause of death</a> for children and adolescents.</p>
<p>“Will we continue to accept the slaughter of innocents, including innocent children, as acceptable collateral damage for loyalty to a completely bogus and distorted misreading of the Second Amendment?” Raskin asked.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">House debates gun control</h4>

	
<p>On Wednesday night, the House passed 223-204 a package of eight bills relating to gun control.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/biden-urges-assault-weapons-ban-us-house-democrats-advance-gun-control-bills" target="_blank">The </a>“Protect Our Kids Act” raises the age of purchasing semiautomatic rifles from 18 to 21, creates new requirements for storing guns in a home with children, prevents gun trafficking, requires all firearms to be traceable and closes the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/4168" target="_blank">loophole on bump stocks</a>, devices that increase the rate of fire of semiautomatic weapons, among other things.</p>
<p>Rep. Madeleine Dean, a Pennsylvania Democrat, challenged Republican arguments that regulating guns would violate Second Amendment rights.</p>
<p>“Do these tragedies from guns in the hands of bad actors sound like the well regulated militia explicitly mentioned in the Second Amendment? Of course not. It’s outrageous,” Dean said.</p>
<p>The package of measures is unlikely to advance to a final vote in the Senate, where Democrats are still trying to strike a deal on passable gun control legislation. In an evenly divided Senate, they will need 10 Republicans on board.</p>
<p>The House is also scheduled on Thursday to vote on a bill by Georgia Democrat Lucy McBath known as a <a href="https://mcbath.house.gov/2021/10/legislation-led-by-mcbath-to-enact-federal-red-flag-laws-passes-house-committee" target="_blank">“red flag” bill</a>.</p>
<p>Red flag laws allow the courts or law enforcement to temporarily remove a firearm from an individual who is adjudged to pose a threat to themselves or others.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Senate negotiations extend</h4>

	
<p>Negotiations continued among senators over gun control legislation that could pass there. Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy, the Democrats’ top negotiator, said Wednesday morning that he wasn’t going to settle for a bill “that isn&#8217;t substantial, that isn&#8217;t really truly meaningful.”</p>
<p>“The entire nation is expecting us to put our politics aside and get something done: Both to save lives, but also to give peace of mind to this country that we understand the trauma this nation is going through right now,” he said.</p>
<p>Murphy said he wanted his colleagues watching the House panel’s testimony to try to “understand the reality of what it&#8217;s like when you lose a loved one to gun violence” as well as “the trauma that these victims go through and how wide-ranging the trauma is.”</p>
<p>“These communities never recovered from a mass shooting,” Murphy said.</p>
<p>Several Republican senators have said that raising the age from 18 to 21 to buy an assault weapon should be considered. Those senators include Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Joni Ernst of Iowa, according to Capitol Hill pool reports.</p>
<p>Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said Wednesday morning on the floor that gun safety negotiators &#8220;deserve the space they need to produce meaningful results.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope my colleagues continue to make progress toward an effective agreement — hopefully by the end of the week,” Schumer said.</p>
<p>Urging GOP lawmakers to support a possible agreement between Democratic and Republican negotiators, Schumer said, “the sooner we act, the greater chance we have of preventing another senseless mass shooting in America.”</p>
<p>Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, his party’s top negotiator on gun safety, said Wednesday afternoon that he’s optimistic Congress will be able to enact legislation that can save lives, noting lawmakers are making “steady progress.”</p>
<p>“I&#8217;m optimistic that we could pass a bill in the Senate, it can pass the House, and it will get a signature by President Biden,” Cornyn said. “It will become the law of the land.”</p>
<p>Lawmakers, he said, are discussing ways to encourage states to upload juvenile records to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, the database that gun dealers are supposed to check before selling a firearm.</p>
<p>“This is not about creating new restrictions on law-abiding citizens, it’s about ensuring the system we already have in place works as intended,” he said.</p>
<p>Cornyn said he believes the ongoing mass shootings throughout the country represent a “failure” of the mental health system and that the legislation could also address that, though he didn’t get into specifics.</p>
<p>“I think there’s a consensus that criminals and people experiencing severe mental health crises shouldn’t have access to guns,” Cornyn said, noting that’s the goal of the NICS system.</p>
<p>The Texas lawmaker said he is optimistic because of the progress lawmakers have made so far that Congress will be able to enact legislation that can save lives.</p>
<p>“I sense a feeling of urgency and a desire actually to get things done,&#8221; Cornyn said. &#8220;Around here if you know people have the will, there is a way. And I believe there is a collective bipartisan will.”</p>

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON — The son of a Black woman shot and killed by a White supremacist begged members of the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday to take action against such domestic terrorism.</p>
<p>The gunman in Buffalo, New York, was <a href="https://www.poynter.org/fact-checking/2022/what-is-the-great-replacement-theory-linked-to-the-buffalo-shooter/" target="_blank">motivated by the “great replacement theory,”</a> a racist conspiracy theory that claims growing numbers of immigrants and people of color will lead to the extinction of the White race, <a href="https://immigrationforum.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Replacement-Theory-Explainer-1122.pdf" target="_blank">according to the National Immigration Forum</a>.</p>
<p>“It comes under the banner of White supremacy,” said Garnell Whitfield Jr., who lost his mother, Ruth, when the 18-year-old White supremacist traveled to a predominantly Black neighborhood in Buffalo on May 14 and killed 10 Black people.</p>
<p>Whitfield talked about his mother, and how it’s impossible for his family to grasp that she was taken from them “by someone full of so much hate.”</p>
<p>“My mom’s life mattered,” he said. “Your actions here will tell us if and how much it mattered to you.”</p>
<p>Witnesses during the hearing also predicted that the spread of White supremacy in the United States will increase acts of domestic terrorism.</p>
<p>“Extremism is still a sad reality in America — we have to do everything to make America safer,” the chair of the Judiciary Committee, Sen. Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, said. “Buffalo, New York, was an illustration on why that’s necessary.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, President Joe Biden met with Sen. Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat, on Tuesday to discuss gun control negotiations in the Senate, following the New York mass shooting and a May 24 massacre in Uvalde, Texas, in which 19 schoolchildren and two teachers were gunned down.</p>
<p>Murphy is part of a small bipartisan group of senators working to strike some type of deal to get 10 Republican votes for gun legislation.</p>
<p>In the House, Speaker Nancy Pelosi will bring a more sweeping package of eight related gun control bills for a vote Wednesday. It&#8217;s not expected to advance in the evenly divided Senate.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/biden-urges-assault-weapons-ban-us-house-democrats-advance-gun-control-bills" target="_blank">The package would</a> raise the age of purchasing semiautomatic rifles from 18 to 21, create new requirements for storing guns in a home with children, prevent gun trafficking, require all firearms to be traceable and close the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/4168" target="_blank">loophole on bump stocks</a>, devices that increase the rate of fire of semiautomatic weapons, among other things.</p>
<p>The Biden administration issued a statement in support of the package. “The President has called on Congress to act now to reduce gun violence and save lives,” the White House said.  “This legislation would make significant progress toward delivering on that call to action.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">No longer a fringe theory</h4>

	
<p>At the Senate hearing, two witnesses, Michael German of the Brennan Center for Justice, and Robert Pape, a political science professor at the University of Chicago, warned senators that while the great replacement theory is not new, it is no longer a fringe idea.</p>
<p>They said it has become mainstream due to media coverage on outlets such as Fox News, as well as claims by right-wing politicians.</p>
<p>“We need to prepare for potential political violence in the future,” said Pape, who is also the director of the Chicago Project On Security And Threats.</p>
<p>The Department of Homeland Security <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/ntas/advisory/national-terrorism-advisory-system-bulletin-june-7-2022" target="_blank">issued a notice Tuesday</a> that stated, due to the recent violent attacks against communities of color, in coming months “we expect the threat environment to become more dynamic as several high-profile events could be exploited to justify acts of violence against a range of possible targets.”</p>
<p>“These targets could include public gatherings, faith-based institutions, schools, racial and religious minorities, government facilities and personnel, U.S. critical infrastructure, the media, and perceived ideological opponents,” the DHS summary said.</p>
<p>“Threat actors have recently mobilized to violence due to factors such as personal grievances, reactions to current events, and adherence to violent extremist ideologies, including racially or ethnically motivated or anti-government/anti-authority violent extremism.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Jan. 6 attack</h4>

	
<p>Pape said that his research has shown that a key characteristic of the more than 800 people charged with participating in the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol is that they are “middle-class Whites residing in counties with the most loss of White population share — exactly who would most likely fear the great replacement as described by prominent political and media leaders.”</p>
<p>He said the White supremacist attack in Buffalo was a prime example. He added that the last time the U.S. saw middle class White Americans involved in political violence was during the second expansion of the Ku Klux Klan in the 1920s.</p>
<p>Durbin said mass shootings targeting places of worship and communities of color are increasing, adding that the first hearing he called on domestic terrorism was 10 years ago after a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikhism" target="_blank">Sikh</a> temple was targeted. Seven worshipers died.</p>
<p>Durbin asked Pape what role social media plays, as well as the easy access to firearms used in mass shootings.</p>
<p>Weapons have combined with “volatile ideas and beliefs in the mainstream,” Pape said. “You&#8217;ve got the combination of these two, which is why we&#8217;re seeing many more of these events in the United States. This is a deadly cocktail that promises more violence coming forward.”</p>
<p>Pape added that media figures and politicians that either directly or indirectly embrace the great replacement theory are often rewarded, from high cable news ratings to campaign donations.</p>
<p>Pape said mass shootings related to the great replacement theory include the 2019 Tree of Life synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh, where 11 Jewish worshipers were killed, and the 2019 El Paso shooting in a Hispanic neighborhood, where 23 Latinos were killed while shopping at Walmart.</p>
<p>German, a former F.B.I. agent, said there needs to be a federal record of domestic terrorism, adding that it’s not something the Department of Justice tracks.</p>
<p>“The failure to acknowledge the organized and interstate nature of violent White supremacists and far-right militant groups forfeits intelligence that could be used to prepare for and perhaps prevent future attacks,” he said.</p>
<p>Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat, also asked one of the witnesses, Justin Herdman, a former U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Ohio, what role social media played in the spread of misinformation.</p>
<p>“It certainly has not played a positive role in spreading disinformation and radicalizing people who would do harm to others,” Herdman said.</p>
<p>Sen. Mazie Hirono, a Hawaii Democrat, said that a large factor in domestic terrorism is the accessibility of assault weapons.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Free speech concerns</h4>

	
<p>The top Republican on the committee, Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, said that the threat of  domestic terrorism is always shifting and can also include political violence.</p>
<p>“We have to condemn all political violence,” he said, adding that “at the same time we have to protect free speech.”</p>
<p>He pointed to the 2017 shooting at a practice for a congressional baseball game, where Republicans were specifically targeted by a left-wing political activist, as an example of extreme political violence.</p>
<p>Sen. Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican, also raised concerns about political free speech. She asked one of the witnesses, Jonathan Turley, a professor at George Washington University Law School, how law enforcement can make determinations between extreme speech and free speech.</p>
<p>“The concern is if you tie a particular ideology to the F.B.I.,” Turley said, adding that the U.S. has persecuted people for being communists and Marxists.</p>
<p>Senate Republicans in late May, <a href="https://www.azmirror.com/2022/05/26/u-s-senate-republicans-block-bill-requiring-agencies-monitor-domestic-terrorism/" target="_blank">blocked a bill</a> that would require federal agencies to monitor domestic terrorism incidents, including those related to White supremacy. Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky said the bill would brand police and military service members as White supremacists.</p>
<p>Sen. Cory Booker, a New Jersey Democrat, said at the hearing that he was worried about the fate of the country.</p>
<p>“On that fateful day in Buffalo we realized the danger of allowing hatred in, any form, in our country to fester,” he said. “It tears at the overall fabric of our democracy. Will we be better at being a multicultural nation?”</p>

In a prime-time address Biden spoke on the need for Congress to pass gun control legislation following a wave of mass shootings including the killing of 19 students and two teachers at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas and a racially-motivated shooting in Buffalo, New York that left 10 dead. (Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden called on Congress to pass gun control legislation in a speech at the White House Thursday evening, following mass shootings in New York, Texas and Oklahoma during the last three weeks.</p>
<p>“This isn’t about taking away anyone’s rights. This is about protecting children,” Biden said. “How much more carnage are we willing to accept?”</p>
<p>The plea came after a White supremacist killed 10 Black people at a supermarket in a predominantly Black neighborhood in Buffalo, New York, on May 14.</p>
<p>Ten days later, an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, was attacked by an 18-year-old man <a href="https://www.statesman.com/story/news/2022/05/26/what-gun-used-texas-school-shooting-ar-15/9940849002/" target="_blank">armed with a rifle </a>and 19 children and two teachers were killed. Another mass shooting at a hospital in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on Wednesday night left four dead.</p>
<p>Biden said Congress should ban assault weapons, like the ones used in the recent mass shootings. And if Congress could not agree to ban them, Biden said the age to purchase an assault weapon should be raised from 18 to 21.</p>
<p>He also expressed his support for laws that would safely store guns in homes where children live, and for an end to the liability shield that prevents civil lawsuits from being brought against gun manufacturers.</p>
<p>“The gun industry special protections are outrageous,” Biden said. “It must end.”</p>
<p>https://twitter.com/RepMcEachin/status/1532513873646977035?s=20&#038;t=QHTPkhsOMEbanNUs6yfvqQ</p>
<p>Firearm related injuries are now the <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2201761" target="_blank">leading cause of death</a> for children and adolescents in the United States, according to the New England Journal of Medicine.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">&#8216;Protecting Our Kids Act&#8217; </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>At the same time Biden spoke at the White House, the U.S. House Judiciary Committee passed a gun control package on a party-line vote, 25-19, following a heated all-day markup called on an emergency basis by Democrats after the recent spate of gun violence. Both the House and Senate are in recess.</p>
<p>The legislation, H.R. 7910, known as the <a href="https://docs.house.gov/meetings/JU/JU00/20220602/114852/BILLS-117HRih.pdf" target="_blank">Protecting Our Kids Act</a>, is made up of eight bills related to gun control, all first introduced in 2021 by Democratic lawmakers. It&#8217;s expected to be on the House floor next week.</p>
<p>While the legislation is expected to pass a Democrat-controlled House, it’s unlikely to advance in the evenly divided Senate, where a small bipartisan group of senators is discussing more limited measures.</p>
<p>https://twitter.com/timkaine/status/1532419111359217664?s=20&#038;t=QHTPkhsOMEbanNUs6yfvqQ</p>
<p>The House gun control package would raise the age of purchasing semiautomatic rifles from 18 to 21, create new requirements for storing guns in a home with children, prevent gun trafficking, require all firearms to be traceable and close the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/4168" target="_blank">loophole on bump stocks</a>, devices that increase the rate of fire of semiautomatic weapons, among other things.</p>
<p>Republicans on the committee raised repeated objections to the bill, blaming mental health problems and a lack of “family values” as the reasons for the recent mass shootings. They criticized Democrats for rushing to pass legislation.</p>
<p>“This is no rush action,” Rep. Steve Cohen, D-Tenn., responded. “This has been delayed for decades.”</p>
<p>https://twitter.com/RepSpanberger/status/1532478512594051085?s=20&#038;t=QHTPkhsOMEbanNUs6yfvqQ</p>
<p>He said all the provisions in the bill should be law today. Cohen added that assault weapons, which are typically used in mass shootings, were banned from 1994 until the law expired in 2004.</p>
<p>Republicans submitted 10 amendments to the bill. Only one was accepted, by Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.house.gov/meetings/JU/JU00/20220602/114852/BILLS-117-HR7910-M001184-Amdt-8.pdf" target="_blank">The amendment</a> would require the attorney general to submit a report to the House and Senate Judiciary committees and to collect “the demographic data of persons who were determined to be ineligible to purchase a firearm based on a background check performed by the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, including race, ethnicity, national origin, sex, gender, age, disability, average annual income, and English language proficiency, if available.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Wisconsin shooting</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Even while House members fought over gun control, more gun violence broke out in Wisconsin, where<a href="https://www.fox6now.com/news/racine-police-graceland-cemetery-shooting" target="_blank"> two people were shot</a> while attending a funeral.</p>
<p>“As we sit here, there are multiple shots near Racine, Wisconsin,” Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, a Texas Democrat, said. “It is obscene, one mass shooting after another.”</p>
<p>Jamie Raskin, a Maryland Democrat, said mass shootings did not start with Buffalo. He argued that Congress has had since the Columbine shooting in Colorado in 1999 to do something about gun control.</p>
<p>But Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, called the markup a “crap proceeding,” saying Republicans did not have enough time to prepare. He said that the goal of Democrats was to “disarm the American people.”</p>
<p>Georgia Democratic Reps. Lucy McBath and Hank Johnson countered that Americans want commonsense gun control laws.</p>
<p>McBath, who became a gun safety advocate after her son Jordan was shot and killed, argued about so-called red flag laws with Florida Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz. Red flag laws allow the courts or law enforcement to temporarily remove a firearm from an individual who is adjudged to pose a threat to themselves or others.</p>
<p>Gaetz submitted an amendment to insert a line into the bill that affirms that “Congress disfavors the enactment of laws that authorize a court to issue an extreme risk protection order, also known as Red Flag laws, in the States because such laws trample on an individual’s due process and Second Amendment rights.”</p>
<p>But McBath said that there is support for red flag laws, including from law enforcement, because they are tools to temporarily remove firearms from people in distress.</p>
<p>“Don&#8217;t you dare try to tout that red flag laws don&#8217;t count,” McBath said, arguing that without the laws, many people’s hands are tied when they want to remove a firearm from a loved one.</p>
<p>Rep. Cliff Bentz, an Oregon Republican, said that the bills before the committee would not immediately end school shootings.</p>
<p>“Each one of these will not help now,” he said. “These things will be challenged (in the courts) and nothing will happen for these kids.”</p>
<p>He criticized Democrats for not reaching out to Republicans to work on bipartisan legislation.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Florida Republican shows off firearms</h4>

	
<p>Rep. Greg Steube, a Florida Republican, who participated in the markup virtually, brandished several of his guns and argued that they would be banned under the proposed laws in the legislative package.</p>
<p>“I hope the gun is not loaded,” Jackson Lee said.</p>
<p>“I&#8217;m at my house, I can do whatever I want with my guns,” Steube said.</p>
<p>https://twitter.com/RepSwalwell/status/1532390639467433989?s=20&#038;t=QHTPkhsOMEbanNUs6yfvqQ</p>
<p>The chair of the Judiciary Committee, Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., asked Steube if he would answer questions, which he declined.</p>
<p>Republican Rep. Mike Johnson of Louisiana blamed secularization for mass shootings, and Republican Rep. Tom Tiffany of Wisconsin said gun violence “came down to family values.”</p>
<p>Tiffany accused Democrats of trying to repeal the Second Amendment, and would not engage with his Democratic colleagues who tried to debate him.</p>
<p>Rep. Madeleine Dean, D-Penn., said she was horrified by the rhetoric from Republicans on the committee and said that they were more concerned with protecting guns than with the victims of gun violence.</p>
<p>“Where is the outrage over the slaughter of 19 kids and two school teachers?” she said.</p>
<p>Dean said that the Second Amendment has been idolized by Republicans.</p>
<p>“Do you think the founding fathers were picturing AR-style weapons?” she said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">School safety</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>GOP lawmakers like Gaetz and Tom McClintock of California argued that gun free zones were actually dangerous and that guns should be allowed on school grounds.</p>
<p>“Perhaps outrage isn’t the best way to write a bill,” Gaetz said.</p>
<p>Rep. Steve Chabot, an Ohio Republican, said that what lawmakers could do immediately is work to make schools safer, such as using funds to hire more resource officers and install metal detectors in schools.</p>
<p>“That’s one area where we could be working for common ground,” he said.</p>
<p>Separately, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the House will take up a bill to ban assault rifles sometime next week, when lawmakers return from recess.</p>
<p>While it will likely pass the House, it has no chance of getting through an evenly divided Senate, where the legislation would need 10 Republicans to join all Democrats to advance.</p>
<p>Pelosi said the House also will vote on McBath’s legislation on red flag laws, the  “Federal Extreme Risk Protection Order Act,” or <a href="https://www.congress.gov/117/bills/hr2377/BILLS-117hr2377ih.pdf" target="_blank">H.R. 2377</a>.</p>
<p>“As we go down this path, it is our responsibility to keep gun violence front and center in the media so that, strengthened by public opinion, we can get life-saving legislation over the finish line,” Pelosi said in a statement.</p>
<p>“To all those in the Congress who would stand in the way of saving lives: your political survival is insignificant compared to the survival of our children.  We will not rest until the job is done.”</p>
<p>Pelosi said the House will also vote on Rep. David Cicilline’s  Active Shooter Alert Act, or <a href="https://www.congress.gov/117/bills/hr6538/BILLS-117hr6538ih.pdf" target="_blank">H.R. 6538</a>, which creates a notification alert system during a mass shooting. The bill by the Rhode Island Democrat has 14 Republican co-sponsors.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Assault-style weapons</h4>

	
<p>None of the bills debated in the House Judiciary markup would ban assault-style weapons, semiautomatic rifles with high-capacity magazines that were used in the New York, Texas and Oklahoma shootings. Pelosi said a hearing on an assault weapons ban will be held, but did not set a date.</p>
<p>Jackson Lee said that Democrats “are not done” and that there needs to be a ban on assault weapons.</p>
<p>But the top Republican on the committee, Jim Jordan of Ohio, said the emergency markup seemed “more of political theater,” and “is not a real attempt, in my judgment, to solve solutions.”</p>

Yesterday a gunman opened fire at the store, killing ten people and wounding another three. Suspect Payton Gendron was taken into custody and charged with first degree murder. U.S. Attorney Merrick Garland released a statement, saying the US Department of Justice is investigating the shooting "as a hate crime and an act of racially-motivated violent extremism".  (Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON — Following mass shootings in New York and Texas, the U.S. House Judiciary Committee is holding an emergency meeting  Thursday to mark up gun control legislation — though it&#8217;s likely doomed.</p>
<p>The package includes eight gun-related bills, known as the “<a href="https://docs.house.gov/meetings/JU/JU00/20220602/114852/BILLS-117HRih.pdf" target="_blank">Protecting Our Kids Act</a>,” and they are expected to pass the Democratic-controlled House. But the legislation has little chance of making it through the evenly divided Senate, where 60 votes would be required for any bill to advance. Assuming every Democrat was in favor, they would need 10 Republicans to join.</p>
<p>The House package would raise the age of purchasing semiautomatic rifles from 18 to 21, create new requirements for storing guns in a home with children, prevent gun trafficking, require all firearms to be traceable and close the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/4168" target="_blank">loophole on bump stocks</a>, devices that increase the rate of fire of semiautomatic weapons, among other things.</p>
<p>The meeting was scheduled by Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, a New York Democrat, after a White supremacist killed 10 Black people at a supermarket in a predominantly Black neighborhood in Buffalo, New York, on May 14. Ten days later, an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, was attacked by an 18-year-old man <a href="https://www.statesman.com/story/news/2022/05/26/what-gun-used-texas-school-shooting-ar-15/9940849002/" target="_blank">armed with a rifle </a>and 19 children and two teachers were killed.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, with both the House and Senate in recess this week, a small bipartisan group of senators is also holding virtual talks to see if it is possible to advance any legislation on guns.</p>
<p>Last week, hours after the Uvalde slaughter, <a href="https://www.marylandmatters.org/2022/05/25/frustrated-democrats-call-for-gop-help-on-federal-gun-laws-after-mass-school-shooting/" target="_blank">Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, did not commit</a> to working on any gun control legislation with Democrats.</p>
<p>However, a few Senate Republicans seemed open to the idea of red flag laws, which allow the courts or law enforcement to temporarily remove a firearm from an individual who is adjudged to pose a threat to themselves or others.</p>
<p>Over the Memorial Day weekend, Sen. Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat who’s worked for years to attempt to pass gun reform laws, tweeted that he’s been talking with senators of both parties about putting together a bipartisan gun violence bill.</p>

<p>“Senator Schumer has given us just over a week to find a compromise,” he wrote. “This time, failure cannot be an option.”</p>
<p>Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said that if Republicans do not work with Democrats to come to an agreement, the Senate will still hold a vote on gun control legislation, even if it fails, when the chamber returns from recess.</p>
<p>After the Uvalde massacre, the nation’s second-deadliest mass school shooting since Sandy Hook Elementary a decade ago, Schumer took a procedural step to begin debate on two background check bills, with the possibility of calling for votes on them.</p>
<p>The House-passed bills are <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/8" target="_blank">H.R. 8</a>, which “establishes new background check requirements for firearm transfers between private parties,” and <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/1446" target="_blank">H.R. 1446</a>, which “increases the amount of time… that a federal firearms’ licensee must wait to receive a completed background check prior to transferring a firearm to an unlicensed person.”</p>
<p>On Sunday, President Joe Biden visited Uvalde and called on Congress to stand up against the gun lobby and send a bill to his desk.</p>
<p>Gun rights groups, such as the National Rifle Association and Gun Owners of America, spent a record of nearly $16 million in lobbying in 2021, campaign finance records show.</p>
<p>“I will meet with Congress on guns, I promise you,” Biden told reporters Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Senate Judiciary Committee is set to hold a hearing on gun violence June 15.</p>

(Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON — U.S. Senate Republicans on Thursday blocked a bill that would require federal agencies to monitor domestic terrorism incidents, including those potentially related to White supremacy.</p>
<p>The failure of the Senate procedural vote showed again how difficult it is for Congress to agree on any response to U.S. gun violence. It followed a racist mass shooting in Buffalo, New York, earlier this month that took the lives of 10 Black people and one at an elementary school in Texas on Tuesday that killed 19 children and two adults.</p>
<p>Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer had scheduled the domestic terrorism legislation, already passed by the Democratic-controlled House, for a vote following the shooting in Buffalo.</p>
<p>“The bill is so important, because the mass shooting in Buffalo was an act of domestic terrorism. We need to call it what it is: domestic terrorism,” said Schumer, a New York Democrat.</p>
<p>“It was terrorism that fed off the poison of conspiracy theories like White replacement theory. Terrorism that left 10 people dead, and a community forever torn asunder.”</p>
<p>But senators fell far short of the 60-vote threshold needed to move debate forward on the legislation. Schumer through a procedural move could bring the bill, <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/350" target="_blank">H.R. 350,</a> up again if there is more support.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_votes/vote1172/vote_117_2_00210.htm#position" target="_blank">The vote was 47-47,</a> with six senators not casting their votes. Only Democrats backed advancing the bill. The House on May 18 had passed the bill, 222-203, with just one Republican vote.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Schumer said Democratic Sens. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, Chris Coons of Delaware, Martin Heinrich of New Mexico, Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, and others are reaching out to Republican senators to work on some type of bipartisan gun control legislation.</p>
<p>“Make no mistake about it, if these negotiations do not bear fruit in a short period of time, the Senate will vote on gun safety legislation,” he said. “But our hope, even amidst our deep skepticism, is that during this week, Democrats and Republicans at long last will come to agree on something meaningful that will reduce gun violence in a real way in America.”</p>
<p>Schumer on the <a href="https://www.azmirror.com/2022/05/25/frustrated-democrats-call-for-gop-help-on-federal-gun-laws-after-mass-school-shooting/" target="_blank">floor Wednesday had implored Senate Republicans</a> to join Democrats in passing the domestic terrorism bill, as well as bipartisan gun control legislation, in reaction to this month&#8217;s mass shootings.</p>
<p>The domestic terrorism legislation creates domestic terrorism offices within the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Justice, and the FBI to monitor domestic terrorist activity and requires Congress to take steps to prevent domestic terrorism. That includes White-supremacist-related incidents or attempted incidents.</p>
<p>The bill also “creates an interagency task force to analyze and combat White supremacist and neo-Nazi infiltration of the uniformed services and federal law enforcement agencies,” according to a bill summary.</p>
<p>Shortly before the procedural vote, Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky said the bill would brand police and military service members as White supremacists.</p>
<p>“To insinuate that the military is consumed with White supremacy is an insult,” Paul said on the Senate floor.</p>
<p><a href="https://rollcall.com/2021/02/16/pentagon-report-reveals-inroads-white-supremacists-have-made-in-military/" target="_blank">The Pentagon drafted a report</a>, obtained by Roll Call, that found U.S. military personnel and veterans were considered high prizes as recruits for White supremacist groups.</p>
<p>The chair of the Senate Committee on Judiciary, Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, said that the bill would not create any new laws, and the purpose of it is for Congress to be informed of reports of domestic terrorism.</p>
<p>Durbin said on the Senate floor that it’s important to include the threat of White supremacy in that category because “this is a category of crime in America that is metastasizing.”</p>
<p>There have been several shootings in the last few years that have targeted communities of color and places of worship. Besides Buffalo, that includes Atlanta, where shootings at several spa shops  targeted Asian-American women; El Paso, Texas, where dozens of Latinos were gunned down; and Pittsburgh, where the Tree of Life synagogue was targeted.</p>

(Photo by Jordan Vonderhaar/Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON — U.S. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on Wednesday implored Senate Republicans to work with Democrats to pass bipartisan gun control legislation, following a mass school shooting that took the lives of 19 children and two teachers in Texas.</p>
<p>Tuesday’s massacre was the nation’s second-deadliest mass school shooting since another at Sandy Hook Elementary in Connecticut a decade ago.</p>
<p>“Please, please, please, damn it, put yourself in the shoes of these parents for once,” Schumer said on the Senate floor.</p>
<p>“Maybe that thought — putting yourself in the shoes of these parents instead of the arms of the NRA — might let you wriggle free from the vise-like grip of the NRA.”</p>
<p>Schumer acknowledged that it was unlikely that 10 Republicans would join Democrats in passing any type of legislation in the evenly split Senate, a sentiment that many in his party also expressed. Sixty votes would be needed to advance gun legislation.</p>
<p>“It’s going to fail,” Sen. Cory Booker, a New Jersey Democrat, said, according to Capitol Hill pool reports.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Background checks</h4>

	
<p>Schumer, a New York Democrat, took a procedural step to begin debate on two background check bills, with the possibility of calling for votes on the bills.</p>
<p>The two bills he put on the Senate calendar passed the House last year. They are <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/8" target="_blank">H.R. 8</a>, which “establishes new background check requirements for firearm transfers between private parties,” and <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/1446" target="_blank">H.R. 1446</a>, which “increases the amount of time… that a federal firearms&#8217; licensee must wait to receive a completed background check prior to transferring a firearm to an unlicensed person.”</p>
<p>But the filibuster is a hurdle for Democratic action on guns in the Senate. Two Senate Democrats, Joe Manchin III of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, have already said they have no plans to change their position on amending the 60-vote threshold required by the filibuster.</p>
<p>“I do not think on this issue, there are 10 Republicans that are serious about doing the things that will make us safer,” Booker said.</p>

<p>Less than a week ago, Booker <a href="https://www.booker.senate.gov/news/press/booker-menendez-blumenthal-reintroduce-federal-firearm-licensing-act" target="_blank">reintroduced the Federal Firearm Licensing Act</a>, which would require individuals to obtain a firearm license from the Department of Justice before purchasing or receiving a firearm.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden spoke Tuesday night about the school shooting from the White House, calling for Congress to pass common sense gun laws, and blaming the gun industry.</p>
<p>“The gun manufacturers have spent two decades aggressively marketing assault weapons, which make them the most and largest profit,” he said. “For God’s sake, we have to have the courage to stand up to the industry.”</p>
<p>Biden is set to visit the site of the mass shooting in Uvalde, Texas, later this week.</p>
<p>Sen. Mark Kelly, an Arizona Democrat, said “it’s (expletive) nuts to do nothing about this,&#8221; following the Texas shooting, according to Capitol Hill pool reports.</p>
<p>Kelly’s wife, Gabby Giffords, is a former congresswoman who survived an assassination attempt when she was shot while meeting with constituents. She now runs a gun safety advocacy group.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Red flag laws</h4>

	
<p>A handful of Senate Republicans have expressed support for “red flag” laws, which have been used to prevent mass shootings, suicides, and deadly domestic violence disputes by allowing courts or law enforcement to temporarily remove a firearm from an individual who is distressed.</p>
<p>Various states have such laws, many passed following the Parkland school shooting in Florida in 2018, but it’s unclear whether there would be enough bipartisan agreement to write red flag provisions into federal law.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.azmirror.com/2021/04/08/biden-administration-to-suggest-model-red-flag-gun-laws-for-states/" target="_blank">The Biden administration directed </a>the Department of Justice last year to distribute model red flag legislation to states. The District of Columbia and <a href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2021/10/05/red-flag-laws-are-saving-lives-they-could-save-more" target="_blank">19 states have red flag laws</a>.</p>
<p>Sen. Roy Blunt, a Missouri Republican, said that while red flag laws could be useful, he pointed out that New York has some of the strictest red flag laws and could not prevent the mass shooting on May 14 in Buffalo, New York.</p>
<p>“I don&#8217;t know that there&#8217;s any one solution here,” Blunt said, according to Capitol Hill pool reports.</p>
<p>In Buffalo, a White supremacist killed 10 Black people at a supermarket in a predominantly Black neighborhood. The attack was based off “The Great Replacement Theory,” a racist conspiracy theory that states immigrants and people of color will lead to the extinction of the White race, <a href="https://immigrationforum.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Replacement-Theory-Explainer-1122.pdf" target="_blank">according to the National Immigration Forum</a>.</p>
<p>Sen. Rick Scott, a Florida Republican, said he was supportive of red flag laws, and pointed out that Florida has its own.</p>
<p>“People that are harming themselves, threatening to harm themselves or somebody else, they shouldn&#8217;t act,” he said, according to Capitol Hill pool reports.</p>
<p>House Majority Whip Steny Hoyer, a Maryland Democrat, <a href="https://twitter.com/LeaderHoyer/status/1529541327930773506" target="_blank">said</a> the House will take up Georgia Democratic Rep. Lucy McBath’s red flag bill in June, which would “prevent those who pose a threat to themselves or others from being able to legally possess a firearm.”</p>
<p>But Sen. Tommy Tuberville, an Alabama Republican, argued that guns were not the problem with the Texas school mass shooting, and it was instead a mental health problem.</p>
<p>“I&#8217;m very sorry it happened, but guns are not the problem,” he said, according to Capitol Hill pool reports. “People are the problem, that&#8217;s where it starts … we’ve had guns forever, and we&#8217;re gonna continue to have guns.”</p>

    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Gun rights lobbying muscle</h4>

	
<p>Gun rights groups, such as the National Rifle Association and Gun Owners of America, spent a record of nearly $16 million in lobbying in 2021, campaign finance records show.</p>
<p>After the 2012 Sandy Hook mass school shooting, where 20 children, ages 6 and 7, and six school staff were killed, <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2022/05/gun-rights-groups-set-new-lobbying-spending-record-in-2021/?andcache=&amp;utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=twitt_gun-lobbing/5/16/22" target="_blank">the amount of money spent lobbying by gun rights groups more than doubled</a>, from $6 million in 2012 to $15 million in 2013, according to an analysis by the campaign finance watchdog Open Secrets.</p>
<p>The NRA spent nearly $5 million lobbying Congress in 2021,<a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/federal-lobbying/clients/summary?cycle=2021&amp;id=D000000082" target="_blank"> according to Open Secrets</a>. For the first quarter of 2022, the NRA has spent $650,000 lobbying Congress, <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/federal-lobbying/clients/summary?cycle=2022&amp;id=D000000082" target="_blank">according to Open Secrets</a>.</p>
<p>Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, did not comment on the Senate floor on Wednesday about whether Republicans would work with Democrats to pass any gun control legislation.</p>
<p>He instead offered his condolences to the Uvalde families and community that lost 19 children and two teachers to gun violence.</p>
<p>He described the shooter as “deranged” and called the act “senseless evil.”</p>
<p>The shooter, 18-year-old Salvador Ramos, legally bought two AR-15 style rifles just days before the attack, Texas law enforcement said.</p>
<p>Schumer came back to the Senate floor after McConnell’s speech and asked on the Senate floor if Republicans would join Democrats in passing the domestic terrorism bill coming to the floor for a vote Thursday. The bill would allow for the creation of special offices within the Department of Justice, FBI and Department of Homeland Security to investigate and monitor domestic terrorism.</p>
<p>The bill passed the House, 222-203, with only one House Republican voting with Democrats, Rep Adam Kinzinger of Illinois.</p>
<p>“Thoughts and prayers are not enough,” Schumer said. “We need action.”</p>
<p>Sen. Jon Tester, a Montana Democrat, said he was frustrated that the NRA and Republicans weren’t supportive about background checks, because they used to be in the past.</p>
<p>“I don’t know what the hell has changed, but I’ll tell you what hasn’t changed — mass shootings,” he said, according to Capitol Hill pool reports.</p>
<p>When a reporter asked about legislation for a ban on assault weapons — like the one used in the Texas and most mass shootings — Tester said there was no way that type of legislation would pass when Congress couldn’t pass background checks.</p>
<p>“It ain’t gonna pass,” he said. “Kids got killed yesterday. For Christ’s sake, let’s talk about what can be done, not about what somebody wants.”</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students and teachers told U.S. House members during a Thursday hearing that their right to talk about race and LGBTQ+ issues in public schools is being silenced due to an onslaught of new state laws as well as pressure on school boards from right-wing advocates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“To be crystal clear, this is about disrupting and destroying public education,” James Whitfield, a former principal in Texas and one of the witnesses, told lawmakers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The House Oversight and Reform </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Civil Rights and Civil Liberties Subcommittee</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> held the hearing to examine the impact of new state laws that bar educators from discussing American history, race and LGBTQ+ issues in K-12 public classrooms. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://floridaphoenix.com/2022/03/31/fl-lgbtq-students-parents-and-advocacy-group-sues-state-over-dont-say-gay-law/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Florida recently passed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t Say Gay” bill that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">prohibits discussion of gender identity and sexual orientation in public classrooms in kindergarten through third grade and allows it only when age-appropriate among older kids</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. One of the witnesses, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jennifer Cousins,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">a mother from Orlando, said the legislation would mean her children would be prevented from speaking about their older sibling, who is nonbinary, in the classroom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Laws like Florida’s officially named ‘Parental Rights in Education’ seek to erase (LGBTQ+ people’s) existence for our youngest of children, who by nature are already more open to learning about diversity and accepting one another despite their differences, and definitely deny parents like me a safe learning environment for my children,” Cousins said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Teenagers from Texas, Michigan and Ohio told House lawmakers that the constant attacks from right-wing advocacy groups and lack of support from school administrative officials are taking a toll on their mental health and affecting their education. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Teachers are being vilified,” Elle Caldon of Dallas County, Texas, said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She told a story about how stickers supporting LGBTQ+ pride, showing rainbows or flags, were scraped off classroom doors in her school without an explanation. When Caldon’s teacher pushed school officials to give a reasoning, her contract was not renewed, Caldon said.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">States limit discussions of race</h4>

	
<p><a href="https://www.edweek.org/policy-politics/map-where-critical-race-theory-is-under-attack/2021/06" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">An analysis by Education Week</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found that since January 2021, 42 states have  introduced legislation or other measures to restrict the teachings of critical race theory, or discussion of race and sexism in the classroom. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Critical race theory is not taught at the K-12 level, but Republicans at the state, local and federal level have drummed up the false narrative that children are being taught an academic theory – that is meant to study how race intersects with the legal field — in the classroom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Claire Mengel of Hamilton County, Ohio, told House members about how their school’s Diversity Day </span><a href="https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/2022/05/01/ohio-school-district-wont-allow-diversity-day-during-school-hours/9608669002/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">was canceled</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an optional event where students, who need to get parental permission to attend, could listen to speakers from different cultures and backgrounds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mengel said they and their classmates soon discovered that the newest school board members ran on a platform opposed to critical race theory and canceled the event.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our event is not about CRT, our event is about diversity,” they said. “The school board brought politics into our schools when they attacked our event. Their actions have harmed our education, our mental health, and our community.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Krisha Ramani of Oakland County, Michigan, pointed to the recent book bans across the country and argued that young people like herself have the capacity to talk, debate and hold tough conversations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For the parents of those who may disagree with these various perspectives, banning books for all students infringes on their own right to hold conversations about the social landscape,” she said.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Second congressional hearing</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the second of the subcommittee’s hearings on attacks on freedom of speech. </span><a href="https://www.marylandmatters.org/2022/04/07/more-than-1500-books-have-been-banned-in-public-schools-and-a-u-s-house-panel-asks-why/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In early April, the panel </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">examined</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> why thousands of books, predominantly written by marginalized authors, have been banned from public schools, and the impact of those actions on students and teachers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The classroom censorship laws being passed and proposed are the hallmark of authoritarian regimes — removing anything from the public sphere that does not comport with a strict party-line and then demonizing it,” Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Maryland Democrat and the chair of the Civil Rights and Civil Liberties Subcommittee, said in his opening remarks on Thursday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suzanne Nossel, the chief executive officer of PEN America, said her organization has tracked books that have been banned in classrooms and in libraries since 2021. PEN America is an organization that advocates for the freedom of speech. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She said there is a “wave of censorship that is engulfing our classrooms.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nossel said a </span><a href="https://pen.org/banned-in-the-usa/#conclusion" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by PEN America found from July 2021 to the end of March this year, more than 1,500 books were banned in 86 school districts in 26 states.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The witness tapped by Republicans, Virginia Gentles of the Independent Women’s Forum, argued that parents should have the choice to not send their children to public school and should be provided with vouchers to send their children to private institutions that have a curriculum with which they agree.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gentles is the director of the Education Freedom Center at IWF, a right-wing public policy group that is backed by the Koch brothers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whitfield said that type of rhetoric is “a ploy to divert public school dollars to subsidize private education in the name of ‘choice.’”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Educators who pour their heart and soul into the growth and development of young people have been placed squarely in the crosshairs of political groups who are determined to destroy public education,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whitfield, who is Black, </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2021/11/10/texas-principal-critical-race-theory-whitfield/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">had to resign from his job </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">after he was accused of promoting critical race theory due to a letter he wrote to students about the summer protests of 2020 following the murder of George Floyd. He was the school&#8217;s first Black principal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina, the top Republican on the panel, said she felt state and local governments should be able to make their own decisions about classroom curriculum and that students should be focused on education and not difficult topics such as race.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our children&#8217;s innocence should be protected and prioritized,” she said. </span></p>

(NBC12)</p><p>WASHINGTON — U.S. House lawmakers questioned several labor experts Wednesday before a House Education and Labor panel about how a new bill to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 would protect workers from wage theft.</p>
<p>House Appropriations Chair Rosa DeLauro introduced the bill, <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/3712" target="_blank">H.R. 3712</a>, known as the “Wage Theft Prevention and Wage Recovery Act of 2022.” It would require employers to provide pay stubs to workers, establish new minimum and maximum civil penalties for employers who engage in wage theft and provide grants to organizations and institutions to enhance the enforcement of wage and hour laws.</p>
<p>“It is unacceptable that dishonest employers can steal workers’ wages with little to no consequence,” House Education and Labor Committee Chair Bobby Scott (D-Va.) said. “This bill would take critical steps to help workers receive the full pay they’ve earned for all hours worked, including overtime pay, and level the playing field for law-abiding employers.”</p>
<p>U.S. Sen. Patty Murray, the chair of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, sponsored the bill on the Senate side.</p>
<p>Republicans on the Workforce Protections subcommittee said the piece of legislation would harm small business owners and slammed Democrats for calling employers “thieves,” however no Democrat on the subcommittee did.</p>
<p>“Calling our country&#8217;s job creators thieves is beyond outrageous,” said Rep. Fred Keller of Pennsylvania, the ranking Republican on the panel. “It would be more predictive to provide compliance assistance, rather than assume employers are bad actors.”</p>
<p>Rep. Alma Adams (D-N.C.), chair of the subcommittee, said that low-income workers are more likely to experience wage theft, which includes minimum wage, overtime, off-the-clock, tip, and meal-break violations. Adams asked one of the witnesses, Karen Cacace, the Labor Bureau chief for the New York State Office of the Attorney General, what the impact of wage theft can be on those low-income workers.</p>
<p>“Low-income workers are typically living paycheck to paycheck,” Cacace said. “They do not have savings in the bank if their employer does not pay them for the wages they are owed for the last week.”</p>
<p>Another witness, Daniel Swenson-Klatt, an owner of a bakery in Minneapolis, said as a small business owner, he didn’t feel that passing a bill to require business owners to provide a pay stub to their employees was burdensome, as many Republicans on the committee, including  Keller and Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks (R-Iowa), raised concerns about.</p>
<p>“I don’t think it’s ridiculous to take on the bad actors,” Swenson-Klatt said of placing a fine on employers who are found guilty of wage theft.</p>
<p>Cacace added that requiring employers to issue pay stubs to their employees “is the bare minimum.”</p>
<p>“Pay your workers the right amount and nobody is bankrupting your business,” she said.</p>
<p>Keller asked Tammy McCutchen, a senior affiliate at Resolution Economics in Washington, D.C., if she felt the bill by DeLauro (D-Conn.) would be a burden to small businesses.</p>
<p>McCutchen said that the increase in civil penalties would harm small businesses if they made a mistake, potentially bankrupting those businesses.</p>
<p>“Good employers make mistakes because compliance is hard,” she said.</p>
<p>Rep. Donald Norcross (D-N.J.) said he has never heard of an “honest mistake” causing a small business to go bankrupt and said the piece of legislation was meant to go after employers willfully engaging in wage theft.</p>
<p>“The ones we are talking about today are intentional,” he said, “and hurt real people.”</p>
<p>Norcross asked another witness, Francisco Esparza of Upper Marlboro, Maryland, about his experience with dealing with an employer who participated in wage theft.</p>
<p>Esparza, who worked in construction, said that he would work seven days a week and not receive overtime and for weeks on end his paycheck was made out as a personal check, rather than a pay stub.</p>
<p>“This isn’t an accident by any stretch of imagination,” Norcross said after hearing Esparza’s story.</p>
<p>Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) said that in her own state contractors have experienced some type of wage theft. <a href="https://minnesotareformer.com/2022/05/04/workers-on-vikings-development-claim-over-100000-in-wage-theft/" target="_blank">Last week</a>, about 40 workers who did work on the Vikings Lake development – owned by the family who owns the NFL Minnesota Vikings team– claimed they experienced wage theft amounting to an estimated $100,000.</p>
<p>“It is clear more DOL (Department of Labor) funding and additional federal reforms are needed in our localities in order to protect our most vulnerable workers,” she said.</p>

The books have since been returned to the shelves. (Max McCoy / Kansas Reflector)</p><p>In some Tennessee classrooms, a nonfiction comic book about the atrocities of the Holocaust is banned.</p>
<p>And one school district in Wisconsin banned from libraries a picture book about a gay rights activist who was assassinated.</p>
<p>In the last nine months, hundreds of books across dozens of states are being banned. A majority of the bans feature books written by authors who are people of color, LGBTQ+, Black and Indigenous, and feature characters from marginalized groups.</p>
<p>And now, some state lawmakers are joining the movement, spurred by conservative groups, to ban books from public schools and libraries.</p>
<p>This year in Arizona, <a href="https://www.azmirror.com/2022/03/16/bill-to-ban-books-with-descriptions-of-sex-from-arizona-schools-moves-forward/" target="_blank">state Republicans put forth a measure</a> that would ban schools from teaching or directing students to study any material that is “sexually explicit.” In Florida, <a href="https://floridaphoenix.com/2022/03/25/desantis-approves-boost-to-parental-input-on-school-library-books-critics-fear-bans/" target="_blank">Gov. Ron DeSantis recently signed a bill</a> to allow parents greater opportunity to review, and potentially object to, school library books that they find inappropriate. Virginia&#8217;s General Assembly, with some <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/02/09/virginia-senate-votes-to-give-parents-final-say-over-sexually-explicit-classroom-materials/" target="_blank">bipartisan</a> support, also<a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+sum+SB656" target="_blank"> passed legislation</a> giving parents a say as to whether their children are assigned sexually explicit materials in schools.</p>
<p>And in<a href="https://idahocapitalsun.com/2022/03/07/idaho-house-passes-bill-that-could-lead-to-prosecution-of-librarians-for-harmful-material/" target="_blank"> Idaho,</a> state House Republicans passed a bill that would allow librarians to be prosecuted for allowing minors to check out material deemed harmful.</p>
<p>Some of the states with the most aggressive book bans include Texas with 713 bans, Pennsylvania with 456 bans and Florida with 204 bans.</p>
<p>Deborah Caldwell-Stone, the director of the American Library Association’s Office for Intellectual Freedom, said book bans the last 10 years have dealt “with the lives of LGBTQIA persons, either reflecting their experiences, or talking about issues of concern to the LGBTQIA community.”</p>
<p>She said those bans have ranged from picture books depicting same-sex couples to young adult books talking about gender identities.</p>
<p>Caldwell-Stone said, “the one thing that has interrupted this” trend of banning books centered around LGBTQ+ themes comes after the 2020 murder of George Floyd by Minnesota police officer Derek Chauvin.</p>
<p>“There was an increased number of challenges to books dealing with race and racism that accelerated when we started seeing complaints from organized groups about critical race theory,” she said.</p>
<p>“And so when I say critical race theory, I&#8217;m not using it in the sense that it actually should be used, which is to describe a graduate level academic analysis of law and political systems, but this use of it to describe books and materials that offer alternative perspectives on American history that reflect the lives of Black persons and their experience of slavery, their experiences with police violence, and so we&#8217;ve seen a rising number of challenges to those books.”</p>
<p>Some of those groups that have challenged school boards include Moms for Liberty, an organization that has strong GOP ties and has local chapters that “target local school board meetings, school board members, administrators, and teachers” to push right-wing policies, as <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/critical-race-theory/unmasking-moms-liberty" target="_blank">reported by Media Matters</a>. Moms for Liberty has more than 100 local chapters across 35 states.</p>
<p>“We&#8217;re seeing nationally organized groups create local chapters, and use social media to amplify their demands,” Caldwell-Stone said. “They will tell you that they&#8217;re asserting parental rights to direct their children&#8217;s education, but the impact of their activities is to deny other parents the right to make decisions about their own children&#8217;s education, and particularly for older adolescents denying the First Amendment rights and agency for elder adolescents to read and access the materials they find important for their lives.”</p>
<p>Congressional Democrats have also raised concerns about the increase in book bans across the country. <a href="https://georgiarecorder.com/2022/04/07/more-than-1500-books-have-been-banned-in-public-schools-and-a-u-s-house-panel-asks-why/" target="_blank">At a recent hearing</a>, Maryland Democrat Rep. Jamie Raskin, cited a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hTs_PB7KuTMBtNMESFEGuK-0abzhNxVv4tgpI5-iKe8/edit#gid=660619424" target="_blank">report by PEN America</a> — an organization that advocates for the protection of free speech — that found from July 2021 to the end of March this year, more than 1,500 books were banned in 86 school districts in 26 states.</p>
<p>The report was limited to &#8220;actions that resulted in removals or restrictions of books of any kind for at least a period of one day,&#8221; which includes some books that were temporarily pulled from shelves but in some cases returned, as was the case with a dust-up over sexually explicit illustrations in &#8220;Gender Queer&#8221; in <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2021/11/23/fairfax-schools-gender-queer-lawn-boy/" target="_blank">Fairfax County</a>. Loudoun County, in contrast, opted to remove the book from school libraries, with the superintendent saying the graphic sexual depictions  &#8220;ran counter to what is appropriate in school,&#8221;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2022/01/15/loudoun-schools-book-removed/" target="_blank"> The Washington Post reported</a>.</p>
<p>Ruby Bridges, a civil rights icon who was the first Black child to desegregate an all-White Louisiana school, was a key witness at the hearing. Children’s books about her story – “Brand New School, Brave New Ruby,” and “The Story of Ruby Bridges&#8221; – have been banned from classrooms in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>“The truth is that rarely do children of color or immigrants see themselves in these textbooks we are forced to use,” <a href="https://www.penncapital-star.com/arts-culture/york-pa-students-who-fought-book-ban-tell-their-story-to-u-s-house-panel/" target="_blank">Bridges told lawmakers</a>. “I write because I want them to understand the contributions their ancestors have made to our great country, whether that contribution was made as slaves or volunteers.”</p>
<p>Banning books is not a new thing, and since the 1980s, the American Libraries Association has celebrated those books that are taken off the shelves for its yearly “Banned Books Week.”</p>
<p>Books have been banned for racist depictions or language, such as “Huckleberry Finn” by Mark Twain and “Of Mice and Men” by John Steinbeck because of its racial slurs. And in 2021, Dr. Seuss Enterprises <a href="https://www.seussville.com/statement-from-dr-seuss-enterprises/" target="_blank">announced</a> it would no longer reprint six Dr. Seuss books, including “And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street,” and “If I Ran the Zoo.”</p>
<p>“These books portray people in ways that are hurtful and wrong,” Dr. Seuss Enterprises said in a statement.</p>
<p>But the uptick and rate at which books are now being challenged and banned in schools, has alarmed many freedom of speech advocates such as Jonathan Friedman, the director of PEN&#8217;s Free Expression and Education program, and author of the report Raskin referred to during a House hearing.</p>
<p>“It’s not just a parent getting angry about a book in a one-off fashion,” he said in an interview with States Newsroom.</p>
<p>Friedman said some parents or local activists will submit hundreds of books to be challenged and removed off shelves.</p>
<p>“It’s happening all over, so it’s not just one part of the country. A list of books that might be deemed illicit by a group of parents in one state is being used in other states as well,” he said.</p>
<p>Friedman said he’s noticed most of the escalation of book banning happened in the fall of 2021, and pointed to a large swath of book bans that started in Leander, a school district in Texas.</p>
<p>“I think a lot of the energy around that (trend), set off of anti-mask energy, and you know, sort of frustrations of a pandemic,” Friedman said.</p>
<p>During a school board meeting, a parent read an excerpt of “Out of Darkness” by Ashley Hope Pérez that has a euphemism for anal sex that is historically accurate for the time the book takes place in, which is the 1930s.</p>
<p>That book was one of 120 that students could choose from based off of an optional curriculum, such as a book club.</p>
<p>“And in response, the district suspended the entire curriculum and launched a review, a kind of book by book review, much of it seemingly developing on the fly,” he said. “So they went through a year-long process, but some have serious questions about how much that process was conducted in a way that was fair.”</p>
<p>Banning books in the classroom is an issue the Supreme Court took up in 1982 in <i>Island Trees School District v. Pico</i>. In a 5-4 decision, the Court <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/1981/80-2043" target="_blank">ruled</a> in the student’s favor, affirming that the First Amendment limits the power of junior high and high school administrative officials to remove books from school libraries based on the books’ content.</p>
<p>But in that court decision, because “given the sensibilities of young people” schools were given discretion to remove books that were deemed “pervasively vulgar,” or “educationally unsuitable,” Caldwell-Stone said.</p>
<p>“Because the court really didn&#8217;t define these terms, they become a kind of magic word,” she said. “If we say those magic words that will make it legal for us to remove this book when, in fact, the actual motivation behind removing the book is because the book is about two gay teens finding each other and falling in love.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Virginia</h4>

	
<p>In Virginia at least seven school districts pulled books pending investigations per the PEN America report: Fairfax, Harrisonburg, Henrico, Loudoun, New Kent, Spotsylvania and Virginia Beach, though some of the titles <a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/news/education/vp-nw-virginia-beach-banned-books-20220212-ibj5flyrp5hwtfiidipylfgs74-story.html" target="_blank">were later restored to shelves.</a></p>
<p>The titles that most commonly drew scrutiny were:</p>
<ul>
<li>“All Boys Aren&#8217;t Blue,” George M. Johnson’s young adult non-fiction memoir, consisting of essays about his life growing up as a queer Black man in New Jersey and Virginia.</li>
<li>“Lawn Boy,” Jonathan Evison’s semi-autobiographical coming of age story about a Mexican American boy’s experience, touching on issues of race, class and sexuality.</li>
<li>“Gender Queer: A Memoir,” a comic book by Maia Kobabe about Kobabe&#8217;s path to gender-identity as nonbinary and queer.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other books included “I&#8217;m A Gay Wizard,” by V.S. Santoni, which is a story about a gay teen and his best friend, a trans girl, who spend their summer getting involved in magic, and “The Poet X,” by Elizabeth Acevedo which is a novel about a teenage girl who works through her family issues by writing poetry.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">WASHINGTON — Jon Zang walks his dog several times a day in his mobile home community in West Goshen Township, Pennsylvania.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s quiet, as most of his neighbors are at work. But he often wonders how many more walks he and his bulldog mix, Ladybug, will have down the streets of the place he’s called home for 21 years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We’re literally sitting on a time bomb that we’re sure is going to go off at some point, but we don’t know when,” Zang said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">His park was purchased by an investment company, Walkart Inc., that residents say is trying to</span><a href="http://www.westgoshen.org/AgendaCenter/ViewFile/Item/249?fileID=867" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400"> change the county zoning laws</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> to close down a community that’s been home to 60 manufactured homes since 1957. Walkart, which could not be reached for comment, wants to build luxury apartments in its stead, according to Zang and  a report in the </span><a href="https://www.dailylocal.com/2021/12/06/west-goshen-mobile-home-residents-to-officials-dont-kick-us-out/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">Daily Local News.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“They just want this property to expand their stranglehold on the rental communities of West Chester,” said Zang, who pays $550 a month for his lot compared to an </span><a href="https://www.rentcafe.com/average-rent-market-trends/us/pa/chester-county/west-chester/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">average rent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> in the area of $1,700 monthly for a one-bedroom apartment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mobile home parks provide affordable housing for millions of low-income residents — including seniors on fixed incomes — to own homes while renting the land underneath. The average cost of a manufactured home in 2019 was about $82,000, according to a </span><a href="https://www.manufacturedhousing.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/2021-MHI-Quick-Facts-updated-05-2021.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> by Manufactured Housing Institute, a trade organization representing the industry.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But in an exploding housing market, that land is increasingly in demand for other projects, or park owners propose major rent hikes or changes in leases. Residents have few protections under a patchwork of state laws. In Virginia, it&#8217;s unknown how many mobile homes there actually are. A 2021 budget amendment from Del. Paul Krizek, D-Fairfax, would have tasked the state with creating a registry but it failed. </span></p>

<p>Krizek, who says he&#8217;ll push for it again next year, said it&#8217;s important to keep tabs on mobile home units amid an affordable housing crush.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s important to know whether we&#8217;re losing that housing stock,&#8221; he said. Krizek has five mobile home parks in his district. &#8220;It&#8217;s a great form of naturally-occurring affordable housing.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Congress might be expected to step in, since some mobile home parks are bought by private equity firms that use federally subsidized loans that carry low interest rates. But there’s been little movement in Washington, D.C.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The invisibility of mobile home parks is a huge problem,” Andrew </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Rumbach, an associate professor with the Department of Urban Planning at Texas A&amp;M University, said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s difficult to understand the scope of people living in these communities, as there is no federal database. But it is estimated that there are 2.7 million mobile homes across 45,600 mobile home parks in 49 states, said</span> <span style="font-weight: 400">Paul Bradley, the president of </span><a href="https://rocusa.org/fund-a-community-project/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">ROC USA</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> — a nonprofit based in New Hampshire that helps residents purchase their mobile home communities</span><b>. </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What’s more, in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic, some of the most frequent filers of evictions on a county-by-county basis were owners of mobile home parks, according to data collected by Eviction Lab. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For example, the owner of a mobile home community was the top filer of eviction cases in </span><a href="https://evictionlab.org/eviction-tracking/cincinnati-oh/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">Cincinnati</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, in Hamilton County, Ohio, with almost 200 eviction files through November 2021, said </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Jacob Haas, a research specialist at Eviction Lab, a project by Princeton University that collects and publishes the first-ever dataset of evictions in the U.S.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mobile home park owners were the top 10 filers of evictions in Florida’s Alachua, Duval  and Pinellas counties, according to data collected by Eviction Lab.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s not uncommon at all for manufactured home communities to show up among the locations that have the most (eviction) filings during the pandemic,” Haas said. </span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">50 states, 50 policies</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">During the pandemic, amid sickness and job losses, mobile home park residents also have grappled with rent hikes or revisions of their leases, often with little help from state laws. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There&#8217;s basically 50 different policies for how to protect residents in these parks,” said Esther Sullivan, an assistant professor of sociology at the University of Colorado Denver. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“In many cases, they are disadvantaged by omission, meaning a state usually doesn&#8217;t have laws on the books that directly address the rights of park residents and the responsibilities of park owners,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the worst case scenarios, some residents must abandon their properties because they can no longer afford to rent the land below their homes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Cesiah Guadarrama Trejo, a housing advocate who also lives in a manufactured housing community in Colorado, said that when people own their homes but cannot afford the rent hikes, “</span><span style="font-weight: 400">that will eventually displace people.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If a resident can no longer afford the plot of land they rent, it’s not like they can move their homes, said Dave Anderson, the executive director for All Parks Alliance for Change, a tenants’ union for residents of Minnesota&#8217;s manufactured home parks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The cost of moving a mobile home — assuming it doesn’t damage the structure — can range from $5,000 to $8,000.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anderson said the trend he’s noticed in the Twin Cities is out-of-state companies buying parks and trying to rewrite leases.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There’s a much more aggressive plan for generating profits out of these purchases,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Some states, like Pennsylvania, have 60-day notice requirements for any rent increases, said Daniel Vitek, a staff attorney at Community Justice Project in Pennsylvania. But there’s no state law to prevent aggressive rent hikes, he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Vitek said one protection that Pennsylvania gives mobile home park residents is a requirement for six months notice of a park’s closure, and the owner of the park must pay for the appraisal of the mobile home. Depending on the appraisal, that homeowner might be compensated for the worth of the manufactured home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t want to make it sound like Pennsylvania is a great place to live in a mobile home park because even though it has its own statute and provides for a lot more protections than, say, a tenant in just a normal landlord-tenant relationship, they&#8217;re still pretty weak protections,” he said. “And the tenants are at the mercy of a bad owner quite a bit.”</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Where’s Congress?</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The invisibility of mobile home parks extends to the federal level, despite deep government involvement in the housing and mortgage industry that is supposed to prop up the availability of low-income housing — especially manufactured housing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We need people to be able to see these places and see what they are and what value they have and then make good, intelligent policy decisions to protect people who live there,” </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Rumbach said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">U.S. Rep. Cindy Axne, D-Iowa, </span><a href="https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/2021/05/26/bill-of-rights-for-residents-of-manufactured-housing-introduced-in-congress/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">introduced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> legislation last year that would extend tenants’ rights to help residents get at least a 60-day notice of rent increases. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In a statement to States Newsroom, Axne said movement on legislation for manufactured housing has stalled since the president’s social spending plan, known as Build Back Better, died in the Senate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The House passed its version of the bill that included a $500 million </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Manufactured Housing Community Infrastructure Improvement Grant program </span><span style="font-weight: 400">that would have helped resident-owned groups and nonprofits in buying and preserving manufactured housing communities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, a Nevada Democrat, </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/3188/actions?r=243&amp;s=1" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">introduced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> a stand-alone </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Manufactured Housing Community Infrastructure Improvement Grant program in November. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, sent a letter in January 2020 to the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation — the government-sponsored enterprises known as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Brown questioned how many manufactured housing communities are being bought by private equity firms that obtained billions in low-cost loans through those entities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Brown noted there is little data available on private equity’s involvement, and that Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae are just two outlets for financing, but said Congress needs a better understanding of the situation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I have seen first-hand how residents in these communities, many of whom are elderly and have fixed incomes, have experienced rent and other housing cost increases with few consumer protections,”</span> <span style="font-weight: 400">the Ohio Democrat said in a </span><a href="https://www.banking.senate.gov/newsroom/minority/brown-demands-information-from-fannie-and-freddie-on-private-equity-investment-in-manufactured-housing" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">statement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Brown, along with Axne, traveled to Waukee, Iowa, to visit residents of Midwest Country Estates, a mobile home community that had been recently bought by a private equity firm in Utah, Havenpark Capitol. Axne said many of the residents </span><a href="https://wisconsinexaminer.com/2021/06/02/bill-of-rights-for-residents-of-manufactured-housing-introduced-in-congress/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">experienced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> a 70% increase in rent hikes from the firm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Brown in his letter raised numerous questions about Fannie Mac and Freddie Mac and the effect of private equity firm ownership on manufactured housing. The Senate Banking Committee declined to share the responses received from the two agencies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At a recent Senate Banking Committee hearing, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, criticized private equity firms for creating a housing crisis, especially for seniors in mobile home parks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So Wall Street investors buying up manufactured home communities threatens the remaining affordable housing stock that seniors rely on,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It means that seniors have fewer opportunities to age in their own homes and that they risk being squeezed by rising rents, leaving them even with less money to buy medicine and to put food on the table. Congress needs to act to weaken the investors&#8217; grip on the housing market.”</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Debate over federal protections</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The most recent federal action came from Freddie Mac in September of last year, when the </span><a href="https://freddiemac.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/freddie-mac-multifamily-requires-tenant-protections-all-future?_ga=2.49710821.290897229.1631544616-1384429246.1618356372" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">agency announced </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">some tenant protections on all future Manufactured Housing Community sales </span><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400">that go above and beyond current state and local requirements.”</span> <span style="font-weight: 400">Some of those protections include a renewable year-lease term, 30-day notice of rental increases and a 60-day notice if the park will be sold or permanently closed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Manufactured housing communities often represent the most affordable multifamily housing option available in many areas, particularly rural areas,” Debby Jenkins, the executive vice president of Freddie Mac Multifamily, said in a statement. “We have been ramping up our tenant protections offering since 2018, and today we’re making these protections a requirement for all future transactions.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Axne said she was hopeful of these protections the agency announced, but still believes congressional action must be taken. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I am encouraged by actions like what Freddie Mac did last fall to finally make their tenant site lease protections universal for all of the MHCs they finance, but do believe more can be done,” Axne said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But housing advocates like </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Guadarrama Trejo</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> have said the updates from Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae are toothless.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Guadarrama Trejo, who works as an associate state director for the working women’s advocacy group 9to5 Colorado, said that many of the tenant protections that Freddie Mac issued are less stringent than some standards in Colorado. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Guadarrama Trejo said the guidelines requiring a 60-day notice for a closure of a park is not a lot of time “for what can potentially put someone in displacement.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We&#8217;re talking about people who would lose everything,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sullivan, the sociology professor, said that in the last 20 years, many private companies have realized how profitable manufactured housing communities can be and have started to acquire them from traditional mom-and-pop operations. She added that it’s such a popular investment that there is a </span><a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2021/09/05/mobile-home-university-rv-horizons-impact-communities-frank-rolfe-dave-reynolds/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">Mobile Home University</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> course where investors can learn how to purchase those communities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“They&#8217;re a favorite investment item of those who are interested in passive income,” she said.  “And that&#8217;s because many park owners are looking for investments that require minimal upkeep, maintenance, and capital investment.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And for residents who want to purchase their communities, known as a resident-owned cooperative, it’s an uphill battle, said </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Nick Smithberg, the executive director at Iowa Legal Aid.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There&#8217;s no present owners under any obligation to sell to any particular group of tenants,” he said, referring to Iowa’s laws.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If a park were to go up for sale, a handful of states offer what is known as a first refusal, which </span><span style="font-weight: 400">means it obligates the community owner to sell to the residents if they match the terms of the other offer. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">But only Florida, Minnesota and New Jersey have such first refusal laws. </span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Pressure on Freddie and Fannie</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A </span><a href="https://www.lincolninst.edu/sites/default/files/content/docs/ummc/ummc_letter_to_director_thompson_10-20-2021.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">coalition</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> of about 20 affordable housing groups is pushing for Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae to do more to help residents of mobile home parks, such as assisting them in acquiring capital to purchase their communities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Amid a housing affordability crisis that requires bold and aggressive action, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have set forth plans that fail to effectively reach those not served or not served well by the conventional mortgage market,” the coalition wrote to FHFA Acting Director Sandra Thompson. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Jim Gray, a senior fellow at the </span><span style="font-weight: 400">nonprofit Lincoln Institute of Land Policy, said Freddie and Fannie have two mission requirements. The first is an affordable housing goal, which “requires them to purchase a certain percentage of mortgages that support low income communities,” and the second is the “duty to serve clause.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The duty to serve  was something that Congress passed to complement the affordable housing goals, and what it does is it requires Fannie and Freddie to make greater efforts to reach three historically underserved markets,” he said. “And those markets are manufactured housing, rural housing, and affordable housing preservation.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Bradley, the president of </span><a href="https://rocusa.org/fund-a-community-project/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">ROC USA</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, said Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae could help low-income groups of neighbors purchase their communities by lowering the upfront capital requirement needed to obtain a loan to purchase a community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But without approval to be flexible in their equity investments from FHFA, Freddie and Fannie Mac’s hands are tied. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you&#8217;re going to meet the needs in low-income neighborhoods, like mobile home parks, you got to have some flexibility,” Bradley said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Bradley said that he’s hoping when Thompson, who has been </span><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/12/14/president-biden-announces-nominee-for-director-of-the-federal-housing-finance-agency/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">nominated</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> as FHFA’s director, is confirmed, she’ll allow those entities to be more flexible in their “duty to serve” clause.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He said that none of the 20,000 homeowners in the nearly 300 resident-owned communities where ROC USA has helped secure financing has gone into foreclosure, arguing that the resident-owned co-op model is a success. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“These groups of homeowners have proven themselves, these co-op borrowers have proven themselves, and it&#8217;s still not good enough,” he said. “And that&#8217;s what annoys everybody.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Bradley added that an effective way to help residents of manufactured housing communities is to pass opportunity to purchase laws, which allow residents to match a third party’s offer to buy their community. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Bradley said that such options are “perhaps their once-in -a-lifetime chance to get control of the land under their homes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And at the end of the day, we ought to have owners on land that they own and control and not on the land of a commercial investor,” he said. “That&#8217;s the bottom line.”</span></p>
