Glenn Youngkin speaking with reporters on April 8, 2024. (Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As lawmakers consider Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s proposal to provide vehicle tax relief for Virginians and ultimately eliminate the property tax, policymakers can find comfort after repeals in Rhode Island and Georgia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of Virginia&#8217;s cities, counties and towns are subject to a personal property tax, which helps fund their respective governments. Municipalities are likely to be impacted by such a relief or repeal proposal, including some, like Chesapeake, that have been grappling with reforming vehicle-related taxes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Dec. 18, Youngkin said a family of four in Virginia pays about $290 on their vehicle taxes annually during his address to lawmakers and cabinet members.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Let&#8217;s give Virginia families relief on the most hated tax in America since the tax on tea &#8211; the local car tax,” Youngkin said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the governor did not include a plan to repeal the tax when he first raised the idea last December, this year he proposed an amendment to the current biennium budget to allocate $1.1 billion into a car tax credit fund to provide income tax rebates to nearly 1.9 billion taxpayers earning up to $50,000 in adjusted gross income for individuals or $100,000 for couples filing jointly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eligible taxpayers would receive up to $150 for individual returns or $300 for joint returns annually for the next three years. After the fund is exhausted, the state would see a permanent reduction of $360 million in tax revenues each year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If successful, Virginia would join several states and jurisdictions that do not impose a vehicle tax including the District of Columbia, Georgia, Maryland and Rhode Island.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a Nov. 7, 2023 </span><a href="https://www.cga.ct.gov/2023/rpt/pdf/2023-R-0196.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislative report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> completed in Connecticut, which was studying tax repeals, Rhode Island and Georgia over the past seven years repealed their vehicle property tax either by adjusting tax calculation factors by an increasing amount over a number of years, or enacting it only for taxpayers that perform a triggering action, such as applying for a vehicle title.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Georgia and Rhode Island took different approaches to address local governments’ revenue losses. Rhode Island reimbursed revenue losses from general appropriations and adjusted reimbursements based on sales tax revenues. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Georgia replaced its state and local annual property and sales taxes with a one-time per owner tax, divided between the state and municipalities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, West Virginia </span><a href="https://www.wvnews.com/mountainstatesman/news/taylor-county-west-virginia-assessor-explains-hb2526-and-the-motor-vehicle-property-tax-adjustment-credit/article_182eafb2-257e-11ee-afe4-8ba9d7735e92.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">created</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a fully refundable tax credit to eliminate the tax’s impact on residents while holding municipalities harmless, which took effect in 2024.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 1998, Virginia developed a vehicle tax </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacodefull/title58.1/chapter35.1/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">relief program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but the reimbursement rate starting at 12.5% was frozen at 70% in 2021, below the anticipated 100%, due to unforeseen costs as new car values increased substantially faster than inflation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia lawmakers will start their 45-day session discussing proposed bills and budget amendments on Jan. 8.</span></p>

As President Joe Biden’s administration </span><a href="https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2024-30921.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">backtracks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> its efforts to maintain some protections for transgender students due to pending litigation, similar efforts in Virginia could be rolled back, too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposed rule — which would have required states to allow biological males who identify as female to compete in girls’ and women’s sports — is separate from an extended civil rights protections rule for LGBTQ students under Title IX, which is still being challenged.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares called the withdrawal a “major victory” in a statement on Monday. Last year, he </span><a href="https://6rdh5iebb.cc.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001jvtWsOWktXoHSP5jkLp53sRncR-6Co9RDAN0u3JkFjolTeANSTc_esQPt0pWBfCJfi8kUy1XPaIOmDuTdxCYSMoLnIE4w1SinQjK4xgqdmhuLkepmb9JnoJebWBtbAv4kjM7hjTcZxWyd8z98pZOgPKvI9vGgEbaSSvo7bMm4f-mE7mNUyzRs6F9COtlPctd9MD0LBtPTWJ8pADp3jtoFHpPKtPrJRWSwIgzCTjWP8ZMSWrqy5-TyB5Yg7gshIn1rGTVql65zyH6g0h1NgP_E8kc2ToNkwKsK8dHGepfSPoUEtlh3Lk6U8gOh2pnJ1MfXuoAcdc6vHXEP4D2GGaqopH6F9vCvZbv2HtlonOyx1VCGLea3CzJpEqrXos1qrtLQXvaNukZ2FqZFQ14eANb8S6XgpdJwQP0&amp;c=uClvih1ISydmTc0WAlFY_XEIYaAuDa0l8s_kZJRdRFoOyjD-cYQUvg==&amp;ch=1nNdTwA10fWIw4_2uESac5akNGXVdqE1Uue_euaBr9NKvbFndb239g==" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">joined</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a coalition of attorneys general to oppose the Biden administration’s attempt to make changes to TItle IX that aimed to protect LGBTQ+ students from discrimination.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The proposed rule would have jeopardized the integrity of women’s sports, forcing female athletes to compete on an uneven playing field while uprooting decades of progress for women in sports. I’m proud to have stood up for Virginia’s female athletes and for the common-sense protections they deserve,” said Miyares in a statement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the past four years, lawmakers and attorneys have sparred over transgender policies in Virginia, as the Biden administration and groups like the </span><a href="https://www.acluva.org/en/cases/doe-v-hanover-county-school-board#:~:text=On%20July%203%2C%202024%20ACLU,she%20tried%20out%20and%20qualified." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ACLU of Virginia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have sought to maintain and expand safeguards. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Opponents of the rule said it would impose gender ideology on others with conservative views and potentially impact the safety of women and girls.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alliance Defending Freedom Senior Counsel and Vice President of Legal Strategy Jonathan Scruggs said female athletes deserve to compete on a “level playing field” and the presidential administration, through the Department of Education, has taken a step in the right direction with the withdrawal. ADF, a conservative Christian legal organization focused on protecting religious rights, has been active in cases seeking to prohibit transgender athletes from competing in women’s sports. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The decision to withdraw the proposed sports rule merely reflects the views of the vast majority of Americans who </span><a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/507023/say-birth-gender-dictate-sports-participation.aspx" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">believe</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that women’s sports should remain reserved for female athletes,” Scruggs said in a statement, adding that ADF will continue to fight other Title IX measures.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Other efforts to ban transgender women athletes</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bluefield University in Southwest Virginia, and other National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics member schools, </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/naia-transgender-ban-ad422f3a86ebcc4db618750c6a5d1c5f" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">banned</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> transgender women from competing in women&#8217;s sports in April.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other efforts to ban transgender women from sports in Virginia have been unsuccessful. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this year’s General Assembly session, Democrats killed bills that would have essentially </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB723" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">banned</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> transgender students from competing in sports programs at elementary, middle and high schools as well as higher education institutions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In February, Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration </span><a href="https://dailyprogress.com/news/local/government-politics/youngkin-administration-play-to-change-policy-for-transgender-high-school-athletes-falls-short-in-charlottesville/article_0ab1748c-c54c-11ee-9a8f-4745a6f30110.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">attempted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to match the Virginia High School League’s policy on transgender athletes with its overhauled policies that students should be placed on teams based on their biological sex rather than their gender identity, but the attempt failed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia High School League, which oversees interscholastic athletic competition for Virginia’s public high schools, </span><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OxLAgeE0tBHCgcHBdYoMBDGepYL2fN7W/view" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">allows</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for transgender athletes to participate on teams that match their gender identity, but under certain conditions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The parents of a Hanover County transgender student were successful in challenging a school’s decision to ban their child from trying out for her school tennis team when a federal court judge temporarily allowed the student in August to try out for and, if selected, play on a sports team this school year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But four months later, the parents of the student dropped the lawsuit against the school system because the student was no longer enrolled in the school division due to “ongoing harassment and concerns about her safety.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Trump presidency could usher in new era of challenges for trans student athletes</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia, like all the states, is preparing for  Republican President-elect Donald Trump to take office next month. Trump promised that he would ban trans students from playing on school sports teams that align with their gender identity during his successful campaign for office against Vice President Kamala Harris. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rhetoric has left transgender youth </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/transgender-rights-trump-title-ix-1b9d3a1d928ea78c21372da63600c6d1" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">seeking</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> help, the Associated Press reported, as Trump continues the calls to roll back protections for trans students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With the stroke of my pen on day one, we’re going to stop the transgender lunacy,” </span><a href="https://www.c-span.org/program/public-affairs-event/president-elect-trump-speaks-at-turning-point-action-conference-in-arizona/653788" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Trump at AmericaFest on Sunday, adding that “I will sign executive orders to end child sexual mutilation, get transgender out of the military and out of our elementary schools and middle schools and high schools.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each year since 2019, the federal government found that Virginia’s education department repeatedly failed to resolve complaints filed by parents of special education students, and it did not have “reasonably designed” procedures and practices to ensure a timely resolution process for those complaints.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the state has taken the necessary steps to “address and resolve the findings of noncompliance and the required corrective actions” outlined in a March 13 monitoring report, according to a Dec. 5 letter from the U.S. Department of Education&#8217;s Office of Special Education Programs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The federal agency indicated that no further action is needed after Virginia officials submitted documents highlighting corrective actions, including providing quicker feedback to school divisions and ensuring that all entities rather than LEAs, or school divisions, listed under the “</span><a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-34/subtitle-B/chapter-III/part-300/subpart-A/subject-group-ECFR0ec59c730ac278e/section-300.33" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">public agency</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” definition are following the due process procedures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia has nearly 181,000 students with disabilities. As federal law requires, Virginia must provide all students with disabilities a “free and appropriate public education” through personalized plans under the Individualized Education Program (IEP).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In its letter, OSEP said that “having a consistent and transparent system for identifying and correcting noncompliance, particularly noncompliance that impacts the delivery of early intervention services, in accordance with individualized education programs (IEPs), and dispute resolution systems that protect the rights of parents, are essential elements to ensuring improved results for children and youth with disabilities,” and acknowledged Virginia’s “continued efforts” to better implement the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) Part B and to put in place “a reasonably designed general supervision system which ensures compliance and improving results for students with disabilities.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">VDOE’s corrective actions</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to the compliance issues facing students, VDOE announced in October 2023 the formation of a workgroup to help develop the 2024 </span><a href="https://www.doe.virginia.gov/programs-services/special-education#:~:text=2024%20Roadmap%20for%20Special%20Education&amp;text=This%20roadmap%20is%20expected%20to,postsecondary%20pathways%20for%20all%20learners." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roadmap</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for Special Education and a team that reports directly to the superintendent of public instruction to monitor how school divisions provide special education services and assist them as needed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Around the same time period, VDOE also created a system to oversee the development and use of IEPs for students with special needs. Educators are required to undergo additional training on providing inclusive special education instruction.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Board of Education also </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/03/29/virginia-adopts-regulatory-changes-for-special-education-amid-federal-review/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">adopted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> regulatory changes to how the state handles compliance complaints regarding students with disabilities and dedicated funds to examine the dispute resolution system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Since day one, Governor Youngkin has prioritized the success of students with disabilities and I am pleased that the U.S. Department of Education has recognized the hard work VDOE has done to improve our work for Virginia’s children with disabilities,&#8221; Superintendent of Public Instruction Lisa Coons said in a statement.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Concerns, funding</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While she has not reviewed the documents the state’s education department submitted to federal authorities, special education advocate Kandise Lucas said she was concerned with the “accuracy” of those documents, specifically concerning the policies and procedures, and independent evaluations based on her recent interactions with schools, parents and students, one of whom she said has been out of school for three years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I just have a real concern that … the Board of Education submitted those documents knowing that they&#8217;re not complying with the law, specifically as it pertains to independent evaluations, which was a major issue,” Lucas said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She questioned if VDOE is following the federal agency’s summary contained in the Dec. 5 letter, which requires the commonwealth to issue a memorandum or other directive to all local educational agencies (LEAs), parent advocacy groups, and other interested parties advising them of the proposed changes to state regulations and complaint procedures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lucas said some hearing officers, who review parents&#8217; complaints, have yet to hear of the changes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She also voiced concerns about the state refusing to enforce its regulations in school divisions about parents’ right to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">access educational records promptly under the Virginia Freedom of Information Act. Another worry is VDOE refusing to enforce hearing officer orders and state complaint determinations well beyond a year after the compliance requirement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carol Bauer, president of the Virginia Education Association, said in a statement that Gov. Glenn Youngkin’sadministration&#8217;s actions are “temporary solutions” that don’t solve the main issue — the underfunding of special education student needs in the state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bauer claimed that since the governor was elected, actual state spending on special education students has continued to “erode” and led to “unmanageable caseloads and subpar parent and family engagement.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, evidence of underfunding schools was outlined in a study conducted by the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission, the state’s legislative watchdog.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">JLARC found that the formula used to decide how much money schools need for teachers suggested fewer special education teachers than schools use or need.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For fiscal year 2023, the funding formula calculated that 13,300 special education teachers were needed, which was 93% of the number employed by school divisions and 66% of what practitioners estimated was required. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers’ work to overhaul the funding formula could take a while. Short-term </span><a href="https://studiesvirginiageneralassembly.s3.amazonaws.com/meeting_docs/documents/000/002/486/original/2._VDOE_Jt._Sub_Committee_Presentation_12.9.24_FINAL.pdf?1733765779" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recommendations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> could be considered for the upcoming General Assembly session beginning in January.</span></p>

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers will consider a bill in January that aims to stop unlicensed minors from operating a vehicle by charging the vehicle owner with a Class 1 misdemeanor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tammy McGee, whose son died in a 2019 car crash after an unlicensed and underage teen driver crashed the car he was in, has become an outspoken advocate for safe driving laws. She is now working with lawmakers including Del. W. Chad Green, R-York, to create accountability for parents and adults regarding driver safety for teenagers with </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20251/HB1549" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 1549</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s another tool that law enforcement would have to hold parents responsible,” Green told the Mercury. “Maybe with this change in law, parents and adults will say, ‘hey, we’re not going to let this happen,’ and it could end up saving some lives.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under current </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/46.2-301.1/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">state law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, owners only face a penalty if they knowingly allow someone whose driver&#8217;s license, learner&#8217;s permit, or privilege to drive a motor vehicle has been suspended or revoked to drive a vehicle. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the General Assembly and the governor approve the new bill, vehicle owners could face a one-year jail sentence and a $2,500 fine. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McGee, who operates the </span><a href="https://www.connergweedo.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gweedo Memorial Foundation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, in honor of her late son, Joseph Conner Williams Guido, affectionately known as “Gweedo,&#8221; died in a car crash on Oct. 26, 2019 in York County. Since the crash, she has advocated for teen driving education in Virginia.</span></p>

(Courtesy of the Gweedo Memorial Foundation)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2021, the General Assembly passed a bill that she pushed to address safety in </span><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?212+sum+HB1918" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">school parking lots</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and another the following year requiring </span><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=221&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=sb78" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">parental involvement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in teen driver education. She also launched a </span><a href="http://www.ifyouseesomethingsaysomething.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to allow people to anonymously report tips about unsafe driving, illegal activities, and bullying, to name a few.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McGee said she hopes the momentum will carry during the short session beginning on Jan. 8 with House Bill 1549 and another bill, still to be filed, that will ensure all students have access to in-car driver education. McGee said not all school divisions offer behind-the-wheel education in Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She fears that if students don’t have a behind-the-wheel education, they are likely to drive without a license if they or their families cannot afford private instruction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That gives our parents a peace of mind about the quality of education and the safety of their child when you think about these driving schools,” McGee said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Would I have been in these shoes had my son not died?” said McGee.  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I wouldn&#8217;t be passionate about driving and safety,” she added. “But what I do know is that what happened to me shouldn&#8217;t have happened. … My baby’s aspirations to play collegiate soccer were wiped away by an innocent act of stepping into a vehicle, and anybody should be able to hop into another vehicle and know that that teen is licensed, and that wasn&#8217;t the case.”</span></p>

(VCU Capital News Service)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Washington Metropolitan area leaders favor considering a regional revenue source for the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (Metro), which faced financial challenges to maintain services at the start of the year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, where the funding will come from and the amount each jurisdiction will contribute to the fund is a concern regional leaders expressed at a joint meeting in the District of Columbia on Monday. Some of the potential funding mechanisms include collecting taxes from regional sales, motor fuel, vehicles and property.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeff McKay, chair of the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors, said he and others support a uniform revenue collection system, but flexibility should be a consideration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If we come up with a regional system … in terms of uniform, that doesn’t necessarily conclude in my mind that the rate has to be exactly the same everywhere,” said McKay.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monday’s discussion on developing a regional Metro funding source was part of a months-long effort to collaborate through an initiative known as DMVMoves, led by Metro and the Council of Governments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The group also reviewed proposed scenarios that would maintain existing service levels and keep Metro efficient, reliable and consistent with repairs and maintenance throughout parts of Virginia, Maryland and the District of Columbia. Leaders also broached the idea of going beyond the current services by modernizing assets and expanding to support other initiatives including investing in a bus rapid transit network. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">How a regional funding source would work</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Metro receives support from ridership and fare revenue. The transit agency also receives contributions from the District of Columbia, Maryland and Northern Virginia — members of the </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/compacts/washington-metropolitan-area-transit-authority-compact-of-1966/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">WMATA Compact</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leaders in the District of Columbia and others, like McKay, said a uniform approach across the region would make it easier for Metro to forecast predicted revenue streams instead of relying on some localities from Northern Virginia and the three jurisdictions to pay their contributions separately.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, under the proposed plan, some jurisdictions that utilize the service would be excluded from contributing to the regional funding source because they are not members of the WMATA Compact. Virginia’se Prince William County and the cities of Manassas and Manassas Park would be left out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McKay didn’t mention any jurisdictions by name, but said data shows those localities outside the compact have a “tremendous” benefit in Metro ridership. He said region leaders should begin considering speaking with those jurisdictions about getting involved with financial planning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s time we start talking to the other jurisdictions that benefit [from] Metro and trying to understand how they can be a part of this moving forward, because the idea that some suburban sprawl that has been created outside of the Metro compact area that feeds into the system — and at the end of that system is a county that has a station that&#8217;s paying for those people to ride the system exclusively — doesn&#8217;t really seem to be equitable in the long term either,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Montgomery County (Maryland) Executive Marc Elrich, said the challenge moving forward with a regional sales tax is determining the appropriate amount from each jurisdiction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am pretty much opposed to doing anything that lands on the residents,” Elrich said. “I think these taxes have to focus on commercial property.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He commended Virginia and its jurisdictions in the compact on a “stunningly good job” to leverage the “myriad of taxes” to contribute to Metro, which he said is backed by a strong tax base primarily around commercial property. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nick Donohue, principal at Capitol Transportation Consulting and one of two experts supporting the task force, provided </span><a href="https://dmvmoves.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/DMVMoves_TaskForce_Dec_ReadAhead-1.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">details</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about the potential funding scenarios to region leaders on Monday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under Scenario 1, Metro would receive an increase of $480 million per year from the region to sustain existing services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An additional $120 million would help to enhance service and grow ridership under Scenario 2. Costs would likely increase.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Actions beyond the initial scenarios to modernize Metro — such as adding new railcars, maximizing services and expanding to move more people with bus rapid transit lines, ferry services and bike share — would require additional funds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Donohue said the figures are subject to change and are based on assumptions for future inflation, project costs, regional ridership growth and sustained commitments from funding jurisdictions.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Reconciling a regional vision, addressing funding shortfalls</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In September, advisory groups associated with the task force reported that more than 80% of people surveyed in the National Capital Region said they “support more and better transit services, even if it requires higher investment by the region.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid the discussion centered on developing a regional funding source, Michael Sargent, Deputy Secretary of Transportation, said he was unclear and frustrated because the task force skipped directly to funding and passed over discussing its regional vision and funding inefficiencies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If we don&#8217;t have an ultimate goal, I can&#8217;t evaluate how any of these steps are going to get us there, and whether that&#8217;s a good use of funding in time, or if that&#8217;s not even gonna get us close to where we&#8217;re trying to go,” Sargent said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said the group needs an explanation of why other metropolitan areas, such as Chicago, are getting more ridership and more service for less funding, as well as the reasoning for the difference in Metro’s capital needs estimates. Sargent said Metro </span><a href="https://dmvmoves.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/092324-readahead.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">estimated</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it needed $2.1 billion per year to keep the system on track in its 10-year capital plan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sargent said if members of the task force come to Virginia lawmakers without looking more closely at costs or providing evidence of need alongside estimates, and ask, &#8220;to raise taxes by hundreds of millions of dollars a year,” the success of the plan won’t be likely. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I mean, that&#8217;s not just going to be a ‘no,’ that&#8217;s going to be a ‘hell no,’&#8221; Sargent said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Donohue said he appreciated Sargent raising the issues facing the task force and added that the group has discussed “a lot” about the vision. He expects more discussions and answers to be provided at future meetings that will continue in January as costs are still being vetted. The task force is expected to adopt recommendations in March and the final plan in June.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have to do what we have to do to get our students prepared for life beyond the walls of our schools,” said board president Grace Creasey, who is, like most of the board’s members, an appointee of Gov. Glenn Youngkin. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She added that other school board members around the commonwealth have supported moving forward. Her colleague, Vice President Bill Hansen, added that the board should continue to push forward.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our system has to change for the benefit of our students and our families, and frankly, for our schools, which are pillars in the community, and so I really look forward to moving this process ahead,” Hansen said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Todd Reid, a spokesman for VDOE, any changes to the new accountability system would require a regulatory change by the board, which is a lengthy and involved process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the summer, the state’s board of education approved the new accountability framework, which has been in the works for two years and overhauled the existing system. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new framework is intended to depict how schools are meeting all requirements set by state laws and regulations, and provide “timely” and “transparent” information on student and school performance, according to the VDOE.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VDOE doubled down on its plans Monday, and staff </span><a href="https://www.doe.virginia.gov/home/showpublisheddocument/58674" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the agency had offered multiple training sessions for superintendents, school division leaders, and counselors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over 73 participants from 55 of the total 131 school divisions have participated in two office hour sessions, which are ongoing on Wednesdays, and 40 individual technical assistance sessions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Nov. 8, Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration announced the launch of an additional resource, the digital Roadmap to Readiness Hub, designed to improve student and school performance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our students cannot wait another year. That&#8217;s why earlier this month, Governor Youngkin took a significant step forward in addressing the needs of Virginia&#8217;s students and public schools with the release of the Roadmap to Readiness, a comprehensive online resource hub that provides parents, teachers, school leaders, and communities with a robust set of supports, resources, and transparent data to inform decision making,&#8221; said Christian Martinez, a spokesman for the governor, in a statement on Monday. &#8220;Since the start of the administration, we continue to raise expectations for every child and put systems in place that will make a measurable difference in students’ lives now, not years from now.&#8221;</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="64ngvob44e"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/11/va-launches-resource-hub-to-improve-student-and-school-outcomes-amid-performance-data-questions/">Va. launches resource hub to improve student and school outcomes amid performance data questions</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Va. launches resource hub to improve student and school outcomes amid performance data questions&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/11/va-launches-resource-hub-to-improve-student-and-school-outcomes-amid-performance-data-questions/embed/#?secret=072MQ2g8Dz#?secret=64ngvob44e" data-secret="64ngvob44e" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a Nov. 18 letter, signed by eight school board chairs from the counties of Arlington, Fairfax, Loudoun and Prince William and the cities of Alexandria, Arlington, Fairfax, Falls Church and Manassas, the group urged the administration to delay implementation of the accountability framework despite the rollout of the resource hub and the pending review by the U.S. Department of Education’s review of Virginia’s Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) plan. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The plan&#8217;s full implementation is slated to begin at the start of the next school year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want to be good partners with the state in our shared mission to foster the success of each and every student; however, we are concerned that school divisions have not been provided that appropriate amount of time to address the new accountability requirements the commonwealth has established,” the chairs wrote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The framework was established after their divisions “planned, budgeted and staffed” for the current school year and students had already selected their courses, the chairs wrote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a quarter of the school year passed, the chairs said that many of the framework’s measures “have still not yet been fully defined,” and that detailed modeling has not been shared with school divisions. The chairs also said Virginia has not identified the types of support it will provide to schools needing improvement and secured the necessary related funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The chairs recommended the state education board “reinstate student knowledge growth and alternative measurement alongside mastery as key framework components.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They also recommended the department clearly explain and test all the components of the framework’s calculations, and clarify and publicly vet the components and intent of any agreement that will be required for low-performing schools or school divisions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The letter urged the board to prioritize an immediate increase in appropriated funding for any school identified as “Off Track” or “In Need of Support,” as well as for comprehensive professional development related to the new framework for all school divisions based on their actual number of instructional full-time employees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the accountability system, schools are given one of four labels based on their performance: “Distinguished,” “On track,” “Off Track,” and “Needs Intensive Support.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schools considered “distinguished” are those that exceed the state’s expectations for growth, achievement and readiness, while those that need “intensive support” do not meet any of the state’s expectations. In addition, “on-track” and “off-track” descriptors indicate whether schools are generally meeting expectations or not.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prior to the board’s work session on Monday, the Virginia Education Association, the largest organization representing teachers and school employees, published a </span><a href="https://www.veanea.org/performance-framework-exposed-see-the-data-and-why-it-matters/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">webpage</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> stating the system is a “problem” and suggesting lawmakers could delay the implementation through legislation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Virginia’s families, educators, and students deserve an accountability system that supports growth and improvement – not one that stigmatizes schools without addressing the root causes of their challenges,” VEA said in a statement. “We urge lawmakers to act swiftly in 2025 to delay this system and lay the groundwork for an approach that works for everyone.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Board member Anne Holton, former Virginia Secretary of Education, said it&#8217;s helpful that staff is providing tools to help educators and school staff get up to speed on how to put the new standards into practice, but providing a clear explanation of the process is also key for school boards and parents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am absolutely confident they have asked for a delay because they want to do the very best by all of our students and because they want to be able to support their teachers,” Holton said. “They may see that differently than you, but it&#8217;s not because they want to cover up problems. They are in the field every day trying to get the very best education to all of our kids, and I have complete confidence in our school division leaders as to their motivation, whether or not they agree with you as to the mechanics of how we implement all of this.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last session, Gov. Glenn Youngkin and lawmakers settled on a biennium budget that included several transportation </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/04/whats-in-virginias-transportation-spending-plan/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">investments</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, including $1 million to establish an Advanced Air Aviation Test Site from the Commonwealth’s Development Opportunity Fund and $350,000 to study implementing “emerging technologies,” including </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/12/22/what-would-virginia-need-for-a-future-of-electric-and-automated-aircraft/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advanced Air Mobility</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the significant investments, Del. Wren Williams, R-Patrick, said he decided to carry his bill that would redirect tax revenues from vehicle rentals to support aviation laws and construction, maintenance, and improvement of airports in the commonwealth in the upcoming session. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, the tax revenues from vehicle rentals go from the Commonwealth Transportation Fund to the Aviation Special Fund.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Williams said the revenue amount is small, but it could help the commonwealth when it has to fully fund aviation projects and match grants from the federal government.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There&#8217;s always the need to help improve the infrastructure of airports and aviation in Virginia, especially with our current administration and Boeing and others that have come into Virginia as an aviation hub,” Williams said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Virginia’s heavily used airports, such as Dulles and Richmond International, receive much attention, Williams said it&#8217;s important to support smaller airports, which lack necessary facilities such as runway extensions, hangar spaces, and control towers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Williams said the bill also considers the future of uncrewed aerial vehicles and the need for dedicated infrastructure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In October, aviation and economic experts briefed House and Senate Transportation Committee members about “advanced air mobility” at the state’s annual transportation conference. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advanced air mobility has grown in popularity as a way to offer travel and delivery services and, at the same time, promise to reduce greenhouse gases. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, because the technologies are new, regulations and infrastructure are still under development.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the nonprofit group Virginia Innovation Partnership Corporation (VIPC), the advanced air mobility industry, as it is known, could generate $16 billion in new business activity in the commonwealth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The opportunity is “huge,” House Transportation Committee Chair Karrie Delaney, D-Fairfax, told the Mercury at last month’s transportation conference, adding that it is vital for lawmakers to begin discussing now some of the regulatory considerations and incentives that will be needed “because the future is here.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">John Campbell Jr., deputy director for the Virginia Department of Aviation, said if the bill were to become law, the money would go into the Aviation Fund, which provides funding for planning and engineering projects that focus on airport facility development.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In general,” Campbell said, “these projects include master plan and airport layout plan studies; environmental studies; land acquisition; airside facility design and construction; and terminal building design and construction.”</span></p>

(Larry Levine / WMATA)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (Metro)  is moving forward with a service-wide redesign of its bus routes, including in a few areas of Northern Virginia, improving where people want to travel and simplifying services by the summer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The transit agency is planning to make changes in Alexandria, Fairlington and West Falls Church and Fairfax County after a two-year comprehensive review of the existing bus network called the 2025 </span><a href="https://www.wmata.com/initiatives/plans/Better-Bus/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Better Bus Network</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which, according to the plan, aims to “better match when and where people want to travel, provide fast, frequent and reliable service, address inequities, and increase access to opportunity for disenfranchised communities.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ultimately we ended up with a product that, I think, is going to really result in significant efficiency and savings, but also provide better service,” said Matt Letourneau, chairman of the Metro Board of Directors Finance and Capital Committee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Letourneau, who also represents Virginia on the board that oversees transit services for Washington D.C., Maryland and Virginia, said some of the changes could frustrate some travelers because a particular route may not be available, “but by and large, we think this is going to be a big win for the whole region.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Alexandria, the Better Bus Network plan proposes to preserve rush hour service in Brookville along Taney Avenue, Park Place Condominiums and South Fairlington. The proposal also consolidates and streamlines service between Shirlington and South Fairlington.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposal will also restore the connection to the West Falls Church Station and surrounding development in West Falls Church. In Fairfax County, the plan will maintain rush-hour service at the Fairview Park Office Complex and service along Vaden Drive to the Fairless neighborhood and the Jim Scott Community Center.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Metro plans to roll out the service plan by June throughout its service area in the District of Columbia, Maryland and Northern Virginia, all of which provide financial contributions to the agency.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Metro is supported by ridership and fare revenue, which has steadily increased since the pandemic when travelers stayed home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the </span><a href="https://www.wmata.com/about/board/meetings/board-pdfs/upload/3A-Approval-of-Restructuring-Metrobus-and-Metrorail-Operating-Subsidy-Allocation-Formulas-v2.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">new</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> restructured Metrorail and Metrobus subsidy formula and Metro’s 2025 Approved Budget, Virginia and most of its Northern Virginia jurisdictions would see a small contribution savings under the new Better Bus Network plan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Board of Directors voted to update the funding formula, which determines how much jurisdictions pay to Metro, after the agency received feedback that the current formulas are “confusing” and lack transparency and predictability.&#8221; The purpose of restructuring the formula is to “increase legibility and transparency,” “align service benefits” and &#8220;improve service and fiscal predictability.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Letourneau said additional costs could arise as the board considers other changes to the bus network. He did not mention any changes specifically.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We were really focusing on data, on efficiency, on really trying to run a really good, efficient system,” Letourneau said. “I don&#8217;t necessarily think that we&#8217;re done growing the bus network. We just needed to really [create] a baseline that reflects &#8230; a new reality of where people are traveling.”</span></p>

(miniseries/Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of Virginia’s public universities and colleges are aware of student food insecurity  at their institutions, according to a November </span><a href="https://www.schev.edu/home/showpublisheddocument/4120/638677880196199761" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> conducted by the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia. 80% labeled on-campus food insecurity as a “somewhat” or “very problematic&#8221; issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The total number of college students experiencing food insecurity is unclear because not all public colleges and universities are tracking the issue, and the economic and social stigma associated with food insecurity has prevented students from asking for help. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A total of 35 of 39 institutions completed the survey, representing 343,797 students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to SCHEV, the coordinating body for the state’s colleges and universities, eight institutions said they had researched food insecurity affecting their students, while 19 had not and eight did not know or preferred not to say.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most schools estimated between 25% to 49% of their students faced food insecurities, and another third estimated between 1% and 24%. “Most of these estimates (53%) were based partly on estimates or best guesses, and partly on data collected, monitored or maintained by the institution and/or other organization(s),” SCHEV reported.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Rae Cousins, D-Richmond, who carried the successful legislation </span><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb827" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">directing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the council to survey each public institution of higher education to identify how they address food insecurity, said she was pleased to see the report confirm her observations. She hopes to receive student input as lawmakers consider the recommendations and potential legislative solutions to prevent students from going hungry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I sympathize with these kids because I know how important food and nourishment has been to me, how important it is to my daughter — who&#8217;s three years old— and so whatever I can do to ensure that people are getting the nutrition that they need, especially our kids and our students … while they&#8217;re in school, I&#8217;m just all in for it,” said Cousins.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In January 2022, the federal government made it possible for colleges and universities to pinpoint how many students were in need after it permitted institutions to use financial aid or FAFSA data to determine the SNAP eligibility of students, the study states. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, 26% of institutions have not used the data and the remaining 34% did not respond if they had. SNAP, also referred to as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, is a government initiative that provides monthly food benefits to low-income people and families.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SCHEV also found that private donations are the most frequently mentioned source of funding to address food insecurity at colleges and universities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report indicated that federal grants and state general fund dollars are rarely obtained. Some institutions use student emergency funds permitted under the 2024-26 biennial budget to address food insecurity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In its report, SCHEV recommended that institutions normalize asking for and accepting government help, involve students in developing and implementing campus services, and leverage existing legislation and funding to grow on-campus support programs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report also recommends policymakers increase state support for direct partnerships between public institutions of higher education and the Department of Social Services, and invest in expanding access to tested, effective services for students across institutions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, SCHEV advised policymakers to work with federal partners and legislators to increase state flexibility for SNAP.</span></p>

(Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia is handing out $12 million worth of grants to 96 school divisions and 472 schools across 96 school divisions in the commonwealth to purchase security equipment including voice and video internal communication systems and surveillance cameras.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a Nov. 21 announcement by the Virginia Department of Education, each school division can receive grants of up to $250,000 for the current school year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Safety has been a priority for school divisions in the commonwealth, especially after a 6-year-old student shot his teacher at Newport News Elementary School in January 2023. Schools have tried to prevent firearms from being brought on campus by </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/05/04/virginia-schools-increasingly-eye-weapons-detectors-to-keep-firearms-out-of-buildings/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">adding weapons detectors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.doe.virginia.gov/programs-services/school-operations-support-services/facility-construction-maintenance/security-equipment-grants" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">School Security Equipment Grants</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> program, developed by the Virginia Department of Criminal Justice Services and VDOE, allows the commonwealth to prioritize schools “most in need” of modern equipment, schools with a relatively high number of offenses and schools least able to afford security upgrades. Schools were awarded grants based on a ranking of those needs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The equipment purchased with these grants will help ensure the safety of all students and staff in Virginia’s public schools,” said Lisa Coons, superintendent of public instruction for VDOE. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Every child deserves a high-quality education experience, one where they can deeply focus on learning and growing the minute they step onto a school bus or pass through the doors of their school. These grants help create safe, supportive environments, both on school grounds and while traveling to and from school,” she added.</span></p>

Sam Rasoul)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">House lawmakers studying how some of Virginia’s universities handle campus protests and free speech policies faced criticism Wednesday after arranging a hearing that some in attendance felt leaned heavily toward institutional and pro-Israeli perspectives. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, House Majority Leader Charniele Herring, D-Alexandria, who chairs the House Select Committee tasked with reviewing campus safety and free speech at Virginia’s colleges and universities, addressed public concerns by emphasizing that this was just the first in a series of meetings aimed at providing a comprehensive review.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Herring said the next meeting is slated for December with a final report due afterwards.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are not here to solve the issues that spark conversations, protests and public displays. We are not equipped to do that in this venue,” Herring said. “However, we are here to make sure that we are working toward campuses continuing to be safe places and learning for all of our students, while ensuring there are safe places to speak out and engage in civil discourse.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The committee convened for the first time on Wednesday after canceling two prior meetings which had left the public without answers. Herring attributed the delays to low attendance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The postponents frustrated some students and faculty members who had hoped that lawmakers would introduce legislation for the upcoming General Assembly session, which begins in January. Some had also called for earlier hearings to address public concerns about new university policies as well as demands for independent investigations and legislative oversight to safeguard First Amendment rights.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration </span><a href="https://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Campus-Safety-and-Security-A-Message-From-Secretary-of-Education-copy.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">urged</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Virginia’s colleges and universities in the spring to “take proactive steps to update policies and improve communication channels before students return this fall.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The directive came in the wake of demonstrations at five universities, sparked by responses to an attack by Hamas, a Palestinian militant organization, on Israel near the Gaza Strip in October. According to reports, Hamas killed 1,200, injured hundreds, and took hostages. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the resulting aftermath of the attack, Israel declared war, resulting in the death of over 41,000 Palestinians, while nearly 100,000 were injured and the health care system in Gaza has collapsed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The public response to the conflict prompted the creation of both the House committee and a parallel Senate group to examine campus policies and ensure free speech protections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last spring, demonstrators across Virginia called for a cease-fire and staged protests at five universities in the commonwealth last spring: The protests resulted in more than 125 arrests at four campuses: the University of Mary Washington, Virginia Commonwealth University, Virginia Tech and the University of Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wednesday&#8217;s two-hour hearing in Richmond, hosted by the House committee, featured testimony from a law enforcement official and a representative from the governor’s administration, along with updates from the University of Virginia and Virginia Commonwealth University regarding the campus protests. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The committee also heard a presentation on the history of the First Amendment followed by remarks from a pro-Israeli student from Virginia Tech who shared her personal experience with the protests and the university&#8217;s policies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kiera Schneiderman, student body president at Virginia Tech, called for a more “peaceful” and “constructive” approach to the campus protests. After the encampment at Virginia Tech, Schneiderman recounted visiting the protest site where she and others were met with chants of “shame” and witnessed a large crowd chasing a Jewish student. She also reported three students were punched in the face. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There is nothing wrong with criticizing Israel. There is nothing wrong with advocating for a better future for Palestinians and trying to preserve their livelihood,&#8221; Schneiderman said. &#8220;I want to be very clear when I say that this is not what is happening in our current state of campus protest.&#8221;</span></p>

(Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During a 30-minute public comment period, community organizers, faculty members and students shared their concerns about the protests, with some alleging excessive use of force by law enforcement and questioning the safety of students facing hate and intimidation. Others advocated for policies that protect free speech as well as for greater accountability and reform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I stand before you in the year 2024 and ask you to tell me which Virginia college will my son be safe in attending,” said Yael Levin, a Jewish mother of two, recounting violent acts in the state. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The House Select committee also invited law enforcement to speak on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jonathan Schleffer, deputy secretary of Virginia Public Safety and Homeland Security, explained that the administration has been actively collaborating with law enforcement and universities throughout the surge in protests. He emphasized the importance of ensuring student safety while addressing the underlying causes of the protests.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lt. Col. Kirk Marlowe, deputy superintendent of the Virginia State Police, told the committee that law enforcement faces challenges in managing crowd sizes and identifying individuals protesting unlawfully. He noted that some unlawful protestors can blend in with larger groups and carry items that can be used as weapons.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When asked by a committee member, Marlowe was unable to confirm if any state police officers were injured during the protests.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want protesters, spectators and law enforcement all to be safe, and we want to create a safe space for people to lawfully exercise their first amendment rights,” Marlowe said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, some speakers expressed frustration that the hearing included presentations from representatives of institutions and law enforcement. They argued that guest speakers advocating for free speech, such as the American Civil Liberties Union, should have been included.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You’ve invited and given an extensive platform to the very perpetrators of the violence, including the police and administrations that have inflicted violence upon myself and my peers, allowing the space for full presentations,” said Selma Ait-Bella, a senior at VCU. “Meanwhile, the advocates of free speech, those that have been punished for speaking out, are all relegated to short testimonies in the public hearing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shahed Sanuri, a graduate student at Virginia Tech, criticized the committee for showing a lack of “empathy” in the way it organized the agenda.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The people selected and presented were the exact people that are systematically and continuously suppressing Palestinian voices on campuses, people that have called for extreme brutality against their own students, faculty and staff,” Sanuri said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When we chant ‘Free Palestine,’ we are fighting for the Liberation of Palestine from the occupation and settler colonialism by Israel on Palestine. Free Palestine has never and will never mean hate towards Jews.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the meeting, Herring said that the committee is laying the groundwork in this initial hearing for potential future legislation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m not saying it’s anyone’s priority, but maybe there’s no need for legislation. But this at least gives us something, some knowledge as we move forward,” Herring said.</span></p>

(JW Caterine for the Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers will consider legislation allowing Virginia to recruit more teachers through a multi-state agreement in the upcoming legislative session, which some see as an opportunity to continue reducing the state’s teacher shortage that has declined in recent months.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20251/HB328" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to enter Virginia into the </span><a href="https://teachercompact.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interstate Teacher Mobility Compact was</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> carried by Del. Jackie Glass, D-Norfolk, earlier this year. A similar </span><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB407" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was left in the Senate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If passed, Glass said the legislation would diversify pathways and processes and remove barriers for experienced teachers who want to bring their skills to Virginia classrooms, ensuring that every student has access to a high-quality education. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The measure would also support military spouses who frequently move with their partners and face licensing barriers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Re-filing the teacher compact bill is a priority because the urgency to address Virginia&#8217;s teacher shortage cannot be overstated,” said Glass in an email to the Mercury. “We are navigating the challenges of a highly transient population, particularly in communities like ours that are influenced by military movement and economic shifts; it’s essential to me that we make it easier to attract and retain qualified educators.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Education Association, the largest teachers union in the state, supported the bill in the 2024 session. Carol Bauer, president of the VEA, said as lawmakers mull over the teacher compact legislation, they should also consider ensuring that the bill works toward improving the quality of candidates by keeping “high standards” while reducing “bureaucratic barriers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We still need to hold high standards for training and we need to make sure that our students have teachers that have had the opportunity to get the experience they need to teach,” Bauer said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regarding the benefits, Bauer said the interstate compact legislation could help teachers move closer to helping aging family members in another state or obtaining support services for their children.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Compact origin</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to </span><a href="https://compacts.csg.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The National Center for Interstate Compacts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at </span><a href="https://www.csg.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Council of State Governments</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the compact, initiated by the U.S. Department of Defense, will allow teachers to use an eligible license held in a compact member state to be granted an equivalent license in another compact member state, lowering barriers to teacher mobility and getting teachers back into the classroom more seamlessly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A minimum of 10 states was required to move the compact forward. Some of the states that joined the compact include Alabama, Florida, Kentucky and Pennsylvania.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last February, a House General Laws subcommittee </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20251/HB328/text/HB328AH" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">amended</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the legislation, requiring any potential license holder to be responsible for paying for their background check. The bill was left with the House Education Committee when session ended</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Va. teacher shortage shows improvement</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to data from the Virginia Department of Education’s Office of Licensure, the teacher vacancy rate was down to 3.4% at the start of the school year after hovering at 4.7% in July. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Studies have found that teachers were leaving public schools due to several factors including dissatisfaction with wages, challenges after the pandemic, and recent political battles over academic content and benchmarking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia, in response, </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/09/01/youngkin-outlines-steps-to-address-teacher-shortage-in-executive-directive/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">initiated</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> several actions that included relaxing guidelines to hire retired teachers, and targeting educator recruitment and retention efforts in areas of need. The administration of Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkinalso worked on the issue with the Democrat-controlled state legislature this year, whose priorities included </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/01/17/legislation-to-bring-va-teacher-pay-to-national-average-gets-bipartisan-support/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">raising</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> teacher salaries to the national average.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Glass said the 3.4% vacancy rate appears to be a small number, but </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">it represents “thousands” of unfilled positions that directly impact students and families, necessitating continued efforts towards progress. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our approach must be multifaceted: removing barriers for teachers entering the profession, supporting current educators to prevent burnout, and recognizing the unique needs of our communities,” Glass said. “We owe it to our students to provide stability and opportunity, and that starts with ensuring every classroom has a dedicated and qualified teacher.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The commission’s creation came after the publication of a series of essays in The New York Times dubbed the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">1619 Project, whose namesake reflects the first year enslaved Africans were brought to the shores of what would become the United States. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, national debate was brewing about how history concerning </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">slavery and Black Americans’ contributions to the country was taught, a discussion that </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/11/17/missing-context-political-bias-some-of-critics-objections-to-virginias-new-history-standards/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">manifested</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Virginia after Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration authorized a rewrite of Virginia history and social science education standards that critics said lacked important context but included bias. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The 1776 Commission’s background</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump has not mentioned plans for the commission since his re-election over Democrat Vice President Kamala Harris on Nov. 5, despite his party’s affirmation of their intent to reinstate it. The former president </span><a href="https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-establishing-presidents-advisory-1776-commission/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">created</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the commission during his previous term via an executive order issued on Nov. 2, 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It came after the Trump administration and some conservatives accused the 1619 Project and  critical race theory college courses of teaching students to “hate their own country.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This radicalized view of American history lacks perspective, obscures virtues, twists motives, ignores or distorts facts, and magnifies flaws, resulting in the truth being concealed and history disfigured,” the order reads. “Failing to identify, challenge, and correct this distorted perspective could fray and ultimately erase the bonds that knit our country and culture together.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2021, the 1776 Commission published a 41-page </span><a href="https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/The-Presidents-Advisory-1776-Commission-Final-Report.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that received criticism from historians and educators largely because it was developed by experts from Hillsdale College, a Christian school in Michigan, politicians and conservatives. Detractors said the report attempted to downplay how the institution of slavery shaped U.S. history.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="https://www.historians.org/news/aha-statement-condemning-report-of-advisory-1776-commission/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">statement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the American Historical Association, joined by 47 organizations, said the report attempted to “elevate ignorance about the past to a civic virtue.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The AHA said the report included “an homage to the Founding Fathers” that was “a simplistic interpretation that relies on falsehoods, inaccuracies, omissions and misleading statements.” It also said the report featured “a screed against a half-century of historical scholarship, presented largely as a series of caricatures, using single examples (most notably the ‘1619 Project’) to represent broader historiographical trends.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beau Dickenson, executive board member and former president of the Virginia Social Studies Leaders Consortium, said the 1776 Commission&#8217;s report tried to rewrite history and insulted social studies teachers by suggesting they don&#8217;t want to be patriotic, which he said was contrary to their motives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want those dispositions in our students, but we want them to have a balanced view of our past,” Dickenson said. “And even within the topics that these folks would prefer us to overlook, I see a very compelling story of agency and resilience and people overcoming despite these odds and making this country stronger as a result. It&#8217;s a testament to our people that we can be a flawed country and make it a better one, but the 1776 Commission seeks just to overlook that history or rewrite it entirely.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were also some educators, like Carol Swain, defending the commission. Swain, former commission vice chair and retired political science and law professor at Vanderbilt and Princeton Universities said “No parts of history were taken out in the report, and the people from the left attacked it because it was the Trump administration that put it together.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soon after the commission published the </span><a href="https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/The-Presidents-Advisory-1776-Commission-Final-Report.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1776 Report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in January 2021, the group was </span><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/20/executive-order-advancing-racial-equity-and-support-for-underserved-communities-through-the-federal-government/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">disbanded</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by President Joe Biden through an executive order focused on advancing racial equity and supporting underserved communities on Jan. 20, 2021. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Virginia parallels</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his first year as Virginia’s governor in 2022, Youngkin began addressing and reforming public education, and, in his first </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/governor-of-virginia/pdf/74---eo/74---eo/EO-1---ENDING-THE-USE-OF-INHERENTLY-DIVISIVE-CONCEPTS,-INCLUDING-CRITICAL-RACE-THEORY,-AND-RESTORING-EXCELLEN.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">executive order</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, prohibited “inherently divisive concepts,” including critical race theory (CRT), in K-12 education. CRT is a graduate-level framework focusing on racial inequity that has not been found in Virginia&#8217;s curricula. Youngkin also signed off on revamping the state’s history and social science education standards. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The administration faced criticisms after state historians, lawmakers and education groups learned that Hillsdale College was involved in the rewrite of Virginia’s standards, which outline the commonwealth&#8217;s expectations for student learning and are assessed through the Standards of Learning tests. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia lawmakers, educators and community organizers </span><a href="https://www.sikhcoalition.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Hamkae-Center-and-Sikh-Coalition-Letter-VA-History-and-Social-Standards-SOLs.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wrote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Nov. 5, 2022 that they were “alarmed” to hear of Hillsdale’s involvement with the draft history standards following accusations that the college, in its work with other states, did not provide feedback on public education systems’ social studies standards, but instead created a curriculum for them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The group also pointed out that experts found the 1776 curriculm’s pedagogical framework had “content inaccuracies” and was “lacking” in inquiry, critical thinking and analysis of primary sources.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are highly concerned that Hillsdale College, a private liberal arts college in Michigan, has the potential to dictate and influence what Virginia educators teach and what Virginia students learn,” the group wrote.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to the outcry, Youngkin’s administration pulled the department’s draft standards from further review. It replaced it months later with a draft missing influential figures and events, a flaw historians said was similar to missing information in the 1776 report. Educators, lawmakers, and community organizers also voiced concern about the process&#8217;s lack of transparency regarding who authored the changes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swain, a native of Southwest Virginia, disagreed with the claim that no professional historians were involved in creating the 1776 report. She did say she’s pleased that the governor’s administration may have included elements from the report in the draft standards.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One of the things that we argued and were pushing was for history to be taught using original documents, to get the young people to read the Declaration of Independence, to read the Constitution … (and also) the constitutions of their states for themselves,” Swain said. “And so that was one of the things that I know we were united on, and I believe that the best schools, the private academies, that&#8217;s what they do.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, historians and educators continued challenging the Youngkin administration and the Virginia Board of Education on the draft standards over several months. By April 2023, the Board of Education </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/04/20/after-months-of-debate-virginia-board-of-education-adopts-history-standards/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">adopted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the updated standards, which had been changed to include more of the historic context and content lawmakers, educators and advocates had sought.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dickenson said there are similarities between how the 1776 Commission&#8217;s report and the Youngkin administration’s proposed education standards were created. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like the 1776 report, Dickenson said professional historians were “sidelined” in favor of conservative groups such as Hillsdale College in the early development of Virginia’s standards. The efforts also shifted from inquiry-based learning to a rote, fact-focused approach emphasizing memorization over critical thinking and analysis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This directly contradicts Youngkin’s claim that students should ‘learn how to think, not what to think,’ and it limits opportunities for students to explore, question, and engage deeply with historical content,” Dickenson said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report and draft standards both aimed to frame the removal of critical race theory as a way to change or remove parts of history that discuss racial issues, colonialism and the struggles of marginalized groups, Dickenson said. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What’s next?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plans for reorganizing the 1776 Commission are uncertain, since it was housed under the U.S. Department of Education, an agency that Trump has vowed to disband.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the 2024 national Republican </span><a href="https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/2024-republican-party-platform" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">platform</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, “Republicans will reinstate the 1776 Commission, promote fair and patriotic civics education, and veto efforts to nationalize civics education. We will support schools that teach America&#8217;s founding principles and Western civilization.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leaders in Albemarle County and the cities of Fairfax and Newport News are considering ranked choice voting, which allows voters to rank candidates in order of preference, for city council and county board elections. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simultaneously, Virginia Beach was considering amending its charter to allow the city to use the 10-1 voting system that splits the voting age population into 10 equal districts to vote for the mayor and the representative for their district. But on Tuesday evening, the city council voted not to approve the change. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sally Hudson, executive director for Ranked Choice Virginia and a former state delegate, said because of the public’s wavering faith in democracy at the federal level, it&#8217;s leading more people to question the fairness of election systems in Virginia and other states.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think that the current crisis of faith in democracy at the federal level is getting a lot of people to look more carefully about how all these decisions that we make all the way down to the local level are reflective of some norms and assumptions that may no longer serve us well,” said Hudson. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020, Virginia passed </span><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+sum+HB1103" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that Hudson carried as a delegate, allowing localities to use ranked choice voting for city and county governing body elections. But lawmakers will have to consider renewing the legislation before it sunsets on July 1, 2031.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advocates say the goal of ranked choice voting is to reflect the actual majority of the vote. Opponents argue that may not be true under single transferable voting, a system similar to ranked choice voting, which could allow candidates with minimal support to be elected to office.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think we need to take a look at ranked choice voting throughout the commonwealth,” said Newport News Mayor Phillip Jones. “There are a lot of elections [including for] local constitutional officers and other elections in which the winner wins 30% of the vote. I think it&#8217;s important to take a look at it holistically.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of Newport News’ charter review, the mayor has tasked the review committee to examine ranked choice voting and return with recommendations in the summer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to  state law, ranked choice votes will be counted in each step to determine who wins or who has the least number of votes, compared to the single choice voting method. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the single choice voting method, where voters pick one candidate, Newport News’ central district council seat had five candidates in the Nov. 5 General Election —and the candidate with the highest percentage of votes led with 31%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jones said that shows more people getting engaged in the electoral process. He said more people are also considering running for office: school board, city council, mayor, constitutional offices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There are multiple ways to take a look at this issue and I think one of the solutions on the table is ranked choice voting,” he said. “I think that is going to allow people to really make their voice heard, and you&#8217;re able to get to that 50% threshold instead of 28% or 30% or 40%.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Northern Virginia, the Fairfax City Council is scheduled to convene a work session on ranked choice voting on Dec. 3.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fairfax City Mayor Catherine Read said she requested the work session for her and her colleagues on the concept of the voting method as the city discusses its election process. The city council has elections every two years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ranked choice voting needs to be better understood,” Read said in a statement. “I&#8217;m open to new ideas and concepts if we can see it produces an outcome that people want. This work session is a very preliminary first step in that exploration.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the Piedmont Region, the Albemarle County Board of Supervisors is also weighing its options with ranked choice voting. After the elections office and the three-member </span><a href="https://www.albemarle.org/government/elections/electoral-board" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">electoral board</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> made presentations about the voting method on Aug. 21, the board has yet to make any further plans. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lauren Eddy, general registrar and director of elections in Albemarle County, said in the first presentation if the county adopts RCV, supervisors should expect to cover the costs for software upgrades, equipment, and voter education, which could cost at least $70,000. Eddy said the county could leverage the costs with county communication resources and educational materials developed by other jurisdictions that have adopted RCV.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, in the second presentation, Clara Belle Wheeler, vice chair of the county electoral board and former Virginia State Board of Elections member, said having a ranked choice voting system is expensive, confusing and there’s no need for it. The electoral board is represented by the political party of the current Virginia governor and one member of the party receiving the second-highest number of votes for that office.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have numerous elderly voters and they may know a lot about one the candidate they like, but they will have trouble voting a ranked choice ballot,” Wheeler said. “The less well-informed and the less well-educated will have the same problem, and they could conceivably be disenfranchised … if you can’t figure out how to mark the ballot, your ballot is not gonna even count.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some supervisors </span><a href="https://dailyprogress.com/news/local/government-politics/elections/albemarle-officials-bash-nakedly-partisan-screed-against-ranked-choice-voting/article_c92af83e-8b53-11ef-ab73-3f20b8a400bb.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">criticized</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the presentation by Wheeler, describing it as “poor” and “skewed,” and some took offense to her remarks. Wheeler is a senior fellow at the Virginia Institute for Public Policy, a conservative think tank that has promoted myths about voter fraud.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Virginia Beach change</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following a scheduled public hearing on Tuesday, the Virginia Beach City Council </span><a href="https://www.wavy.com/news/local-news/vb-council-votes-down-putting-10-1-voting-system-into-charter/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">failed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to garner enough votes to amend the city charter to use the 10-1 voting system. The council needed a three-fourths majority, or nine members, to support the measure and send it the request to the General Assembly for approval.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a </span><a href="https://www.coopercenter.org/research/virginia-beach-local-election-system" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the Weldon Cooper Center at the University of Virginia, 78% of city residents surveyed said their interests are “well-represented” under the 10-1 system. The survey included more than 2,100 residents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This system has proven to be a vital step towards ensuring equitable representation and addressing the historical disparities faced by minority communities in our city,” </span><a href="https://naacpva.org/virginia-naacp-urges-virginia-beach-city-council-to-approve-modifying-the-city-charter-to-incorporate-the-fair-10-1-voting-system/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the Virginia chapter of the NAACP in a statement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to city records, in November 2022, the city first conducted its election using the 10-1 voting method after a lengthy legal battle in the Federal District Court. Then in Aug. 15, 2023, the city adopted in its decennial redistricting ordinance that included the 10-1 system and newly formed district boundaries ordered by the federal district court.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the city charter, Virginia Beach voters used the 7-3-1 system, dividing the city into seven districts and three-at-large seats, allowing voters on 11 council seats, according to the city.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In January 2024, former council member Linwood Branch filed a lawsuit alleging the 10-1 system was illegally implemented and goes against the city charter, according to </span><a href="https://www.13newsnow.com/article/news/local/mycity/virginia-beach/virginia-beach-10-1-voting-system-lawsuit-going-to-trial/291-2bb2318c-4990-47b1-873b-e49e1c564ab7" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">13 News Now</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last session, Gov. Glenn Youngkin vetoed </span><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB416" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to amend Virginia Beach’s charter because of “pending litigation concerning the validity of the adopted district system in Virginia Beach,” and said he expected “that this legislation will be re-introduced once the court’s adjudication has been finalized.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the city and General Assembly backed the change to the charter, Virginia Beach’s members representing Districts 2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10 will be elected during the November 2026 general election. At the November 2028 general election, voters will select candidates for Districts 1, 3, 5 and 7 and for the mayoral seat. Each member is elected for terms of four years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>Editor’s note:</em> This story was updated Wednesday morning to reflect the 7-4 vote from Tuesday’s Virginia Beach City Council meeting not to amend the locality&#8217;s charter to include 10-1 voting. The council needed three-fourths majority, or nine members, to make the change.</span></p>

(Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A majority of Virginians supported a referendum expanding the state Constitution to provide real estate tax relief to surviving spouses of service members who died in the line of duty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Constitution only applied to 100% disabled veterans and surviving spouses of soldiers killed in action as determined by the U.S. Department of Defense.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s unofficial election results show that 93% of Virginians supported the amendment through a referendum that was on the ballot last week.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s humbling to see the overwhelming support and to be able to help just over a hundred or so families,” said Sen. Jeremy McPike, D-Prince William, who carried the </span><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB4" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">amendment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the Senate. “I think people, once they read it and understood it, they got why it was so important.”</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">As part of the </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/constitution/article12/section1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">requirement</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> to make any changes to the Constitution of Virginia, McPike’s amendment had to pass successfully by a majority in both chambers in two separate sessions, intervening with a general election. McPike was able to garner the votes in 2023 and 2024.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said the expansion of the law will now also cover the spouses of service members, who, for example, may have died in a training accident.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under current law, the property tax exemption applies only to the spouses of service members who are either 100% disabled or who were “killed in action”— a specific Department of Defense term indicating that the death occurred due to enemy action.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mitch Rubenstein, state commander of the Veterans of Foreign Wars of Virginia, said in a statement that the organization appreciated the votes in  support of the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are grateful to the voters for expanding the property tax exemption offered to surviving spouses of service members killed in action to spouses of any service member killed while honorably serving this nation,” Rubenstein said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2022, lawmakers passed </span><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+sum+HB957" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> carried by Del. Kathy Tran, D-Fairfax, that gave localities the authority to provide property tax relief to certain surviving spouses of service members who died in the line of duty (LODD).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the passage of the amendment, Friends of the Virginia Military Survivors &amp; Dependents Education Program (VMSDEP), an advocacy group for ensuring the state’s tuition beneficiary program is sustainable, said it hopes that localities will continue to offer the tax relief benefit in addition to the statewide tax exemption.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our hope is that, for the purposes of enactment, the amendment enabling language will include the ability for local authorities to continue or choose to provide additive relief, by establishing or continuing a special tax classification for LODD Survivors, to include Survivors of LODD Suicide,” Friends of VMSDEP said in a statement. “Enabling language should include property tax relief when the property is held in a revocable trust.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The group also said it is seeking enabling language to allow survivors who lost their spouses in service prior to 9/11 — when Line of Duty Determination Investigations were first conducted in order to render Line of Duty Death Determination Letters — to provide alternative qualifying documentation. In addition, the organization said it is  asking for language to recognize and include partial ownership for the purposes of proportional tax relief.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Going forward, Friends of VMSDEP will advocate for and support legislation that provides statewide parity between tax relief for Survivors of LODD and survivors of the 100% disabled,” the group said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During an announcement on Friday about the Department of Education’s new </span><a href="https://www.doe.virginia.gov/state-board-data-funding/accreditation-accountability/school-performance-and-support-framework" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Road to Readiness Hub</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help improve student and school performance, the agency’s current reports showed most schools were meeting or are on track to meet expectations compared to a report presented in August demonstrating that more than half of schools lagged behind and required support, based on 2023-24 data.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the accountability system, schools are given one of four labels based on their performance: “Distinguished,” “On track,” “Off Track,” and “Needs Intensive Support.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schools considered “distinguished” are those that exceed the state’s expectations for growth, achievement and readiness, while those that need “intensive support” do not meet any of the state’s expectations. In addition, there are “on-track” and “off-track&#8221; descriptors that indicate whether schools are meeting or not meeting expectations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It seems like there is not [any] clarity around what we are talking about and what this new accountability system is actually looking at,” Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Richmond, the Senate Health and Education Committee chair, told reporters on Friday, adding that the VDOE has not been forthcoming with its data.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We don’t have the data ourselves to evaluate what these numbers constitute and what they represent,” she said, “and so that’s a real concern why there’s not the transparency we need in order to understand where our schools are actually performing.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When asked about the data gap, Superintendent of Public Instruction Lisa Coons said on Friday that the modeling was “incomplete.” The August data was not finalized until Sept. 30, Coons said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Based on 2023-24 data, the VDOE projected in </span><a href="https://www.doe.virginia.gov/home/showpublisheddocument/56656/638598579207770000" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">August</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that 55.5% of schools were significantly “off track” and not meeting the state’s expectation for growth, achievement, and readiness, while current </span><a href="https://www.doe.virginia.gov/state-board-data-funding/accreditation-accountability/school-performance-and-support-framework/spsf-overview" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> shows that 34.7% of schools are “off track” and would need intensive support.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The hub’s launch on Friday comes as Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration seeks to provide the public with transparent access to preliminary data on school performance and resources to support students and schools.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This new Road to Readiness embodies our commitment to high expectations, transparency, and prioritizing resources to those students and schools most in need,” Youngkin said in a statement. “Our school performance framework and this new resource hub reaffirm our commitment to empowering our teachers, partnering with our parents, strengthening our schools and most importantly, preparing every student for success.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The administration believes the performance data was masked behind an existing system that showed an inaccurate picture of K-12 public education in Virginia, as identified by state and national assessments. Youngkin suggested the inaccurate picture was because of previous administrations’ decisions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The hub is also in conjunction with the new accountability framework, which has been in the works for two years and was overhauled from the existing system. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new framework is intended to depict how schools are meeting all requirements set by state laws and regulations, and provide “timely” and “transparent” information on student and school performance, according to the VDOE.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Education leaders, including members of the Board of Education, said the existing system has been considered “vague” and fails to clearly state to the public how students are performing academically since its development in 2018-2019.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new system also aims to improve the direction of state resources.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Friday, Youngkin said he would commit at least an additional $50 million to support schools that were “most in need,” as well as an unspecified amount of additional operating funds for the Office of School Quality. The Richmond Times-Dispatch previously </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/education/virginia-education-assessment-system/article_4773aef0-8cc3-11ef-aa61-6780d4a1c068.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the agency requested $125 million for the assessment system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data collection on assessments is underway, and full implementation of the plan &#8211; is set to begin in the 2025-26 school year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Public speakers at Board of Education meetings and Democratic lawmakers have </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/education/virginia-education-accountability-hashmi/article_1c46cf0e-8ff3-11ef-9fbb-ef6affd1b57d.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">criticized</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> agency leaders for using performance labels that they say have a negative connotation. They also said that they believe the overhauling of the system was rushed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speakers have also said that the changes would increase current inequities for students, and require teachers to earn additional certifications to teach accelerated coursework in middle school mathematics, science, history and social science. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">English learners, which have been typically excluded because of the language barrier, will also be considered in the accountability calculations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The previous rules allowed VDOE to exclude ESL students from their assessment for 11 months per year. Under the new rules, the agency can only discount ESL student data for three months of the year.. Under the previous regulations, approximately 35,000 students were excluded.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maria Arcara and Selene Cerankosky, the two students who received the no-contact orders, responded to the Sept. 27 proposal in an online chat group, according to a </span><a href="https://adfmedialegalfiles.blob.core.windows.net/files/CerankoskyComplaint.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lawsuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> filed on behalf of the students’ attorneys from Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative Christian legal organization focused on protecting religious rights.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cerankosky said if women accessed male restrooms, she believed that men would seek to access private female spaces, which would violate her safety and privacy as well as her religious convictions about human sexuality, ADF stated. Acara agreed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the exchange of views led the student, identified in the lawsuit as Mr. Doe, to accuse them of bigotry and report them to the university’s Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Office. Arcara and Cerankosky received no-contact orders prohibiting them from contacting Mr. Doe</span><b>.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ADF claims that their clients potentially face expulsion from school and scrutiny in their legal careers due to the orders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attorneys also claim in the complaint that the school’s </span><a href="https://universitypolicy.gmu.edu/policies/sexual-harassment-policy/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">policy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> allows the school to include protected speech as “sexual harassment.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ADF claims the policy “does not require the DEI Office to determine that sexual harassment occurred, give notice to students before they are disciplined, advise the accused of the allegations, or allow students to appeal ‘supportive measures’—which include no-contact orders—imposed by the DEI Office.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tyson Langhofer, senior counsel and director of the ADF Center for Academic Freedom, said that Arcara and Cerankosky expressed their opinion about the biological differences between men and women, but Mr. Doe’s proposal “blurs those lines at the expense of safety, privacy, and religious conviction. Because of this, their academic and professional careers are now in serious jeopardy.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Langhofer added that the university’s policy is “far too subjective” and allows university officials to punish students simply because “their opinions about hotly debated social issues don’t align with their own.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">George Mason University President Gregory Washington, Sharnnia Artis, vice president for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion and Chief Diversity Officer, and Thomas Bluestein, Title IX coordinator and assistant vice president of equity and access services, are named in the lawsuit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The university acknowledged The Mercury&#8217;s request for comment but did not supply a response before press time. </span></p>

(Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While many Virginians focused on this year’s congressional and presidential elections, Arlington County became the first locality in Virginia to use ranked-choice voting for city and county governing bodies in the general election Tuesday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But three years after a law went into effect giving localities the option to adopt ranked-choice voting, only Arlington County and the city of Charlottesville have adopted the method common in college campus elections by students, and primary elections and conventions by Republicans in the commonwealth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The chief concern has been around the lack of education.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The biggest obstacles that we face in more localities adopting ranked-choice voting is that it&#8217;s always new, that it&#8217;s a change and I think especially changing the way we vote … in that space is hard,” said Liz White, executive director for UpVote Virginia, which has advocated for ranked-choice voting. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arlington County became the first locality to adopt ranked-choice voting for its Democratic primary in June 2023 and again in June 2024. The process allows voters to rank candidates in order of preference, with elections officials reallocating those votes through several rounds of counting ballots.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_40746" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:780px;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-40746" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Screenshot-2024-11-06-at-9.36.52 AM.png" alt="" width="780" height="661" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Screenshot-2024-11-06-at-9.36.52 AM.png 780w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Screenshot-2024-11-06-at-9.36.52 AM-300x254.png 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Screenshot-2024-11-06-at-9.36.52 AM-768x651.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  A sample ballot in Arlington County shows the candidate options for the first ranked-choice election for a county board seat in a November General Election. (Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Tuesday, it was used for an open seat on the Board of Supervisors, which favored veteran JD Spain Sr., a Democrat who won with 58% of the first-choice votes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voters&#8217; initial reactions were mixed. Some said they wished they had researched more about the candidates, but one admitted that they only ranked one of the four candidates out of preference. Other voters said they were also pleased to receive guidance about the process from volunteers at their precinct.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I liked it actually because it’s tough when it&#8217;s a binary choice, like one or the other,” said Parker Wood, an Arlington resident. “I think it&#8217;s pretty good. It gives a more accurate distribution of data in terms of (what) people think.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An </span><a href="https://fairvote.org/press/arlington-rcv-poll-24/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">exit survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> conducted after the June primary by FairVote, a nonpartisan organization focused on voting reforms, found that 88% of Arlington voters said ranked- choice voting was “easy” and 67% said “they’d like to use it for future elections.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under former Democrat Gov. Ralph Northam, Virginia passed </span><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+sum+HB1103" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2020 allowing localities to use the election method for city and county governing body elections. But lawmakers will have to consider renewing the legislation before it sunsets on July 1, 2031.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the state law, votes will be counted in each step to determine who wins or who has the least number of votes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advocates say the goal is to reflect the actual majority of the vote. However, some argue that may not be true under single transferable voting, which could allow candidates with minimal support to be elected to office.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">White said ranked-choice voting could have been an idea instead of single choice voting in two Democratic primaries this past spring, where more than a dozen candidates vied for seats in the 7th and 10th Congressional Districts held by Abigail Spanberger and Jennifer Wexon, respectively.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eugene Vindman, an Army veteran, won the 7th District primary with 49% out of seven candidates. However, in the 10th District primary, state Sen. Suhas Subramanyam won with 30.4% of the vote out of 12 candidates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think having more cases in which ranked-choice voting could make a difference is going to help propel a lot of these local conversations forward,” White said, adding that having a ranked choice voting could have helped determine who the majority of voters believe should represent them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In September, the Charlottesville City Council voted to adopt the method starting next year with the City Council primary in June.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sally Hudson, former state delegate and author of the ranked-choice legislation, said at the Sept. 3 meeting that the creation of the state law involved top election law experts and organizations in drafting the legislation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A lot of people have done a lot of careful work over the last four years to get us where we are today,” Hudson told the council. “To use the popular parlance of our time: this ordinance did not just fall out of a coconut tree. We exist in the context of all that came before us, and in Charlottesville, that context goes back centuries.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that meeting, council members agreed to appropriate $26,460 for an educational and outreach program and to purchase equipment for ranked-choice voting tabulation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a second vote to adopt the election method, Council Member Lloyd Snook voted in opposition, citing concerns that a voter’s second selection could be devalued.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead, Snook recommended a sequential instant runoff system, claiming it could be a better alternative. Under the single transferable voting method, he disagreed that candidates who won would reflect the true majority of the vote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Although I completely agree with the notion of ranked choice voting, and would be really quite pleased to do it under a sequential, instant runoff voting system, I think most folks that I&#8217;ve talked to don&#8217;t understand how single transferable voting will actually work in terms of what that allocation looks like,” Snook said at the Sept. 3 meeting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response, White said that’s not the case because “voting for multiple candidates is a means to an end to achieve proportional representation.&#8221;</span></p>

Suhas Subramanyam, D-Loudoun, has defeated Republican nominee Mike Clancy in Virginia’s 10th Congressional District race, according to The Associated Press. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subramanyam, a former tech policy adviser to former President Barack Obama, had said if elected, he will advocate for federal funding for Virginia infrastructure projects, which the district’s current representative, Democrat Jennifer Wexton, also pursued. Subramanyam has also vowed to help keep the federal government open to avoid shutdowns that impact federal government employees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wexton, who endorsed Subramanyam, is </span><a href="https://wexton.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=854" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">retiring</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the end of the year after being diagnosed with a severe neurological disorder.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I am honored and humbled that the people of Virginia’s 10th District put their trust in me to take on the toughest fights and deliver results in Congress,&#8221; said Subramanyam in a statement. &#8220;This district is my home. I got married here, my wife Miranda and I are raising our daughters here, and the issues our community faces are personal to our family. It is an honor to continue serving this district in Washington.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past three congressional elections, Democrats have maintained control of the district, even after it was redrawn to include the counties of Loudoun, Fauquier and Rappahannock, the cities of Manassas and Manassas Park, and parts of Prince William and Fairfax counties.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the campaign, Clancy faced criticism for his alleged ties to  Project 2025, a conservative playbook for running the country that proposed eliminating the jobs of federal government workers and contractors. Although Clancy admitted to previously donating to the Heritage Foundation, which authored Project 2025, he denied that he supported the plan, and ran on issues with the economy, parental rights, and public safety.</span></p>

(izanbar/Getty Images) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Members of the congressional delegation from Virginia would like to see the Infrastructure Investments and Jobs Act, or Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, reauthorized when it ends in less than two years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The BIL has fueled internet access </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/virginia-nets-almost-1-5-billion-in-federal-broadband-funds/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">expansion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and funded several transportation and environmental projects in Virginia, including financially supporting the Long Bridge Project&#8217;s expansion and cleanup efforts at abandoned mine lands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The law expires on Sept. 30, 2026, leaving a reshaped Congress and new presidential administration to consider its reauthorization.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3684" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the BIL</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was signed into law on Nov. 15, 2021, authorizing $1.2 trillion for transportation and infrastructure spending with $550 billion targeted for “new” investments and programs over six years, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have just entered the fourth fiscal year out of a five-year package, so it&#8217;s not too soon to be talking about what comes next,” said Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg to the media during the Oct. 15 groundbreaking of the Long Bridge Project in Arlington. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What we&#8217;ve had in this bipartisan infrastructure package is a level of investment that we&#8217;ve not had in my lifetime, clearly very much needed, especially when you talk about a 100 year-old asset like Long Bridge and thousands of cases like that around the country,” he added. “So we need to, I think, take all of the successes and learn from the experiences of the last few years, and it will very much be one of the biggest things on Congress’ plate in just about a year from now.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the groundbreaking ceremony, lawmakers laid out how the act has helped and advocated for the law to be reauthorized.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Congresswoman Abigail Spanberger, D-Prince William, said the Long Bridge expansion was an example of how the law continues to impact Virginians and “makes good on the promise of investing in our communities.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Mark Warner, D-Virginia, said reauthorizing the law would help address some unmet needs for rail, highways and airports in the commonwealth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If we just keep all the folks who voted for it last time and add in all the members of Congress who didn&#8217;t vote for it, but have shown up in ribbon cuttings across the country during the last five years, we&#8217;ll have an 85% passage,” Warner said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is also a catch-up for crumbling infrastructure that was allowed to languish and be neglected for a long time,” said Congressman Gerry Connolly, D-Fairfax.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some lawmakers have had a change of heart concerning BIL. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Rep. Morgan Griffith, R-Salem, had voted against the policy, initially </span><a href="https://morgangriffith.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=402544" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">criticizing </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">how much of it was new spending or just reauthorizations of approved funding. Yet, he touted his role in securing a $1.6 million federal grant benefitting the Piedmont Planning District’s Commission’s Route 122 Regional Corridor Plan, which was funded under the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Griffith explained the contradiction by saying “&#8230;once it’s passed into law, I would be failing to do my job if I didn’t then advocate for those federal monies to come to the 9th District,” in a September interview with the Mercury about his </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/27/in-the-fightin-ninth-baker-seeks-to-end-griffiths-13-year-tenure/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">campaign</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for re-election in the Southwest Virginia-based district.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Transportation </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers and industry leaders in transportation are excited about the future of public transit after millions in BIL federal funding have been dedicated to projects across the commonwealth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Danny Plaugher, executive director for Virginians for High-Speed Rail, said the federal government’s $16 billion investment nationwide for rail is making a “huge difference,” eclipsing an earlier record of $2 billion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In October, Virginia celebrated the groundbreaking of the Long Bridge expansion project after the commonwealth was awarded $729 million. Once completed, the bridge that connects Washington D.C. and Virginia, will allow for more freight and passenger rail service separation. </span></p>

(Washington D.C. Department of Transportation/ Virginia Department of Rail and Public Transportation)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The current two-track system, widely considered a choke point, has negatively impacted travel times. The plans include expanding to a four-track corridor and constructing approximately 1.8 miles of improvements to rail and pedestrian bridges.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plaugher said the two largest federal investments for rail before the Act were $74 million in 2009 and $100 million for the Franconia-Springfield Bypass last year. The bypass is an elevated rail bridge south of the Franconia-Springfield station that separates passenger trains from the existing freight tracks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, across rail and transit services, Plaugher said Virginia has aggressively sought grants for bridge repairs, rail improvement, and safety projects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Both the railway and transit side have been very aggressive in pursuing opportunities for those competitive grants, and we have also been very successful,” Plaugher said. “And so I think we should be proud of our elected and appointed leaders for ensuring that Virginia gets its fair share, and that good things are happening.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to USDOT, Virginia is expected to receive $1.2 billion under the law to improve its public transportation options.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other investments for Virginia include approximately $386 million for infrastructure development for airports, about $106 million per year over five years to support the expansion of an electric vehicle charging network in the commonwealth, and along with grant opportunities, earn a portion of $2.5 billion.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Energy &amp; environment</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislation had a significant impact on environmental issues as well, and is assisting the commonwealth in tackling outdated pipes, supporting electric grid programs and cleaning up abandoned mine lands.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with the release of incremental amounts of funding for Virginia to upgrade water and gas infrastructure, the BIL provided over $50 million in October to replace those lines in the state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency </span><a href="https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/biden-harris-administration-protects-communities-lead-drinking-water-announces-more-35" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> $35.1 million is headed to Virginia to replace lead drinking water pipes, in line with an administrative rule to identify and replace those lines across the country within 10 years. The announcement comes after the EPA awarded $94 million to Virginia in </span><a href="https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/biden-harris-administration-announces-94-million-virginia-drinking-water-wastewater" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">February</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to upgrade drinking water, and wastewater and stormwater infrastructure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About $15.7 million out of the U.S Department of Transportation&#8217;s Pipeline and Hazardous Material Safety Administration, or PHMSA, is going toward </span><a href="https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/sites/phmsa.dot.gov/files/2024-10/FY%202024%20NGDISM%20Grants%20Report.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">replacing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 13.25 miles of aging gas mains with polyethylene and cathodically protected steel coated lines in Richmond.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although environmentalists are critical of maintaining fossil fuel infrastructure, PHMSA said the funding will reduce 22.26 metric tons of methane, the most potent climate change causing greenhouse gas, annually by eliminating leaks.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data centers, the energy intensive warehouses storing internet processors, are proliferating in Virginia, prompting electricity generation sources to be built, including  natural gas-run facilities. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Energy had received about $3 million to $4 million annually since 1981 to clean up mine lands, but the BIL increased the coffers by $23 million over the next 15 years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The AML program exists to clean up mine lands coal companies left unreclaimed, or remediated, before the 1977 Surface Mine Reclamation Act, which now requires sites to be reclaimed, meaning returned to their natural states or revamped for future economic opportunities. Dangers, such as a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/07/01/bipartisan-infrastructure-law-aiding-virginia-energys-abandoned-mine-cleanup/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">landslide</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Dickenson County, can result from improper irrigation at AMLs if reclamation doesn&#8217;t happen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The increased funding is </span><a href="https://www.energy.virginia.gov/public/documents/newsroom/2024/Press_Release_DOI%20Announces%20$22%20MIll%20for%20VA%20AML%20BIL%20funding%2020240325.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">expected</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to allow Virginia Energy to reclaim 70% of its inventory of abandoned mines it has found since 1981. That’ll lead to the creation of more than 1,000 jobs, the agency said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If Congress considers reauthorizing the law, Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Virginia, predicted his colleagues could debate turning the act into a longer term investment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Six years is going to prove to the American public, and I hope to Congress, of course it&#8217;s worthwhile,” Kaine said. “So my prediction is when we have the reauthorization vote, it&#8217;s going to be by a bigger margin than the first one.”</span></p>

The committee formed in the wake of a series of campus protests over the ongoing Israel-Hamas war last spring that led to the arrests of dozens of students and faculty members, and criticisms of how some institutions responded to the demonstrations.</span></p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Senate hearing over campus protests to Israel-Hamas war draws criticism from Republicans&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/19/senate-hearing-over-campus-protests-to-israel-hamas-war-draws-criticism-from-republicans/embed/#?secret=nheFTQdWUw#?secret=pcby5vVsis" data-secret="pcby5vVsis" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But after five months, there has yet to be a hearing or word on when one will occur.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zahra Jalajel, a senior at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond, said the House&#8217;s lack of action suggests that it is “supportive” of the universities&#8217; and law enforcement&#8217;s protest response, which, in VCU’s case, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">included using pepper spray to clear encampments and arresting 13 people.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jalajel described the experiences as “brutal” after watching friends and schoolmates being dragged and arrested by police, and their belongings including laptops being permanently destroyed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think that by not having those conversations, it is saying that we&#8217;re not important and what occurred to us is not important to them,” said Jalajel.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Updated campus protest policies still a concern</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students, university faculty members, and organizers hoped that lawmakers&#8217; interest would help influence how universities responded to the demonstrations and take accountability for the flurry of policy changes about public demonstrations several schools have made since the protests. Free speech advocates have described the series of updated campus policies </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/03/virginia-colleges-change-protest-rules-mirroring-unprecedented-u-s-trend-advocate-says/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“unprecedented” </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">and questioned whether they infringed on students’ First Amendment rights. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was violent; it was the unnecessary use of violence, and people were hurt and harmed. It didn&#8217;t have to happen that way,&#8221; said Walt Heinecke, immediate past president of the American Association of University Professors Chapter at the University of Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I think faculty staff and students around the commonwealth are asking for some accountability about what&#8217;s been happening and what has happened since with the changes of university protest policies.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Others hoped some legislation could also be proposed for the upcoming session starting in January, but they did not have any specific ideas. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the spring, Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration has urged Virginia’s colleges and universities to “take proactive steps to update policies and improve communication channels before students return this fall,” according to an Aug. 8 </span><a href="https://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Campus-Safety-and-Security-A-Message-From-Secretary-of-Education-copy.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">email</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> quoting Secretary of Education Aimee Guidera.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VCU has made changes like </span><a href="https://vcu.public.doctract.com/doctract/documentportal/08DCB87F8F1BF38525EBA350748F2D3D" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">requiring</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> students to have identification when covering their faces or heads, and </span><a href="https://vcu.public.doctract.com/doctract/documentportal/08DA32A740D31FB4D9FC17CC1351AF65" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">banning encampments</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on campus grounds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Charlottesville, the University of Virginia administration has already implemented new disciplinary and protest policies “with no student input” from faculty members and students, according to an Aug. 21 letter from AAUP Chapter at UVA.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="5FwkLGe6KL"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/08/uva-president-said-protest-outcome-upsetting-professors-condemn-administrations-actions/">UVA president said protest outcome ‘upsetting’; professors condemn administration&#8217;s actions</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;UVA president said protest outcome ‘upsetting’; professors condemn administration&#8217;s actions&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/08/uva-president-said-protest-outcome-upsetting-professors-condemn-administrations-actions/embed/#?secret=Yrxn4VmTTM#?secret=5FwkLGe6KL" data-secret="5FwkLGe6KL" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heinecke fears the longer lawmakers wait to meet, the policy changes could negatively impact students and faculty members.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He added that the policy changes at UVA would increase the punitive nature of protesting and make it “almost near to impossible for students to protest in what is normally accepted ways of protesting.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Faculty members and students could also face harsher penalties, including termination or expulsion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They have made it harder to protest, they have made the consequences for protesting more severe, and they are actually squelching the First Amendment rights of students both at a psychological level and a policy level,” Heinecke said.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Legislators’ response</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Majority Leader Charniele Herring, D-Alexandria, briefly spoke with the Mercury after the first meeting was canceled. However, neither the office of Del. Terry Kilgore, R-Scott, or Herring, both committee chairs, have responded to questions about the second cancellation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since Hamas, a Palestinian militant group, attacked Israel near the Gaza strip last October, killing 1,200, injuring hundreds, and taking hostages, demonstrators have called for a cease-fire and protested at five universities in Virginia last spring. In the resulting aftermath of the Oct. 7 attack, Israel declared war and over 41,000 Palestinians have been killed, while nearly 100,000 were injured and the health care system in Gaza has collapsed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia demonstrations ended with more than 125 arrests at four campuses in the commonwealth — the University of Mary Washington, Virginia Commonwealth University, Virginia Tech and the University of Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since lawmakers in both chambers </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/14/virginia-lawmakers-to-study-campus-safety-policies-after-series-of-protests/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">formed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> select committees in May to examine campus safety only Senate lawmakers have met, which was a contentious gathering between students, faculty members and some lawmakers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans disagreed with the hearing process, described as a “fact-finding” session, because lawmakers could not ask university leaders questions publicly. Lawmakers were urged to submit questions afterward in writing. The meeting agenda also went beyond the scope of the events, and no law enforcement agencies were directly invited to speak; instead, they were offered to comment through university leaders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the meeting, Capitol Police had to break up students and faculty members with opposing views. Jalajel, who identifies as a Black Palestinian, said the confrontation is an example of why Virginia’s legislature needs to get involved sooner rather than later.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think the climate worsens every day, and I think the sooner we have the (hearings) … maybe we&#8217;re able to make some changes before it gets worse,” Jalajel said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A second meeting has yet to be scheduled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jack Leff, a recent Virginia Tech graduate arrested during the April campus protest, attempted to find more about the conversations between the House committee chairs and House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth. However, after reviewing the responses from Leff’s records request, the offices invoked their working papers exemptions and didn’t release any correspondence. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leff, now an adjunct professor who identifies as Jewish, said it&#8217;s important for lawmakers to investigate the campus protests to ensure the First Amendment rights of everyone, including Palestinian and Jewish activists, are honored.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Abandoning their responsibility to protect Palestinian, Jewish, and activist students is a failure to uphold First Amendment rights,” Leff said, adding that it&#8217;s truly “undemocratic not to be investigating universities more in response to these protests.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leff said he’s worried about retaliation for his involvement in the encampment at Virginia Tech in the spring. Despite his “strong” employment record, he said Virginia Tech failed to renew his contract as a staff member following his arrest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oliver Nicholson, a senior at the University of Virginia, experienced a similar issue at an encampment at his university. Even though the court dismissed the charges against him, and Nicholson said he regained the job he lost, he is now concerned about losing his job again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said the House holding its hearings could help everyone understand what happened at Virginia’s universities in response to the continuing conflict.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think having an official institution like the Virginia Senate, like the Virginia House, record it and show ‘Hey, here&#8217;s what the encampment is about,’ here&#8217;s what students endured, here&#8217;s how safe it actually was,’ rather than whatever demonization you saw on social media, I think that&#8217;s very valuable as providing truth and clarity on the issue,” Nicolson said. “So yeah, it&#8217;s disheartening to me that so many of these meetings have been canceled or pushed back. I would like to see them reinstated.”</span></p>

(Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Thursday, Virginia lawmakers discussed ways to address the state’s decades-old funding formula, which determines the funding level for public schools, and considered a series of near-term recommendations that could be phased into the commonwealth’s plans within three to four years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lifting the support cap, which limited the number of support positions the state would fund, was one of the recommendations put forth by Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission researchers. JLARC’s December </span><a href="https://jlarc.virginia.gov/pdfs/reports/Rpt575.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> showed that local governments in Virginia are spending more to pay for K-12 education than the commonwealth to fund the </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/constitution/article8/section2/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">state’s</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Standards of Quality in Virginia school divisions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s SOQ formula determines funding for divisions by calculating the number of staff they need and then the cost of those staff. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other near-term recommendations from JLARC:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Address technical issues with the formula</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Discontinue Great Recession-era cost reduction measures such as the support cap</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use division averages instead of approximating what most school divisions spend on operating their schools in calculations. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The commission also recommended that the Local Composite Index, or a locality’s ability to pay education costs, should be changed to a three-year average instead of every two. They also suggested changing the at-risk funding formula that would impact low-income or students identified as “at-risk,” and studying special education staffing needs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The joint subcommittee, tasked with reviewing and proposing changes to the funding formula, learned that on Thursday, the near-term recommendations could be phased in over three to four years. The long-term recommendations are “more complex and will require additional review to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">implement,” the commission told them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Terry Jones, a special education teacher and member of the Virginia Education Association, said at Thursday’s joint subcommittee hearing with members of both the House and Senate that since the pandemic in 2020 and the continued exodus of k-12 teachers, special education has been one of the hardest hit areas in terms of staffing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“(It’s been) so severe that classrooms are often led by substitutes or adults with no training in education and in many schools, this is more than half of the classrooms,” said Jones.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said while lawmakers are considering long-term reforms, including shifting to a student-weighted funding model compared to the current staff-based model, “they don&#8217;t address the immediate needs we face today,” urging them to act immediately.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of the long-term recommendations offered by JLARC:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Develop and adopt new staffing ratios similar to more accurately reflect how divisions are staffed</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Update old salary assumptions during rebenchmarking, a period every two years in which the state reviews the cost of continuing to provide direct aid to programs </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Replace the cost of competing, a measure to help school divisions compete for staff in more expensive labor markets, with a new and more accurate method</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Add economies of scale adjustment, or a cost savings measure, to provide additional funding to divisions with fewer than 2,000 students.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Understanding the support cap</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to staff, the committee received responses about the funding formula from nearly 60 respondents, who were not identified to the public. Staff said some of the responses expressed support for lifting the support cap.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cap was enacted during the Great Recession in 2007, impacting central office and administrative, technical, clerical, maintenance and instructional support positions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Funding levels have never been fully restored, but the support cap was partially lifted last year, which increased the funding ratio from 21 support positions per 1,000 pupils to 24 per 1,000 pupils.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Terry Austin, R-Botetourt, said he hopes the committee will work with the Virginia Department of Education to ensure the funding supports classrooms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I know the support cap is very broad and what it covers, but I hope our emphasis will be on improving the quality of education and putting the dollars where we&#8217;ll get the most benefit from them,” Austin said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislature </span><a href="https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/amendment/2024/1/SB30/Introduced/CA/117/3s/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">allocated</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> $600,000 to the department over the next two years to support the subcommittee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In terms of studying special education staffing needs, JLARC identified that per-pupil special education funding has declined over the last 10 years when adjusted for inflation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Researchers also found that the most significant gap between SOQ formula estimates for staffing compared to actual division staffing was in instructional aides, including special education.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the last session, Gov. Glenn Youngkin vetoed </span><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=HB624" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that would have reviewed special education staffing needs in an omnibus package he and Democrats sparred over regarding teacher pay. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, some of the legislation’s elements were successfully passed in the 2024-2026 budget. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers agreed to allocate $72.1 million over the next two years to expand and provide targeted support for English learner students and $371.3 million in additional funding for at-risk students over the next two school years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislature also redirected approximately $650 million each year and added around $180 million yearly to develop the at-risk program. Most localities have opted into the program, which helps to provide sufficient funding for schools to serve low-income students in Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;ve done quite a bit in the areas of ELL and at-risk, but this is one of the areas that we have neglected,” said Sen. Mamie Locke, D-Hampton, adding that there may be some overlap with ELL and at-risk, “but I think that this is one area where we do need to do some work.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The committee will next meet on Dec. 9 ahead of the 2025 General Assembly session that starts in January.</span></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Port Authority will receive $380 million in federal funding to purchase new zero-emission cargo handling equipment and charging infrastructure. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to members of Virginia’s congressional delegation, the funding was provided through the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Clean Ports </span><a href="https://www.epa.gov/ports-initiative/cleanports" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">grant program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, stemming from the </span><a href="https://www.energy.gov/lpo/inflation-reduction-act-2022#:~:text=The%20President's%20Inflation%20Reduction%20Act,energy%20manufacturing%2C%20and%20putting%20the" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inflation Reduction Act of 2022</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, designed to address and support environmental issues and climate goals nationwide, and achieve a net-zero economy by 2050. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of the Port’s </span><a href="https://www.portofvirginia.com/gateway/environmental-sustainability/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sustainability efforts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, officials said that the grant money will be used to buy and install electric assets and equipment as legacy equipment powered by gasoline or diesel fuel engines is retired.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Port will replace several pieces of equipment including specialized cranes for all rail operations, shuttle carriers for moving containers, electric locomotives, on-terminal trucks and shuttle buses to move people to and from work areas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This grant is truly transformative for our port and our community,” said Stephen A. Edwards, CEO and executive director of the Virginia Port Authority in a statement. “It will make our operations more efficient and sustainable, enhance our capabilities and allow us to continue making strides toward becoming the U.S. East Coast’s first net-zero port.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He added that the Port’s approach to sustainability and efficiency aims to advance opportunities for its workforce and reduce pollution in  communities that host its terminals, in the state’s Tidewater region. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are building the U.S. East Coast’s most modern gateway and this is accelerating economic development and workforce enrichment to ensure that Virginia is not just prepared for, but ahead of the future,” Edwards said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the EPA, the Port of Virginia was one of </span><a href="https://www.epa.gov/ports-initiative/clean-ports-program-selections" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">55 applicants</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> across 27 states and territories, receiving a total of $3 billion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Congresswoman Abigail Spanberger, D-Prince William, who said she voted for the Reduction Act to “help build a stronger future for the next generation of Americans,” said in a statement that the investment will help grow the commonwealth’s economy and support the nation’s economic competitiveness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Now, I’m proud to see these federal investments coming home to Virginia,” Spanberger said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Congressman Bobby Scott, D-Newport News, and Democrat Sens. Mark Warner and Tim Kaine, all of whom supported the Act, echoed similar sentiments and stressed that the Port is “critical” to Virginia’s economy and offshore wind industry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As the Port of Virginia continues to grow thanks to investments we’re making, we must also ensure we’re reducing greenhouse gas emissions, which result in negative health and environmental impacts for our communities,” the lawmakers said in a statement. The funds for the Port will “further cement Virginia’s place as a leader in clean energy,” they wrote.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Jan. 3-4, 2022, Virginia experienced a complete traffic shutdown, primarily in the counties of Spotsylvania and Stafford, which made headlines worldwide and left vehicles trapped on the highway during a severe snowstorm. The shutdown also impacted access points for travelers and forced some drivers to abandon their vehicles with little to no gasoline. The debacle’s impacts extended to Culpeper and further into Northern Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lauren Mollerup, maintenance engineer for the VDOT Northern Virginia District, said at a Monday briefing the district is prepared for the upcoming season with a fleet of 3,500 pieces of equipment, most of which is contracted, and 120,000 tons of salt. The office will continue working with the National Weather Service and Iteris to plan for snowfall mitigation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She said the district, weather services and other partners will continue advising Virginians about snow storms beforehand and pre-treat roads as necessary. While VDOT is responsible for clearing interstates and some other roadways, Mollerup recommended Virginians learn who is responsible for clearing their area’s travel routes by contacting their local government or transportation agency.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Even if you make the best plan, sometimes it just doesn&#8217;t work out,” Mollerup said, “People have to be aware, you’ve got to be ready, you’ve got to do all these things and then hope for the best in some cases.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the 2022 snow storm, Mollerup said the district was under a near-max level advisory level and the snow was an overwhelming challenge for the area’s VDOT team. Mollerup said members from her district in Northern Virginia tried to assist, but even for them, the storm&#8217;s impact was overwhelming.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to an Aug. 12, 2022 </span><a href="https://www.osig.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/office-of-the-state-inspector-general/pdf/performance-audits/I-95-Snow-Incident-Report-FINAL-8-11-22.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">audit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the Office of the Virginia Inspector General found that the commonwealth needed to apply lessons learned from a similar snow event on Interstate 81 on Dec. 9-10, 2018. The inspector general also found that the commonwealth had no hazard-specific snowfall plan and needed to communicate more effectively to the public to avoid travel on I-95 or provide accurate information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The inspector general recommended the commonwealth conduct snow-related disaster response and recovery exercises and advised the Virginia Department of Emergency Management (VDEM) to facilitate communication training for VDOT, VDEM and Virginia State Police.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state is forecast to have an overall milder winter according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s </span><a href="https://www.wsls.com/weather/2024/10/18/noaa-has-released-its-winter-outlook-for-the-2024-25-season-heres-what-they-predicted/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">latest outlook</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but snowfall is a distinct possibility. Mollerup said it could take several days for the agency to clear up to six inches of snow or more, a timeframe that can vary based on the dryness and weight of the snow, and available resources. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chris Strong, meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Virginia, said because of the “unpredictability” of winter weather, VDOT’s partnership with the weather service and other groups is essential for the commonwealth to reach travelers during inclement weather.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Being able to reach the right people at the right time so the good people at VDOT and others can mitigate weather threats is really what it’s all about,” Strong said. “It doesn’t matter if we have a perfect forecast or not. It matters whether the end results [are] good.”</span></p>

Shown are children at the Downtown Children’s Center in St. Louis. (Courtesy of Rebecca Rivas/Missouri Independent)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Board of Education sent the proposed </span><a href="https://www.doe.virginia.gov/home/showpublisheddocument/58022/638646898284400000" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">standards</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for licensed child care centers for regulatory review on Tuesday, potentially ending the existing standards to enhance the safety of children receiving care.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The review will include </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the publication of the proposed regulation in the Virginia Register, then</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after review by the Attorney General&#8217;s office and the governor, public comments will be solicited and revisions made prior to the final adoption by the board.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, after some providers aired concerns over the changes at the business meeting, the board on Thursday directed staff to create guidance for providers on screen time and other common issues raised through variance requests. The board also removed the requirement for providers to use only liquid soap in the proposed regulation since some children can only use bar soap because of sensory needs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Honestly, it just seems like an over-regulation to require child care centers to apply for a variance for something like just using a bar of soap,” said Board Member Meg Bryce, a Gov. Glenn Youngkin appointee. “I have a 3-and-a-half-year-old who can&#8217;t pump liquid soap, so I can see why this would be a pretty common issue in child care centers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The process began in December 2021 to protect children while also meeting state and federal laws, considering the cost and operational impact of regulations, and reducing any “burdensome” requirements, according to Virginia Department of Education (VDOE) staff. Public comments on the updated rule will still be accepted through the Early Childhood Advisory Committee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposed regulation, dubbed Standards for Licensed Child Day Centers, is expected to help people more easily understand the standards and keep kids safer under state and federal laws. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The regulation describes to providers the health and safety requirements of operating a child care center and provides the standards to protect children under the age of 13, and also reduces risks and ensures the services and resources at the centers are “conducive to the well-being of children,” according to VDOE staff.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020, the Virginia General Assembly transferred oversight of early childhood care and education programs from the Board of Social Services to the Virginia Board of Education.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, funding and oversight of early childhood programs and policies, including the Child Care Subsidy Program and child care licensing and monitoring, transitioned to the Virginia Department of Education from the Department of Social Services on July 1, 2021. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“From the beginning, we&#8217;ve tried since the shift to DOE to say our job is to partner with programs to keep kids healthy and safe,” said Jenna Conway, deputy superintendent at VDOE, adding that if any providers don’t understand the standards or need additional help the department will assist.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She continued that there is still more work to be done and it is essential that providers “believe in these regulations” so they can employ these practices “day in, day out” to prevent child care center fatalities in Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposed regulation includes </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title22.1/chapter14.1/section22.1-289.059/#:~:text=%C2%A7%2022.1%2D289.059.-,Possession%20and%20administration%20of%20an%20appropriate%20weight,dosage%20of%20epinephrine%20by%20employees." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a state law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> requiring centers to have a stock of epinephrine on hand and to train staff on its administration. </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title22.1/chapter14.1/section22.1-289.057/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> requires centers to perform lead testing to ensure drinking water meets minimum standards.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the proposed regulation, the definition “school-age” was revised to clarify that the allowance for children 5 years of age by Sept. 30 to be considered school-age is not exclusive to school-age only groups.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Records could include a child’s dietary restrictions and any special accommodations needed, and centers must also inform the superintendent if a child is lost, missing or wandered away unattended from the facility.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The height requirement of climbing equipment installed outdoors after June 1, 2005, was proposed to be reduced from seven feet to six for toddlers and preschool children. Indoor climbing equipment height requirement would remain at five feet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of a handful of speakers requesting the board modify the proposed regulation on Thursday said the height requirement is unclear. Other speakers urged the board to modify the regulation that calls for providers to increase the ratio of staff to children by two, which they fear may not decrease the costs for centers entirely. Speakers also asked the board to modify the standards around visual media screen time to differentiate between the age groups.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conway said there are approximately 2,600 child care centers across the state.</span></p>

(Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia lawmakers are aiming sky high as they turn their attention to the future of “advanced air mobility.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Wednesday, experts in the aviation and drone industries addressed lawmakers from Virginia’s Joint House and Senate Transportation Committees at the governor’s annual transportation conference in Norfolk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of the areas discussed included emphasizing the importance of collaboration and “policy harmonization” across different agencies and programs, supporting workforce development and considering making the state’s supplies and parts tax exemption permanent while addressing the potential concerns of the technology.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We need the patron saints from inside the body pushing for us and we need you to become industry experts,” said Daniel “Bud” Oakey, president of the Virginia Aviation Business Association. “We&#8217;re not going anywhere as an industry, but up and we&#8217;re going at speeds that will just increase.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the nonprofit group Virginia Innovation Partnership Corporation (VIPC), the advanced air mobility industry, as it is known, could generate $16 billion in new business activity in the commonwealth.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="fTIAkM8Svb"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/12/22/what-would-virginia-need-for-a-future-of-electric-and-automated-aircraft/">What would Virginia need for a future of electric and automated aircraft?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;What would Virginia need for a future of electric and automated aircraft?&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/12/22/what-would-virginia-need-for-a-future-of-electric-and-automated-aircraft/embed/#?secret=3Rotcc6Qpp#?secret=fTIAkM8Svb" data-secret="fTIAkM8Svb" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advanced air mobility is a term that refers to aircraft that are highly automated, more flexible than large commercial airplanes and typically electric. One example is electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, often called air taxis. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uncrewed aerial vehicles, which are part of a larger umbrella under advanced air mobility, have proven popular as a way to offer travel and delivery services and, at the same time, promise to reduce greenhouse gases. However, because the technologies are new, regulations and infrastructure are still under development.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is incredibly important for us as a legislature to start considering what are some of the regulatory considerations and incentives that we need to think about now, because the future is here,” said House Transportation Committee Chair Karrie Delaney, D-Fairfax.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tracy Tynan, director of Virginia Unmanned Systems Center at VIPC, said AAM is important to the commonwealth because it improves accessibility for rural and urban areas and provides sustainability potential because many of the systems rely on electricity to operate and reduce emissions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She said AAM can also help with law enforcement and medical responses. In August, Riverside Health System </span><a href="https://www.riversideonline.com/about/newscenter/system/riverside-health-system-will-begin-using-cargo-drones" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it would begin using cargo drones to deliver medication to patients on remote Tangier Island, 16 miles from the mainland of the commonwealth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marcy Eisenberg, president of Xelevate, a drone research center and training facility in Leesburg, said there are a number of key industries that can benefit from AAM including advanced materials, aerospace, automotive, controlled environmental, agriculture, cybersecurity, data centers, food and beverage processing, semiconductor conductors, software and supply chain management. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The possibilities are endless,” Eisenberg said. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Privacy, security concerns</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As exciting as uncrewed aerial vehicles have become, they have also raised public concerns about security and privacy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Bonita Anthony, D-Norfolk, emphasized the need for a comprehensive regulatory framework for the vehicles in Virginia, incorporating both local and federal guidelines. Some of the growing concerns are about data privacy, mass surveillance, and equity, particularly in land use and public safety.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There are many use cases, and so we need to build a framework that covers the basis of all those use cases,” Anthony said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In December, VIPC published a </span><a href="https://www.virginiaipc.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Virginia-UAV-Activity-Study_OTkxOD.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that highlighted the aviation and security concerns for local communities of uncrewed aerial vehicles, specifically drones that can be used for surveillance and can be challenging to detect and identify.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VIPC also reported that the systems could be modified for illicit purposes, such as weaponization or delivering contraband. System operators are also free of autonomy once the drone has left the operator. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report states that small uncrewed aircrafts flown in unauthorized areas — particularly near airports and heliports— can cause havoc to air traffic and other aviation operations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result, the Federal Aviation Administration began tracking them in 2014.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, the FAA found that the commonwealth experienced 320 uncrewed aerial vehicle sightings from 61 locations. Virginia’s sightings make up approximately 2% of the total nationwide reports.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Small unmanned aircraft systems continue to create problematic safety and security challenges</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">for state and local agencies,” VIPC wrote in the December report. “As these devices continue to proliferate, state and local governments will be forced to establish policies for detecting, tracking, and responding to problematic sUAS flights.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What’s next</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers will return to Richmond in January to discuss proposed legislation and existing laws.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers said it&#8217;s too early to see if anything related to uncrewed aerial vehicles will be proposed, but said Wednesday’s panel will help to craft legislation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Transportation Committee Chair Jennifer Boysko, D-Fairfax said the goal of creating the joint session for their colleagues is to be “forward thinking” and educate members on UAVs and transportation electrification, which a second panel discussed in Wednesday’s meeting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Both of them have major economic opportunities for the private sector and we just want to make sure that as we are starting to legislate on those things, that we have the facts in front of us,” Boysko said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the last session, Virginia adopted a budget that allocated $1 million from the Commonwealth&#8217;s Development Opportunity Fund in fiscal year 2025 to support the development of an advanced air aviation test site in the commonwealth. The agency, in cooperation with the Virginia Innovation Partnership Authority, is directed to work with the industry to identify the “optimal” location or locations and uses of these funds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">​​On Tuesday, the Federal Aviation Administration published a</span><a href="https://www.faa.gov/newsroom/integration-powered-lift-pilot-certification-and-operations-miscellaneous-amendments" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> final rule</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the qualifications and training that instructors and pilots must have to fly aircraft in the “powered-lift” category, which have characteristics of both airplanes and helicopters, according to the agency.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The FAA said the new pilot-training and qualifications rule was necessary because the existing regulations did not address this new category of aircraft, which can take off and land vertically like a helicopter and fly like an airplane during cruise flight.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The FAA will continue to prioritize the safety of our system as we work to seamlessly integrate innovative technology and operations. This final rule provides the necessary framework to allow powered lift aircraft to safely operate in our airspace,” said FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker in a statement on Tuesday.  “Powered lift aircraft are the first new category of aircraft in nearly 80 years and this historic rule will pave the way for accommodating wide-scale Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) operations in the future.”</span></p>

(Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Parents of nearly 10,000 children in Virginia are seeking early childhood care and education services primarily in the south and central regions, according to data collected by the Department of Education as of Oct. 1. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Industry experts say the challenge is balancing capacity and demand as the state focuses on preparing children and supporting families.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia faces unmet parental demand for all three state-funded child care programs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state-funded programs are the </span><a href="https://www.childcare.virginia.gov/providers/child-care-subsidy" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Child Care Subsidy Program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which provides subsidies to eligible families; the </span><a href="https://vecf.org/mixed-delivery-grants/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mixed Delivery</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> program, which offers funding to private, community-based preschools to serve children at risk of entering school without the necessary skills, and the </span><a href="https://www.doe.virginia.gov/teaching-learning-assessment/early-childhood-care-education/virginia-preschool-initiative" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Preschool Initiative</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> program, which is provided for free, for four-year-old children.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Unmet parent demand for child care is essentially a loss or a leak in our workforce pipeline,” said Del. Carrie Coyner, R-Chesterfield, at the Oct. 9 Commission on Early Childhood and Education meeting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. David Bulova, D- Fairfax, added that while the commission is off to a great start, there is still a long way to go.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve built up a system that I think is gathering a great reputation, and so it’s not surprising that people are taking notice and they want to participate in that,” Bulova said. “This is really a very important part of our economy, it’s an important part of our workforce development and it’s also just a really great way to help families become self-sufficient and successful in the long term.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The wait list</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to data collected by VDOE, 9,657 children, including infants, toddlers, and school-age children, are on the Child Care Subsidy Program waitlist based on information collected from 93 of the 120 localities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jenna Conway, deputy superintendent at VDOE, said at the commission meeting that the remaining localities either have enough attrition or are seeing a different level of demand. The agency did not provide data on the enrollment changes for the Mixed Delivery or Virginia Preschool Initiative programs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Chesapeake Bay region has the most significant demand for services at 24%, followed by the Central and North Central regions at 22%.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A total of 4,100 infants and toddlers comprise most of the children on the waitlist.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conway said that excluding any policy changes, $112.7 million in additional funds would be needed to fully cover the 9,657 children on the waitlist. Excluding school-age children would cost $94.1 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She added that about two-thirds of families seek options in the private sector because they have infants and toddlers or need a full-day or full-year option. A third of families are seeking options through public school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the agency, Virginia families contribute an average of 2% of gross income. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The current average copayment is $77 per month. Changing the current copayment policy for any of the three state-funded programs requires a change to Virginia’s biennial budget, completed in May.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Improving child care services</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the progress made to identify the need and demand for child care services, the commission celebrated the state’s </span><a href="https://earlychildhoodquality.doe.virginia.gov/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">release</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of 3,121 profiles of publicly funded early childhood sites across the commonwealth detailing each program&#8217;s health, safety and learning information. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The data was published on Oct. 8.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The profiles stem from the Unified Virginia Quality Birth to Five system, or </span><a href="https://www.doe.virginia.gov/teaching-learning-assessment/early-childhood-care-education/quality-measurement-and-improvement-vqb5" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">VQB5</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, focused on improving children’s school readiness and expanding access to parents and support providers. The system is also a tool to help gauge the effectiveness of Virginia’s early childhood education programs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bulova said earlier that more than half of child care programs, approximately 75%, that received public funding previously did not participate in the state’s voluntary quality measures. His 2020 legislation, which he co-patroned, led to all publicly funded providers being required to participate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coyner said she was anxious to begin reviewing the data as the commission seeks to support families with access, costs and quality of services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For our families to work, attend job training, get more education and pursue greater self-sufficiency, which is our goal, while putting their children on track for success in school, we need to ensure that eligible families have access,” Coyner told the panel at the meeting. “And again, that comes back to our task with finance, right? Access and quality equates to our ability to finance the system.”</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The commission will conclude its review and recommend updates to the current copayment schedule, parental work requirements, and attendance expectations applicable to the Child Care Subsidy Program and Mixed Delivery Grant Program by Dec. 1, according to </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://vecf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024.10.09_ECCE-Commission-Budget-Language.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">language</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> in the biennium budget.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, Jodi Kuhn, an expert in data analytics and ethics from Richmond, was selected as the Joint Commission on Technology and Science’s executive director, the first since its </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title30/chapter11/section30-85/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">establishment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 1997. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kuhn, who served as the director of data quality and visualization for the Virginia Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">said she hopes to use her experience in the private sector and 15 years in the executive branch to enable “responsible innovation by providing objective, non-partisan research to our legislatures.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She said she’s already received support from universities in and beyond the commonwealth, including Virginia Tech and the Wharton School at UPenn, that includes consultation and reports around Blockchain technologies, a method for recording information, and is forthcoming for the commission. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the last session, the Virginia legislature </span><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=HB1199" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">authorized</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the commission to appoint an executive director to support the group of lawmakers from both the House and Senate. Staff from legislative services split their regular duties by supporting the commission.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Cliff Hayes, D-Chesapeake, commission chair, said legislators face several challenges in dealing with complex technology issues and, in most cases, have limited expertise. With the help of Kuhn, Hayes said he hopes to have thorough research and recommendations when reviewing technology legislation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;re not in the business of passing ideas. We are literally passing laws that the commonwealth&#8217;s citizens and businesses are going to have to follow, so that in itself, begs us to do our due diligence the way that we should before we actually pass law,”  Hayes said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hayes thanked previous legislators and staff for laying the groundwork for hiring a dedicated staff and the successes thus far.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kuhn said the commission will continue reviewing over a dozen bills from the last legislative session that range from blockchain technology, to artificial technology, to online and data protections. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The depth and breath of bills that came to JCOTS demonstrate that our legislature is clearly ready to dive deeper into these topics. Having full-time, dedicated staff, Virginia is now poised to be at the forefront of leveraging advances in science and technology in a manner that keeps our citizens, and especially our children, safe.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The committee made the recommendation, along with a list of others — including funding special education based on based on the state funding formula and continuing ongoing training for families and using the new </span><a href="https://www.doe.virginia.gov/teaching-learning-assessment/student-assessment/virginia-sol-assessment-program/virginia-alternate-assessment-program-vaap" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">student evaluation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> tool — to the Board of Education, as the Virginia Department of Education (VDOE) and lawmakers continue working to improve services to special needs families and meet federal requirements.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since 2019, the U.S. Department of Education has been investigating how Virginia handles special education disputes. The department previously determined that the state repeatedly failed to resolve complaints filed by parents and did not have “reasonably designed” procedures and practices to ensure a timely resolution process for those complaints.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A study by the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission, the state’s legislative watchdog, surveyed parents and found that they were not adequately informed of the state-level resources available to them for resolving disputes with their child’s school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Samantha Hollins, an associate superintendent with VDOE, said given the increasing number of complaints, the Office of Dispute Resolution’s staff size has made it a challenge to meet the adjudication requirements set by the federal government.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The committee recommended that VDOE evaluate the proper staffing levels in the Office of Dispute Resolution and the Office of Program Improvement within the Department of Special Populations, which handle complaints to “ensure the increasing needs of families of children with disabilities requesting assistance can be met,” the report states.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The department should consider providing an annual summary in order to help the advisory committee perform its “statutorily required duty of identifying trends in the issues being raised by parents of students with disabilities in the commonwealth, the committee suggested.”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VDOE and lawmakers have taken several steps to improve services for nearly 181,000 students with disabilities this school year, which coincide with the advisory committee’s recommendations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The department created a system to oversee the development and use of individualized education programs (IEPs) for students with special needs.  Educators are now required to undergo more training on providing inclusive special education instruction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The board also adopted regulatory changes to how the state handles compliance complaints regarding students with disabilities and dedicated funds to examine the dispute resolution system, which has been criticized for failing to monitor and respond to complaints against school districts.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Teacher pipeline and funding </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the Sept. 26 presentation to the board, the committee also raised awareness about incentivizing and funding high school educator prep programs to develop a pipeline for potential special education teachers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia was one of a few states to </span><a href="https://www.doe.virginia.gov/Home/Components/News/News/399/227" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">receive</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a $6 million grant to expand its registered apprenticeship program for K-12 educators and create opportunities in the teaching profession. Last year, 28 school divisions launched registered teacher apprenticeship programs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The committee also recommended that the department ensure that if a locality uses Virginia IEP and has optional add-ons, those comply with IDEA parent participation requirements, “specifically that parents are able to access their student’s information and increase their participation in the IEP process.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://sites.ed.gov/idea/about-idea/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Individuals with Disabilities Education Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (IDEA) is a federal law that ensures students with disabilities receive a “free appropriate public education” and guarantees special education services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hollins said the department and governor’s administration are “actively” seeking additional resources to support some of the specialty modules. An allocation from the special education fund goes to the IEP process, but there is no dedicated fund to support it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s also been recent evidence that Virginia has underfunded schools for years, leaving localities responsible for filling the gaps.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the JLARC 2023 study into K-12 funding, analysts found that the Standards of Quality formula, which helps the state determine how much funding schools need, estimated that fewer special education teachers are needed than actual staffing, and a workgroup of K–12 teachers, principals and other school staff concluded. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For fiscal year 2023, the funding formula calculated that 13,300 special education teachers were needed, which was 93% of the number employed by school divisions and 66% of what practitioners estimated was required. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State analysts </span><a href="https://jlarc.virginia.gov/pdfs/summary/Rpt575Rec.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recommended</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> lawmakers require the VDOE to work with school division staff and experts to develop new special education staffing need estimates based on a review of current ones.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Analysts also suggested the legislature amend state law to replace the funding formula calculations for special education and English as a second language students, including any associated calculations for benefits and payroll taxes under the Standards of Quality, with student-based funding calculations based on actual average school division expenditures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers formed a joint subcommittee to review and transform the state’s funding formula, which could take a while.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The subcommittee will vote on a work plan at its Oct. 31 meeting.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But commuters hoping to use the service to travel from Maryland using the MARC commuter train into the commonwealth in the late morning may miss out, because Virginia Railway Express only runs trains heading south from Union Station at </span><a href="https://www.vre.org/assets/1/6/MANASSAS_PRINTER_FRIENDLY_SCHEDULE_2023.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">6:35 a.m.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and later around </span><a href="https://www.vre.org/assets/1/6/FREDERICKSBURG_PRINTER_FRIENDLY_SCHEDULE_2024.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1 p.m</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If someone traveling from Maryland needs to get into Virginia, they would instead have to travel by bus, car, or Metrorail, depending on where they live.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Danny Plaugher, executive director of Virginians for High Speed Rail, said he believes there is a “decent” amount of commuting from Southern Maryland and suburbs of Washington D.C. to places in Virginia including Amazon&#8217;s HQ2 headquarters, National Landing, Tysons Corner and the tech corridor in Northern Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although he’s uncertain how many of those travelers are already served by Metro, if the run-through service were available at additional times, it could benefit those commuters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think there will be opportunities in the future, but just trying to figure out what the new normal is and then building a service that will accommodate those new normal travel trends is going to be key to the future mobility of the region,” said Plaugher.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">How the run-through service started</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In August, the two systems </span><a href="https://www.mta.maryland.gov/articles/458" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that passengers with a weekly, monthly, or 10-trip ticket purchased on the MARC or VRE system to Union Station can utilize that ticket to transfer to the other system to continue their trip, without paying anything extra.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Virginia Railway Express, the previous agreement between the two rail services was terminated by Maryland’s MARC commuter train service in 2015. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unrelated, a MARC and VRE </span><a href="https://www.mwcog.org/newsroom/2020/05/26/whats-the-market-potential-for-marc-vre-run-through-service/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">run-through service study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was commissioned by the Transportation Planning Board at the Washington Metropolitan Council Governments in 2019.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Analysts found most trips likely originate from Maryland and head to Washington D.C. and Arlington destinations. An estimated 16,000 daily trips would be serviced by the run-through service, mainly between Baltimore, MD, and Alexandria at 11,600 trips.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">COG </span><a href="https://x.com/MWCOG/status/1821614635746816020" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in August that the move by VRE and MARC to “create a more connected region” aligns with the DMVMoves transit effort launched by COG and Metro in May.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maryland Transit Administrator Molly Arnold said in August that the agreement represents a “significant step forward in regional transit integration” that fosters economic growth, supports tourism and attracts business to the region.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new run-through service also coincides with VRE’s long-range goal to grow the commuter-focused rail service to an all-day, bi-directional transit system that can “better meet the transportation needs of a growing region,” said Rich Dalton, VRE CEO, in August.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What’s next</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plans are underway to expand the Long Bridge that connects Washington D.C. and Virginia, allowing for more freight and passenger rail service separation. The current two-track system, widely considered a choke point, has negatively impacted travel times.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The plans include expanding to a four-track corridor and constructing approximately 1.8 miles of improvements to rail and pedestrian bridges.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Friday, Alliance Defending Freedom, representing the Harrisonburg teachers, filed the brief in Rockingham County Circuit Court. In June 2022, Harrisonburg City teachers Deborah Figliola, Kristine Marsh, and Laura Nelson filed a </span><a href="https://adfmedia.org/press-release/parents-teachers-sue-va-school-district-concealing-childrens-discomfort-biological" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lawsuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> challenging the school board’s decisions that they claim “violate Virginia’s Free Speech Clause and the Virginia Religious Freedom Restoration Act by compelling them to speak a message to which they object,” the attorneys stated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legal team recently </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/30/va-school-board-to-pay-575k-to-fired-teacher-who-refused-to-use-transgender-students-pronouns/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">settled</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a case for a former high school French teacher who declined to refer to a transgender student by his requested pronouns. The case ended with the West Point School Board agreeing to pay $575,000 in damages and attorneys’ fees.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative Christian legal organization focused on protecting religious rights, claimed the teachers were directed to “immediately implement” three practices through a series of trainings: asking students their preferred pronouns; always using them, even when contrary to a student&#8217;s sex; and doing so without notifying parents or seeking their consent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ADF Senior Counsel Vincent Wagner said by doing so, the Harrisonburg City School Board is compelling its employees to refer to students by their pronouns that don’t correspond with their sex.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“[Figliola, Marsh, and Nelson] like all School Board employees, face a choice: comply with the trainings’ ‘Best Practices’ or risk losing their jobs,” the brief read. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wagner added that Virginia’s Constitution and other laws contain “robust free speech” and “free exercise protections for public employees, and let teachers do their jobs. Because of those protections, we urge the court to rule for our clients.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In September 2022, Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration </span><a href="https://www.doe.virginia.gov/parents-students/for-parents/model-policies-on-ensuring-privacy-dignity-and-respect-for-all-students-and-parents-in-virginia-s-public-schools" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">overhauled</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the state’s policies for transgender and nonbinary students to </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/09/16/youngkin-administration-overhauls-virginia-transgender-student-policies/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">require parental approval</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for any changes to students’ “names, nicknames, and/or pronouns.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The changes also included a directive to schools to keep parents “informed about their children’s well-being,” and a mandate that student participation in activities and athletics be based on sex and the use of bathrooms correspond to a students’ sex, “except to the extent that federal law requires.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a </span><a href="https://jlarc.virginia.gov/pdfs/reports/Rpt593.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission, which conducts analysis and provides oversight of state agencies on behalf of the General Assembly, each institution is &#8220;attempting to address its viability risks through various initiatives and efforts.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">JLARC assessed Virginia&#8217;s 15 public four-year public higher education institutions in three areas: enrollment, institutional appeal and finances using data collected through 2022.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Mark Sickles, D-Arlington, chair of the commission, said there’s a number of factors that have led to the increased viability risks for some institutions, including the state’s shift to offering education based on Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics, or STEM, at four-year universities compared to the smaller, liberal arts schools, who are attempting to offer more STEM-education programs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is not a surprise to the presidents or the boards of visitors of all these schools,” said Sickles. “They&#8217;ve already taken some remedial action. I&#8217;m really curious whether what they&#8217;ve done now is going to work or not.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Researchers also found that public opinion on the value of higher education has changed while institutions, including Radford University, recover from enrollment declines over the past decade.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Factors putting the schools at risk</h4>

(Courtesy of the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Radford’s viability is at risk because of declining enrollment, after JLARC found that its total full-time enrollment dropped by 26% over the past decade, more than any other four-year institution in the commonwealth including nearby Virginia Tech.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mary Washington and Virginia State’s viability is at risk due to the institutions’ inability to increase tuition without losing students and the age and condition of their facilities. Mary Washington also carries a risk due to its financial ratio because of its relatively high debt from absorbing foundation debt and assets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Between 2015-22, VSU, which has the oldest facilities in the commonwealth, experienced a decline in tuition revenue per student by 26%. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Monday, Sen. Mamie Locke, D-Hampton, questioned if the risks against Virginia State have any connection to the institution </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/10/25/va-governor-rejects-claim-of-underfunding-virginia-state-university/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">not being funded</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the same levels as Virginia Tech after the federal government estimated a year ago that VSU is owed over $277 million in state funding from 1987 to 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like Virginia Tech, the historically Black college in Petersburg is a land grant institution. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s an HBCU and this state is known for not having funded HBCUs to the levels that they should be funded,” Locke said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration has denied the claim, stating that the U.S. Departments of Education and Agriculture used a </span><a href="https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">database</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the administration characterized as having “well-documented issues.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of JLARC’s study in the cost efficiency of public higher education institutions, researchers found that Christopher Newport, Longwood, and Norfolk State Universities and the University of Virginia’s College at Wise all have a “very low” viability risk. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">JLARC made no further recommendations for action in addition to the analysis and planning processes each institution conducts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sickles said the state increased its funding for higher education over the past two bienniums, which includes adopting a budget that provides </span><a href="https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/sessionreport/2024/2/2434/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$205.4 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over the 2024-26 biennium to increase access, aﬀordability and degree production at public colleges and universities.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Recommendations on spending and efficiency</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a separate </span><a href="https://jlarc.virginia.gov/pdfs/reports/Rpt594.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to address the increased spending with the slow growth of enrollment, researchers recommended amending state code to place a cap on the amount of student fees and institutional funds that can be allocated to intercollegiate athletics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At James Madison University, athletics revenue grew by $11.8 million over 10 years, $8.7 million of which was funded by student fees and the institution without exceeding the </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title23.1/chapter13/section23.1-1309/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">statutory limit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> set in 2015.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Researchers also recommended the legislature require institutions experiencing reductions in cost efficiency because of declining enrollment to report their efforts on how they’re working to improve enrollment operations.  JLARC also suggested amending the state code to ensure schools’ boards of visitors fully consider the impact that policies and decisions in non-instructional areas have on student costs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Researchers found that some institutions have not implemented efficiency strategies in areas of spending growth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Further, researchers added that some institutions are not “consistently” implementing efficiency strategies previously recommended by JLARC and subsequently required in the Appropriation Act.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Total spending by Virginia’s 15 public four-year institutions increased by 64% over the past 20 years, which was adjusted for inflation. Instruction made up the largest cost.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Total spending by Virginia’s 15 public four-year institutions increased 64% over the past 20 years. This was greater than the national average for public four-year institutions during that time period, which was 50 percent.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the demand for electrification grows, companies and specialists in Virginia are helping to develop the workforce necessary to build and maintain electric vehicles, connect consumers to electric transportation, and uncover resources to power low-emission vehicles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, to attract and retain employees and build, sell, and maintain electric and low-emission vehicles, leaders in the respective industries said the commonwealth needs to provide incentives and support efforts to continue building an efficient charging infrastructure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leaders in the trade industry said one of the biggest misperceptions is that people can’t be successful unless they go to college. Experts said it&#8217;s one of the driving forces behind the shortages of electricians, mechanics and technicians. Trade workers are needed in the electric vehicle industry, too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don Hall, president and CEO of the Virginia Automobile Dealers Association, said Virginia can help by continuing its commitment to career and technical education (CTE) training as well as working with the federal government to develop an accessible and convenient charging infrastructure and create ways to invest and incentivize EV purchases. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There are many things the state can do, but both parties have been lacking in that arena,” said Hall. “Yet one party over the other says, ‘this is where we need to be’ [and] ‘we need to be selling more of them.’ Okay, I agree, but help us.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not clear how state efforts on workforce development are focused on electric vehicles. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When asked why Gov. Glenn Youngkin nixed a proposed battery manufacturing plant slated for Virginia’s Southside, press secretary Martinez said </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the governor “decided not to finance technology affiliated with the Chinese Communist Party using Virginia taxpayer money,” and pointed to other clean energy jobs the state is </span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2024/07/09/south-korean-company-plans-to-build-681-million-offshore-wind-submarine-cable-plant-in-chesapeake/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pursuing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia was </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/11/virginia-americas-top-state-for-business-nations-best-schools-solid-infrastructure.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">named</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the top state to do business in 2024 by CNBC. But the governor admitted that the commonwealth still has work to do in the area of workforce development, after CNBC ranked the state ninth on that measure, largely because of the shortage of educators moving to the commonwealth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin told CNBC that the workforce grew by 240,000 since he took office in 2022, but that growth hasn’t included electric vehicle makers at a rate other Southeastern states are experiencing. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Jobs: Building electric vehicles</h4>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia businesses and higher education institutions are becoming involved with testing and developing semiconductor chips and building electric vehicles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this year, Virginia </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/virginia-micron-semiconductor-chips-lynchburg-batteries/article_973cc5fa-fda5-11ee-99bd-076706ef8fb7.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">settled</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on an incentive package with manufacturers to develop batteries and semiconductor chips used to support vehicles, after the country experienced a shortage in chip manufacturing. Micron, one of those manufacturers, designs the advanced fabrication for many of its chips in Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Delbert Parks, vice president and site executive at Micron Technology, said the chips are the backbone of the EVs. The chips also drive advancements in power electronics and electrification efforts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also said developing a “robust and diverse talent pipeline” is essential for driving innovation in the semiconductor industry and supporting EV trends; some of that talent could come from . community colleges and universities. Students and university researchers can design and manufacture cutting-edge solutions, meet growing production demands, improve energy efficiency and maintain global competitiveness in the semiconductor industry and the EV revolution. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Micron has partnered with several Virginia colleges including Virginia Tech and Norfolk State University to grow the workforce and provide experiential learning opportunities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The semiconductor industry is facing a global talent gap requiring industry, academic and government partnership to ensure we create pathways for students, K-PhD, to enter into our industry,&#8221; Parks said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the help of a grant from the National Science Foundation, the Bradley Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at Virginia Tech has been working to advance semiconductor research and education. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The department also hosts workshops and summer camps to encourage high school students to pursue careers in semiconductor-related fields, and has been putting more emphasis on offering semiconductor chip courses in light of the nation’s shortage of chips.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volvo Trucks North America is one of the vehicle manufacturers in Virginia promoting the sale of heavy electric trucks, including tractor trailers.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_40032" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:1024px;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-40032" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/NRV-Site-Aerial-1024x576.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/NRV-Site-Aerial-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/NRV-Site-Aerial-300x169.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/NRV-Site-Aerial-768x432.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/NRV-Site-Aerial-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/NRV-Site-Aerial-2048x1152.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  The Volvo Group North America New River Valley Plant located in Dublin, VA. (Courtesy of Volvo Group North America)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Calling itself the largest manufacturing employer in Southwest, Virginia, the company employs about 36,000 people at its plant in the New River Valley and says its been committed “from the beginning” to building an educated workforce for those selling and working on the trucks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“During the dealer certification process, all employees receive safety and basic EV training and a minimum of two technicians per location must be certified,” said Bobby Compton, product marketing manager at Volvo Trucks North America. “Traditionally, these technicians have experience working on traditional (internal combustion engine) powertrains and are adding the skill set for zero-emissions-vehicles.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company has benefited from the Commercial Clean Vehicle Credit under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which equates to a $40,000 tax credit for buying an electric battery truck. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The IRA, President Joe Biden’s landmark law regarded as the largest investment in climate policy in the country&#8217;s history, has offered tax credits to incentivize the creation of electric manufacturing facilities throughout the country. The Southeast has taken advantage of those offerings, giving the region the name “battery belt.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The policy has been using funding from the IRA and 48C tax credits to spur EV component development. This is </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/16/podcasts/the-daily/biden-electric-vehicles.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">intended</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to create domestic manufacturing and make EV purchase tax rebates, which require components to be made in the U.S.A., more accessible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Virginia has not been part of that movement, although it has come close. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state almost became home to a battery plant in Danville, but the Richmond Times-Dispatch </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/ford-disputes-reporting-on-pittsylvania-county-pick-for-battery-project/article_3fce0f3e-9697-11ed-9b9d-d309e4bf363a.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">in January 2023 Youngkin pulled the plug because of a concern over connections to China.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“His concerns were validated when Ford scaled </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/business/ford-pausing-construction-of-battery-plant-that-had-been-considered-in-virginia/article_480a2dae-5bf4-11ee-9ec7-ffe193373d83.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">back</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> its Michigan battery plant plans, resulting in fewer jobs than anticipated, and the Defense Authorization Act </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-19/us-will-ban-pentagon-procuring-batteries-from-china-s-catl-byd" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">banned</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the Pentagon from purchasing batteries based on (Chinese-based Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., Limited technology),” Martinez said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, in Dec. 2023, Microporous, a Tennessee-based company that manufactures lead-acid battery separators, was the recipient of a $100 million grant from the federal government through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to potentially invest over $1 billion and create 282 jobs to build a lithium-ion battery plant in Virginia’s Pittsylvania County. But no final decision has been made and the company is considering building the plant in other states.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brad Reed, vice president of corporate development at Microporous, said the U.S. Department of Energy and the Virginia Economic Development Partnership are working to finalize a grant agreement and incentives package before year’s end.  Among the other states, Virginia was the “best for support offered in the area of workforce recruitment and development,” Reed said, but offered lower financial services compared to North Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Ohio.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No final decisions or public announcements will be made until these are finalized and approved,” Reed said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And in April, Applied Materials, the second company alongside Micron to receive a state incentive package, received $100 million in federal funding to open a battery plant in Lynchburg. The public </span><a href="https://cardinalnews.org/2024/04/22/5-ways-the-battery-plant-planned-for-lynchburg-is-significant/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">saw</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this move as a way for Virginia to enter the battery belt industry. But in August, </span><a href="https://cardinalnews.org/2024/08/02/battery-plant-backed-by-100-million-federal-grant-no-longer-planned-for-lynchburg/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">news</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> broke that the company had scrapped its plans without a clear answer as to why.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When asked what other EV component manufacturing plants the state was pursuing, Martinez, with the governor’s office, said “the administration is actively working on several economic development opportunities,” and pointed to successful 48C tax credit awardings, used to spur domestic clean energy development, luring in other engineering-related manufacturing operations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those included a $681 million investment from GreenLink LS in </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/news-releases/2024/july/name-1030531-en.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chesapeake</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to make a submarine transmission cable for offshore wind projects, and an over $400 million investment by Topsoe, a carbon emission </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/news-releases/2024/may/name-1026403-en.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reduction</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> company, in Chesterfield County. Those investments received $235 million in the 48C tax credits, “the third most of any state in the nation,” Martinez said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The administration has and will continue to leverage available federal dollars to unleash economic growth in Virginia,” Martinez said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Southern Alliance for Clean Energy and Atlas Public Policy </span><a href="https://www.cleanenergy.org/wp-content/uploads/Transportation-Electrification-in-the-Southeast-2023-Report.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">found</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the end of last year that Florida, Alabama, South Carolina, North Carolina, Tennessee and Georgia, had announced the addition of 65,242 manufacturing jobs and $60 billion in investment by building out the battery belt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Noting that announcements of the jobs may not always come to fruition, the report stated, “One factor in the growth of EV jobs in the Southeast is the significant economic incentive packages offered by state and local governments.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Jobs: Maintaining EVs</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While EVs require less maintenance, Matt Shepanek, vice president for credential testing programs with the National Institute for Automotive Service Excellence (ASE), said it&#8217;s a “misconception” that there won’t be any jobs available for technicians in the EV industry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With EVs, you don&#8217;t have some of the maintenance items, like there&#8217;s no oil and power steering fluid and things like that, but there&#8217;s still plenty of things that technicians need to do, as far as diagnostics and just overall vehicle care.” Shepnaek said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two years ago, ASE created a free </span><a href="https://ase.com/ev" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">EV safety standards</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> document, which the institute and members in the vehicle industry developed. The institute also started providing testing programs to help technicians and salespeople become certified to work and provide information to consumers about electric vehicles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shepanek said well over 5,000 people have participated in both testing programs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For years, car manufacturers have also trained technicians to work on their vehicles at service stations and shops and taught salespeople to understand vehicle details important to consumers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dan Banister, chair of the Virginia Automobile Dealers Association and owner of Banister Automotive, said car manufacturers such as Nissan and Ford have provided extensive training for his technicians at five dealerships, four of which are in Virginia and the other in Maryland. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the age of electrification, Banister said the role of technicians has changed, with some experts primarily using tools such as wrenches and now computers. He credits secondary schools and community colleges, including those in Chesapeake, for creating opportunities for students and the automotive industry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We need people out there willing to get their certifications (and) to help with all the skills we&#8217;re lacking right now,” Banister said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Banister said it’s important to have certified employees available to meet the demands of all their customers including those with EVs. On average, he said technicians work on four to five EVs a month with warranty work or tire replacements.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a real need for electricians trained to install chargers and charging stations around the commonwealth, with electric vehicle owners and future consumers increasingly searching for access. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Charles Skelly, business manager with IBEW Local 666, which represents and trains electricians, said the organization is helping new and experienced electricians prepare for the wave of charger installations. Those installations require electricians to be familiar with electrical load calculations and code requirements.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;With the manufacturing jobs that are coming countrywide from the IRA and other laws that have come out recently &#8230; there&#8217;s just an extreme demand for electricians right now,&#8221; Skelly said. Class sizes have increased from 20 to 25 students per class in the last few years. The number of classes  per semester has increased from two to three this fall, with 75 new apprentices starting. The program has 300 apprentices total. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://evitp.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Training Program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the primary program for electricians to complete to install chargers, requires applicants to have 8,000 documented hours of fieldwork. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;re neck deep in making sure we&#8217;re prepared for the work,&#8221; Skelly said, adding that their training can vary from residential to commercial and industrial levels. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Jobs: Uncovering resources</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The International Energy Agency found that 1.46 carbon dioxide equivalents, the same amount produced by 164 gallons of gasoline, are emitted when mining for lithium carbonate, a component of lithium-ion batteries that power a majority of electric vehicles. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While there are no major mining operations in the commonwealth, mineral mining is one practice in Virginia that could yield some success in collecting non-fuel minerals. However, there are environmental concerns about digging for resources, and processing minerals can add more emissions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, the IEA found that making an electric vehicle emits less climate-changing emissions than gas-power internal combustion engine cars.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Total lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions of EVs are around half those of internal combustion engine cars on average, with the potential for a further 25% reduction with low-carbon electricity,” the IEA </span><a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions/sustainable-and-responsible-development-of-minerals" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trip Pollard, with the Southern Environmental Law Center, said that’s the evidence to support electric vehicles instead of ones that guzzle gas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Overall, when you look at the environmental toll, you know the entire process of a gas-powered vehicle and an electric vehicle,” Pollard said. “Hands down, you&#8217;re better off with electric vehicles, which is why we support that transition.”</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_40119" class="wp-caption alignright" style="max-width:100%;width:300px;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-40119" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/deq-charger-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/deq-charger-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/deq-charger-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/deq-charger-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/deq-charger-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/deq-charger-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  EVgo chargers deployed by the Department of Environmental Quality at a gas station in Richmond.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. has a ban on </span><a href="https://www.state.gov/conflict-minerals/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">conflict minerals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which come from countries known to have human rights violations. Cobalt, a mineral explored as a more efficient power source for batteries, can come from the Democratic Republic of Congo. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, Sen. Bill Stanley, R-Franklin, introduced a bill this past session to prevent public bodies, including state and local governments, from procuring an electric vehicle unless the manufacturer swears child labor wasn’t involved in the process. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At an August meeting when discussing his bill, Stanley said finding “clean energy sources … is a policy decision that the commonwealth has made and rightly so.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Stanley continued, “I still believe that we can make a general inquiry and determine what nation states, what countries are mining this cobalt rationally, reasonably and without harm to their children or to their citizenry.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scapegoating electric vehicles in that pursuit isn’t fair, Pollard said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If we&#8217;re really concerned about this issue, which is a serious issue, it should apply to all products, don&#8217;t single out EVs,” Pollard said. “I think there are concerns that need to be addressed, and, absolutely, (the SELC is) involved in a couple of projects that are mining projects in the south. They&#8217;re pushing for more steps to be taken to minimize any adverse environmental impacts.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia has nearly all of the 50 critical minerals in the state in trace elements, including Cobalt, which has a “moderate potential” for economic development, and lithium, which has an “unknown potential.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sixteen of the elements have high potential for development,” said Tarah Kesteron, a spokeswoman for Virginia Energy. “These include the 14 rare earth elements (REEs), titanium, and zirconium.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One company that mines for titanium and zirconium is Atlantic Strategic Metals. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement on the </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/03/12/petersburg-based-company-to-reactivate-mining-operations-in-dinwiddie-sussex/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reactivation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the mine in Dinwiddie and Sussex counties, Christopher Wyatt, the CEO said that Virginia had “a knowledgeable and talented workforce.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More broadly, Virginia is exploring ways to procure rare earth elements from waste </span><a href="https://rga.lis.virginia.gov/Published/2024/SD3/PDF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">coal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as well as </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/08/08/four-takeaways-from-southwest-virginias-critical-mineral-investigation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">innovative</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ways to find critical minerals in the earth or mined coal, through an initiative with Virginia Tech called Evolve Central Appalachia, or CAPP.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The work around minerals is part of the transition that the Natural Resources Defense Council said can be more affordable than spending  $1,117 a year to fuel a gas-powered vehicle, compared to $485 a year to fuel an electric one, the group found, citing a University of Michigan </span><a href="https://www.nrdc.org/stories/electric-vs-gas-cars-it-cheaper-drive-ev" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The cost saving also comes with benefits for humans and the planet they call home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“At 20 pounds of co2 for every </span><a href="https://www.epa.gov/greenvehicles/greenhouse-gas-emissions-typical-passenger-vehicle#:~:text=How%20can%20burning%20one%20gallon,the%20carbon%20and%20hydrogen%20separate." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">gallon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that’s burned, this is a phenomenal number of carbon dioxide molecules that are released in gasoline,” said Harned. “I think that the social cost of carbon, the impacts around people&#8217;s lives, the refugee movements, the economic harms from the additional storms, the heat events and the loss of life, that will over time reduce our consumption.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In approximately half of the country, people can also store and share personal credentials on their devices, including state identification cards or driver’s licenses. Virginia has been working with experts to develop technology to make the same thing possible here. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Jillian Cowherd, a spokeswoman with Virginia DMV, the agency has partnered with CBN Secure Technologies on its Virginia </span><a href="https://www.dmv.virginia.gov/licenses-ids/mobile-id" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mobile ID (mID)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> program. While the agency continues to work with businesses and organizations to accept the mID, Cowherd said the agency is working to “make it easier” and “more secure for customers to manage their credentials” while addressing privacy concerns about the potential for personal data to be released without approval. State lawmakers are also closely monitoring the process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We always want to make things easier for folks (and) we can do that with the use of technology &#8230; but that&#8217;s always tempered with making sure that the privacy of individuals is paramount,&#8221; said House Technology Committee Chair Cliff Hayes, D-Chesapeake. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently the app is available for download and is being used by a portion of Virginia’s nearly 126,000 state employees. mID can be used at select TSA checkpoints including Richmond International Airport and Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, and state workers are providing feedback to the agency.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cowherd said the team is working to make mID available to the public in Google, Apple, and Samsung wallets and is in discussions with public and private entities to ensure it will be accepted at businesses and by organizations when launched. She said that once its fully rolled out,, Virginians should be able to use their mobile ID to board planes, show proof of identity at DMV offices, engage with law enforcement and emergency services, and eventually show proof of age at retail establishments and restaurants.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“DMV has continued to work with CBN Secure Technologies, our secure credential vendor partner, to develop an app, conduct extensive testing, gather customer feedback and ensure it has seamless functionality and robust security,” said Cowherd in a statement. “However, building a program that is widely accepted and highly secure takes time.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The pilot program, legislation</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2017, the General Assembly passed </span><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?171+sum+HB2229" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> creating the standards for issuing, reviewing, and displaying electronic credentials after the agency conducted a year-long pilot research program to assess “customer value, market demand and the ability to meet stakeholder needs,” Cowherd said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the program’s </span><a href="https://www.dmv.virginia.gov/licenses-ids/mobile-id/faq" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">list</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of frequently asked questions, there is no cost associated for Virginians to add the mID to their device or to use it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2017, lawmakers discussed charging for each individual-issued electronic credential. State law allows the agency to charge users up to $10 per year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to an earlier fiscal statement from the Department of Planning and Budget, at the fixed rate of $10, Virginia would have collected $1.7 million in revenue per year if 3% of the state’s approximately 5.6 million licensed drivers signed up. If 5% of licensed drivers were to buy an electronic credential, Virginia could receive approximately $2.8 million per year.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Privacy Concerns</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Karrie Delaney, D-Fairfax, chair of the House Transportation committee, said having technology to store your identification card on your smartphone is convenient for a lot of people, but privacy is paramount to many Virginians. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Having the security factors is an essential part of making sure that this program is trustworthy for the public,” Delaney said. “We are responsible for making sure that those guardrails are in place. But, at the end of the day, it is also going to be a choice for people.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Dave Marsden, D-Fairfax, said he believes the 2017 bill that created the mobile ID standards didn’t “raise any alarm bells” for the legislature, but believes lawmakers would be open to making any necessary changes if needed to address privacy or security worries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State governments and authorities known as “issuing authorities” seeking to use mobile ID technology have partnered with the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators, a nonprofit organization dedicated to developing model programs for motor vehicle administration, law enforcement and highway safety, for guidance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to </span><a href="https://www.aamva.org/topics/mobile-driver-license" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">guidelines</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> provided by the AAMVA, the issuing authorities, in this case Virginia, should take care to ensure mobile ID data stored on peoples’ phones is “adequately protected.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As standards in this respect are still under development, each Issuing Authority should take great care to ensure that the design of its solution supports this requirement,” the guidelines read. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AAMVA’s guidelines also advise authorities to encrypt mobile ID information and protect key material in a security module.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The organization also provides guidance on access.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While law enforcement and emergency services have legal access to a person’s physical credentials in Virginia, the association has suggested that mobile driver’s license apps allow similar access in case of justifiable need.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the association said that because such an option could be misused, the app must not allow anyone other than the mobile ID holder to access the mobile ID information.Virginia’s mobile ID app follows suit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Your information is not accessible without your consent. You control what information from your mID you’d like to share,” the DMV’s mobile ID FAQ page states. “When you enroll, your information is stored on your personal device. Only those with access to your personal device and the ability to unlock and access the app would have access to view it.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cowherd confirmed that user security is at the forefront of the project. She said the customer will control the information shared on the app, which presents the information needed for the interaction. The customer can also review and authorize the requested information before it is shared.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Virginia DMV provides the highest level of security in credential storage, data transmission and verification,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, she said mobile IDs are presented digitally through encrypted communication directly between a user’s device and a verifying business or organization. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The device never needs to be handed to anyone or leave the customer&#8217;s possession.,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cowherd said the agency hopes to fully release the app early next year, but this depends on final testing and proven use cases.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the growing number of electric vehicles is expected to cause the demand on Virginia’s electric grid to surge, Dominion Energy and Appalachian Power Company are actively preparing for the changes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, conservation groups are monitoring the impact on the environment and Virginians, ensuring that the transition is as sustainable as possible and of less concern than data centers that are prompting continued fossil fuel use as a dispatchable power source.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The transition to electric vehicles is intended to remove tailpipe greenhouse gasses that make up one third of the emissions in the state and nationwide, contributing to climate change-fueled increasing storm intensities and frequencies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia is also navigating the Virginia Clean Economy Act, a 2020 law that seeks to transition Dominion and Appalachian Power to zero-carbon generation sources by 2050 to reduce emissions from the power sector.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion Energy, the state’s largest utility with 2.6 million customers serving large swaths of Northern Virginia, the Richmond region and Hampton Roads, is pursuing a suite of zero-carbon generation sources like solar, offshore wind and nuclear in order to meet its projected demand on the grid, or “load growth,” which includes more electric vehicles. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the utility is also proposing a carbon-emitting natural gas plant, largely needed for data center growth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have to think about meeting load 24/7, so you&#8217;re going to see a mix of both renewable and dispatchable resources to meet that growth,” said Nathan Frost, general manager of new business and customer solutions at Dominion. “I feel, again, very confident that we can meet the load associated with EVs.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trip Pollard, a senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center, cautioned that some “concerns are definitely legitimate” when it comes to whether clean cars contribute to skyrocketing energy needs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But a lot of the rhetoric has been very overblown, especially by the fossil fuel industry and politicians who derive a lot of donations from the fossil fuel industry,” Pollard added. “There&#8217;s far, far greater impact from things like data centers, which are still provided taxpayer subsidies.”</span></p>
<p><b>How does the grid work? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though people don’t see them when they plug a toaster into a power outlet or flip on a power switch, utility companies are always managing the power grid, an interconnected network, to provide electricity to customers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Across the country, the power grid has come under strain to meet all the electricity demands to power data centers that support entertainment devices, kitchen appliances and even electric and low-emission vehicles. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The grid’s work begins with electricity being created by a generation source, such as a solar panel or natural gas plant. Then, power is sent through transmission lines that are carried by the tall steel towers seen along highways and through countrysides. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those transmission lines connect to substations, where higher voltage electricity is converted to lower power so it can be delivered across distribution lines, the wooden poles along roadways. Distribution lines then connect to transformers to send electricity to homes, businesses, electric vehicle chargers and more. The whole system is evolving to keep up with the ever-increasing demand for power. </span></p>

(Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have the grid transformation plan that&#8217;s been underway going back to 2019,” Frost said. “That is again another comprehensive approach to making sure that we&#8217;ve got an electric distribution grid that can meet the needs of tomorrow.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Theresa Hamilton Hall, spokeswoman for Appalachian Power, a utility company that provides services in Southwest Virginia, said the company is also working to address customers’ new needs, including “enabling EV charging at home, while they shop, or are on a road trip.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Appalachian Power typically extends a secondary service from the company’s primary system by setting an appropriately sized transformer and service conductors (wire) that will handle the maximum demand of the charging station(s),” Hall said.</span></p>
<p><b>Can the grid support the increase?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Appalachian Power and Dominion are confident the power grid will be able to support the increase in demand for electricity. However, there is still uncertainty about when that increase will begin, and exactly how much EVs will contribute to it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were 91,000 all-electric cars registered in Virginia as of June 30, but Dominion has projected an adoption of over 220,000 passenger electric vehicles by 2027, and the peak need from electric vehicles by 2038 is 1,600 megawatts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is what we do all day, every day,” Frost said. “Whether it&#8217;s connecting a home or business or an EV charger, we take all of it very seriously.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hall, with Appalachian Power, said the utility is anticipating modest growth related to electric vehicle adoption across the company’s three-state service territory, growth that is accounted for in Appalachian Power’s load forecasting models. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Using information gleaned from the amount of electric load carried on the company’s circuits and stations, and other internal data, this model allows the company to identify areas of future load growth on the system that may require improvements to the distribution system infrastructure,” Hall said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SELC hired consultants to do an analysis and concluded that the Clean Car Standards are only projected to increase the demand about 4% by 2040.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_40258" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/02/virginias-electric-vehicle-transition-depends-on-the-power-grid-how-is-it-faring/20240710_1840122/" rel="attachment wp-att-40258"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-40258" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20240710_1840122-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="2214" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20240710_1840122-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20240710_1840122-300x259.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20240710_1840122-1024x885.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20240710_1840122-768x664.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20240710_1840122-1536x1328.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20240710_1840122-2048x1771.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  A Rappahannock Electric Cooperative substation with distribution lines next to it. (Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the smaller municipal electric grids in Virginia, including the Harrisonburg Electric Commission, and Electric Cooperatives that serve rural areas, it’s the transmission and distribution lines that need thoughtful planning, some utilities say.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I look at my [utility] peers and, we&#8217;re all in this and scratching our heads, trying to say, how do we do this in a more efficient way to be able to address the growth that we&#8217;re seeing?” said Peter Muhoro, chief strategy, technology &amp; innovation officer at Rappahannock Electric Cooperative, serving the Central Piedmont region. One solution the company is exploring is pairing a battery with a charger so higher voltage power can be stored and distributed more easily on site, he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Old Dominion Electric Cooperative, which supplies the power to the cooperatives, relies on a planning tool developed by University of California at Davis to stay aware of EV adoption for forecasting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“ODEC and (the Virginia, Maryland and Delaware Association of Electric Cooperatives) have a collaborative working group with VDOT, Virginia Energy and Virginia Clean Cities, which meets quarterly so the state agencies are aware of what cooperatives are doing in preparation for EV adoption in their services territories,” said Kirby Jordan, a spokesperson for ODEC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brian O’Dell, general manager at Harrisonburg Electric Commission, added that when the chargers are built close to each other, strain on specific points in the grid  need attention.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don&#8217;t know that we&#8217;re heavily into forecasting, because that seems to be a little bit of a moving target, but it does require us to keep tabs on our distribution system, making sure things are balanced and not overloaded,” O’Dell said.</span></p>
<p><b>Impact on Virginians </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the electricity demand increases, questions around the cost for ratepayers are driving public concerns.</span></p>
<p>Garrett Gee, a senior attorney at SELC, said his group petitioned the Virginia State Corporation Commission to have the utilities do more comprehensive planning.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plans for electrification of vehicles were filed in May 2023, but updates are now due February 2025, after environmental groups asked for a better public picture of what the utilities are expecting in terms of medium- and long-term energy demand, and the plans the utilities have to mitigate some of that demand with part of the investments that will be required and paid for by ratepayers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It takes deliberate work, I think, from policymakers, as EV adoption increases to make sure that stays the case,” Gee said. “It doesn&#8217;t just happen, but it&#8217;s something that we can do, and we need to do.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the 2025 session beginning in January, representatives from the Electrification Coalition, a nonprofit organization advocating for electric vehicles, said they would like to see legislative support for utilities to be able to pre-plan for medium- and heavy-duty growth and rural EV deployment expanded across the commonwealth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As this becomes the norm, and people want the choice for how they propel their vehicle and fuel it every day, we don&#8217;t want people in the rural regions of the state to be left behind,” said Jordan Neerhoff, senior policy analyst with the Electrification Coalition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb107" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Del. Rip Sullivan, D-Fairfax, in the 2024 session would have provided funding to offset some of the non-utility costs for installing chargers in rural areas. It ultimately failed in the House.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That is going to be a problem in our rural areas,” said Cheri Conca, transportation and smart growth program manager for the Virginia Chapter of the Sierra Club.</span></p>
<p><b>Ratepayer opportunities</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Utility providers are offering ratepayers and electric vehicle owners incentives to install chargers at home. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of several <a href="https://www.dominionenergy.com/virginia/save-energy/electric-vehicles" target="_blank">programs</a> available to EV drivers, Dominion offers $40 a year to residents who participate in a demand response program to reduce charging at peak system load and encourage charging during off-peak hours.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We also have time of use rates, which are time varying rates that incentivize customers to charge off peak or overnight to the extent they want to,” Frost said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Appalachian Power’s Virginia residential customers similarly can </span><a href="https://apcova.clearesult.com/shop-rebates/electric-vehicles" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">apply</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for a $100 rebate towards the purchase of an Energy Star rated Level-2 EV charger, and also use a similar time of use schedule.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Customers who charge off-peak save money, and programs like this help us keep the grid working for everyone,” Hall said. “As demand grows and we make improvements to the electric grid, we are also using those opportunities to make the grid more reliable.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gee said SELC has pushed both Dominion and Appalachian Power to adopt electricity rates to encourage people to charge their cars at night, when there is more renewable energy available or when there is less overall demand for power. He said the idea aims to balance the energy use and ensure that the grid benefits from a more steady and efficient use of electricity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A lot of places now, like California, are seeing that it makes a lot of sense for fleets to charge in the middle of the day,” Gee said. “That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s really important to do this planning at the state level.”</span></p>

(Courtesy Port of Virginia)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As experts anticipated, members of the International Longshoremen’s Association went on strike Tuesday, hoping to settle on a new agreement with the United States Maritime Alliance, leaving cargo in limbo at East and Gulf Coast ports, including at the Port of Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Workers want better pay and restrictions on how automation can be used at ports, according to the association. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Representing members working at American ports from Maine to Texas, the association </span><a href="https://ilaunion.org/ila-update-monday-september-30-2024-at-11-am/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Monday that USMX continues to “block the path” towards an agreement by refusing the association’s demands for a “fair and decent contract.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“ILA longshore workers deserve to be compensated for the important work they do keeping American commerce moving and growing,” the association stated. The group is the largest union of maritime workers in North America. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some ILA members work at the Port of Virginia, which suspended operations on Monday in anticipation of the work stoppage. It’s uncertain how long the stoppage will last, or the full impact on delayed shipments of goods to stores and businesses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Analysts at Sea-Intelligence, a Copenhagen-based shipping advisory firm, </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/possible-us-seaport-strike-could-back-up-goods-months-shipping-experts-say-2024-08-14/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">told</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Reuters in August that the backlog from a one-day strike could take between four to six days to clear.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our hope is for a speedy resolution that allows The Port of Virginia to implement its resumption of operations plan to methodically and safely bring terminals back online,” representatives of the Port of Virginia said in a </span><a href="https://www.portofvirginia.com/work-stoppage-impact/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">statement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Until an agreement is reached, the Port of Virginia said operations at the following areas would be closed: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Norfolk International Terminals</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia International Gateway</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Newport News Marine Terminal</span></li>

<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Portsmouth Chassis Yard</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reefer Service Area</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Damage Annex</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The offices of the Virginia Port Authority, Virginia International Terminals and Hampton Roads Chassis Pool II are open according to their regular schedules.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Portsmouth Marine Terminal will remain open. Richmond Marine Terminal and Virginia Inland Port will also stay open, but customers should expect cargo operations to be impacted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to last May’s State of the Port, a total of 3.7 million units of cargo were processed in 2022, a 5% increase since 2021. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the flip side, no school was denied accreditation, leading the governor’s administration and some from the education industry to say that the existing accreditation system is a “failure” to provide the public with “accurate and actionable” insights into how well students perform academically.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Approximately 14% of the 1,824 schools are accredited with conditions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As soon as I came into office, I committed to reverse the systematic lowering of standards and lack of transparency in Virginia’s education system,” said Youngkin in a statement on Monday. “As students struggle to recover from pandemic learning loss, it’s more important than ever to prioritize high expectations, transparency and accountability. We must be honest with ourselves that too many students and schools are not on track for success.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few weeks ago, the Virginia Board of Education </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/08/29/virginia-board-of-education-approves-changes-to-accreditation-accountability-systems/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">approved</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a new School Performance and Support Framework for the current school year, which aims to improve the direction of state resources. Under the new system, the </span><a href="https://www.doe.virginia.gov/data-policy-funding/virginia-board-of-education/board-comprehensive-plan" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">board</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will be able to set and assist students in meeting high academic expectations while supporting learning loss recovery by ensuring the school performance framework holds schools accountable for actual performance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of the board’s action, the state’s accreditation system will be split into two: an accreditation system to assess whether schools meet all requirements laid out in state laws and regulations; and an accountability system to provide “timely and transparent information on student and school performance.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state is already collecting data. The plan&#8217;s full implementation will begin at the start of the next school year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In August, Youngkin praised school divisions for </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/08/20/virginia-students-make-some-gains-on-annual-test-scores-schools-see-less-absenteeism/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">improving</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> their annual Standards of Learning tests, which measure student learning and achievement in mathematics, reading, science, writing, and history and social science. However, he acknowledged that schools have more work to do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data showed that the number of schools that met or exceeded the English standard increased by 77. However, the total number of schools that met the mathematics standard dropped by 25.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past year, the governor and lawmakers have agreed to invest more state funding in instruction and current and future teachers. The commonwealth also measures achievement through attendance, which improved.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the 2022-23 school year, only 647 schools met the state’s attendance indicator. The total increased to 1,509 schools in 2023-24.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The agreement came several months after the Virginia Supreme Court </span><a href="https://adfmedialegalfiles.blob.core.windows.net/files/VlamingDecision.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reinstated</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Vlaming’s case, which the King William Circuit Court dismissed. The lower court did not believe Vlaming had any valid reasons for the law to accept his suit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the Supreme Court determined in December that the school board violated Vlaming’s rights.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vlaming’s lawsuit alleged “constitutional, statutory, and breach-of-contract claims” against the school district, Justice D. Arthur Kelsey wrote in an opinion explaining the high court’s ruling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Examining only the allegations in Vlaming’s complaint, the circuit court dismissed Vlaming’s claims, finding that they failed to state legally viable causes of action. Disagreeing with the circuit court, we reverse and remand for further proceedings.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative Christian legal organization focused on protecting religious freedoms, represented Vlaming in the case and announced the settlement Monday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Peter wasn’t fired for something he said; he was fired for something he couldn’t say. The school board violated his First Amendment rights under the Virginia Constitution and commonwealth law,” said Tyson Langhofer, senior counsel for ADF and director of the ADF Center for Academic Freedom, in a statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Langhofer said Vlaming felt using male pronouns to address the student were “untrue,” even though the student had recently undergone a gender transition and legal name change. ADF said that for Vlaming to use the preferred pronouns went against his religious beliefs and violated his right to free speech.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to ADF, the board cleared Vlaming’s firing record and changed its policies to conform to the new policies overhauled by Gov. Glenn Youngkin. West Point School Board did not immediately respond to The Mercury’s request for comment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In September 2022, Youngkin’s administration </span><a href="https://www.doe.virginia.gov/parents-students/for-parents/model-policies-on-ensuring-privacy-dignity-and-respect-for-all-students-and-parents-in-virginia-s-public-schools" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">overhauled</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the state’s </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/09/12/despite-law-few-virginia-school-districts-adopt-state-model-transgender-policies/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2021</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> model school policies for transgender and nonbinary students designed under former Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most notably, the list of changes included </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/09/16/youngkin-administration-overhauls-virginia-transgender-student-policies/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">requiring parental approval</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for any changes to students’ “names, nicknames, and/or pronouns,” a directive to schools to keep parents “informed about their children’s well-being,” and requiring that student participation in activities and athletics be based on sex and the use of bathrooms correspond to a students’ sex, except to the extent that federal law requires.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ADF and Vlaming said they are pleased that the case has been settled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I was wrongfully fired from my teaching job because my religious beliefs put me on a collision course with school administrators who mandated that teachers ascribe to only one perspective on gender identity — their preferred view,” Vlaming said in a statement.</span></p>

(Photos courtesy of respective campaigns)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State Sen. Suhas Subramanyam, D-Loudoun, and Republican nominee Mike Clancy are vying to represent Virginia’s 10th Congressional District and succeed Democratic U.S. Rep. Jennifer Wexton, who is </span><a href="https://wexton.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=854" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">retiring</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after being diagnosed with a severe neurological disorder.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subramanyam opposes Project 2025 — a proposed conservative plan to change how the federal government operates — and said it is a key issue in his race. He is also prioritizing the cost of living and the economy in his campaign. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clancy said he does not support the project, but sees a path forward for himself focusing on areas that matter to voters, namely the economy, parental rights and public safety.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">District 10</h4>

	</strong></p>
<figure id="attachment_39958" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:1480px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/va10-map_supreme-court-of-virginia/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-39958 size-full" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/VA10-map_Supreme-Court-of-Virginia.png" alt="" width="1480" height="996" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/VA10-map_Supreme-Court-of-Virginia.png 1480w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/VA10-map_Supreme-Court-of-Virginia-300x202.png 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/VA10-map_Supreme-Court-of-Virginia-1024x689.png 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/VA10-map_Supreme-Court-of-Virginia-768x517.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1480px) 100vw, 1480px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Virginia Congressional District 10 (courtesy Supreme Court of Virginia)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past three congressional elections, Democrats have maintained control of the district even after it was redrawn to include the counties of Loudoun, Fauquier and Rappahannock, the cities of Manassas, Manassas Park, and parts of Prince William and Fairfax Counties.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wexton, who has represented the district in the U.S. Congress since 2019, won her first two races by at least 12 percentage points in 2018 and 2020. However, in her final election in 2022, she narrowly won the redrawn district by six percentage points to Republican nominee Hung Cao, who is now running for U.S. Senate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After serving three straight terms in Congress and announcing her decision not to seek reelection, Wexton endorsed Subramanyam over several Democratic primary candidates hoping to succeed her. If elected, Subramanyam said he wants to carry on Wexton’s work in advocating for federal funding — potentially on the appropriations committee — for infrastructure projects and keeping the federal government open to avoid shutdowns that impact federal government employees. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Jennifer Wexton was a leader in trying to push legislation to prevent shutdowns and being outspoken and her support of federal workers and contractors, so I want to continue that work because it&#8217;s important to our community and it&#8217;s what makes us so special,” said Subramanyam. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He added that the federal government should spend more resources in District 10 to keep it functioning because of the many civil servants who live and work there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If elected, Clancy would be the first Republican to hold the seat since Wexton unseated former congresswoman Barbara Comstock, who succeeded longtime congressman Frank Wolf. Wolf has endorsed Clancy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He was solution-focused, and that&#8217;s what I want to be,” Clancy said about Wolf. “(I) want to make sure that we&#8217;re representing the people of our constituency in the 10th District, doing what&#8217;s good for the people.” Like Wolf, Clancy added that he is “very focused on human rights issues.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Project 2025 and federal workers</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than 34,000 federal government workers and contractors reside in the 10th District, according to a Sept. 23 </span><a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R47716" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the Congressional Research Service. There is a growing concern among residents and government employees about the impact of the recommendations outlined in Project 2025 if implemented by a Republican presidential administration, particularly the proposal to replace federal workers with political appointees. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Members of the American Federation, the largest federal workers union in the nation, wrote that such a proposal would negatively impact employees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s a takeover of our federal government in a manner that is not loyal to the Constitution and the law, has no interest in listening to the people, and will force employees to take orders, legal or not, or be terminated,” AFGE President Everett Kelley said in a </span><a href="https://www.afge.org/article/project-2025-seeks-to-dismantle-agencies-terminate-up-to-1-million-federal-workers/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">July statement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clancy, a tech executive and lawyer, told The Mercury rejects the project’s proposal targeting federal government workers, refuting claims from his opponent and some media that he has connections to the Heritage Foundation. This conservative think tank published Project 2025. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I want to create jobs for the 10th District, not to decrease them,” Clancy said. “And here in Northern Virginia, in our district, a key component of the job market here is not only federal government employees, but government contractors, and that&#8217;s an important constituency that we&#8217;re trying to promote.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clancy admitted to donating to the organization in the past but said he is not a member of the Heritage Foundation, despite a Newsmax </span><a href="https://www.newsmax.com/insiders/mikeclancy/bio-834/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">webpage</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> stating he is a member. He calls Subramanyam’s attempt to tie him to Project 2025 and the Heritage Foundation a way to “distract” voters from the “failed” decisions made by the Biden-Harris administration on the economy, border security, fentanyl and “weak” foreign policy that led to two wars.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Other than a small donation to the Heritage Foundation several years ago, I have never had any ‘connection’ to the Heritage Foundation,” Clancy said in a statement. “I have never worked with Heritage or attended any of their events. I have no connection to Project 2025. I never heard of Project 2025 until the Democrats started fear-mongering over it. I do not support and never have supported Project 2025.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subramanyam, a former tech policy advisor to former President Barack Obama, said Project 2025 would be “a complete disaster” for the 10th District if implemented by impacting businesses that rely on customers who are likely federal government workers and contractors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It will affect everyone, and in a time where people are worried about the economy and rising costs and being able to afford things like housing and childcare and prescription drugs, we don&#8217;t need a self-imposed recession,” Subramanyam said.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Parental rights</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In District 10, parents have </span><a href="https://dcist.com/story/22/02/03/youngkin-lawsuit-school-board-mask-mandate/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">challenged</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> local school divisions and boards and cited concerns about how schools operate, including what is taught and what students learn. Like elsewhere in the state, schools in the 10th District are facing </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2023/10/05/loudoun-sexual-assault-stone-bridge/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lawsuits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and confrontations from parents over controversial social issues, such as the types of books that are allowed in libraries and the treatment of transgender students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clancy said he supports parental rights, or a parents legal authority to make decisions about their child’s care and education. He said he also understands Project 2025 may overlap with his views, especially in the area of </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/04/what-could-project-2025-mean-for-education-in-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">education</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by supporting school choice, or the idea that parents should be able to use tax dollars designated for their child’s public education and send them to a private or charter school of their choice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Things shouldn&#8217;t just be for the rich,” Clancy said. “We should be able to empower parents at the middle-income and low-income levels to give them opportunities for school choice.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also claimed that his opponent voted against the interest of parents and children during his time in the Virginia House of Delegates, pointing to </span><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=221&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=sb656" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> requiring schools to notify parents of sexually explicit instructional materials in school libraries, which Subramanyam opposed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of those books being considered was “Beloved” by author Toni Morrison, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in Literature for the book. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I support current Virginia law; the fundamental right for parents to be involved in their child&#8217;s education,” Subramanyam said in response. “I’m a father to two daughters, and being an involved parent is important to me.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Cost of living</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both candidates said they are committed to addressing inflation for Virginians in District 10. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to data provided by the Bureau of Labor Statistics to the Senate Joint Economic Committee in </span><a href="https://www.jec.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/republicans/virginia-inflation-report/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">August</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the average Virginia household has spent $30,688 more annually due to inflation since January 2021. </span><a href="https://www.fauquiernow.com/news/government_politics/10th-district-candidates-clancy-subramanyam-square-off-at-loudoun-county-debate/article_68f031a8-7773-11ef-bafe-2f320e87e58b.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clancy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and local </span><a href="https://loudoungop.com/subramanyam-denies-tax-relief-to-all-virginians/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have said Subramanyam’s votes against tax cuts have cost Virginians.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subramanyam denied that and said Democrats have done “a lot” to ensure Virginia has a “fair tax system.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I have not increased income taxes since getting into the General Assembly, and I don&#8217;t plan on increasing personal income taxes in Congress,” he said, adding that he would like to find ways to cut taxes for people in the middle class, and continue his work by addressing rising costs and boosting the economy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clancy stated Subramanyam’s votes, including one opposing a </span><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=231&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb472" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tax relief bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2023, show the state senator does not represent the entire constituency of the 10th District. The Republican nominee said he hopes to support district voters by revitalizing the economy and minimizing President Joe Biden’s spending, curtailing inflation through “American innovation, American energy production,” and saving “small businesses from burdensome, stifling regulatory burdens.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a follow-up to the Mercury’s interview, Subramanyam’s campaign said the then-delegate ultimately </span><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?232+sum+HB6001" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">voted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in favor of the tax relief legislation within the budget, which included over $1 billion in tax reductions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The relief package provided an immediate tax rebate of $200 for individual filers, $400 for families and joint filers, and increased the standard deduction to $8,500 for individual filers and $17,000 for families and joint filers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;My opponent is wrong — in the General Assembly, I supported tax relief for families and worked in a bipartisan way to do so, including a version of the very proposal my opponent cites,&#8221; Subramanyam said.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Immigration</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Immigrants often come to the U.S. to leave adverse conditions in their home countries and seek safer living conditions and opportunities for employment. While migrants have become a staple of the country’s workforce, immigration has created backlash among some Americans concerned about migrants entering the country illegally and being granted rights and benefits without being a U.S. citizen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clancy and Subramanyam agree that something must be done to address challenges stemming from immigration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If elected, Clancy said he would advocate for “strong border security” legislation that would address sanctuary cities and legally mandate local governments to work with federal agencies and law enforcement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subramanyam said Republicans had a chance to address immigration and have failed to do anything.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this year, the state senator told the Mercury that the U.S. immigration system is “broken” and he supports the country taking a comprehensive approach to the problem. He said one of the steps begins with securing the border and ensuring that people doing “the right things the right way and contributing to our economy“ have a path to citizenship.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said the country must also fix its “broken” asylum system.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Thursday, the Founding Freedoms Law Center, the legal division of the Family Foundation, announced it filed a lawsuit in Henrico County Circuit Court, claiming the state violated their clients&#8217; right to free speech and religious freedom. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The suit names the Virginia Board of Counseling, Virginia Department of Health Professions, and its director, Arne Owens, as the defendants.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The American Medical Association has denounced conversion therapy, </span><a href="https://www.ama-assn.org/delivering-care/population-care/advocating-lgbtq-community" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">saying</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the practice is based on the idea that “homosexuality and gender nonconformity are mental disorders and that sexual orientation and gender identity can be changed,” assumptions that are not based on medical or scientific evidence.</span></p>
<p>Narissa Rahaman, executive director for Equality Virginia, said the Family Foundation&#8217;s latest action is another attempt to discriminate against LGBTQ+ people.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once again, anti-LGBTQ+ forces are just trying to find new ways to advance their failing cause,&#8221; Rahaman said in a statement. &#8220;To the LGBTQ+ youth in Virginia and around the country who have been subjected to this dangerous practice: We will not stop fighting for you. You are worthy of love, support and access to affirming therapy.”</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020, Virginia </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title54.1/chapter24/section54.1-2409.5/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">banned</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> conversion therapy, which prohibits state-licensed healthcare providers and counselors from practicing it on anyone under 18. Sen. <a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+sum+SB245" target="_blank">Scott Surovell</a>, D-Fairfax, and Del. <a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+sum+HB386" target="_blank">Patrick Hope</a>, D-Arlington, carried the legislation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the suit, John and Janet Raymond, the plaintiffs and owners of the Associate Counseling Center in Front Royal, have lost “significant” business income due to the ban.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Raymonds wish to counsel children who are seeking help to align their sexual feelings, actions, and identity toward a biblical sexual ethic, in accordance with God‘s design for human beings, including those struggling with homosexuality and so-called &#8216;gender identity,’” the suit states.</span></p>

(Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia lawsuit was announced soon after Kentucky Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear banned the practice through an executive order on Sept. 18. Republicans outraged by the decision said it violated parental rights and hindered their legal authority to make decisions about their child’s care.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founding Freedoms Law Center attorney Josh Hetzler said their case is independent of Kentucky’s recent action, but makes the Virginia lawsuit “all the more timely” and could be a learning opportunity for the neighbor state. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We think our case is going to help (and) hopefully when we win, Kentucky will see the writing on the wall and will do the right thing as well,” Hetzler said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a </span><a href="https://www.apa.org/pi/lgbt/resources/therapeutic-response.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the American Psychological Association, behavior therapists used treatment like inducing nausea, providing electric shocks, or having the individual snap an elastic band around their wrist when they became aroused by same-sex erotic images or thoughts. Virginia’s ban on the practice in 2020 came after</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2020/02/18/after-years-of-efforts-virginia-passes-law-to-ban-conversion-therapy/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> several years of failed legislative efforts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to make it illegal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In recent years, minors’ sexuality and gender expression have been at the forefront of political discussions concerning education and athletics in Virginia schools. Both Democrats and Republicans have  fought over the protections and rights of minors as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most notable actions came when Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration overhauled the state&#8217;s </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/09/12/despite-law-few-virginia-school-districts-adopt-state-model-transgender-policies/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2021</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> model school policies for transgender and nonbinary students designed under former Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam to protect the privacy and rights of such minors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since then, groups including the American Civil Liberties Union of Virginia have filed lawsuits challenging the Virginia Department of Education on the policies that some schools have adopted. In February, the ACLU and Freshfields filed three related lawsuits. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One case, involving at least one teacher refusing to address a transgender student by her preferred first name, was </span><a href="https://www.wtkr.com/news/in-the-community/historic-triangle/york-county-court-dismisses-lawsuit-challenging-virginias-transgender-student-policies" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">dismissed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in July. The other two cases are still being litigated in the Eastern District of Virginia and the Hanover County Circuit Court.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, the Mercury </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/07/12/changes-to-sex-listed-on-virginia-birth-certificates-more-than-doubled-after-2020-law/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the number of Virginians changing the sex listed on their birth certificate more than doubled between 2020 and 2022, after lawmakers passed </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+sum+SB657" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> streamlining the process for individuals wanting to do so.</span></p>

(Tim Walck/Dulles Corridor Metrorail Project)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than 80% of people surveyed in the National Capital Region said they “support more and better transit services, even if it requires higher investment by the region,” according to a survey conducted by two advisory groups associated with a regional task group’s effort to create a new funding plan for the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (Metro).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under a proposed funding plan known as Scenario 1, the advisory groups said the region would have to generate an additional $645 million to cover all the transit agencies in fiscal year 2028, with 70% of the funds for capital investments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Scenario 2, the region would need to raise $835 million. The figures are based on assumptions for future inflation, project costs, regional ridership growth and sustained commitments from funding jurisdictions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, how Virginia would meet those possibilities is uncertain. Earlier this year, the state legislature allocated $144.7 million in funding to pay for Metro’s $750 million shortfall with the General Fund, which can vary based on the amounts of tax collections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The commonwealth commonly supports areas of transportation from its non-General Fund.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whether we can continue that General Fund support is unknown because it’s a little unprecedented,” Del. Mark Sickles, D-Arlington, told The Mercury on Monday. Sickles, a member of the task force, was involved in Virginia’s final budget discussions this year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers and leaders from around the region gathered at Metro’s office in New Carrollton Monday to hear the </span><a href="https://dmvmoves.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/DMVMoves-Task-Force-Meeting-2_Presentation.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recommendations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from two advisory groups representing the area’s community organizations and governments to meet the goal of developing “stronger coordination” among the 14 different transit systems, the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments (MWCOG) said in a statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In May, Metro and MWCOG launched a joint initiative known as DMVMoves, dedicated to creating a “unified vision” for transit service in the metro region that encompasses part of Virginia after Metro’s financial challenges to maintain services surfaced during the most recent budget season.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Metro is supported by ridership and fare revenue, which has steadily increased since the pandemic when travelers stayed home. The agency also receives contributions from localities, Virginia, Maryland and Washington, D.C.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, who serves on the task force, said the goal is to develop a regional funding solution so Metro has a sustainable, long-term revenue source. He said this would help minimize the budget negotiations in the commonwealth, which occur every few years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It just seems like every six or seven years Metro has another funding crisis because our region has punted on a permanent solution down the field another 70 yards instead of dealing with it head-on,” Surovell said after the meeting.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_40146" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:1024px;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-40146" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_2701-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_2701-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_2701-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_2701-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_2701-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_2701-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Virginia Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, at a regional task force meeting in Maryland on Sept. 23. (Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under Scenario 1, the least expensive option, the plan focuses on all providers maintaining the existing service and limiting capital investments to keep the transit system efficient and reliable with repairs and maintenance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scenario 2 would be in addition to Scenario 1, plus improve services by supporting Maryland’s MARC Train and Maryland Transit Administration, or MTA, commuter bus, as well as fund increases for local bus services, optimize Metrorail service by increasing service frequency, using 8-car trains, and expanding weekend operating hours. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The scenario also includes implementing the first phase of the </span><a href="https://www.wmata.com/initiatives/plans/Better-Bus/What-We-Heard.cfm" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Better Bus</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Visionary Network, which is Metro’s commitment to improving service and connections using the existing resources.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The task force will be briefed on the two remaining scenarios, which focus on expansion, maximizing service, and modernizing assets, at the Nov. 14 meeting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some potential ideas for localities to consider when creating new public revenues include taxes, collecting revenue from assessments, real estate transfers, and vehicle registration fees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to transit leaders, determining how revenue would be collected from Virginia, Maryland, and the District of Columbia is still challenging since each jurisdiction has its own funding mechanism and operates its budgets differently.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Representatives from the community and government advisory groups also suggested the task force consider several suggestions to improve the transit service.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of these included integrating and aligning fare policies to provide consistent customer experience, improving wayfinding, customer information and amenities at transit stops, and exploring shared use of resources and assets and grouped procurements.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The task force is expected to vote on the group’s recommendations Nov. 14. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An area not included in the list of recommendations was the idea of consolidating Northern Virginia’s bus services with Metro, something some Virginia leaders vocally supported.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Surovell said he did not have to travel on multiple transit systems when he traveled out of the country and visited different cities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You buy one ticket, and you go from one train, one bus, and whatever, and it’s simple,” he said, adding, “It strikes me that one solution to having a better functioning system is one system.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Phyllis Randall, chair of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors and Northern Virginia Transportation Authority, added, “I think when people are trying to move throughout this area, if you want to go from Loudoun to Alexandria, you don’t want to have to go on three different bus systems to do that.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Loudoun County operates a bus service for commuters around the county and to other parts of Northern Virginia and Washington. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simultaneously, as the task force is working to develop a model, state </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+ful+SJ28ER+pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">leaders</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Virginia are meeting to study the growing transit needs in Northern Virginia</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">studying sustainable, dedicated operations and capital funding for Metro.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State leaders will hear several presentations on short–and long-term needs for transit agencies, trends and funding ideas.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Searching for a new vehicle can be challenging, but not as complex as it is to develop the infrastructure needed to power electric and low-emission vehicles at rest stops, gas stations, homes, workplaces and public areas in Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To build its EV infrastructure, the state leaned on the federal government’s nationwide plan to install charging stations across major corridors around the country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, those areas are found along Interstates 81, 295 and 495, to name a few. The commonwealth has received $61 million, with a future allocation of $45 million, from the federal government’s Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, also known as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, to build out charging stations along interstate highways, with one planned at least every 50 miles, and within one mile of federally identified designated alternative fuel corridors (AFCs). So far, the process has progressed slowly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whenever you put a large amount of new money into a system, meaning deploying EV infrastructure where none previously existed, the startup is going to be very difficult. New processes and procedures need to be established to ensure taxpayer dollars are used appropriately and we minimize the potential for waste, fraud, and abuse,” said Del. David Reid, D-Loudoun, who is a strong supporter of electric vehicles and owns one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, homeowners, businesses, and residential and commercial developers could tap into another infrastructure layer soon — or even now, if they have access to a 240-volt outlet. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state could incentivize Virginians to install chargers at shopping malls, homes and corporate offices through future legislation. Previous efforts have failed due to the lack of support or funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reid said the state needs to build out the charging infrastructure along major highways, but there’s also the potential for existing wiring to support a Level 2 EV charger, which is typical for home, the workplace and public areas such as gas stations.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Divesting from gas stations for charging stations</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s gas stations and convenience stores are aware of the transition to electric vehicles, but are generally prioritizing their available fossil fuel at the moment. Some, though, are seeing a new business opportunity with government funding to provide EV charging infrastructure. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of June 30, the Department of Motor Vehicles said there were about 6.9 million vehicles registered in Virginia, with about 311,000 being electric, plug-in hybrid or traditional hybrid. That means at least 6.6 million cars need a gas station to fuel up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mike O’Connor, president and CEO of the Virginia Petroleum and Convenience Marketers Association, acknowledged the transition to more electric vehicles is “going to happen regardless of what pressures are brought to bear because there are people that are interested in these vehicles.” O’Connor’s group represents owners or suppliers for the 3,385 gas stations and convenience stores across Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But given some challenges with adopting electric vehicles, including their difficulty performing in cold weather, O’Connor said for his group, the percentage of new cars sales being electric vehicles likely won’t increase beyond the current 7% rate as fast as previously thought. So they’re not focusing on EV drivers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If I&#8217;m one of these businesses, I&#8217;m doing a long term projection, and you say it&#8217;s going to increase by 100% in 10 years — which I think is optimistic given what&#8217;s going on — you&#8217;re going to go from 7% to 14%,” O’Connor said. “You&#8217;re still going to have 14% EVs and 86% internal combustion engines. If I’m making my efforts in planning, I&#8217;m focused on the 86% in those locations where I&#8217;m operating presently.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That hold-out philosophy is present in the Shenandoah Valley, where Holtzman Oil is one of the largest suppliers of gas and is keeping with its model based on conversation with retailers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “Our gut feeling is that fossil fuel has a long and bright future ahead of us,” said Todd Holtzman, general manager of the company&#8217;s propane division and a Republican member of the town of Mount Jackson’s council. “[Chargers] are very, very expensive and I think it&#8217;s a possibility when the public wants them. Where you see ‘em, I think they’re heavily subsidized and they’re not heavily used.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Individual gas station owners decide if and when to install EV chargers, O’Connor said, similar to the choice between selling “Coke versus Pepsi.” A separate group of gas stations and convenience stores, ranging from national chains to mom and pop stores that are a part of the Charge Ahead Partnership, ranging from national chains to mom and pop stores, take a fuel-agnostic stance, said Ryan McKinnon, a spokesman for the group. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If customers want charging, they want to provide it,” McKinnon stated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But with Level 3 fast chargers costing about $100,000 to install — the type which take about 15 to 20 minutes to charge a battery up to 85% for up to a 300 mile duration, typically — McKinnon said gas stations owners want certainty their investment will provide a return and not be overlooked by a charger built down the street. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That certainty, McKinnon said, can come from giving private companies a right of first refusal to prevent utilities from building, owning and profiting chargers paid for through ratepayer funds within a 12-mile radius of an existing publicly used one, which is what a 2024 </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb118" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Del. Rip Sullivan, D-Fairfax, sought to achieve. Dominion Energy, which McKinnon said has been cooperative with building charging infrastructure, argued against the bill, saying it would have hampered their ability to provide more charging stations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is a pretty big business opportunity,” McKinnon said, adding gas stations can be well lit, attended by people and are close to highways. “We’re uniquely positioned.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The government’s role</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While it can be considered as a subsidy, the government is providing incentives to overcome the funding concerns with building EV chargers, particularly at gas stations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2016, a settlement with Volkswagen for cheating emission tests led to $14 million for charger development, primarily at gas stations in Northern Virginia and the Hampton Roads area. More recently, the Virginia Department of Transportation began doling out National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure funds from the federal government.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Erin Belt, decarbonization program manager with the Virginia Department of Transportation, said the applicants include traditional gas stations and travel centers. The list of applicants also include third party operators running the stations, and those from the tourism industry operating dining establishments, grocery stores and shopping centers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;ve seen pretty good, and I would say better than expected, response from applicants across the state,” said Chris Berg, director of sustainability at VDOT. “I think we had some concern around ‘are there some areas of the state that have lower EV penetration?’ where we may see less interest. But in our first round we saw multiple applications at all of our target areas.”</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_38259" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:1148px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/04/02/vdot-announces-sites-for-electric-vehicle-charging-stations/nevi-sites/" rel="attachment wp-att-38259"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-38259" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/NEVI-sites.png" alt="" width="1148" height="649" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/NEVI-sites.png 1148w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/NEVI-sites-300x170.png 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/NEVI-sites-1024x579.png 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/NEVI-sites-768x434.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1148px) 100vw, 1148px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  A map of the sites chosen to receive federal funding for electric vehicle charging stations.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sullivan told the Mercury in a phone interview he’s used a charging station much like what the NEVI program is working on. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;m in Western New York state right now. I drove up here in my EV,” Sullivan said “My wife and I stopped at a Sheetz in Bedford, Pennsylvania; took 20 minutes to charge our car while we were inside, using the restroom and buying some food for the road. And then we were on our way, not unlike an internal combustion engine vehicle stopping for a gas fill up.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">EV traveling in Virginia</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Industry leaders say charging stations along Virginia’s interstates are moving along, but have some challenges amid concerns over car batteries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2022, VDOT said after it received funding for the </span><a href="https://publicinput.com/Customer/File/Full/b483a081-9d89-4e33-874b-19ae8529c991" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NEVI</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> program, it would be working through 2026 to expand the network to over 1,000 charging stations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Berg said it&#8217;s the largest investment in the commonwealth’s history. However, VDOT is uncertain when deployment could be completed, due to factors such as whether the program will be reauthorized and what the demand will be in a couple of years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Supply chain delays could also impact when award recipients complete the installation of charging stations, as could applicants’ need to ensure they understand the federal requirements and obligations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The program does not cover infrastructure installation in areas beyond Virginia&#8217;s interstates, like the commonwealth’s rural regions. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_40113" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/img_4173/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-40113" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_4173-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1707" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_4173-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_4173-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_4173-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_4173-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_4173-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_4173-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  A demonstration of a charger for an electric vehicle that is part of a fleet. (Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, some communities are applying for the </span><a href="https://www.transportation.gov/rural/grant-toolkit/charging-and-fueling-infrastructure-grant-program" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Charging and Fuel Infrastructure Discretionary Grant Program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> created under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to address those areas. The application process, which closed last month, offers a $2.5 million cut for groups such as local governments and planning organizations in urban and rural communities. The funding will help to deploy EV charging and other alternative vehicle-fueling infrastructure projects in publicly accessible locations.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The idea behind the CFI funding is to essentially fill in gaps left by the NEVI program,” said Anne Blair, vice president of policy for the Electrification Coalition, a nonprofit organization advocating for electric vehicles. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While NEVI dictates specific funding every 50 miles, a mile off the interstate, this is designed to really go in areas outside of that, [such as] rural communities (and neighborhoods with)multi-family housing, for instance, that also need assistance in terms of deployment of funding.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s stated </span><a href="https://www.mwcog.org/file.aspx?&amp;A=8kzH4dtaFasiXH88W0qktEqlAIWJZ5eDj4%2Bc8Rd2uUI%3D" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">goal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the charging network is to create a system that facilitates “convenient, reliable, and equitable access to fast charging stations throughout the commonwealth, while spurring growth in this promising industry.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sullivan has introduced a bill three years and counting to make sure “all Virginians” can have access to charging, including rural areas that won’t directly benefit from the NEVI program. Sullivan’s bill attempted to offset some infrastructure costs in less populated, lower income areas, which Republican lawmakers have said is lacking while also largely opposing the clean cars policy seeking to increase the state’s adoption of electric vehicles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those rural areas are where state parks typically are, too, said Sullivan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want all of our Virginia citizens to be able to charge electric vehicles. We want people coming into the states, into our beautiful tourist attractions all over the state. We want those people who own electric vehicles to feel confident that they can charge there as well.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reid suggested that state involvement could help alleviate any inequities for people who live in places that don’t have garages or dedicated spaces for charging such as apartments and condominiums. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Operating and improving EV charging in Virginia</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some consumers considering the idea of transitioning to electric are looking to businesses, legislators and local and state governments to make finding charging stations easier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In some parts of Virginia, electric and low emission vehicle owners have already taken steps to install chargers at their homes. In some cases, a homeowner is required to have an electrical permit to install a charger. Experts say most EV charging is done at home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In </span><a href="https://www.pwcva.gov/department/building-development-division/residential-EV-charging-stations" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prince William</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an electrical permit is required when a circuit or feeder is added or extended to supply the vehicle charging system or if the system is hard wired. A permit is not required if the charging system is cord-and-plug connected to an existing circuit that meets the requirements of the manufacturer’s installation instructions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">EV and hybrid owners also use chargers at shopping malls and at workplaces as the more effective charging stations become available.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_40114" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/23/in-va-electric-vehicle-infrastructure-development-is-underway-incentives-could-spur-growth/img_4214/" rel="attachment wp-att-40114"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-40114" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_4214-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1707" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_4214-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_4214-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_4214-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_4214-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_4214-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_4214-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  The screen of an charger for a municipal electric vehicle. (Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers attempted to increase the number of charging stations and home chargers during the previous three sessions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2021, the Virginia legislature passed the first EV Rebate Program providing tax incentives for consumers to purchase a new or used electric vehicle. However, the program was never funded by the legislature.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reid said the state’s EV Rebate Program lost support because some interpreted it as a means to support the wealthy purchasing expensive EVs; others balked because of the cost to support the program. He said the commonwealth has a “finite amount of money,” and the legislature has to make some “very difficult decisions” about priorities, some of which have been neglected for decades, such as increasing teacher pay, disability waivers and law enforcement pay.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don&#8217;t fault anyone for that, but it was one of those unfortunate things that we were able to pass the legislation, but we had different priorities when we got to the budget,” Reid said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2023, </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+SB1312" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to give localities the option to require developers to include charging infrastructure in their proposals failed, which he said was supported by localities in Northern Virginia. A similar bill in </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb405" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2024 </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">would have convened a workgroup to evaluate the technical requirements for building EV charging infrastructure. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Jennifer Boysko, D-Fairfax, said she supports localities having the flexibility “in certain areas” to require developers to include charging infrastructure in their proposals, especially multi-family dwelling unit construction proposals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have to keep up with the times and with the technology and giving localities another tool in the toolbox to make some decisions for themselves, knowing their communities better than anybody else, I think it’s a reasonable thing,” Boysko said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blair from the coalition acknowledged that it’s been “a fairly controversial issue for the building community, because it&#8217;s another thing on their list to include in their standards.” But it&#8217;s “vastly less expensive to do it when you&#8217;re building a new apartment complex than to retrofit a property after it&#8217;s already been built,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without Boysko’s bill passing, the city of Alexandria has been using “Standard Conditions” to encourage developers to agree to include charging infrastructure as they submit building proposals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Virtually all development projects incorporate some degree of EV infrastructure into their project,” said Amy Posner, EV planner for the city of Alexandria. “We typically see at least 2% of the parking spaces on a project will have Level 2 EV chargers. The latest update to the Standard Conditions raised that to 5% of parking spaces to better align with EV adoption rates in Alexandria.”</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_40117" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/23/in-va-electric-vehicle-infrastructure-development-is-underway-incentives-could-spur-growth/img_4241/" rel="attachment wp-att-40117"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-40117" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_4241-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1707" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_4241-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_4241-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_4241-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_4241-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_4241-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_4241-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  An electric vehicle charger at a Richmond residence. (Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The city also wants to provide the chargers in areas like city parks and libraries, but costs are a challenge. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To get around that, the city is offering up their locations to developers who would own, operate and profit from charging stations, but “ideally” enter a revenue sharing agreement with the city. Grants that Alexandria receives could also go toward building chargers. It’s similar to a program Virginia Beach is doing, Posner said, “to really accelerate the public charging that we know we need to make it easier for folks to make the switch.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stuart Gardner, executive director of </span><a href="https://generation180.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Generation 180</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which provides consumer education on switching to electric, said a way the organization is helping to spur interest is working with businesses in developing charging stations, and encouraging localities to apply for federal grants. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last January, Henrico County became the recipient of a </span><a href="https://henrico.gov/news/2024/01/henrico-earns-1-4-million-grant-to-create-ev-charging-station-network/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$1.4 million discretionary grant</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the </span><a href="https://www.transportation.gov/rural/grant-toolkit/charging-and-fueling-infrastructure-grant-program" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Charging Fuel Infrastructure Grant Program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for developing stations at seven county facilities including at two libraries and a recreational center. The second round of applications closed last month. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Generation 180 and a coalition of partners reached out to localities across the state to say ‘hey, let&#8217;s not leave money on the table.’ They’re going to award these grants, so let’s make sure that money is in Virginia,” Gardner said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Virginians unable to charge at home, businesses like Dominion are making it possible at the </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/10/27/dominions-electric-vehicle-charging-infrastructure-program-has-zero-sign-ups/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">workplace</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span>The company also <a href="https://www.dominionenergy.com/virginia/save-energy/electric-vehicles/residential-charger-program" target="_blank">announced</a> last Thursday that it would provide a one stop shop for qualifying residents who want to add chargers at home by connecting them with electricians. Participants can pay $1,835.96 upfront for the charger plus required materials, permitting, installation, maintenance and support, or pay $40.27 a month for five years. Low-income participants, including a family of four making less than $88,000 a year, can also participate at no cost. The utility will provide ongoing support, including a five year warranty.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This program eliminates a significant barrier to EV ownership by simplifying the process to purchase and install a home charger,&#8221; said Nathan Frost, General Manager of New Business &amp; Customer Solutions for Dominion Energy. &#8220;We are excited to help empower our customers to reduce their fuel costs and their emissions at the same time.&#8221;</span></p>

(Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Senate committee meeting in Richmond focused on investigating the wave of Israel-Hamas war protests at several Virginia colleges and universities turned intense on Tuesday, as public testimonies extended beyond the scope of the events last spring and some Republican lawmakers accused the committee of excluding law enforcement officials from the dialogue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans on the Senate Education and Health Committee also opposed the hearing’s rules, which would not allow committee members to ask university and college representatives questions during their six-minute testimonies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the start of the hearing, committee chair Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Richmond, told lawmakers their questions would be submitted to the university reps after the testimonies were provided. She also added that law enforcement and campus police were invited to speak because they were included in the committee’s invitation to the universities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We learn very little when there is an effort to just grab 30-second bites, and the opportunity to dive deeply into issues is something we&#8217;re not afforded during a General Assembly session,” she said, “but we have that opportunity now in a meeting that is really meant to develop insights and to dig deeper into and really learn from lived experiences of individuals who are sharing it today.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Tuesday, the committee listened to testimony from five university representatives who shared their responses to the demonstrations, and details about the involvement of law enforcement and campus police, institutional policies on public demonstrations and free speech, and their history of modifying their policies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The committee also heard from multiple speakers in person and online who shared their negative experiences at the demonstrations, including some people who were arrested. The committee heard from 30 speakers in total.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Republicans said that the </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://lis.virginia.gov/241/oth/Agenda.SEH.091724.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">meeting</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">which was</span> <span data-preserver-spaces="true">organized mostly by</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> Democratic senators, was one-sided. </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">They pointed to speakers’ remarks about “police </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">brutality,</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">” </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“genocide,</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">” and claimed none of the speakers were Jewish, despite several speakers being from the Jewish community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I hope we can continue this conversation,” said Sen. Christie New Craig, R-Chesapeake. “I hope we can bring everybody together because ‘fact-finding’ means everyone has to come together to figure out a way to find a resolution to this. So I&#8217;m praying that we can do that.”</span></p>

Mark Peake speaking at a Senate Education and Health Committee meeting on Sept. 17, 2024. (Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Mark Peake, R-Lynchburg, and other Republicans questioned the chair about the decision to hold questions and not directly invite law enforcement. Peake left the room for 15 minutes after the university representatives finished their remarks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I needed to calm down,” Peake said, adding that he initially believed the committee would have been able to question the speakers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Secretary of Public Safety and Homeland Security Terry Cole was in attendance, while members of the Capitol Police provided security. Cole said he looks forward to discussing officers&#8217; role in the protests and noted that members of some campus law enforcement teams were assaulted and hit with bear spray, hammers, and rocks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During Tuesday’s hearing, Senate Republicans released a </span><a href="https://x.com/VASenateGOP/status/1836131266456064332" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">statement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> urging their Democratic counterparts “to immediately stop this unacceptable attempt to legislate in secrecy. A new committee should be convened where law enforcement and Jewish community representatives can present, and Senators can ask questions.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No Democratic lawmakers expressed opposition to how the hearing was run. House lawmakers are scheduled to have a similar meeting on Sept. 26. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In May, lawmakers in both chambers </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/14/virginia-lawmakers-to-study-campus-safety-policies-after-series-of-protests/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">formed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> select committees to examine campus safety at Virginia’s colleges and universities after more than 125 people were arrested last spring at four campuses — the University of Mary Washington, Virginia Commonwealth University, Virginia Tech and the University of Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past several months, demonstrators and faculty members have criticized college administrators and law enforcement for their handling of anti-war protests, including using pepper spray to clear encampments. Demonstrators have largely called for a cease-fire in the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas militants, highlighting the deaths of thousands of Israeli and Palestinian citizens, and urged an end to the anti-semetic activity on campuses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Schuyler VanValkenburg, D-Henrico, expressed concern about trying to legislate institutions’ responses to the protests. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m not sure we should have a legislative policy on this,” VanValkenburg said, adding that Virginia universities are “wildly” different and since case law on the subject is evolving, the legislature shouldn’t be overly prescriptive.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_40080" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:1024px;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-40080" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_2691-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_2691-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_2691-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_2691-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_2691-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_2691-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Secretary of Public Safety and Homeland Security Terry Cole speaking at a Senate Education and Health Committee meeting on on Sept. 17, 2024. (Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No future meeting date was set at the end of Tuesday’s committee hearing. Hashmi said testimonies and existing policies will be compiled for the committee to consider. The list of speakers for a future meeting has not been arranged.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think overall, our colleges and universities have good policies in place that&#8217;s part of their requirements, and they&#8217;ve done that for decades, and there may not be a need to correct anything,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her main concern, Hashmi said, are “new policies that have been implemented without going through that process of shared governance, and that&#8217;s what I want to catalog and assess what&#8217;s happened, and then see how the universities are going to address that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The American Association of University Professors Chapter at the University of Virginia has criticized UVA’s administration for working to implement new disciplinary and protest policies “with no student input” from faculty members and students, according to an Aug. 21 letter to the president and provost.</span></p>
<p>Walt Heinecke, immediate past president of the AAUP UVA Chapter, said the chapter is continuing to urge the <a href="https://facultysenate.virginia.edu/meetings" target="_blank">Faculty Senate</a> to reject the policy changes made by the university’s Faculty Senate Executive Council at its upcoming meeting on Friday, adding, “we believe the policy changes should be suspended&#8221; until faculty, students and staff fully vet them.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The final guidelines, which have grown from a seven-page document to 27 pages, include suggestions on improving communication gaps between parents, teachers and school officials in emergency and non-emergency situations. Additional information was added to support school leaders with the best practices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The guidelines continue to define “cellphone-free” education as “bell-to-bell,” meaning phones should be turned off and stored away from the first school bell until dismissal. The period includes lunchtime and breaks between classes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VDOE said many students wrote in asking to use their cellphones during lunch, but doubled down on its position that the phones distract students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is essential that students have the opportunity to develop face-to-face conversations and critical in-person communication skills during unstructured school hours,” the agency stated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The final guidelines only provide exemptions for students with disabilities and English Learner students with a documented language barrier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to studies, students have used cellphones to browse the internet and social media apps, and message people during instructional time. Students have also used the devices to record events at schools and post them on various platforms. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As proposed last month, the draft guidance includes age-appropriate cellphone restrictions in Virginia’s elementary and secondary public schools.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a parent determines an elementary student needs to bring a cellphone or personal electronic communication device to school, it must be stored, off, and away from the student during the school day. Students should not use cellphones in the school building or on the school grounds before or after school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In middle and high school, students should not have a readily available cellphone or personal electronic communication device during the bell-to-bell school day, the guidance states.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Middle schools should establish local policies that determine cellphone and personal electronic communication device use within the school building or on school grounds outside of bell-to-bell,  the guidance stipulates, including before and after school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cellphones and personal electronic communication devices may be used on a high school campus before or after school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Officials said Tuesday that a task force will also be established to support schools and division leaders in enhancing communications and handling school-based emergencies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This guidance from the Virginia Department of Education is an important step towards creating a healthier learning environment where students can receive a quality education free from harmful distractions,” said Gov. Glenn Youngkin in a statement, who thanked parents, students and school staff for their “substantive engagement” in the process and committed to continued discussions to refine the policies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Department officials held several meetings with the public before drafting the guidelines. The public comment period ended on Sunday. While some have already adopted cellphone regulations, school boards are expected to adopt them by Jan. 1.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Thursday, VDOE will release an “Administrator’s Toolkit” to support school leaders in implementing their policies. No timetable was provided for when the microgrants are expected to be available for schools to raise awareness about the mental health impacts of cellphones and social media. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The governor allocated $500,000 from existing funds for the Departments of Education and Behavioral Health and Development Services to support the initiative.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are so thankful for the collaborative input from families, educators, and students on such a critical challenge for our young people,” said Superintendent of Public Instruction Lisa Coons in a statement. “Virginians helped us shape the final guidance and our implementation supports. We look forward to continuing to work with families and educators as we help ensure that every student can have a cellphone-free education.&#8221;</span></p>

Mamie Locke, D-Hampton, and Del. Sam Rasoul, D-Roanoke, at a joint subcommittee meeting on Sept. 16 in Richmond. (Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia lawmakers are carefully examining the state’s 52-year-old funding formula, which determines the funding level for public schools.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During its first meeting in Richmond on Monday, a small subcommittee of lawmakers faced the reality that the transformation could take a while, with members of the public in attendance and watching online.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers said they hope to move forward swiftly, but not too quickly, after a December </span><a href="https://jlarc.virginia.gov/pdfs/reports/Rpt575.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> showed that local governments in Virginia are spending far more than the state for K-12 education to fund the </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/constitution/article8/section2/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">state’s</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Standards of Quality in Virginia school divisions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Researchers learned that for fiscal year 2021, school divisions needed close to $11 billion in state and local funding. Instead, schools spent $17.3 billion, $6.6 billion more than the funding formula indicated was needed. Researchers said local governments covered the “vast amount” of funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission, which studied the formula, said lawmakers could partially replace the SOQ formula by using student-based calculations for special education and English learner funding, or fully replace the entire staffing-based formula with a new student-based formula.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Senate Appropriations Committee, since the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission published its report on the Standards of Quality last December, funding for public education is projected to increase by $1.85 billion between fiscal years 2023 and 2026. $1.17 billion of this new funding will result from new policy spending, including salary increases.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Policy experts told legislators from the House and Senate that other states have taken around three years to adopt new funding formulas. According to the Learning Policy Institute, a nonprofit that studies ways to improve education policy, nine states, including Tennessee and Pennsylvania, have adopted new funding formulas since 2000.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The education system today does not look the same as it did when our funding system was designed,” said Sen. Mamie Locke, D-Hampton, serving as the committee chair. “This is our opportunity to evaluate the current system and ensure that it is aligned to meet the needs of our students and school divisions for the next half-century.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Sam Rasoul, D-Roanoke, chair of the House Education Committee, said funding for public education is one of the largest components of the state&#8217;s budget. As a result, he said funding schools often impacts other priorities around the commonwealth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For that reason, we will be careful, thoughtful and deliberate as we move through this process to make sure we get it right,” Rasoul said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Terry Austin, R-Botetourt, said he would like to see the Department of Education staff and the Secretary of Education involved in the lengthy process. Neither </span>Secretary of Education Aimee Guidera nor any Department of Education staff appeared to be present for the meeting on Monday. The legislature <a href="https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/amendment/2024/1/SB30/Introduced/CA/117/3s/" target="_blank">allocated</a> $600,000 to the department over the next two years to support the subcommittee.</p>

Terry Austin, R-Botetourt, asking questions at a joing subcommittee meetiing on Sept. 16. (Nathhaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don&#8217;t want to see us work through this very quickly,&#8221; Austin added. &#8220;Although we can move through it in a timely fashion with a good, organized work plan, &#8230; this is something that&#8217;s going to be very challenging because there is tremendous diversity in the commonwealth of Virginia from one border to another, both east, west, north and south.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some Democratic lawmakers, including Locke, believe much of the work the committee will be tackling could have been addressed in two </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB105" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">omnibus bills</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that Gov. Glenn Youngkin vetoed last session. The bill would have raised teacher salaries to the national average. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his veto, Youngkin said he supported the desire of “ensuring that teachers and state-funded education support positions are funded competitively,” but passed up on the legislation because it relied heavily on what he viewed as flawed data from the </span><a href="https://www.nea.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Education Association</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which represents educators across the country. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, while the governor and legislature could not agree on the two bills, they agreed on reforming the funding formula.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Christian Martinez, a spokesman for Youngkin, said the governor has been clear that the funding formula is “archaic” and an “opportunity for real reform.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The commonwealth needs a more effective K-12 funding formula that strategically allocates resources to meet the specific needs of students, teachers, and school divisions, ensuring that critical needs are addressed effectively,” Martinez said in a statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The committee will keep its </span><a href="https://forms.microsoft.com/r/bvp0spxBjr" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">public comment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> period open through Thursday. Lawmakers will review a draft work plan at its next meeting on Oct. 31.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid the commonwealth’s transition to electric vehicles, dealerships and private companies have been grappling with meeting sales targets, and the costs to convert fleets and install infrastructure, as one major auto retailer with a plant in Southwest Virginia manufactures the parts necessary for electric heavy trucks to hit the road here and across America. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of June 30, the Department of Motor Vehicles reports there were about 6.9 million vehicles registered in Virginia, about 1.7 million cars short of having one for every person.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not clear how many of those cars are registered by private citizens or part of private companies’ fleets, but they contribute 37% of the state’s emissions from the transportation sector, almost double the next leading sources of Virginia’s 122 million metric tons of climate changing pollutants, according to a climate reduction </span><a href="https://www.deq.virginia.gov/home/showpublisheddocument/22732/638451476222270000" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality. The plan lists vehicle electrification as its number one solution to the problem..</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reducing those carbon emissions by using more electric vehicles is better for the environment, would provide opportunities and spur new jobs, said Sen. Jennifer Boysko, D-Loudoun, chair of the Senate Transportation Committee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I believe that if we don&#8217;t take necessary steps to reduce carbon emissions, and we know that transportation is the largest contributor to that, that we&#8217;re really going to be in very serious trouble,” Boysko said. “We should be thinking forward instead of trying to find ways of getting out of taking action.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration celebrated the </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/news-releases/2024/august/name-1032230-en.html#:~:text=RICHMOND%2C%20VA%20%E2%80%94%20Governor%20Glenn%20Youngkin,the%20City%20of%20Danville%20and" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">expansion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of RBW Sports &amp; Classics to Virginia, placing another electric vehicle manufacturer in the commonwealth next to Volvo, which operates a factory in Dublin. But the governor also pledged to sever Virginia’s tie to California’s electric vehicle standards, and his administration said in a statement that electric vehicles may not be a one-size-fits-all solution.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Electric vehicles are and will continue to be an attractive option for some drivers and businesses, but they simply won’t work for all Virginians,” said Christian Martinez, a spokesman for the governor. Youngkin’s move to “declare independence from the California Electric vehicle mandate restores Virginians’ freedom to decide which vehicles best fit the needs of their families and businesses and rids the commonwealth from a misguided mandate imposed by unelected bureaucrats.”</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Clean Cars and legislative efforts</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the controversial “Clean Cars” transition rules broadly require that 100% of new vehicle sales be electric starting in 2035, the regulations are nuanced and allow for hybrid-type vehicles that run on gas, and sales in other states, to be credited toward meeting the targets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia had been following the Advanced Clean Car I standards out of California under authority granted in the federal Clean Air Act. Those standards required about 7% of new vehicle sales in 2024 to be electric, before California passed the updated Advanced Clean Car II standards, which imposed the 100% electric sales requirement. The ACC II standards </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">start with 35% of new sales required to be electric or plug-in hybrid beginning in 2026. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new mandate under the ACC II standards is what led </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/05/youngkin-says-virginia-wont-follow-californias-clean-car-standards-anymore/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to say Virginia will revert back to following the less-stringent federal standards next year, with the backing of Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares, who said the 2021 law tying the state’s tailpipe regulation to California’s didn’t mean the state had to follow the updated standards. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin and Miyares have advocated for consumer choice, and so has Will Hupman, vice president of American Petroleum Institute that represents the oil and gas industry, in </span><a href="https://www.api.org/-/media/files/news/letters-comments/2024/api_comments_epa_acc_ii_final.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">comments</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> submitted to the U.S. The Environmental Protection Agency, which is still considering </span><a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/12/26/2023-28301/california-state-motor-vehicle-pollution-control-standards-advanced-clean-cars-ii-regulations" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">approving</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the exemption allowing California to set its own rules under the Clean Air Act.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The 100% (zero emission vehicle)mandate for new vehicles plainly will have a significantly adverse effect on the nationwide market for liquid transportation fuels produced and marketed by API members and ignores other approaches that can result in similar emissions reductions, on a faster timeline, and at a lower cost,” Hupman wrote.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_40024" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/img_4135/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-40024" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_4135-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1707" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_4135-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_4135-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_4135-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_4135-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_4135-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_4135-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  A plug-in hybrid vehicle charges in Richmond. (Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Environmental groups like the Southern Environmental Law Center, however, point to the standards’ flexibility that allow for compliance, like allowing credits from sales to be transferred among manufacturers. Credits from sales in other states, including manufacturers in California who “continue to over comply” with meeting requirements, according to the state’s online </span><a href="https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/applications/annual-zev-credits-disclosure-dashboard" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">dashboard</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, can also count toward sales requirements in Virginia, should the state fall behind. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s also an option of allowing plug-in hybrid electric vehicles to account for 20% of a requirement. Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, or PHEVs, run on gas but also can charge their battery with a plug, while a traditional hybrid uses its engine to charge its battery while the car is running.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">EV sales have slowed from their earlier accelerated pace, leading to concerns about meeting future Clean Car requirements.  But the SELC contends adoption of the ACC II standards that include sales requirements will lead manufacturers to send more EVs to the state to continue development of the market. Because the rules offer flexibility in how its requirements are met, the group also said, that concern isn’t warranted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No manufacturer has ever failed to meet the requirements of the Clean Car Standards on the present side of things,” said Carroll Courtenay, a staff attorney with the SELC. “There&#8217;s a lot of play in the joints and a lot of flexibility in terms of how manufacturers kind of plan nationally to meet the standards across the various states where they&#8217;re in place.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic lawmaker Boysko acknowledged a concern she’s heard from some Virginians is that the commonwealth hasn’t done enough to spur the adoption of electric vehicles for consumers and create incentives for businesses to build the infrastructure for charging stations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One of the challenges that I hear from consumers, and I&#8217;m one of those, is that I want to be able to drive wherever I need to go in the commonwealth, and I&#8217;m not confident at this point to be able to do that because we have not done the work that my legislation set out to,(to) make a very clear effort that we are moving an electrified transportation system direction,” said Boysko.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Dealers juggle EV demand and regulations</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the updated rules, dealers in Virginia have either embraced the sales targets or been met with sales and supply challenges.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia is selling between 4-5 electric vehicles per month, according to Tim Pohanka, Chief Operating Officer for the Pohanka Automotive Group and Legislative Chairman for the Virginia Automobile Dealers Association.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said electric cars made up around 8% of all car sales across the country in 2023, in part due to some states helping consumers pay for cars through subsidies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the DMV, electric, traditional hybrids and plug-in hybrid vehicles made up about 1%, 3% and .001% of registered vehicles in the state as of June 30 this year, respectively. The about 311,199 total registrations of those vehicle types have contributed about $75.5 million toward the controversial </span><a href="https://www.wavy.com/news/investigative/charged-for-efficiency-the-highway-use-fee-debate/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">highway use fee</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> drivers must pay to make up for lost gas tax revenue. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But as hybrids, another form of low emission vehicles, continue to sell quickly, Pohanka said one of the chief challenges for dealers is some customers’ hesitancy to buy EVs because of factors like the cost, lack of charging infrastructure and anxiety with how far EVs can travel on a charge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think it&#8217;s safe to say that the dealer body in this country is ready to go on anything that the consumer wants,” Pohanka said. “It really comes down to how that demand gets generated, and right now we just don&#8217;t see any of that demand.”</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_24934" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2458px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/virginia-auto-dealers-say-they-will-support-new-vehicle-emissions-standards/img_5259-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-24934"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-24934 size-full" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_5259-2.jpg" alt="" width="2458" height="1481" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_5259-2.jpg 2458w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_5259-2-300x181.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_5259-2-1024x617.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_5259-2-768x463.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_5259-2-1536x925.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_5259-2-2048x1234.jpg 2048w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_5259-2-696x419.jpg 696w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_5259-2-1068x643.jpg 1068w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_5259-2-697x420.jpg 697w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_5259-2-1920x1157.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 2458px) 100vw, 2458px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Electric vehicle charging stations. (Sarah Vogelsong/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Behind the scenes, Pohanka said dealers across the country are building the infrastructure for the charging stations, investing in safety equipment for staff, educating consumers and training sales professionals and technicians.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pohanka said there is a misconception that dealers are against electric vehicles. In reality, he said, dealers are allowing consumers to pick what suits them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When a consumer comes in and they&#8217;ve got questions about any type of drive train, be it (internal combustion engine), be it hybrid, be it electric, we&#8217;re showing all of those technologies to a consumer so they can make the right choice themselves,” he said. “There&#8217;s no pushing one way or pushing another. You really want the customer’s needs to be in charge of their purchase.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the country’s goals to convert gas powered vehicles to electric, or low emission, Pohanka predicts no state will be able to meet the California regulations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You&#8217;re not going to be able to go from 8% market share to 25% market share overnight. You&#8217;re going to need considerable help to get to those numbers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is some optimism about future EV sales, though.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stuart Gardner, executive director of </span><a href="https://generation180.org" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Generation 180</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which provides consumer education on switching to electric, is confident vehicles will continue to sell. Generation 180 also found that women are underrepresented when it comes to EV ownership, representing  less than 30% of EV owners.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;re still seeing people shopping for electric vehicles, and people buying more and more electric vehicles every year in Virginia. So that&#8217;s still happening,” Gardner said. “Even though state media and national media is focusing on ‘oh, the sales are dropping,’ they&#8217;re still beating records, it&#8217;s just not growing as fast as it was and that&#8217;s the natural evolution of anything that sells. As it starts to move more mainstream that kind of adoption curve flattens out.”</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Converting fleets</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">JK Moving Services, which is headquartered in Northern Virginia, has been preparing for the transition  enthusiastically, but still faces challenges like many other businesses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chuck Kuhn CEO and founder Chuck Kuhn said over the years the company has committed to sustainability. They use waste oil for furnaces and warehouse operations, provide sales members incentives to use electric vehicles and have converted all of its buildings to using motion sensors with LED lighting. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">JK’s truck drivers also use small, environmentally friendly generators when on the road instead of running diesel trucks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;m passionate about protecting the environment, and it&#8217;s truly embraced in all aspects of how we run the business,” said Kuhn.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The shortage of electric trucks is one of the businesses’ key challenges, Kuhn said, especially after he invested and placed orders for Tesla’s electric vehicles years ago, which he has yet to receive. While he is still committed to converting the company’s fleet to electric, Kuhn admitted he was discouraged after learning that PepsiCo received less than half of the vehicles promised by the manufacturer, according to an April report by </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-semi-trucks-short-supply-pepsico-its-rivals-use-competing-ev-big-rigs-2024-04-19/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reuters</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said he believed Tesla to be in the best position to bring electric heavy duty trucks to the market. He ordered six local tractors, but has been waiting four years after paying a deposit. The goal is to convert the entire tractor fleet by purchasing 12 units total. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I would have thought by now a large portion of our local fleet would have been converted to electric,” Kuhn said. “I had no idea it was going to take this long to get them.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shelley Francis, co-founder and managing partner of EVNoire, a consulting company that focuses on autonomous mobility solutions, said some of the reasons businesses are converting their fleets to electric vehicles is because of the cost of maintaining a gas powered vehicle. Francis said electric vehicles have limited maintenance costs for tires, windshield wipers and fluids.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similar to JK Moving Services, Francis said their clients are also converting their fleets to meet their sustainability goals such as reducing their carbon footprint. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kuhn said some other challenges he anticipates once his EV trucks arrive is the need to outsource maintenance support for the trucks until he can train his mechanics, preparing for the lack of infrastructure across the country and limitations on how many miles a truck can travel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s easy to sit back and say, ‘no, that won&#8217;t work,’ ‘we can&#8217;t do it,’ and then you don&#8217;t change, and I&#8217;m a firm believer: if you don&#8217;t embrace change, you&#8217;re going to be left behind,” Kuhn said.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Heavy truck industry opposes regulations</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While some businesses are working to convert its fleet of heavy trucks, others are in opposition to federal rules calling for the transition due to the mandates and costs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Trucking Association, which said there were 43,338 heavy and tractor trailer truck </span><a href="https://vatrucking.wildapricot.org/resources/ATRI_FastFacts_2024_VA.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">drivers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Virginia in 2022, said there’s been a 98% reduction of nitrous oxide emissions coming from the trucking industry’s tailpipes since 1985.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heavy trucks in Virginia follow rules from the federal government, which finalized an update in March that, similar to the passenger car rules, calls for truck drivers to use cleaner gas engines, traditional and plug-in hybrids, and battery electric and hydrogen fuel cell type vehicles for model years 2027 through 2032. Several groups are challenging the rules, which could delay their implementation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The EPA </span><a href="https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/biden-harris-administration-finalizes-strongest-ever-greenhouse-gas-standards-heavy" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">estimates</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the rules will remove one billion tons of climate-changing emissions from the 25% of emissions heavy trucks contribute to the transportation sector’s total emissions. The rules could also save the country $13 billion in avoided health costs, fuel and operation benefits.</span></p>

(Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though environmental groups like the Natural Resources Defense Council said the rules didn’t actually go far </span><a href="https://www.nrdc.org/bio/guillermo-ortiz/epas-latest-heavy-duty-vehicle-rule-does-not-meet-moment" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">enough</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Dale Bennett, president and CEO of the Virginia Trucking Association, said the rules had “picked the technology” by pushing toward electric vehicle adoption, which the industry says will cost </span><a href="https://www.trucking.org/news-insights/ev-mandates-trucking-industry-are-disconnected-reality" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$1 trillion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in purchases, and require building charging infrastructure and upgrading power supply.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That price tag will force drivers to either hold on to their trucks or hurry to purchase trucks now, which aren’t up to the EPA’s Clean Car standards, Bennett said. Higher costs will also trickle down to raise the costs of transported goods, and with the lack of heavy truck charging, which works differently than passenger vehicle charging, there’s what’s called “range anxiety” over how long a change will last and concern over an EV trucks’ towing ability, he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“W</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">here&#8217;s that money going to come from?” said Bennett. “It will require more trucks to haul the same amount of freight we&#8217;re hauling. We’ve got to figure that out. We think there are other technologies and ways to get there.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volvo Group, which runs the 2.3 million-square-foot New River Valley Operations electric heavy trucks manufacturing plant in Dublin, a town within Virginia’s Pulaski County,  sees things differently. The company is “c</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ompletely aligned” with the EPA’s desire of “speeding the transition to zero-emission vehicles,” said Volvo Group North America Public Relations Director Janie Coley. They also have other emissions-reducing ideas for the commonwealth and other localities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Along with electrification, states can realize significant reductions through greater use of renewable, lower carbon fuels, like HVO (renewable diesel),” Coley said, adding the plant uses HVO to move finished vehicles off the plant’s production line.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In total, there are 560 </span><a href="https://www.volvotrucks.us/trucks/vnr-electric/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volvo VNR Electric</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> trucks, which make up 44% of the Class 8 battery electric heavy trucks, the heaviest class, in the country, said Bobby Compton, product market manager at Volvo Trucks North America. Those vehicles have driven over 7.8 million miles since being launched in 2021.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Local carriers, including Camrett Logistics, Watsontown and Online Transportation, are using the model on daily routes in and out of the facility, transporting parts on two shifts while drivers charge them up on their lunch break, Compton said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And the model has more towing power, too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “The Volvo VNR Electric features 4,051 lb./ft of torque, which is substantially higher than the 1,850 lb./ft of torque on a traditional internal combustion engine VNR.” </span></p>

(Courtesy of Volvo Group North America)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coley admitted that zero-emissions trucks including the VNR Electric have a higher production cost, resulting in a higher purchase price for customers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is why we’ve seen the greatest rate of adoption of the VNR Electric in states and Canadian provinces where there are incentive and grant programs to offset some of the cost of purchase for customers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company takes a “consultative approach” with customers to evaluate their operations, see if they fixed or planned routes, work to find incentives and offer financing options, including for charging infrastructure, Compton added.</span></p>

(Ned Oliver/ Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Statewide, the teacher vacancy rate was down to 3.4% at the start of the school year after hovering at 4.7% in July, according to data provided by the Virginia Department of Education’s Office of Licensure during an advisory meeting on Monday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s teacher vacancy rate was 3.9% last October. The agency’s annual vacancy report, which provides a breakdown of school division vacancies, will be published next month, along with the vacancy rate for bus drivers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of the 131 school divisions in Virginia, 30 have a 0-1% vacancy rate, and 64 have a vacancy rate under 2%.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The focus on the teacher shortage in Virginia’s K-12 schools sharpened in recent years, after studies found that teachers were  leaving public schools because of several factors including dissatisfaction with wages, challenges after the pandemic, and political battles over education.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We continue to look for innovative ways to help school divisions ensure that every Virginia child has a high-quality educator in their K-12 classroom,” said Todd Reid, a spokesman for the Department of Education, in a statement to the Mercury. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration has tried </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/09/01/youngkin-outlines-steps-to-address-teacher-shortage-in-executive-directive/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">different methods</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to address the shortage by relaxing guidelines to hire retired teachers and targeting educator recruitment and retention efforts in areas of need.The Republican governor also worked on the issue with the Democrat-controlled state legislature, whose priorities included </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/01/17/legislation-to-bring-va-teacher-pay-to-national-average-gets-bipartisan-support/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">raising</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> teacher salaries to the national average. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last session, the General Assembly passed </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=SB142" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> authorizing school boards to issue a one-year, nonrenewable local eligibility license to people to work as teachers within the school division that made the authorization. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the legislation, locally licensed teachers must have a college degree from a regionally accredited institution of higher education, be a subject matter expert or have training in a specific area of instruction and not seek to teach special education or  plan to be certified to teach at a college or higher professional level.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislation expires on July 1, 2030.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Agency efforts and improvements</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, the state education department developed the Grow Your Own initiative, which helps develop well-qualified teachers locally. As part of the program’s mission, the agency </span><a href="https://www.doe.virginia.gov/Home/Components/News/News/350/227?npage=2" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">awarded $1.5 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to 24 school divisions in February.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, in July, VDOE </span><a href="https://www.doe.virginia.gov/Home/Components/News/News/399/227" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">received $6 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in federal funding to expand its </span><a href="https://vmm0dj30.r.us-west-2.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fwww.doe.virginia.gov%2Fteaching-learning-assessment%2Fteacher-residency-and-apprenticeship-programs/1/01010190a75a3ed9-c2edf737-365c-4148-904b-92eeae116d74-000000/RilapvtjwgRWUGqYO5V9EeXwvJM=383" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">registered apprenticeship</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> program for K-12 teachers and create pathways for beginners to become educators. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VDOE has also updated its licensure office, including fully staffing it, improving communications about licensing, and, last year, launching a new teacher licensing system, </span><a href="https://www.doe.virginia.gov/teaching-learning-assessment/teaching-in-virginia/licensure/licensing-services" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">VALO</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Phase 2 of the system, which will debut in the fall, will allow applicants to renew their licenses, add endorsements and print licenses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, the agency rolled out VALOto help “modernize” the teacher licensure process and make the application process more “user-friendly” for first-time applicants. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VDOE said it reduced the time required to process complete applications from approximately one month to an average of two weeks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the licensure office, there are 339 different areas within the agency where an educator can obtain a license. Currently, there are over one million active license types among all eligible teachers in the commonwealth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In one sense, car travel can be traced all the way back to 3500 BC in the Middle East when Mesopotamians invented the wheel and axle to transport items. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flash forward through the advent of the horse and buggy and the Ford Model T, the U.S. and Virginia are undergoing the latest stage in four-wheel travel: the adoption of electric vehicles that run on rechargeable batteries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The process is happening, and it&#8217;s happening faster everyday,” said Del. Rip Sullivan, D-Fairfax, an electric vehicle owner. “It’s part of the natural evolution of technology. It’s not an infringement on anybody. It is a phased-in process. It’s a transition of the kind we’ve experienced before.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, as the demand for reducing carbon emissions and purchasing electric vehicles grows, government and transit agencies in Virginia are facing questions about how they will meet such expectations. At the center of these charged efforts is the substantial costs of implementing the technology statewide, and how different levels of government are helping to support the transition through policy and funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The electrification of the transportation industry is an opportunity, and also a disruption, to the national power economy that the Governor’s All-American, All-of-the-Above energy plan contends with,” Christian Martinez, a press secretary for Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin, said in a statement.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">High costs for everyone</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Localities across the commonwealth agree that the costs to pay for electric vehicles and chargers can add up quickly, even for some of the most affluent jurisdictions. Local leaders have said state and federal grants have become vital to the transition statewide, but they also believe there is a long-term benefit for the future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2018, Fairfax County, one of the most affluent counties in the commonwealth, organized its Operational Energy Strategy, which included goals to electrify its fleet and have a 100% carbon-free fleet by 2035.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, Fairfax has 12  electric buses in its transit connector fleet with four more in production, two electric trash trucks, and an electric box truck to move supplies, all purchased through grants from the Environmental Protection Agency. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_36067" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/08/23/dominion-dulles-break-ground-on-nations-largest-renewable-energy-project-at-an-airport/img_0518/" rel="attachment wp-att-36067"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-36067 size-full" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/IMG_0518-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1707" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/IMG_0518-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/IMG_0518-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/IMG_0518-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/IMG_0518-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/IMG_0518-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/IMG_0518-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  An electric bus used by the city of Alexandria on display as an example of one Dulles Airport would use. (Charlie Paullin/The Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">John Morrill, director of Fairfax’s Office of Environmental and Energy Coordination, said Fairfax’s “inclination to pursue the goal of electrification and the goal of carbon neutrality was perhaps facilitated by the county having staff already working in this area toward environmental goals, the external funding is absolutely critical.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similar to Fairfax County, affluent Alexandria adopted a goal in 2019 of transitioning the city’s vehicles to full electric by 2040, but it’s falling short of its aim to convert 25% of the fleet by the end of this fiscal year, June 30,  because of delays, including the pandemic when funding was scarce. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, the city has acquired 65 electric vehicles, 45 hybrids, 6 plug-in hybrids and 42 hybrid electric buses, said Ursula Ramos, a spokesperson for the city’s transportation and electrification office. The costs for the passenger vehicles have ranged from $25,000 to $55,000, as costs for some heavy duty trucks and buses have ranged from from $500,000 to $1.8 million per vehicle, Ramos said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The locality is working on a study, expected to be completed by the end of the year, to fully evaluate how much transitioning a vehicle may cost in the long term, which will present a perspective beyond the sticker shock.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We anticipate getting some savings over the life of the vehicle through maintenance and fuel costs, and we are also taking advantage of the IRS’s direct pay incentives that provide some incentives for the purchase of any alternative fuel vehicles,” said Amy Posner, electric vehicle planner for Alexandria. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keith Harless, town manager of Pennington Gap in Lee County, said the town partnered with Virginia Clean Cities to promote electric vehicles in rural areas three years ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said one of the challenges for rural areas with charging stations is being patient on the revenue return. The town manager said rural areas “most likely” won’t have day-to-day users compared to more densely populated areas like  cities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But that is not stopping the town of approximately 1,600 people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harless said the town has a charging station and two others expected to be available this month, thanks to grant funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We recognized years ago that even though we are a small town, we still want to be able to prepare for the future, regardless of what comes &#8230; we would still like to accommodate anybody that’s visiting our town,” Harless said.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">How Virginia is participating in the transition</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since Virginia has dedicated millions to clean transportation projects following the 2016 </span><a href="https://www.deq.virginia.gov/topics-of-interest/volkswagen-settlement-agreement" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volkswagen settlement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which required the major car maker to make payments toward environmental remediation because of allegations of cheating on emissions tests, the state’s vehicle electrification transition has included some proposals from lawmakers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of the policy goals were intended to drive the public toward purchasing electric vehicles, and to help localities with funds. However, those efforts have been mostly unfruitful, as the state legislature and governor’s administration have collided on the matter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Democratic members of the legislature pushed for new electric vehicle sales by passing a law in 2021 that tied Virginia’s tailpipe emissions to the stringent “Clean Car” standards passed by California, which takes periodic steps toward ultimately banning the sale of new gas-powered cars in 2035. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though gas-powered cars could still be used and bought from the used car market under the standards, Republican legislators and Youngkin have opposed the policy, arguing that people should transition to electric vehicles at their own pace. In June, despite the 2021 legislation, Youngkin </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/05/youngkin-says-virginia-wont-follow-californias-clean-car-standards-anymore/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">decided</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to take up the only other option: following the federal standards next year. It was a move that some legislators opposed and others embraced.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have no doubt that those intent on mandating what citizens are allowed to drive will have the inclination to challenge this, but I&#8217;m hopeful we ultimately recognize we are better off when we make our own policies and decisions as a Commonwealth — not be forced to tie our yolk to a state like California,” said Del. Tony Wilt, R-Rockingham, in a July statement.  Still, Wilt acknowledged  both air pollution improvements and cost concerns with the standards.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Clean Cars policy had been seen as the best way to curb the </span><a href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">country’s</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.deq.virginia.gov/home/showpublisheddocument/19685/638411885888070000" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">state’s</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> largest source of emissions, those coming from transportation, which are causing climate change’s increasing storm intensities. But to offset the costs of electric vehicles, the federal government has been the only provider of government-based point-of-sale rebates or tax breaks in the amount of $7,500 through the Inflation Reduction Act, which funds many of its initiatives through a tax on corporations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those incentives have been </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/05/14/1251096758/biden-china-tariffs-ev-electric-vehicles-5-things" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tough</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to use, because of federal requirements mandating electric vehicle components be made in America that come with them, yet Virginia’s government  hasn’t funded  a $2,500 </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacodefull/title45.2/chapter17/article8/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rebate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> program through Virginia Energy, which could help offset costs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Do I wish that had been and was being funded? The answer to that is yes,” said Sullivan. “I await the day when Virginia, both the legislature and the governor, make the decision to fund that program.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to The Mercury’s query on how much interest there has been in the rebate program, the Virginia Department of Energy sent a statement from Director Glenn Davis, a former Republican lawmaker, that said “bipartisan consensus has remained to this day” on deciding the program “was not worthy of funding.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Martinez, with the Youngkin administration, didn’t address costs directly in his statement, but said that with federal funding available, “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">state agencies across Virginia … are pursuing opportunities aligned with the Governor’s vision to foster innovation and ensure Virginians have access to reliable, affordable, and increasingly clean energy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state government is grappling to gauge  the cost of electric vehicles for its own use,  by way of legislation that passed in </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/06/17/under-new-law-virginias-government-fleet-is-poised-to-go-electric/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2022</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to fully assess the cost of transitioning state vehicles to electric. Similar to Alexandria’s study in evaluating maintenance and fuel cost for purchasing an electric or gas vehicle, the state is supposed to purchase a gas vehicle only if the assessment “clearly indicates” it&#8217;s the cheaper option when looking at the lifetime of the costs instead of the sticker price.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Department of General Services, which oversees the state’s facilities and cars, said 99% of their vehicles are gas powered, with less than 1% being electric or hybrid. Those percentages are the same breakdown for vehicles bought in 2024, said Killeen Wells, deputy director of communications, when “only 1% of purchases showed an electric vehicle as being more affordable and operationally viable.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides cots, there are other factors for the state to contend with when purchasing EVs, Wells said, including “limited electric vehicle availability to government fleets” and lack of infrastructure at our state agencies and cost.” There’s no defined timeline to transition the state’s fleet fully to electric vehicles, Wells added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Electric vehicles are purchased when the electric vehicle meets the commonwealth&#8217;s operational and financial criteria,” she said.</span></p>

(NBC12)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Department of Transportation launched an electric vehicle pilot program last year after purchasing a number of trucks for the agency. However, like others, VDOT has faced a significant delay in acquiring and using electric vehicles. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Christopher Berg, assistant director of VDOT’s environmental divisions, said the agency is deploying them across the commonwealth in different use cases to determine the feasibility of bringing electric vehicles into the agency’s fleet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re really in the early days of looking at how to bring electric vehicles into our VDOT fleet,” Berg said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia has also put $39.9 million toward the purchase of battery-electric buses from the state’s share of the 2016 Volkswagen settlement.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">How federal EV funding is being put to use statewide, from schools to law enforcement </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With local support and the overwhelming amount of federal funding, schools in Virginia have been the most notable groups to benefit from the transition from diesel to electric. In addition, local governments have also started to convert their fleets of vehicles but are still facing challenges with costs and charging.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Fairfax, the school division purchased 73 electric buses, most of which were paid for by the U.S. </span><a href="https://www.epa.gov/cleanschoolbus" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Environmental Protection Agency</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and a competitive grant from Dominion Energy. The Fairfax County Joint Environmental </span><a href="https://www.fairfaxcounty.gov/environment-energy-coordination/joint-environmental-task-force" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Task Force</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a group that worked to address climate change and environmental sustainability, provided assistance in purchasing three electric buses. Currently, there are 1,625 school buses in the division’s fleet. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“FCPS School Board and Administration recognize the importance of protecting our children and community by eliminating emissions into the atmosphere and reducing our dependence on fossil fuels,” said Steven Brasley, a spokesman for Fairfax schools, adding that the county plans to convert school buses and other fleet vehicles to electric or zero-carbon alternatives by 2035.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brasley said Fairfax would advise other school divisions interested in switching to electric to work with their local utility provider to ensure infrastructure and agreements are in place and to take their time. Training drivers, maintenance technicians, and supervisors are critical to success.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some schools are still working to reduce emissions through alternatives to purchasing electric buses. Others have tabled the idea. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the southeastern part of Virginia, Newport News Public Schools </span><a href="https://sbo.nn.k12.va.us/news/archive/2024-01-08_NNPS-receives-government-grant-for-propane-school-buses.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in January that it would be using other alternative fuel sources, such as propane, for buses. The school division announced it was awarded a grant of $525,000 from the EPA to replace 15 diesel school buses with propane buses. The acquisition would bring the city’s total of propane buses to 168 out of a total fleet  of 318.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rappahannock County Public Schools Superintendent Shannon Grimsley said her division has not purchased any electric buses. She said until the infrastructure is available, it does not make much sense for the district to switch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grimsely said the school division also faces challenges with meeting the qualifications for grant funding, terrain and the lack of available charging resources presently. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We researched and even collaborated with other districts on available grant programs to purchase electric buses, but the partial rebates and up front infrastructure costs associated with these programs made the concept cost prohibitive for us to pursue further,” Grimsley said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Law enforcement is also considering converting its fleet, but in smaller steps, as the technology continues to develop for electric patrol vehicles. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fairfax County Police Department has acquired five electric vehicles through a procurement process as part of its fleet with over 1,200 vehicles. The vehicles, which range in costs between $25,000 to $75,000, are used for recruitment primarily by administrative staff, but are being considered for other uses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The department said one of the keys was having the infrastructure in place before receiving the electric vehicles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since its 2019 </span><a href="https://www.government-fleet.com/324588/va-police-gets-ev-for-response-at-public-events" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announcement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Virginia Capitol Police has been operating a six-seat electric vehicle, which was purchased from Global Electric Motorcars (GEM), a subsidiary of Minnesota-based Polaris Industries using grant funds from the U.S. Department of Justice. In 2021, Polaris sold GEM to Waev Inc. based in Anaheim, California.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spokesman Joe Macenka said the Capitol Police’s six-seat GEM, licensed for use on city streets and capable of traveling 25 MPH with a range of 35 miles, helps to transport people around the 13-acre Capitol Square. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2019, Col. Anthony S. “Steve” Pike, former Capitol Police chief, announced that the GEM could reach all state properties the division is assigned to protect in Richmond. He said GEM would be less expensive to operate than a traditional police vehicle and have less of an impact on the environment.</span></p>

Read their responses below, and stay tuned for in-depth profiles of these candidates in the coming weeks.

<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Abortion</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the only state in the South that hasn’t restricted abortion access since the Supreme Court overturned Roe. v Wade in 2022, which made abortion a federal right, Virginia is a key player in the country’s reproductive health landscape. By dismantling Roe v Wade, the nation’s highest court laid the groundwork for each state to restrict or enhance access to abortion; a spate of state bans on abortion have since emerged, with 14 states making the procedure illegal. Abortion remains legal in Virginia and state Democrats will push to enshrine it as a right in the commonwealth’s constitution next year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many Republican candidates in Virginia’s congressional races assert that abortion access should be determined at the state level. In District 2, Republican incumbent U.S. Rep. Jenn Kiggans, a Navy veteran, nurse and former member of the state senate, has “consistently advocated for women to choose life, but respects exceptions for rape, incest, and life of the mother,” according to her campaign </span><a href="https://jenforcongress.com/issues/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Democratic challenger Missy Cotter Smasal, who is also a Navy veteran as well as the director of a nonprofit focused on women veterans, </span><a href="https://fb.watch/uhpo6DTiSN/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">declared herself</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “the only pro-choice Navy veteran in this race.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In District 7, anchored in Prince William County but also spanning rural parts of the state, Spotsylvania attorney and former Green Beret Derrick Anderson, a Republican, is challenging career military officer and Democrat Eugene Vindman for the seat currently occupied by Abigail Spanberger, who is running for governor next year. Anderson has expressed support for the overturn of Roe and </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/DerrickAndersonforVA/videos/my-life-story-is-pro-life-and-thats-how-i-will-serve-in-congress-my-mother-got-p/414067620643367/?locale=ms_MY" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">called himself “pro-life” while sharing on social media</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that his mother had him as a single parent at 17 years old. Vindman plans to support </span><a href="https://vindmanforcongress.com/issues/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">access to abortions and contraception along with in vitro fertilization</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In District 10, anchored in Loudoun County, Democratic state Sen. Suhas Subramanyam is running against Republican Mike Clancy to fill Rep. Jennifer Wexton’s seat. Wexton will not seek reelection due to a health issue, and endorsed Subramanyam during his democratic primary. He has supported an effort to </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+SJ255" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">enshrine abortion protections into Virginia’s constitution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and plans to support federal protections. Clancy said that he “does not support federal action on abortion.” His campaign website lists “respect life” as a campaign issue and notes his support for resources for pregnant people and families. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In District 9, incumbent Rep. Morgan Griffith faces Democratic challenger Karen Baker, a lawyer-turned-nurse. Griffith has voted against congressional efforts to protect abortion access and </span><a href="https://morgangriffith.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=402684" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">stated</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that Roe v. Wade had “produced decades of tragedy.” Baker wrote on her campaign website that “women’s choices must be respected.”</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Ksn63EC7JL"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/17/they-dont-like-abortion-but-kaines-gop-challengers-say-they-wont-seek-a-federal-ban/">They don’t like abortion, but Kaine’s GOP challengers say they won’t seek a federal ban</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;They don’t like abortion, but Kaine’s GOP challengers say they won’t seek a federal ban&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/17/they-dont-like-abortion-but-kaines-gop-challengers-say-they-wont-seek-a-federal-ban/embed/#?secret=H3VtqeFCdu#?secret=Ksn63EC7JL" data-secret="Ksn63EC7JL" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, who is seeking reelection, has co-sponsored the </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/kaine-others-reintroduce-reproductive-freedom-for-all-act/article_f6cbd514-a8a7-11ed-8ac8-e388ae499856.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reproductive Freedom For All Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which would protect access federally, now that Roe has been overturned. His Republican challenger, retired Navy veteran Hung Cao, told Virginia Mercury this summer that he </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/17/they-dont-like-abortion-but-kaines-gop-challengers-say-they-wont-seek-a-federal-ban/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">won’t support a federal abortion ban</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He has also </span><a href="https://www.hungforva.com/right-to-life/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">called himself “pro-life.” </span></a></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Housing </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Housing is an issue people experience practically and constantly, amid paying rent or mortgages. Local governments handle approvals or rejections of developments and craft zoning laws that guide development potential. But state and federal lawmakers have roles to play as well — largely through funding mechanisms or taking action where housing intersects with other policy platforms. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While many congressional candidates this year don’t have housing policy outlined on their websites, some have been talking about how they plan to help states and local governments from the federal level. The Mercury reached out to others for more details on what they would do to help with housing supply and affordability. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In District 2, Incumbent Rep. Jen Kiggans did not respond to inquiry for more details on housing policy by the time of this publication, though during her time in the state legislature as a senator, she voted in favor of the </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?212+vot+SV0271HB1889+HB1889" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Residential Landlord and Tenant Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her challenger, Democrat Missy Cotter Smasal, acknowledged the Mercury’s request for comment but did not follow through with a response in time for this publication. Her website touches on housing policy while addressing the economy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We need to stop the price gouging on groceries, and stop massive corporations from buying up houses and raising rent,” she wrote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In District 7, Democratic candidate Eugene Vindman expressed support for building more homes that middle-class families can purchase and “support programs that help first-time homebuyers buy a house.” He added that he’s concerned about out-of-state corporations buying homes that they then sell or rent at higher prices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In Congress, I will work to take on these speculators who are putting regular people&#8217;s American dream out of reach,” he said in an email. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican candidate Derrick Anderson said he’s going to focus initially on how Congress can help reduce inflation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The first thing I’d do is pass a federal balanced budget amendment – ridiculous inflationary spending drove up housing prices (and grocery costs, gas costs, etc),” he said in an email. “Let’s stop the spending and get inflation down for the sake of Virginians who are struggling to get by.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In District 10, Republican Mike Clancy could not be reached for comment by the time of this publication. His campaign website doesn’t include housing policy, but it does stress his goal of helping to reduce inflation and stimulate the economy by “unleashing American innovation” and energy as well as reducing regulations on small businesses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrat Suhas Subramanyam’s campaign replied to The Mercury’s inquiry but did not follow through with his housing policy plans should he become a congressman before publication. He has supported affordability measures as a state senator: This year he </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB597" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">co-sponsored a bill </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">to allow more Virginian localities to utilize Low Income Housing Tax Credits when approving developments, but it was vetoed by Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In District 9, Democratic challenger Karen Baker supports expansion of tax credits that can help spur construction of affordable housing available to various levels of area median income. She also wants to</span><a href="https://www.bakerforva9th.com/affordable-housing" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “work on tailored solutions that address the specific needs of rural communities,”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> like the Southwest Virginia ones she seeks to represent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his tenure as representative, Morgan Griffith has </span><a href="https://morgangriffith.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=402287" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">supported funding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> appropriations to his district meant to help with affordable housing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine has cited his early-career experience as a fair housing lawyer before he went into politics. As a member of congress, he pointed to a bill he co-sponsored, the </span><a href="https://www.kaine.senate.gov/press-releases/klobuchar-kaine-introduce-legislation-to-address-nationwide-housing-shortage" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Housing Supply and Affordability Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which would create a grant program for state and local governments to tap into. He’s also been involved with the </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/2797" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Low-Income First-Time Homebuyers Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which would establish fixed-rate 20 year mortgages for first-time buyers whose income doesn’t exceed a certain amount. Both bills have been introduced multiple times but have yet to become law. Kaine also supports expansions to Low Income Housing Tax Credits, which helps increase affordable housing supply. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine’s opponent, Hung Cao, </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/how-kamala-harris-new-policy-plan-could-impact-housing-in-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">echoes a stance of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump that ties housing issues to the U.S.-Mexico border</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“First and foremost, we need to secure the border,” Cao said in an email to The Mercury. “Everything that’s going wrong in our country right now is a direct result of our wide-open southern border. Housing costs are at an all-time high because there&#8217;s millions who were not here a few years ago for which we need to provide housing.” </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Guns</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Congress remains at a standstill as lawmakers fiercely debate the future of gun rights in America, with proponents of stricter gun control measures clashing with staunch defenders of the Second Amendment. Amid a surge in mass shootings and growing public outcry, both sides are digging in, setting the stage for what will likely be another defining battle over gun laws as the nation is headed toward the 2024 presidential election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the Senate, U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., who was governor of Virginia when the deadly mass shooting at Virginia Tech took place in 2007, co-sponsored the Virginia Plan to Reduce Gun Violence, which he said would enact the same gun safety provisions passed by the Democratic-controlled Virginia General Assembly in 2020 at the federal level. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hung Cao, Kaine’s Republican opponent, strictly opposes further legislation that he believes would infringe Second Amendment rights. Instead, Cao proposes that gun-related violence to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. Prosecutors who refuse to enforce the law must be held accountable, the retired U.S. Navy captain said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia’s 2nd Congressional District, U.S. Rep. Jen Kiggans, R-Virginia Beach, in 2023 received a 100% rating by Gun Owners of America (GOA), a national gun rights organization, and a 92% rating by the National Rifle Association (NRA) in the previous year. While in the Virginia legislature, Kiggans has voted against universal background checks, expanding red flag laws that take guns out of the hands of domestic abusers and those who pose a threat to Virginians, and against prohibiting guns in schools and childcare centers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Missy Cotter Smasal, Kiggans’ Democratic opponent, states on her campaign website that she is committed to legislation seeking to prevent gun violence, create safer communities, and prevent veteran suicide. Smasal said that there are “commonsense measures supported by large majorities of Virginians” that can make Virginia’s neighborhoods safer while also protecting individual rights.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In District 7, Derrick Anderson, the Republican nominee, has stated that Second Amendment rights are sacred and shall not be infringed upon. As a former special forces Green Beret, Anderson vows to be “a strong advocate for gun owners in the halls of Congress.” Earlier this year, the Republican turned to the social media platform X, where </span><a href="https://x.com/DerrickforVA/status/1774127722647687559" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">he said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that Americans have to “stand up for and protect our 2nd Amendment rights.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eugene Vindman, a former career military officer and the Democratic nominee, supports gun safety measures such as background checks and red flag laws to keep guns out of the hands of criminals, the mentally ill, and others who might cause harm. While he believes in the right of law-abiding gun owners to own firearms, Vindman also pushes for more legislation ensuring public safety. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Rep. Morgan Griffith, R-Salem, the incumbent in District 9, is a strong advocate for Second Amendment rights. Griffith said in a statement to The Mercury that he does not support government-mandated registrations of guns but that he backs harsher penalties for offenders who “abuse the right to have guns” by committing felonious crimes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrat Karen Baker, Griffith’s opponent and a gun owner, said she backs rigorous gun safety training for children in school. She is also pushing for enhanced gun safety laws, including tax credits for trigger locks, and she has called for enhanced mental health services for troubled individuals, and a legal mechanism to manage early reports of suspicious behaviors involving non-imminent ideation of shootings. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Across the state in District 10, constitutional lawyer Mike Clancy, the Republican nominee, has vowed to defend Americans’ constitutional rights without exception, including the Second Amendment right to bear arms. Instead of regulating gun ownership. Clancy is pushing for legislation to fully fund law enforcement to ensure law enforcement has the training and equipment to protect Virginia’s communities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During his time in Virginia’s state legislature, Sen. Suhas Subramanyam, D-Loudoun, Clancy’s opponent, has actively supported several gun safety laws, including </span><a href="https://www.suhasforvirginia.com/press-and-media/key-gun-violence-prevention-bills-from-senator-subramanyam-vetoed-by-gun-lobby-backed-governor" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">several measures which passed the General Assembly just this year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, two of which were signed by Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican. Suhas told The Mercury he believes America can achieve serious progress on this issue while respecting the Second Amendment, and without undermining the rights of responsible gun owners.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Education/Project 2025</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With divergent calls from some to eliminate the U.S. Department of Education and from others to improve teacher pay, public education is a top matter for voters in Virginia and across the nation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a Pew Research Center </span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2024/04/23/what-are-americans-top-foreign-policy-priorities/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> published in April, half of the Americans surveyed said that public K-12 education is going in the wrong direction. Some believe that schools should spend more time on core academic subjects. At the same time, communities, including those in Virginia, are sparring over what is taught in schools, particularly history, and gauging if students are falling behind in their studies and how to address that challenge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schools are also facing confrontation from parents over social issues, such as the types of books that are allowed in schools and the treatment of transgender students. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of these education issues and recommendations to address them are outlined in </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/04/what-could-project-2025-mean-for-education-in-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Project 2025</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — a conservative plan for how the country should operate if a Republican wins the White House. Some support the plan and others fear it could derail previous efforts to improve public education in Virginia.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="AKFt5DoOMp"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/04/what-could-project-2025-mean-for-education-in-virginia/">What could Project 2025 mean for education in Virginia?</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the state’s District 2 congressional race, Republican nominee and incumbent Jen Kiggans has publicly supported</span><a href="https://jenforcongress.com/issues/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> prioritizing students&#8217; safety and security</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and equipping teachers with tools and resources to improve student outcomes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She voted for the </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/5" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Parents Bills of Rights</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a measure to “ensure the rights of parents are honored in public schools” and stands against critical race theory, a graduate-level framework that focuses on racial inequity and has not been found in Virginia curricula.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like the authors of Project 2025 and Kiggans, the Republican nominee for the District 10 seat Mike Clancy said he supports school choice. </span></p>
<p>Democratic nominee Eugene Vindman, in District 7, said he opposes book bans and the project, which he <a class="c-link" href="https://dailyprogress.com/opinion/column/eugene-vindman-project-2025-is-a-threat-to-democracy/article_709f3f3a-6a2a-11ef-927e-b310eb440bd5.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://dailyprogress.com/opinion/column/eugene-vindman-project-2025-is-a-threat-to-democracy/article_709f3f3a-6a2a-11ef-927e-b310eb440bd5.html" data-sk="tooltip_parent">sa</a>id his opponent and Republican nominee Derrick Anderson has failed to denounce.</p>

<p>He said he supports helping students in his home district “succeed” and will advocate for ensuring that “test scores go up and conflicts go down.”</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In District 9, Karen Baker, the democratic nominee, said she supports strengthening public schools, much like Vindman.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Baker’s </span><a href="https://www.bakerforva9th.com/issues" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">campaign website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, she supports making universal preschool “a reality for all families” in Southwest Virginia. She also supports investing in vocational education and making it accessible to the area. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Suhas Subramanyam, the Democratic nominee in District 10, said if elected, he will work to expand Pre-K, access to “critical“ job training into apprentice programs, and support providing resources to local schools to close the pandemic, learning loss gap.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He told the Mercury that if the recommendations for Project 2025 were implemented, it would “devastate” Virginia’s public education system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We must do the opposite: invest in our schools, support our parents and teachers, and make college and postgraduate education affordable,” Subramanyam’s campaign said in a statement.</span></p>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic candidates in Virginia’s congressional races largely have expressed the desire to address climate change by transitioning to zero-carbon generation sources. Some candidates differentiate themselves, like District 3 incumbent U.S. Rep. Bobby </span><a href="https://www.bobbyscottforcongress.com/the-scott-record" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scott</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who’s advocated for funding Norfolk’s flood wall to reduce sea level rise damage. District 6 contender Ken </span><a href="https://www.kenmitchellforvirginia.com/issues" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mitchell</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> highlighted a need to “transition public investments away from propping up fossil fuel companies” on his campaign site, while District 11 incumbent U.S. Rep. Gerry </span><a href="https://gerryconnolly.com/issues/environment/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Connolly</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has said he’s an advocate for environmental justice, an environmental lens that amplifies the voices and needs of overlooked and overburdened communities during development that could impact their area. District 9 candidate Karen </span><a href="https://www.bakerforva9th.com/coal-miners" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Baker </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">doesn’t address climate change on her website, but highlights a need to protect coal miners’ health.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Across the aisle, Republican congressional candidates also mostly fall in line with each other’s environmental policy views by advocating for  </span><a href="https://www.mikeclancyforcongress.com/services-5" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reducing regulations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.hungforva.com/enviornment/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">energy independence</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or promoting energy sources stemming from </span><a href="https://cline.house.gov/issues/energy/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fossil fuels</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><a href="https://sitkaforcongress.com/on-the-issues" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">nuclear</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Some candidates don’t take clear positions about their environmental policy plans. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taking unique approaches on the GOP side are District 2 incumbent U.S. Rep Jen Kiggans, who signed onto a letter with other House Republicans earlier this year asking for House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana to </span><a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/some-house-republicans-warn-against-climate-law-repeal/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">not repeal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> tax credits of the IRA, which have helped incentivize a burgeoning offshore wind </span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2024/07/09/south-korean-company-plans-to-build-681-million-offshore-wind-submarine-cable-plant-in-chesapeake/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">development</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> industry in the Hampton Roads region. U.S. Rep.

District 7 candidate Derrick Anderson doesn’t offer a clear position on his website.</span></p>

Some environmental groups say the bill includes some concessions for continued natural gas use. Whichever party gains majority control of Congress could determine the fate of that bill.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Election integrity</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Concerns over election integrity and the potential for voter fraud have sparked a renewed focus in Congress, as lawmakers from both parties debate how best to safeguard the democratic process. With allegations of fraudulent voting making headlines in recent election cycles, the issue has become a political flashpoint. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While some legislators call for stricter voting regulations to prevent potential abuse, others argue that such measures could suppress voter participation. As the 2024 election approaches, members of Congress are crafting new policies aimed at ensuring fair elections while addressing public concerns over security and accessibility.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the U.S. Senate, Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., has carried legislation such as the Freedom to Vote Act, which would implement provisions like automatic voter registration, same-day and Election Day voter registration, online voter registration, and no-excuse mail voting. Kaine has also co-sponsored the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, which seeks to restore and update crucial protections against voting discrimination that were weakened by recent Supreme Court decisions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine’s Republican opponent Hung Cao, a retired U.S. Navy captain who is backed by former President Donald Trump, has proposed few legislative means to secure the electoral process beyond a universal requirement for providing a voter ID in order to cast a ballot. But he said in a statement to The Mercury that “the only way to have election integrity is to have people watch the polls.” Cao has also suggested that the U.S. hold elections like the ones he witnessed in Iraq and Afghanistan, where people vote with their finger and blue ink. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In July, U.S. Rep. Jen Kiggans, R-Virginia Beach, who represents House District 2, voted in support of the </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/118/bills/hr8281/BILLS-118hr8281rh.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which passed in the House of Representatives by a 221-198 vote. Advocates of the SAVE Act say it would ensure that only citizens can vote in federal elections, partly by making it mandatory for states to obtain proof of citizenship to register voters and also requiring states to purge noncitizens from voter rolls. But President Joe Biden has vowed to veto the measure, stating that it would make it more difficult for eligible voters to register and increase “the risk that eligible voters are purged from voter rolls.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kiggans’ Democratic challenger Missy Cotter Smasal, who previously mounted an unsuccessful campaign in Virginia’s 8th Senate District, has talked little about election integrity legislation. But the U.S. Navy veteran has attacked her Republican opponent for being  a “big supporter of President Trump” for backing “Big Lie” conspiracy theorists in Virginia’s state legislature by being one of </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/02/24/virginia-youngkin-tax-cuts-house-senate/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">only four Senators to vote for an audit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the 2020 election that would have cost Virginia taxpayers $70 million.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Derrick Anderson, a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">former special forces Green Beret and the Republican nominee in District 7, has talked little publically about election integrity and he offers no clues about his views on his campaign website, but in </span><a href="https://dailyprogress.com/news/local/government-politics/elections/derrick-anderson-talks-biden-the-border-and-inflation-ahead-of-tuesdays-gop-primary/article_a009bd2a-2837-11ef-9cbd-0f478e969dbd.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an interview</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with The Daily Progress he acknowledged that Joe Biden is the legitimate president.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If elected, Anderson’s Democratic opponent Eugene Vindman, the twin brother of anti-Trump whistleblower Alexander Vindman, has vowed to work to pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and strengthen protections for election workers, “so that anyone who threatens a poll volunteer or election official in an attempt to undermine our vote is held accountable.” Vindman, whose family emigrated to the United States from the former Soviet Union, has also warned against downplaying the Jan. 6, 2021 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, which he blamed on a pro-Trump movement that did not recognize the nation’s norms of peaceful transfer of power and that he said undermines elections across the country to this day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Rep. Morgan Griffith, R-Salem, the incumbent in District 9, in 2023 sponsored the </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/4460" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">No Vote for Non-Citizens Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, seeking to ensure only eligible American citizens may participate in federal elections. The bill, which is still moving through the House, withholds some federal dollars that go to localities that allow non-citizens to vote in their elections. Griffith also voted for the SAVE Act. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrat Karen Baker, Griffith’s opponent, told The Mercury that Republicans have failed to provide any evidence of voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election and therefore there is no reason to believe that this year’s election will be different. Baker also stated that fears of undocumented immigrants voting are generated to induce distrust of election integrity but are absolutely without basis, and she has criticized Griffith for refusing to state that he will accept the outcome of the 2024 presidential election. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Mike Clancy, an attorney from Loudoun County and the Republican nominee in District 10, does not list election integrity as one of his legislative priorities on his campaign website, he has been outspoken on social media about strengthening election laws. “Congress must pass the SAVE Act,” Clancy </span><a href="https://x.com/MikeClancyVA/status/1811031488923586986" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said on X</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in July. “Only U.S. citizens should be voting in our elections.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State Sen. Suhas Subramanyam, D-Loudoun, Clancy’s opponent and a strict opponent of the SAVE Act, believes that “democracy is under attack” in America. The son of Indian immigrants, Subramanyam has vowed to continue to fight against “restrictive voter ID laws that are designed to suppress the vote, protect early voting to ensure greater access to the polls, and combat political gerrymandering.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Immigration</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Americans find that more migrants are turning to the United States for employment opportunities or to escape violent conflict in their home countries, among other reasons, they are increasingly interested in candidates&#8217; views on immigration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">America has become one of the most prominent destinations for migrants. However, over several years, many migrants have entered the country illegally, prompting backlash. At the same time, migrants have also been a staple of America’s workforce, including in the commonwealth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the </span><a href="https://map.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/locations/virginia/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">American Immigration Council</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, immigrants comprised about 12.6% of Virginia’s total population in 2022, and 16.2% of Virginia&#8217;s labor force.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the District 9 race, Republican nominee and incumbent Morgan Griffith said immigrants are welcome to come to the United States “legally” and share in the “American dream,&#8221; but supports “cracking down” on illegal immigration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While criticizing the House for ducking its responsibility, Democratic nominee Karen Baker in District 9 said Congress needs to pass comprehensive immigration reform. She said she supports the Senate&#8217;s template for more border control agents and asylum officers and advocates for a DACA bill to protect children who have lived in the U.S. their entire lives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the District 2 race, Jen Kiggans’ campaign said the Republican nominee and incumbent voted for legislation to increase security at the U.S. border by ensuring that federal immigration officials have the training and resources to stop the influx of illegal immigration, drugs and crime into the U.S. The measure has remained in the Senate since last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kiggans supports strict enforcement of existing federal immigration laws and holding President Joe Biden’s administration accountable. She also backed legislation to prevent the administration from using National Parks to house illegal immigrants.</span></p>
<p>Derrick Anderson, the Republican nominee for the District 7 seat, said he <a class="c-link" href="https://dailyprogress.com/news/local/government-politics/elections/derrick-anderson-talks-biden-the-border-and-inflation-ahead-of-tuesdays-gop-primary/article_a009bd2a-2837-11ef-9cbd-0f478e969dbd.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://dailyprogress.com/news/local/government-politics/elections/derrick-anderson-talks-biden-the-border-and-inflation-ahead-of-tuesdays-gop-primary/article_a009bd2a-2837-11ef-9cbd-0f478e969dbd.html" data-sk="tooltip_parent">supports</a> shutting down the border.</p>
<p>“It’s clear that the crisis at the border is hurting people right here in Virginia’s 7th District,” Anderson said in a statement. “Drugs, fentanyl, human trafficking – we need a serious change. We need to secure the border.”</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Suhas Subramanyam, the Democratic nominee in District 10, said with the U.S. immigration system being “broken,” he supports the country taking a comprehensive approach to the problem by starting with securing the border and ensuring that people who are doing “the right things the right way and contributing to our economy“ have a path to citizenship.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said the country must also fix its “broken” asylum system.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Foreign policy (Israel-Hamas conflict, China, Ukraine)</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Virginia voters are following their congressional candidates&#8217; views on common issues in the U.S., they are also considering their responses to global conflicts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a Pew Research Center </span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2024/04/23/what-are-americans-top-foreign-policy-priorities/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that was completed in April, two of the most important issues to Americans are limiting the powers of China and finding a solution to the Israel-Hamas conflict.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Americans are also interested in limiting Russia’s powers following its invasion of Ukraine in Feb. 2022.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., said he takes pride in the fact that he is among a wide slate of lawmakers President Vladimir Putin of Russia permanently banned from visiting Russia in response to his record of standing against Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine two years ago. Kaine has voted for aid to Ukraine, and earlier this year he helped pass a supplemental package that included support for the country to defend its sovereignty. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine also said he views the U.S.-China relationship as the most consequential bilateral relationship of the century. Kaine voted to pass the </span><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/08/09/fact-sheet-chips-and-science-act-will-lower-costs-create-jobs-strengthen-supply-chains-and-counter-china/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CHIPS and Science Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> designed to outcompete China by shoring up domestic supply chains and bringing manufacturing back to America. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After Hamas terrorists attacked Israeli territories on Oct. 7, 2023, Kaine has worked with Democrats, Republicans, and the Biden administration to ensure that Israel has defensive support. But Kaine has also called for a reduction of civilian casualties, supported the safe and swift delivery of humanitarian assistance to civilians in Gaza and the West Bank, and for long-term solutions to allow Palestinians and Israelis to live alongside each other in peace.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine’s Republican opponent and former U.S. Navy captain Hung Cao in a statement criticized the Biden administration and Congress for giving “blanket amounts of money” towards Ukraine’s defense effort, alleging the financial support instead helps fund Ukraine’s retired workers pension plans. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cao considers China an “existential threat” to the United States, and he has further called for the continued support of Israel, which he considers one of the United States’ closest allies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Jen Kiggans’ campaign, the District 2 Republican nominee and incumbent supports legislation to impose sanctions against China for its responsibility in the fentanyl crisis and </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/22/cosponsors" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">prevent selling any petroleum to Chinese Communist Party-controlled entities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her campaign also said she prioritizes protecting American jobs and intellectual property from being stolen by the CCP.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Derrick Anderson, the Republican nominee in District 7 and a former special forces Green Beret with six tours of duty overseas, including Afghanistan, Iraq, and various countries throughout the Middle East, told the </span><a href="https://jewishinsider.com/2024/04/virginia-congressional-candidate-derrick-anderson-military/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Jewish Insider”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in an interview in April that Congress needs to move quickly to provide additional aid to the Jewish state in its war against Hamas. He added that he was skeptical of sending more U.S. funds to the Palestinians, noting that other countries are providing aid. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like Anderson, his Democratic opponent Eugene Vindman, also a veteran, called for continued support for Israel, while asking that the U.S. continue to ensure that all the hostages — including Americans — are returned safe and sound to their families. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vindman has also pushed for the continued support of Ukraine in both military and economic terms, and for taking on China&#8217;s state-directed economic system, which he said unfairly competes in the market and compromises America’s national security. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While U.S. Rep. Morgan Griffith, R-Salem, voted for the Ukraine Democracy Defense Lend-Lease Act of 2022, which allowed the lending and lease of American defense material to the country in its defense of the Russian invasion, he also also voted to block similar legislation last year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Griffith </span><a href="https://morgangriffith.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=403045" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">has called</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> China a “dangerous, power-hungry actor” over the country’s territorial claims in the South China Sea, as well as its escalating efforts to control Taiwan, while </span><a href="https://morgangriffith.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=403086" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">criticizing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> President Joe Biden’s decision to hold an arms shipment to Israel last spring. Griffith also said that America’s dealings with other countries must be driven by a careful analysis of what best serves the United States and its citizens.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In relation to the conflict between Israel and Hamas, Karen Baker, Griffith’s Democratic opponent, has pointed out that while she acknowledged Israel’s right to exist, there are “bad acts on both sides.” Baker has also endorsed the continued financial and military support of Ukraine by the United States, </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Suhas Subramanyam, the Democratic nominee in District 10, said he supports the U.S. in opposing Russia leader Vladimir Putin&#8217;s territorial ambitions in Europe and standing up to China, which is “violating international law and illegally dumping goods to prop up their economy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also supports the CHIPS Act, which helped to boost domestic research and manufacturing of semiconductor chips.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for the Israel-Hamas war, Subramanyam said he supports the U.S. returning hostages, especially  American citizens, and helping to rebuild communities affected by the war.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also supports a two-state solution, adding that Hamas cannot be one of the states.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The human lives lost in this conflict have been devastating for all sides,” Subramanyam said in a statement. “I have visited the region, including the areas of Israel that were attacked, and made good friends there. I want to see an end to the war and a long-term path to peace.”</span></p>

<p>An initial proposed plan was to transform the corridor into a rail trail.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, the state appropriated up to $35 million, as part of a <a href="https://ctb.virginia.gov/media/ctb/agendas-and-meeting-minutes/2024/march/draft_minutes_ctb_workshop_meeting_march_2024.pdf" target="_blank">$54 million package</a>, to “buy land for the proposed rail trail and conduct initial planning and site development.” </span><a href="https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/get/budget/4779/HB6001/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Language</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the budget noted that any land acquisition for the trail “shall not preclude the consideration of options to maintain rail transportation in the corridor.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In June, a proposal was published for bids to revive the rail line that suggested to applicants that the winning rail operator could use $35 million in state funds to make needed repairs to the historic railroad, which was founded in the 1850s. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Jessica Cowardin, a Virginia Department of Transportation spokeswoman, the agency would “not view repairing the rail line as an eligible expense for this directed spending” under the budget language.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">How the rail-with-trail proposal developed</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2021, Virginia completed a field survey and produced a </span><a href="https://www.vdot.virginia.gov/media/vdotvirginiagov/projects/staunton/rockingham-shenandoah-and-warren-/Feasibility_Study_for_a_Linear_Park_in_the_Shenandoah_Valley_%C3%A2%C2%80%C2%93_November_1_2021.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the feasibility of developing a linear park alongside the railway. However, after interest grew among community organizations, the agency launched a second assessment to consider converting the corridor into a rail with trail. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid a decline in freight service, Norfolk Southern Corporation discontinued certain corridor sections in 1989. More than 30 years later, the Shenandoah Valley Battlefields Foundation and Norfolk Southern have negotiated a letter of intent to purchase the corridor for $23 million, </span><a href="https://www.nvdaily.com/nvdaily/svbf-charges-forward-on-rails-with-trail-plan/article_172f4bcb-a22f-508b-8667-d535145537e9.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Northern Virginia Daily</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reported in February. Foundation CEO Keven Walker and the Shenandoah Rail Corridor Coalition have argued that the corridor could be restored to include a restored rail line and a recreational trail. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Walker, who is familiar with the negotiations and plan to solicit shortline rail operators, said in an earlier phone call with the Mercury that the proposal was necessary to meet the federal common carrier responsibility requirements that are part of the agreement with Norfolk Southern.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said the process has yielded “multiple proposals” from rail operators, five of which are “very well known, very well respected, and have the means, the ability… and desire to operate the line.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposal to applicants made references that suggested the selected railroad operator would not be responsible for the repair costs. A projected amount for the repairs was not included, but in a </span><a href="https://www.shenandoahrailcorridor.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">May analysis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, initial repair and replacement costs were estimated to be more than $7 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Due to the current track conditions, this is assumed to be a phased approach expected to take a minimum of three years, and be primarily funded by a combination of state and federal funding for capital track rehab as well as parallel trail construction,” part of the proposal read.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposal also stated that &#8220;funding for major capital needs, including acquisition, bridge repairs, or major capital tie replacement programs are not assumed to be the responsibility of the operator.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Walker did not respond to follow-up questions about the language in the proposal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, rails-with-trails projects have </span><a href="https://railroads.dot.gov/elibrary/rails-trails-best-practices-and-lessons-learned-0" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">grown</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from 65 in 2002 to 434 in 2018.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don Hindman, project director for the Shenandoah Valley Rail Trail Exploratory Partnership, an 18-member group that supports converting the corridor into a trail, said the idea of reviving the rail line and also building a parallel trail could be expensive and instead suggested that the corridor should be a multi-use trail.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well, I&#8217;m incredulous that a nonprofit can try to contract a for-profit railroad company on property that they don&#8217;t own, and on property that they know at least the population here has plans for a rail trail,” Hindman said.</span></p>
<p><i data-stringify-type="italic"><strong>Correction</strong>: An earlier version of this story stated that $35 million to buy land for the proposed rail trail in the Shenandoah Valley was part of a $245 million Outdoor Recreation package, instead of the $54 million appropriated to the State Trails Office for the General Assembly&#8217;s five priority trails.</i></p>

(Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Virginia leaders tout improvements in public education, they are still working to address achievement gaps, facility improvements and the diverse needs of students and educators.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, recommendations in Project 2025 — a conservative plan for how the country should operate if a Republican wins the White House — if implemented, could derail those efforts. The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, has for years made recommendations found in the Project, and some were used in former President Donald Trump’s </span><a href="https://www.heritage.org/impact/trump-administration-embraces-heritage-foundation-policy-recommendations" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">first term</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The project includes conservative policy recommendations in various government areas, including defense, health and human services, and education. Some state leaders are concerned about the project’s proposed impact on school funding and resources. In contrast, others, including Gov. Glenn Youngkin, say the focus should be on what the presidential campaigns are proposing instead of Project 2025, which the governor characterized as a routine transition plan. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;At the end of the day, there are lots of transition plans that are written, and they&#8217;ve been written for decades,” said Youngkin during an Aug. 15 meeting with reporters. “I do believe that what would really benefit Virginians and Americans is if the media would actually report on what the candidates are talking about, what they will do, or candidates that have yet to tell anybody what they&#8217;re going to do, as opposed to supposing what they might do from some transition plan that&#8217;s been written for presidents, literally since Ronald Reagan.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The plan’s stance on public education </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jonathan Butcher, co-author of the education plan and senior research fellow with the Heritage Foundation, said nearly everything found in Project 2025 came from foundation research or is something it has advocated for years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The project’s </span><a href="https://static.project2025.org/2025_MandateForLeadership_CHAPTER-11.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">education plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> suggests eliminating the U.S. Department of Education, which is responsible for serving students, executing plans by the president and Congress, and advocating for parental choice in education and for civil rights.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Butcher said the agency “failed” to address its goals of closing the achievement gap and improving the outcomes of children from low-income areas, while the federal government is spending billions on schools, compared to 50 years ago. He also said reading and math scores have reached historic lows.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The authors of the plan also propose advancing school choice options, eliminating student loan forgiveness programs, eliminating a childcare program that focuses on children from low-income families, and rolling back regulations to protect transgender students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The education chapter states: “When power is exercised, it should empower students and families, not government. In our pluralistic society, families and students should be free to choose from a diverse set of school options and learning environments that best fit their needs.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposal recommends that the next president issue a series of executive orders requiring an unspecified group report on the “negative” influence of action civics on students’ understanding of history and civics and their disposition toward the United States. The report would also include an accounting of how federal programs and grants spread critical race theory and ideology centered on gender and diversity, equity, and inclusion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic legislators leading the General Assembly’s education committees have expressed concern about the proposed ideas. Several Republican legislators did not return The Mercury’s requests for comment on how Project 2025 could impact education in the state, or said that they weren’t well versed in the material. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, the House and Senate are controlled by Democrats who have prioritized funding teacher pay increases, and dedicating additional funds for disadvantaged students, higher education and providing more mental health resources.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats have dismissed Republican legislative efforts to ban certain books and allow parents to use state funding to cover the costs of educational opportunities outside of the public school system. But the two parties have worked together to improve special education and address child care needs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What we’re seeing in Project 2025 is really steering away from those critical core issues that we need to focus on in education, particularly around giving our students the skills that they need to succeed in a very complex world not just in the academic sense, but also socially and culturally,” said Senate Education and Health Committee Chair Ghazala Hashmi, D-Richmond. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In another section of Project 2025, the authors recommend eliminating the Head Start program, which has fostered educational and social development for children under 5 years of age across the country since 1965. In 2021, the Heritage Foundation </span><a href="https://www.heritage.org/education/commentary/preschool-funding-35-trillion-spending-bill-modeled-after-failed-head-start" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wrote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the program negatively affected children and that the federal government should sunset it in 2023. Virginia currently offers 52 Head Start and Early Head Start programs across four regions statewide, according to the </span><a href="https://headstartva.org/about-us/membership/membership-directory/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Head Start Association</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Butcher said Project 2025 and the foundation have also called for an end to the federal student lending program, stating that it&#8217;s not “Washington’s job to be the bank for every college student.” Instead, the plan calls for consolidating student loans, moving them to the U.S. Department of Treasury and opening an opportunity for private lenders to offer loans to students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Education Committee Chair Sam Rasoul, D-Roanoke, said the plan is “dangerous for business” and could negatively affect early education, increase college costs, and deprive disadvantaged students of resources.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;ve made record investments in public education, and just this year, we put an extra half billion dollars into early childhood slots because businesses were saying ‘Our workers need this,’” Rasoul said. “This is sadly a poorly concocted right-wing agenda to just prey on people, and to me, it clearly would be taking Virginia backward, and a lot of the good work that we&#8217;ve done in a bipartisan way would be unraveled.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hashmi said Republican members at the state and federal levels have long pushed ideas to dismantle the Department of Education and return control to the localities, which she said has likely adversely affected public education funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While a lot of these ideas are not necessarily new, they are really, really concerning in the ways in which Project 2025 spells out with great clarity the efforts to, in essence, destroy public education in the country.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She said the plan also attacks the teaching of American History in schools, and protections for transgender and nonbinary children.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The plan lists several principles for safeguarding parental, student, and civil rights. The authors stated that “enforcement of civil rights should be based on a proper understanding of those laws, rejecting gender ideology and critical race theory.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The authors added that federal officials should protect educators and students in jurisdictions under federal control from “racial discrimination by reinforcing the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and prohibiting compelled speech.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Butcher said while the education plan has no curricular recommendations based on gender, Project 2025 does follow the foundation’s </span><a href="https://www.heritage.org/model-legislation/the-given-name-act#:~:text=No%20public%20education%20employee%20or,a%20student's%20parents%20or%20guardians." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Given Name Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which states that “no public education employee or contractor shall use a name to address a student other than the name listed on a student’s birth certificate, or derivatives thereof, without the written permission of a student’s parents or guardians.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In higher education, Hashmi said there is also a growing argument from Republicans that higher learning is not essential and students should be diverted to trade programs instead. While workers are needed across the economic sector, she said, the proposed measure should not be implemented at the expense of higher education.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Governor keeps Project 2025 author on GMU Board of Visitors</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lindsey Burke, appointed by Youngkin to a four-year term on the Board of Visitors at George Mason University, is one of the authors of Project 2025 and director of the Center for Education Policy at the Heritage Foundation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some state leaders have criticized her role in the plan. Virginia House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, </span><a href="https://x.com/DonScott757/status/1820884230999830666" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">urged</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the governor in an Aug. 2 letter to remove Burke from her seat on the board, writing that “her extreme views are alarming and contradicts the commonwealth’s efforts.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin responded by writing that the commonwealth is “very fortunate” to have Burke on the board and said he has no intention of removing her. He said Burke was among his early higher education appointees because of her extensive preschool, K-12 and higher education policy background.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Removing her would not only do a tremendous disservice to George Mason University, but it would also undermine the spirit of Virginians from all walks of life coming together to improve their community and their commonwealth,” Youngkin wrote. </span></p>

(Klaus Vedfelt / Getty Images) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Board of Education on Wednesday approved the final touches on the state’s Every Student Succeeds Act plan, designed to address concerns with how schools were rated and student performance was measured to determine better how to direct state resources. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the special meeting in Richmond, the board approved Virginia’s ESSA plan, readiness weighting for different grade levels, and the overall school performance and support framework proposal as part of its package of accountability system changes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Compared to the existing system, the new regulations are splitting the state’s accreditation system into two: an accreditation system, to assess whether schools meet all requirements laid out in state laws and regulations; and an accountability system, to provide “timely and transparent information on student and school performance.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VDOE staff said this plan helps meet the board’s </span><a href="https://www.doe.virginia.gov/data-policy-funding/virginia-board-of-education/board-comprehensive-plan" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">goals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of setting and assisting students in meeting high expectations and supporting learning loss recovery by ensuring the school performance framework holds schools accountable for actual performance.</span></p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Va. education board adopts new school accreditation regulations&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/07/26/virginia-board-of-education-board-adopts-new-school-standards-of-accreditation-regulations/embed/#?secret=nqv27Yi67M#?secret=I6qUehRHfV" data-secret="I6qUehRHfV" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whether that is human resources or financial resources, whatever it is, targeted support is absolutely what this is,” said Board President Grace Creasey, an appointee of Gov. Glenn Youngkin, like most members of the board, following the group’s vote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Based on 2022-23 data, VDOE projects that 60.5% of schools are off track or would need intensive support according to the new accountability system standards, meaning they are “significantly” or “not meeting the state’s expectation for growth, achievement, and readiness.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Compared to the existing system, 11.5% of schools were found not fully accredited, with conditions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin, who directed the board to split the accountability system into two, suggested </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/05/19/youngkin-says-report-on-honesty-gap-points-to-decline-in-virginia-schools/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">earlier</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in his tenure that the decisions by previous administrations created an inaccurate picture of the state of K-12 public education in Virginia as identified by state and national assessments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Board member Mashea Ashton stated that the old system identified schools needing support and resources. Still, it didn&#8217;t give schools the data they needed to use their resources appropriately to target the students who needed it most such as English language learner students, who were excluded from that data.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chad Alderman, a co-consultant on the redesign, said the new accountability system will require more schools to examine a greater number of student groups than under the previous system. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And when more schools have to pay attention to more groups of students, that’s a good thing,” said Board member Andy Rotherham. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Board Vice President Bill Hansen added that “in so many ways, this is such a wonderful opportunity for us to change our system — bring accountability, bring transparency, bring innovation into this conversation.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data collection on assessments is underway, and full implementation of the plan will begin in the 2025-26 school year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some members of the public who spoke at Wednesday’s meeting were perplexed by the changes, after Virginia’s education system helped the commonwealth earn </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/11/virginia-americas-top-state-for-business-nations-best-schools-solid-infrastructure.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CNBC&#8217;s</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> rating as the top state for business in 2024. CNBC examined Virginia’s K-12 public schools and higher education institutions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The board also faced criticism regarding the accountability changes from speakers who claimed the changes will increase current inequities for students, require teachers to earn additional certifications to teach accelerated coursework in middle school mathematics, science, history and social science, and require more English learners to be considered in accountability calculations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">English learners are typically excluded because some children are learning English for the first time and may need more time to become proficient in the language. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The board said the new rules would reduce the number of semesters English learners are excluded from the calculations from 11 to three. Under the previous regulations, approximately 35,000 students were excluded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Do you know how many students cannot access advanced classes due a language disability, cost or availability?” asked parent Vanessa Hall. “We asked for equitable support for student success; instead, these measures punish schools with too many low income English language learning or disabled students.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hall added that the measures “throws them under the bus” and challenged the board to learn a language in three semesters in order to take science and history tests.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other speakers embraced the changes. Todd Truitt, a parent with children in Arlington schools, said he supported the newly adopted accountability framework, the middle school accelerated coursework readiness factor and changes to give school districts extra credit for students successfully taking Algebra before the eighth grade.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also pointed to a </span><a href="https://x.com/arneduncan/status/1780285163127382412" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">social media post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from former U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan, who supported updating the accountability framework and said that “Lying to parents about how their children are doing academically is definitely the easier path, but it is always the wrong path.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Truitt added that with the changes, Virginia will “finally live up to its responsibility” to students, parents and communities with “proper disclosure of academic performance data.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, the board successfully approved its newly designed Standards of Accreditation </span><a href="https://www.doe.virginia.gov/home/showpublisheddocument/55896/638569321084370000" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">regulations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, separating the existing system because information about the quality of schools or student learning outcomes wasn’t clearly delineated. In addition, the existing system used the process for accrediting schools as an accountability system to “foster” school improvement, instead of fostering the establishment of effective school-level educational programs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ESSA plan is subject to revision by the U.S. Department of Education. According to Todd Reid, a spokesman with VDOE, the federal agency will have 90 days to review and approve the revisions to the ESSA state plan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The changes they are making are consistent with components of other states’ plans that have been approved by USDOE previously,” Reid wrote in an email to the Mercury. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anne Holton, an appointee of Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam and former state secretary of education, said she disagreed that the new accountability system enhances transparency. She said the previous system was developed in 2018-2019.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She also said the development process of the new system ignored feedback from parents and members of other academic organizations, some who claimed that it was “wrongheaded” and “not fully flushed out.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I certainly can&#8217;t say that it&#8217;s perfect in every way, and I think there are some legitimate improvements that the new framework would make,” Holton said of the splitting of the system, “but I think that [the new system] is fundamentally flawed in a number of ways.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Holton said many people have said there is an issue with the “honesty gap” — the perceived difference between how students in Virginia fared on state assessments versus national assessments — but she believes the state should address the “support gap” for schools, which has spanned across different administrations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s what we need to do next,” Holton said.</span></p>

However, pass rates in other subjects are still behind results from the 2022-23 school year.</span></p>
	<div class="newsroomSidebarContainer ">
	<div class="newsroomSidebar">
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Statewide Pass Rates: 2018-19 vs. 2023-24</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><strong>Reading </strong>77.55 | 73.05</p>
<p><strong>Writing </strong>75.74 | 75.69</p>
<p><strong>History and Social Science </strong>79.99 | 65.2</p>
<p><strong>Mathematics </strong>82.05 | 70.95</p>
<p><strong>Science </strong>80.91 | 68.44</p>
</div>
	</div>
	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pass rates for grades 3 through 8 in reading, math, and science Standards of Learning tests all showed increases statewide by at least 1%. Writing showed the highest increase — 17 percentage points — while history and social science saw little gain, less than a percentage point.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Standards of Learning tests (SOLs) are used in Virginia to measure student learning and achievement in mathematics, reading, science, writing, and history and social science. Testing was suspended during 2020-21, when many schools around the state stopped in-person instruction in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2023-24, roughly 71% of Virginia students passed the math tests compared to 82% before the pandemic. On reading tests, 77.5% of students overall passed compared to 73% before the pandemic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The administration has regularly </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/03/29/virginia-explained-the-debate-over-student-expectations/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pinned</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the results of the learning loss on prior Boards of Education that changed the state’s standards of school accreditation and </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/03/29/virginia-explained-the-debate-over-student-expectations/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lowered the scores</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> required to be considered proficient in a certain subject, on student assessments. Democrats and previous board members have defended such decisions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Every single one of our data releases is a snapshot into a motion picture, and I&#8217;m pleased today that the</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">motion picture will, in fact, show that a ship that was off course has been turned around, and that we are seeing progress,” said Gov. Glenn Youngkin, “but we will also say today that we have a long way to go.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last September, the administration, troubled by the significant learning loss in reading and math, dedicated $418 million through the 2025-26 school year to the problem. The administration launched “high-intensity” tutoring programs and the “ALL IN VA” plan to focus on attendance, literacy and tutoring.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Statewide, schools hired additional tutors, extended instruction time before and after school, and focused on using the state’s free personalized supplemental math and reading resources.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The data showed a 16% reduction in students chronically absent in 2023-24 compared to the previous year. Students are chronically absent if they have missed at least 18 days of instruction for any reason, including excused and unexcused absences. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data shows pass rates statewide increased for economically disadvantaged students, English learners and students with disabilities over the previous two school years.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Mixed results between counties</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, school divisions have had mixed results with pass rates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fairfax County, the largest school division in Virginia, maintained similar pass rates in reading, math and science over the previous two school years, but experienced significant drops in writing, and history and social science by at least 20 percentage points each.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Craig County, one of the smaller school divisions in the commonwealth, saw increases in all five subject areas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The administration also praised school divisions such as Bath and Brunswick County Public Schools.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Between 2022-23 and 2023-24 school years, Bath saw a 19% increase in reading scores and Brunswick saw a 21% increase in grades 3-8 math pass rates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With schools facing the threat of All In VA funding ending in two years, Kristy Somerville-Midgette, superintendent of Brunswick County Public Schools, recommended superintendents work with their school boards, and local government and “be creative” with their funding and “look for opportunities to best serve students.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Levi Goren, a policy director at The Commonwealth Institute for Fiscal Analysis, said in a statement that the increases in pass rates are “great” and the success is likely connected to the recent increases in state support for students. Support for students facing “higher barriers,” such as students from low-income families, students with disabilities, and English language learners, is still needed, Goren added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While today’s scores were promising for some of these students, we know that one strong year of improvement cannot make up for the continued impact of years of insufficient funding,” Goren said. “Sustained increases in state funding would help lift test scores and other outcomes for students facing greater barriers.” </span></p>

Glenn Youngkin policies, Sept. 27, 2022. (Courtesy of Z2B Photography)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Walkouts over mask mandates, overhauled transgender policies and gun violence have disrupted some high schools in Virginia in recent years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now with public schools underway in a new year, educators are bracing for actions that could mimic spring protests on college campuses over the Israel-Hamas war.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At a principals’ conference earlier this summer, education leaders discussed how to prepare for the political climate in the upcoming year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Longtime educator Tim Healey in Prince William County told his colleagues at the conference in June that school climate and culture will become more important than ever in an age of political unrest, divided opinions, and student activism.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Healey said the upheaval students are learning now is completely different from what his colleagues learned regarding free speech from the 1969 Supreme Court case, Tinker vs Des Moines Independent Community School District, when students were disciplined for wearing armbands to protest against the Vietnam War. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The court </span><a href="https://perma.cc/8K9M-3MVG" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">decided</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in favor of the students who did not “materially or substantially interfere“ with the school&#8217;s operation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No longer is it just armbands in the Tinker case we all studied in school law, student activism has taken on a much more unique role in our schools, and how we keep our school together with this political unrest is really, really important,” said Healey at the annual Virginia Middle and High School Principals Conference and Exposition in Norfolk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Healey, who is principal at Colgan High School in Northern Virginia, said his students have walked out over the issues in the Middle East, racial injustice, school shootings and violence, transgender rights and abortion rights.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said the challenge for school officials and teachers is that students are learning about the history of the Middle East through short social media videos, some of which need to be fact checked. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">He stressed that school officials need to facilitate students’ free speech, saying it’s important to listen, validate students and teach them how to disagree appropriately.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I think we see a lot of models around of people yelling and screaming at each other or folding their arms, and [saying] ‘because you disagree with me, you&#8217;re the worst person in the world;’ and so we in our history classes and our leadership classes, we are deliberate about teaching our kids how to disagree with each other and have different opinions,&#8221; he said.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Healey said expanding beyond the traditional sports teams and clubs could also help to foster a positive culture and climate in schools. For example, Healey said his school boosts student spirit around musicals and multicultural events. At Colgan&#8217;s Multicultural Spirit Week, Colgan students wear the colors of their native flag and jerseys from their favorite sports team. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Education Committee Chair Sam Rasoul, D-Roanoke, who recently attended Roanoke City Public Schools </span><a href="https://www.wdbj7.com/2024/08/15/convocation-kicks-off-roanoke-city-school-year/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">annual kickoff</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the school year, told the Mercury that one of his takeaways from the event is that a way teachers can help students learn is through their own interests. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What better way to channel their passion, their interest into better understanding civics, history, constitutional rights amongst other things than to take these interests, take these passions and embrace them and channel them,” Rasoul said. “My best advice is to use this as an experiential moment for those students who genuinely are concerned and would like to have their voice heard.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the collegiate level, Virginia’s colleges and universities are a bit more experienced in handling student activism. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The State Council of Higher Education for Virginia, the coordinating body for the state’s colleges and universities, holds an annual training and discussion session because of increased campus protests in recent years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s legislature formed a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/14/virginia-lawmakers-to-study-campus-safety-policies-after-series-of-protests/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">select committee</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on maintaining campus safety and allowing students to exercise their First Amendment rights, after more than 125 arrests at four of Virginia’s college campuses were recorded in May.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While there are some differences between K-12 and higher education, Senate Education and Health Committee Chair Ghazala Hashmi, D-Richmond, said students, teachers, and administrators must know their rights and limitations when it comes to demonstrating, and for schools to have clear guidelines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Essential to this is how we teach our students the parameters of debate, discussion, dissent from each other,” Hashmi said to the Mercury. “That&#8217;s part of our responsibility as we&#8217;re teaching civic-minded individuals and to give them the tools and the resources to engage in discussion, but to do it in a respectful way, in a nonviolent way.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In February, the student, represented by the American Civil Liberties Union of Virginia and the law firm Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP, filed a lawsuit claiming the school division violated Title IX and the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ACLU stated that the ruling found that the school board “likely violated” both when it banned the Hanover student from the tennis team.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This order is a reminder to school boards that protecting transgender young people is part of protecting girls’ sports,” said legal director Eden Heilman, in a statement. “And it’s a flashing red light to any Virginia school board that might be tempted to think that VDOE’s anti-trans model policies give it license to abuse its power. As the court reminded Hanover County School Board in its ruling, no state policies can shield Virginia schools from accountability for violating federal law.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration overhauled the </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/09/12/despite-law-few-virginia-school-districts-adopt-state-model-transgender-policies/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2021</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> model policies for transgender and nonbinary students designed under former Gov. Ralph Northam to protect the privacy and rights of such students. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In February, ACLU and Freshfields filed three lawsuits challenging the Virginia Department of Education on the policies that some schools have adopted. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In opposition to a student’s right to decide who finds out about their gender status out of fear of being bullied or harassed, the governor sided with parents’ rights, directing the administration to overhaul the policies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The administration </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/09/16/youngkin-administration-overhauls-virginia-transgender-student-policies/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">revised</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the policies to require parental approval for any changes to students’ “names, nicknames, and/or pronouns,” direct schools to keep parents “informed about their children’s well-being” and require that student participation in activities and athletics and use of bathrooms be based on sex, “except to the extent that federal law otherwise requires.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Freshfields and ACLU filed the Hanover case in two courts, the Eastern District of Virginia and the Hanover County Circuit Court. The third lawsuit involving a York County student was </span><a href="https://www.wtkr.com/news/in-the-community/historic-triangle/york-county-court-dismisses-lawsuit-challenging-virginias-transgender-student-policies" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">dismissed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in July. That suit claimed that at least one teacher had refused to address the student by her correct first name.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The draft defines “cell phone-free” education as “bell-to-bell,” meaning phones should be turned off and stored away from the first school bell until dismissal. This includes lunchtime and breaks between class periods. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On July 9, Gov. Glenn Youngkin issued Executive Order 33, directing his administration to create guidelines to limit students’ time in front of “addictive” cell phones and eliminate “clear distractions” in the classroom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The education department said over 600 community members, parents, teachers and school officials attended public events to provide input on the guidelines as well as other community events to understand concerns about cell phones and personal electronic devices. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The extensive input we received from Virginians was clear and direct,” said Superintendent of Public Instruction Lisa Coons. “They asked for cell phones and personal electronic communication devices to be removed from our children’s public schools during the school day at every level — elementary, middle and high school. By refocusing our students’ attention back into learning and away from their phones and social media, all our children will have a better opportunity to learn and succeed academically.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Studies have shown that students use cell phones to browse the internet and social media apps, and message people during instructional time. Students have also used the devices to record events at schools and post them on various platforms. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The draft guidance includes age-appropriate cell phone restrictions in Virginia’s elementary and secondary public schools.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the draft, if a parent determines an elementary student needs to bring a cell phone or personal electronic communication device to school, it must be stored, off, and away from the student during the school day. Students should not use cell phones in the school building or on the school grounds before or after school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In middle and high school, students should not have a readily available cell phone or personal electronic communication device during the bell-to-bell school day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Middle schools should establish local policies that determine cell phone and personal electronic communication device use within the school building or on school grounds outside of bell-to-bell, including before and after school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cell phones and personal electronic communication devices may be used on a high school campus before or after school.</span></p>
<p>Exemptions will be permitted for students with disabilities and EL students with a documented language barrier.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.doe.virginia.gov/programs-services/school-operations-support-services/cell-phone-free-education-in-virginia-k-12-public-schools" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Feedback</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the draft guidelines closes Sept. 15. School boards must adopt the final guidance by Jan. 1. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of Virginia’s school boards have already banned or restricted cell phone use in schools.</span></p>

(Courtesy of Cassandra Loper/Capital News Service)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most Virginians agree that public K-12 schools should teach the history of race, but fewer say it should be required in colleges and universities, according to a </span><a href="https://news.vcu.edu/article/2024/08/75-of-virginians-agree-that-the-history-of-race-should-be-taught-in-k-12-schools" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">poll</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> conducted by the L. Douglas Wilder School of Government and Public Affairs at Virginia Commonwealth University.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The poll found that 75% of respondents supported such a curriculum for K-12, the remaining 15% disagreed. But less than half of Virginians, or 49%, said those lessons should be required in postsecondary education in the commonwealth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The study indicated that Democrats and independents were more likely to support a college requirement, while 6 in 10 Republicans polled disagreed. Wilder School used telephone interviews from 809 Virginians, ages 18 or older, between June 24 and July 3. The margin of error is plus or minus 4.81 percentage points.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since 2022, Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration has been examining and revising educational content related to race and equity, which the governor branded “divisive” in his </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/governor-of-virginia/pdf/74---eo/74---eo/EO-1---ENDING-THE-USE-OF-INHERENTLY-DIVISIVE-CONCEPTS,-INCLUDING-CRITICAL-RACE-THEORY,-AND-RESTORING-EXCELLEN.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">first executive order</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last spring, the governor directed his administration to review VCU’s racial literacy syllabi and the diversity-themed coursework from George Mason University.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VCU students sought to make racial literacy general education a requirement for graduation, but the university’s Board of Visitors, which is appointed by the governor, </span><a href="https://blogs.vcu.edu/provost/2024/05/10/provost-statement-on-the-board-of-visitors-decision-regarding-vcus-racial-literacy-requirement/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">killed it</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in May.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While VCU still offers racial literacy classes to VCU students, the graduating students walked out of the commencement address given by the governor the day after the board’s decision. George Mason delayed its courses until the 2025-26 school year.</span></p>
<p><b>Rao still remains health system chair</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the release of the poll data, the Wilder School was criticized by the university for errors it </span><a href="https://news.vcu.edu/article/2024/08/vcu-statement-about-the-commonwealth-poll" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">identified</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the release accompanying the poll, specifically that the General Assembly recommended VCU President Michael Rao step down as chair of the VCU Health System Board of Directors and that Rao resigned from the board after an unsuccessful development project costing the university millions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rao remains the chair, VCU stated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Unfortunately, this is the </span><a href="https://news.vcu.edu/article/2024/01/vcu-statement-about-the-commonwealth-poll" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">second time in 2024</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> former Gov. Wilder’s personal agenda has skewed polls regarding VCU and President Rao,” the university wrote. “His continued bias runs the risk of tarnishing the Wilder School’s otherwise strong reputation. VCU is proud of the Wilder School dean, leadership and its dedicated and award-winning faculty, staff and students. They deserve better from their namesake.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rao </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/06/vcu-officials-reviewing-56m-payment-to-richmond-for-failed-development-project-jlarc-suggestions/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">told lawmakers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in June that plans to develop a medical tower on the site of Richmond’s former Public Safety Building at Clay and 10th streets ended due to concerns over the unsuitable site conditions and increased construction costs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VCU officials are still reviewing an agreement to pay the city of Richmond approximately $2.5 million annually in lieu of taxes for a development that was never built. The school paid the city, investors and developers nearly $80 million to exit the project. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Wilder School’s study indicated that 84% of Virginians think Rao should provide a public accounting of where VCU spent the money, and 53% said Rao shouldn’t receive his comprehensive salary.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a Richmond Times-Dispatch </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/vcus-rao-ranks-high-on-list-of-highest-paid-university-presidents/article_dc7326fe-2b50-575d-997a-f62e2fd6dce3.html#:~:text=Rao%27s%20pay%20in%20his%20first,for%20last%20year%20as%20%24875%2C284" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2018, Rao’s compensation was $875,284.</span></p>

Glenn Youngkin at the General Assembly Building in Richmond. (Nathaniel Cline/VIrginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s general revenue surplus reached $1.2 billion in fiscal year 2024, Gov. Glenn Youngkin </span><a href="https://hac.virginia.gov/Committee/files/2024/8-14-24/Review%20of%20FY%2024%20Revenues%208-14-24.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to lawmakers in Richmond on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin said the impact results from job growth, economic development wins, regulatory streamlining, crime reduction, and “amazing” progress in education backed up by a legislative “game plan” that he said works. Last month, Virginia was </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/11/virginia-americas-top-state-for-business-nations-best-schools-solid-infrastructure.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">named</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the country’s best state to do business by CNBC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Going forward, we must continue to compete,” Youngkin said. “At the core, we have resisted the false narrative of ‘either-or,’ and we have embraced ‘both-and.’ Importantly, our success has not just enabled both tax relief and record investment in critical areas, our success is the result of, driven by, fueled by both tax relief and record investments.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The revenues will support accelerated improvements on the Interstate 81 Corridor, reduce pollutant discharge in Virginia’s rivers, and fund the Virginia Military Survivors &amp; Dependents Education Program (VMSDEP).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the spring, lawmakers repealed a budget provision that would have required family members of disabled veterans seeking a college education to first complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), among other new eligibility requirements. The legislature also allocated $90 million in additional funding from the state’s surplus in addition to the $40 million included in the two-year budget for the tuition beneficiary program. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Joint Legislative Audit Review Commission and the VMSDEP task force are reviewing the tuition benefit program. JLARC is expected to present its findings next month. Youngkin did not provide a date for when the task force would provide its recommendations.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We will always honor the sacrifices of our military heroes, our Gold Star families, first responders and their families,” Youngkin said, “and I am proud that we were able to fully fund this program.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin said that with a $1.2 billion surplus, there are a “variety of good ideas” on how to provide tax relief. The governor has proposed reducing tax rates on all Virginians and suggested finding a solution to reduce or eliminate the car tax and tax burdens on companies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“All of these should be opportunities for us to reduce tax burdens on Virginians, and I will go through the next few months to put together a formal proposal,” he said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers redirected approximately $650 million each year and added around $180 million yearly to develop the at-risk program. Most localities have opted into the program, which helps to provide sufficient funding for schools to serve low-income students in Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data from the Department of Education shows that at-risk students comprised approximately 43% of Virginia’s total enrollment last year.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Underfunded schools, under-resourced students</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state investment comes after localities </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/11/20/after-a-state-study-found-virginia-is-underfunding-schools-local-governments-want-action/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">urged</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> lawmakers to address Virginia’s historical underfunding of its school divisions. This was backed by a </span><a href="https://jlarc.virginia.gov/pdfs/reports/Rpt575.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">July 2023 study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission that </span><a href="https://jlarc.virginia.gov/pdfs/reports/Rpt575.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">found</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Virginia schools receive 14% less state funding than the 50-state average, roughly $1,900 less per student.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Any additional money that the state provides to local governments to the local school divisions to help restore the balance in the funding relationship to what it should be based on the JLARC [recommendations] is greatly appreciated and is a good first step,” said Jeremy Bennett, director of intergovernmental affairs for the Virginia Association of Counties.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bennett said the report shows that local governments and school divisions are “paying billions more than they&#8217;re required to by the state because we recognize that the cost of providing quality education is higher than what is recognized on the state&#8217;s current funding formula.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=HB825" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rae Cousins</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, D-Richmond, who carried unsuccessful at-risk add-on legislation based on JLARC’s recommendations, said changes to the program will help support at-risk students with potentially more one-on-one instructional time, more nutritional school meals, and before-and after-school programs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our schools just didn&#8217;t have the resources that those [at-risk] students needed to be successful,” Cousins said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Local leaders said funding formulas that underestimated the needs of school divisions and a cap on the number of support positions the state would fund enacted amid the Great Recession in 2007 have contributed to the lack of funding. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/10/04/virginia-budget-puts-millions-toward-support-staff-as-schools-struggle-to-find-teachers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">partially lifted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the cap last summer by investing $152 million in school support positions, but funding levels were never restored.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Recommended changes for the at-risk program</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After finding the previous add-on program for at-risk students relied on outdated free lunch data, JLARC </span><a href="https://jlarc.virginia.gov/pdfs/summary/Rpt575Rec.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recommended</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> changing the state code and language in the Appropriation Act to designate the at-risk add-on program as a Standards of Quality funding program, which would signify that the funding is  “essential for providing Virginia K–12 students with a quality education.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Researchers also recommended changes to allow for the federally-approved Identified Student Percentage (ISP) measure to calculate funding for all at-risk programs that relied on outdated free lunch estimates. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the two-year budget lawmakers adopted in May, funding would be allocated based on each school division’s weighted ISP. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of the new program, 60% of funding would be distributed to divisions using a flat per-student rate, and 40% would be distributed using a variable rate based on the concentration of poverty in each school division.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">School divisions that opt into the program will receive a minimum 11% basic aid add-on per estimated at-risk student and an additional add-on to basic aid varying between 0% and 37%, depending on the number of at-risk students relative to other school divisions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB609" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lashrecse Aird</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, D-Petersburg, carried legislation that would have added at-risk add-on funding to the Standards of Quality, as well as updated the funding formula to “ensure that money designated for our highest-need students doesn’t go unused,” in a statement to the Mercury.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the legislation was incorporated into an </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB105" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">unsuccessful bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> vetoed by the governor after the legislature failed to accept his recommendations. If the bill had been successful, the program would have been a mandatory part of the Standards of Quality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Joint Subcommittee to Study Elementary and Secondary Education Funding, which will be meeting for the first time on Sept. 16, was created to provide direction and oversight of Standards of Quality funding cost policies and make recommendations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Local governments that opt into the at-risk add on program are responsible for providing a local match to receive state funding.</span></p>

Parker Michels-Boyce for The Virginia Mercury</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Lottery announced Wednesday that $934 million in fiscal year 2024 sales profits will benefit K-12 public education, a record amount. The total amount it collected for the fiscal year that ended June 30 was more than $5.5 billion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Lottery’s total proceeds to public education stands at $13.6 billion, and the agency continues Virginia’s year-over-year sales increases since the pandemic. Last year, the Virginia Lottery earned $867.4 million from lottery sales, an increase from $779.6 million in 2022.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Over the course of my administration, we have been able to achieve record funding for K-12 education, allowing for increased opportunities in the classroom,&#8221; said Gov. Glenn Youngkin in a statement on Wednesday. “I am so thrilled these record profits will help provide the necessary support and resources for Virginia&#8217;s students,” the governor said, noting that about 10% of the state’s k-12 education budget stems from Virginia Lottery profits. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin, along with Secretary of Education Aimee Guidera, said the lottery helps to support various aspects of Virginia’s K-12 education, including special education, career and technical learning, and early reading intervention. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guidera thanked lottery employees and expressed that their work helps set students up for success outside the classroom. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is preparing every single graduate of our K-12 schools to be ready for life, and that means preparing them to be productive members of our economy, to be informed and engaged citizens in our democracy, and to be engaged, thoughtful and good neighbors in our communities,” Guidera said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The announcement of the lottery’s sizable profits comes after some convenience stores </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/04/15/convenience-stores-shut-down-virginia-lottery-sales-in-protest-for-skill-games/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">shut down</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Virginia Lottery sales briefly in April in protest to the ban on skill games, which are still illegal in the state after a lengthy campaign to lift the ban and protracted deliberation in the legislature.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Lottery Director Khalid Reede Jones said in the past fiscal year, the agency paid $4.2 billion in prizes to lottery participants, and $142 million to retail partners, while doing so with an expense ratio of 3.8%. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his remarks to the governor, Jones said “the only thing I can promise is that we are endeavoring to make fiscal year 2025 even bigger, better and greater than this year.”</span></p>

Data is still being collected for VMSDEP costs for the 2023-24 school year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The program was established nearly 95 years ago to provide college tuition waivers to the spouses or children of permanently disabled military veterans or those killed in action.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amy Griffin, wife of the late Norfolk firefighter Chris Griffin, said her husband’s sacrifice was a big loss for the family and challenged their financial stability. However, the tuition program changed their son’s life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I was told that school would be one less thing that we had to be worried about and one less thing I had to try and plan for,” said mother Amy Griffin, during a June 28 Senate Select Committee Workgroup. “That was such a relief to not have to worry about that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chuck Zingler, commissioner of the Virginia Department of Veterans Services, added “people are definitely becoming more aware of the program” and are “able to enjoy the benefit of [an] education earned by deaths and wounds.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although military families say VMSDEP greatly benefits them, the rising costs for the state&#8217;s institutions of higher learning is a continuing concern for some lawmakers. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The cost to colleges</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to SCHEV’s figures, George Mason, Virginia Commonwealth and Old Dominion Universities have experienced the most significant cost impacts from the program year over year since 2019, compared to other schools. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mike Porter, a spokesman for VCU, said the program&#8217;s cost has impacted the university’s ability to invest in essential areas such as academic programs, student experiences, and research initiatives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data shows that VCU lost more than $11 million due to the program during the 2022-23 school year, the most in a single year compared to other institutions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Although VMSDEP is a waiver program, there are real costs associated with delivering a comprehensive educational experience and support services to these students while receiving no revenue to support those costs,” said Porter. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_36388" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:1024px;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-36388 size-large" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/VCU_sign_CNS-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/VCU_sign_CNS-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/VCU_sign_CNS-300x225.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/VCU_sign_CNS-768x576.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/VCU_sign_CNS-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/VCU_sign_CNS-2048x1536.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  The VCU sign located at Shafer Street.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He added that VCU has periodically raised tuition and fees to cover all new costs, though they can’t be pinned solely on the tuition waiver program.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While increases have not been directly attributed to VMSDEP, the program&#8217;s costs are part of the overall financial picture that necessitates tuition hikes,” he said. “Without state support, VCU would need to increase tuition by 3.6% to cover the full cost of the VMSDEP waiver.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data shows that Old Dominion had the largest increase in VMSDEP waiver participation, jumping from 53 participants in 2018-19 to 735 in 2022-23. VCU had 538 participants in 2022-23, while George Mason had 514 and Virginia Tech enrolled 477.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kelsey Kendall, a spokeswoman from Old Dominion, said in an email that the program has expanded access to the university for a number of students. As a result, she said, Old Dominion has had to realign internal resources to cover the growing expense, which includes reallocating funds to student services from non-student service areas, and making changes to student fees and tuition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While these adjustments did help, it did not fully cover the waivers, although needed services were provided to support students,” Kendall said in a statement. “With the new law now providing funds for VMSDEP waivers, the university looks forward to continuing to serve our military students and further investing in our long-standing commitment to access and excellence.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the state’s figures, the program recorded 6,344 waiver recipients last school year; in contrast,the program provided 1,387 waivers during the 2018-19 school year. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">How the program works</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Department of Veterans Services certifies applicants’ eligibility for the Virginia Military Survivors and Dependents Education Program. SCHEV and Virginia’s public colleges and universities apply the program’s financial aid benefits including stipends, and tuition and fee waivers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Benefits are available for up to eight semesters, the equivalent of four academic years,” according to the Department’s website.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The program saw significant legislative changes that expanded its benefits, starting in the late 1970s, according to a May 28 House Appropriations Committee </span><a href="https://www.dvs.virginia.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/House-Approprations-Committee-Staff-Higher-Education-Update-2024-5-28.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Some of the changes included shifting the benefit from appropriation-based to a waiver format and creating a stipend benefit for room, board, and books.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2019, the legislature also passed a </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+sum+SB1173" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">measure</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> expanding tuition waivers to applicants of a veteran with at least a 90% permanent and service-related disability.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Program changes prompted pushback, repeal</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Debates about the program’s impact dominated the spring, after advocates urged Virginia lawmakers to repeal a budget provision that would have required family members of disabled veterans seeking a college education to first complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), among other new eligibility requirements.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers responded by repealing the changes last month and allocating $90 million in additional funding from the state’s surplus in addition to the $40 million included in the two year budget. However, the legislature’s actions left lingering questions about the program&#8217;s future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In June, lawmakers </span><a href="https://jlarc.virginia.gov/pdfs/resolutions/2024%20Joint%20JLARC%20VMSDEP%20Request%20Letter.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">directed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> JLARC to study the program to “ensure the long-term sustainability of the program and evaluate all aspects of eligibility criteria, program parameters, and impact on Virginia’s higher education institutions and tuition paying students.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The letter also directs JLARC to provide recommendations on legislative action and budget modifications that could improve the stability and strength of the program and ensure its long-term viability.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">JLARC’s findings are due to the governor and chairs of the House Appropriations and Senate Finance and Appropriations Committees by Sept. 1. Gov. Glenn Youngkin </span>also <a class="c-link" href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/governor-of-virginia/pdf/ed/ED-7---Addressing-Changes-to-the-Virginia-Military-Survivors-and-Dependents-Education-Program.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/governor-of-virginia/pdf/ed/ED-7---Addressing-Changes-to-the-Virginia-Military-Survivors-and-Dependents-Education-Program.pdf" data-sk="tooltip_parent">convened</a> a task force to study the program.</p>
<p><em>Editor&#8217;s note: This story has been updated to reflect that a task force was formed to study the tuition benefit program.</em></p>

(Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s school bus driver vacancy rate has decreased by five percent over the past three school years, according to the Virginia Department of Education. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the legislature amended its reporting requirements, the agency started collecting bus driver vacancy data two years ago. Factors like pay and recruitment challenges, and drivers leaving for the private sector, led to the shortage of drivers.</span></p>
<p><iframe id="datawrapper-chart-hLcn8" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" title="Virginia Bus Driver Vacancy Rate" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/hLcn8/1/" height="272" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" aria-label="Multiple Donuts" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
</script></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, schools were closed to in-person leaving some drivers to find other ways to meet the increased cost of services and goods due to inflation that burdened families in Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the 2021-22 school year, Virginia recorded a vacancy rate of full- and part-time drivers at 16% in 2021-22. The rate decreased to 11% in 2022-23 and last year to 10%. Data on the upcoming school year 's driver vacancy rates will not be available until the fall.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s good news,” said Scott Brabrand, the executive director of the Virginia Association of School Superintendents. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said superintendents around the commonwealth have been working to address the shortage by offering bonuses and increasing bus driver salaries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schools in Virginia found other unique ways of transporting students amid the bus driver shortage, such as altering routes, placing more students on buses, and using car and van services. Some communities created programs to promote </span><a href="https://news.virginia.edu/content/shortage-bus-drivers-uva-students-walk-children-school" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">walking</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to school. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state legislature has also attempted to address the shortage in recent years. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, the General Assembly agreed to legislation carried by Del. </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB1630" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carrie Coyner</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, R-Chesterfield, and Sen.</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+SB1479" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Louise Lucas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, D-Portsmouth, to shorten the time period during which retired drivers with at least 25 years of service could return to work without jeopardizing their pension benefits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In another measure, Sen. </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB622" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Todd Pillion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, R-Abington, and Del. </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB687" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Israel O’Quinn</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, R-Washington, raised awareness of the retirement benefits for teachers who drive buses. Following the session earlier this year, the Virginia Retirement System clarified that qualifying teachers who drive buses would receive compensation when they retire.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the agency’s </span><a href="https://employers.varetire.org/media/shared/pdf/er-manual-enroll-and-maintain-employees.pdf#page20" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">employer manual</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, VRS-participating school divisions may combine the job duties of two positions under one contract as long as one of the positions is a covered position.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is a huge benefit to teachers,” Washington County Public Schools Superintendent Keith Perrigan said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Experts have said that transportation is one key to keeping children in school, limiting a high number of absences, and addressing the learning loss exacerbated during the pandemic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perrigan, who serves on the state’s </span><a href="https://www.doe.virginia.gov/teaching-learning-assessment/all-in-va/attendance-matters/chronic-absenteeism-task-force" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">task force</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to address absences, said a few school divisions he represents in the Coalition of Small and Rural Schools of Virginia will start the school year fully staffed with drivers, unlike previous years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Much of rural Virginia, especially Southwest Virginia, is seeing progress in this area. Although we still have some work to do, we are breathing a little easier with the bus driver shortage,” Perrigan said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Perrigan, seven teachers in Washington County will split their time teaching and driving students, and more than 20 will do the same in Buchanan County. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, Rappahannock County faced a shortage of drivers. However, according to Shannon Grimsley, superintendent of Rappahannock schools, the school division is fully staffed with drivers and has substitute drivers available.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This comes after Grimsley became a part-time school bus driver to alleviate transportation barriers for students and encourage others to become drivers. The division's focus now is covering the costs of replacing aging buses, another transportation challenge some districts face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are creatively working with the county government on our bus replacement schedule to ensure our fleet is in proper order and meeting all guidelines for optimum operability,” Grimsley said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grimsely said the costs of buses have significantly increased and the impact on rural school districts with limited state funding can be a challenge. She said the costs of buses in her district have increased by more than 63% over the past five years.</span></p>

(Stock photo by Vladimir Vladimirov/Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liberty University, a private institution in Lynchburg, is facing </span><a href="https://www.acluva.org/en/cases/zinski-v-liberty-university" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a lawsuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for allegedly firing an employee after she disclosed her identity as a trans woman.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Monday, the American Civil Liberties Union of Virginia announced that it and the law firm Butler Curwood filed the lawsuit on behalf of Ellenor Zinski, who they claim was fired in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex and national origin.</span></p>
<p>Liberty University did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No one should be fired because of who they are — but Liberty University made it clear that’s exactly why it fired Ellenor,” said Wyatt Rolla, the ACLU of Virginia’s senior transgender rights attorney, in a statement. “Workplace discrimination against transgender people is against the law, and it’s especially telling that Liberty University sees a practicing Christian’s gender identity as so antithetical to its mission that it was willing to flout the law in order to cast out one of its own.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the ACLU, Zinski was hired to work at Liberty’s IT Helpdesk last year and received a positive review from her supervisor. Three months after being hired, her supervisor told Zinski that her performance was above average and she was “on the path to success.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, things started to change after she notified the university’s Human Resources Department that she identifies as a trans woman and planned to change her name legally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ACLU said Zinski had not received a response for over a month. She later met with leaders from Human Resources and IT.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Officials read a termination notice aloud, citing “denying biological and chromosomal sex assigned at birth” as the basis for her termination, stating a conflict with Liberty’s Doctrinal Statement that names “denial of birth sex by self-identification with a different gender” as a “sinful act prohibited by God.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the ACLU, Ellenor is a devout Christian who is committed to Liberty’s mission of “preaching Christ.” She is an active member of her local church, Trinity Episcopal, whose pastor fully supported her transition, even providing gender-affirming clothing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The first time anyone ever told me God made me this way was at Trinity Episcopal Church,” said Ellenor Zinski. “Christianity has been so weaponized against the LGBTQ community, but there doesn’t need to be a conflict: You can be transgender and Christian. I am.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the ACLU, Zinski is seeking declaratory relief that Liberty University’s policy violates Title VII and compensatory and punitive damages.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two said they were “disappointed” after the school system voted to rebrand schools with Confederate names on May 10, four years after the district stripped the names. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The students are now taking responsibility for representing a small population of Black students in a Virginia NAACP-backed </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/12/virginia-naacp-sues-shenandoah-school-board-after-district-restored-confederate-names/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lawsuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> against their school board for allegedly “reaffirming discrimination” after voting to revert Mountain View High School back to Stonewall Jackson, and Honey Run Elementary School to Ashby-Lee after Confederate Gens. Turner Ashby and Robert E. Lee. The Confederate names were removed in 2020.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to recent data from the Virginia Department of Education, the two students represent 2.9% of Black students in Shenandoah County Public Schools.White students make up 73% of the student population, Hispanic students represent 17% and the remainder being Asian, Indigenous and Pacific Island students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Nobody really cared about how this mentally affects students, makes them feel unsafe and unwanted in their learning environment and that’s something that should have never been the case,” said student Briana Brown, who attends Massanutten Regional Governor’s School, based at Mountain View High School.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brown, one of the rising seniors on the lawsuit, said some of her peers felt hopeless during the renaming process and after the decision. She said she’s pleased that she’s gained support following her decision to speak out against the board’s decision.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Between the 1950s and 1960s, local leaders in Shenandoah County named public schools after Confederate leaders. Some did it in protest of the U.S. Supreme Court’s 1954 decision to desegregate schools. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A.D. Carter V, the son of a government teacher and a student plaintiff in the lawsuit, said at the announcement of the lawsuit in June that history upsets him. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The reason they had done that was that they were trying to disincentivize Black people from attending that high school … and so they had used it specifically as a scare tactic to try and keep them out,” Carter said.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_39448" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:1024px;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-39448" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_2509-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_2509-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_2509-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_2509-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_2509-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_2509-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Briana Brown and AD Carter speaking in front of the Shenandoah County Circuit Court on June 11, 2024 (Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attorneys from Guynn Waddell representing the school board are requesting the court dismiss the case because the complaint fails to prove that any student has been coerced into supporting the board’s decision against their will or harmed for refusing to do so.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The only alleged harm is emotional and psychological, or speculative and potential,” the attorneys wrote. “The claims are simply not ripe for adjudication because no student has alleged that they suffered actual harm. Hurt feelings will not suffice.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia NAACP alleges in the suit that the school board violated the U.S. Constitution, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and the Equal Educational Opportunity Act. The plaintiffs seek to remove the Confederate names, mascots and vestiges, and to prevent any future school naming involving Confederate leaders or references to the Confederacy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some Virginians believe the Confederacy represents a heritage of Southerners’ courage against the federal Union while fighting for the rights of southern states. Others, like the students and lawsuit’s plaintiffs, view the Confederacy as defenders of slavery and a foundational part of America’s history of racism.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In recent years, Virginians have been working to address the commonwealth’s history of white supremacist ideology and historical practices of creating unfair advantages for white people by implementing policy changes and hosting community discussions on these topics. Signs, symbols and statutes of the Confederacy have also been renamed or removed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Immediately following the board’s decision to reverse the school names, the monikers were changed with the help of the donations collected by the Coalition for Better Schools.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mike Schiebe, a spokesperson for the group, said approximately $70,000 in private donations have been spent to help with name-changing expenses, compared to the approximately $300,000 in 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former board members said the 2020 costs were covered by $135,000 from unused salary accounts for frozen positions, and $133,284 from residual Shenandoah Valley Regional Program for Special Education tuition. </span><a href="https://www.shenandoahforward.org/about" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shenandoah Forward</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which was founded by community members, raised the remaining amount, under $40,000.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students will be starting school in Shenandoah County on August 13.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We stand with our clients as they’re about to experience having to walk into the doors again of these schools with these Confederate names and certainly understand that this presents a real challenge for them,” said Kaitlin Banner, deputy legal director for the Washington Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_38925" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:1024px;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-38925" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_2528-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_2528-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_2528-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_2528-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_2528-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_2528-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  A view from outside Stonewall Jackson High School in Shenandoah County. (Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attorneys from the Washington Lawyers’ Committee and Covington &amp; Burling LLP are representing the plaintiffs — the NAACP and five current students in Shenandoah County Public Schools including Brown and Carter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before the lawsuit, Virginia NAACP President Cozy Bailey Bailey urged the school board to oppose renaming the schools after Confederate leaders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Memorializing that historical reality by naming your public schools after Confederate military leaders and sympathizers subverts part of your district’s mission that claims that ‘all members of the learning community are valued and respected,’” Bailey wrote in a May 8 letter. “Students must believe they are valued and protected in order to thrive.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of the school board members did not directly comment on the lawsuit during a June 19 business meeting. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Board Member Gloria E. Carlineo </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3CyHdWszvo&amp;list=PLfMoFJbmXuzWdX7OD5QZst4XC2SsXtgMs&amp;index=4" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">defended</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> division staff for taking “nasty” and “harassing” calls following the board’s decision to put the Confederate school names back in place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are fully committed to fighting this lawsuit to the fullest extent of the law and we are confident that the whole truth will come out,” Carlineo said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Banner said the court is considering a hearing between September and early October.</span></p>

These regulations simplify how schools are rated and allow the state to separate accountability from accreditation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A final vote on the accountability system is expected at next month’s board meeting. The accountability system includes Virginia’s Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) plan, readiness indicators and weighting. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;m really excited for what this new system provides for our students, for our parents, for our families, for our teachers [and] for our school divisions across the state,” said Board President Grace Creasey, who was appointed by Gov. Glenn Youngkin. “I think it absolutely contributes to increasing transparency and understanding the outcomes that our students are achieving, and how well our schools are ensuring students are having those positive outcomes for life beyond our schools.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under Gov. Youngkin’s direction, the board was tasked last year with separating the existing system because information about the quality of schools or student learning outcomes wasn’t clearly delineated, the repeal states. In addition, the existing system used the process for accrediting schools as an accountability system to “foster” school improvement, instead of fostering the establishment of effective school-level educational programs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the list of regulation changes, schools would receive credit for seniors who earn an advanced studies, standard or applied studies diploma within six years and credit for helping students demonstrate college and career readiness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The changes also include providing credit to schools for middle school students taking advanced coursework.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Chad Aldeman, a co-consultant on the redesign, a central theme of public comment about Virginia’s school system accreditation standards is the importance of transparency, high academic standards, and career and college readiness and pathways.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Superintendent of Public Instruction Lisa Coons said the public comment on the regulation changes, which ended on July 5, “shaped and developed” the proposed system. She said the system will help the commonwealth “focus on what schools need and provide the support that they need” to achieve a distinguished rating.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The department said out of the 34 total comments submitted, most were supportive of the regulations’ changes, including the revamped standards’ favoring student mastery in a school subject over growth and supporting a continued focus on chronic absenteeism, or students missing at least 18 days of instruction for any reason, including excused and unexcused absences.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike other states, Virginia is proposing to raise the academic standards for English learners by including more students in the accountability calculations. English learners are typically excluded because some children are learning English for the first time and may need more time to grow in proficiency of the language. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To meet that goal, more resources would likely be required to address the achievement gap.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The agency said the new rules would reduce the number of semesters English learners are excluded from the calculations, from 11 semesters to three. Approximately 35,000 students were excluded under the existing regulations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consultants said the change would help identify schools struggling to support students classified as English Learners and provide them with resources and services. According to VDOE, 1.5 years is the maximum allowed under federal law to exclude an English learner from accountability calculations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As a former high school English teacher, I have seen the frustration of ELL students, many of whom have a second or third-grade English comprehension level being placed in a high school English class without any support,” said Shelly Norden, a director with the School Board Member Alliance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She said ELL students would often “give up” out of frustration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data collection on assessments will begin at the start of the 2024-25 school year, and full implementation will begin the following school year. The federal government’s adoption of the state ESSA plan is a vital part of the implementation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Todd Reid, a spokesman with VDOE, Virginia is on track to submit its state plan to the U.S. Department of Education by the February deadline.</span></p>
<p><em>Note: An earlier version of this story stated that <span style="font-weight: 400;">Chad Aldeman was the Edunomics Lab policy director at Georgetown University. He left that position during the accountability system redesign.</span></em></p>

Glenn Youngkin to serve as the newest member of the Virginia Board of Education. The governor has yet to fill the second seat on the nine-member board after two seats became available earlier this month.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are excited to have Dr. Bryce as a part of the team now,” said Board President Grace Creasey, who Gov. Glenn Youngkin appointed. “Thank you so much, and we look forward to all that you have to offer and bring it as far as your expertise, to add to our team here.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bryce, a mother and college psychology teacher, has been </span><a href="https://dailyprogress.com/news/local/government-politics/meg-bryce-addresses-elephant-in-the-room-at-town-hall/article_a09eea80-519b-11ee-a4d9-c7148c607840.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">criticized</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for taking her children out of Virginia’s public schools following the pandemic. Bryce told the Daily Progress that she took them out of Murray Elementary School in Albemarle County after losing faith in the school’s leadership during the pandemic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, Bryce unsuccessfully ran for the at-large seat on the Albemarle County School Board, saying she wanted to help improve the system. She’s also written commentary in opposition of decisions made by Albemarle County Schools regarding “</span><a href="https://megforschoolboard.com/megs-blog/f/lowering-standards-is-inequitable" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lowering the standards</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” and ignoring </span><a href="https://megforschoolboard.com/megs-blog/f/acps-doesnt-listen-part-ii" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">parents</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the same year, she told </span><a href="https://www.cbs19news.com/news/politics/albemarle-school-board-candidate-profiles-meg-bryce-part-3/article_b7648a09-255c-5854-bd97-1bb2d748da07.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBS 19</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that being Scalia’s daughter made it, “very easy for people to dismiss me as partisan because of my maiden name.” The late justice opposed abortion, affirmative action and gay rights.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the same interview for her school board run, she said she hoped people would look at policies and issues instead.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bryce joined the board for the first time during Wednesday’s work session. After she was introduced, Bryce did not directly comment on her appointment. She is expected to speak during Thursday’s business meeting.</span></p>
<p>Christian Martinez, a spokesman for Gov. Youngkin, said in a statement that the governor wished to thank Bryce for agreeing to serve on the board.</p>
<p>&#8220;Her extensive background in <span class="c-mrkdwn__highlight">education</span>, her advocacy for student-centered policies, and her commitment to restoring common sense in <span class="c-mrkdwn__highlight">education</span> for all Virginia students will be instrumental in ensuring that every parent, student, and teacher receives the essential resources and support needed to thrive,&#8221; Martinez said in a statement.</p>
<p><em>Editor&#8217;s note: This brief was updated with a response from the governor&#8217;s office.</em></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Research shows that some students use cell phones to message people and browse the internet and social media apps during instructional time. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Others use them to record events in school and post them on various platforms. The resulting videos aren’t always positive: Earlier this month, a Pennsylvania school district acknowledged that several middle school students had made fake TikTok accounts impersonating their teachers, “and apparently made some posts using racist, homophobic and sexually explicit language” according to NPR. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I hate TikTok,” said Oveta Scott, a teacher in Northern Virginia, at a Thursday listening session hosted by the state’s education department about the proposed cell phone ban in schools. “If I hear another TikTok challenge where they are destroying the bathroom, making noises in class, chirping like birds, I go insane, and I can’t take it anymore.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But she said she understands some circumstances in which a child needs a cell phone including for health reasons. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last Thursday’s listening session was the first of several seeking public input on the future cell phone-free policies and procedures, which school boards must adopt by Jan. 1, 2025, or before. Some of Virginia’s school boards have already begun banning or restricting cell phone use in schools.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The initiative is spearheaded by the Virginia Department of Education, the Departments of Health, and Health and Human Services as part of Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s executive order signed earlier this month that requires the departments to create guidelines to limit students’ time in front of “addictive” cell phones and eliminate “clear distractions” in the classroom. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Democrats also </span><a href="https://x.com/ssurovell/status/1811120474275074425" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on July 10 the creation of a Senate Democratic workgroup on school mobile phone policy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many said teacher input on the forthcoming policies is vital to eliminating distractions at a time when questions are circulating about the use of technology in schools and artificial intelligence’s impact on learning. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I certainly am not opposed to a ban. I just think it&#8217;s a bandaid for a much bigger issue that we have in public education that speaks to so many things about how we&#8217;re able to hire amazing teachers and retain them,” Del. Laura Cohen, D-Fairfax, a former preschool teacher and school board member.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The benefits: technology tools, expanded internet access</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While cell phones are often considered a distraction for students, researchers and professors say they also have their share of benefits and tools that can help with students’ studies, like language translators, rulers and calculators. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There&#8217;s reasons we should be concerned about cell phones as distractions to learning, but they&#8217;re also very powerful learning tools potentially, you know, their access to information,” said Jesse Senechal, executive director for the </span><a href="https://soe.vcu.edu/centers/-institute-for-collaborative-research-and-evaluation/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Institute for Collaborative Research and Evaluation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the School of Education at Virginia Commonwealth University.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senechal said that cell phones offer support in some cases when schools have a limited number of computers and internet access. He said policies could also create broader equity issues in how marginalized students are disciplined in contrast to socio-economic privileged students. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leon Rouson, a professor in the School of Education at Norfolk State University, said the phones also allow students to do research without a computer or laptop, which is helpful for high school students he assists in preparing for college during the summer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If we say ‘no cell phones, ‘get rid of them,’ ‘throw them out,’ ‘they should not exist’ — I think we would also be creating some disconnection,” Rouson said.</span></p>
<p><b>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The challenges: Enforcement questions, negative impacts on some learners</h4>

	 </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Teachers have also questioned who will enforce cell phone restrictions. Some are worried that the restrictions will create additional responsibilities for teachers and contribute to further burnout.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2022, a Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission study found that increased workloads and behavioral and mental health issues among students were some of the factors leading teachers to leave the career field.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Researchers also found that teachers were dissatisfied with the lack of respect from parents and the public.</span></p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Virginia report shows more teachers leaving the workforce than entering it&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/11/07/virginia-report-shows-more-teachers-leaving-the-workforce-than-entering-it/embed/#?secret=aK3MnJNXKg#?secret=vA7XB2lVXo" data-secret="vA7XB2lVXo" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If students are simply told not to have cell phones out during class, then teachers become the cell phone police,” said Nancy Bradley, a Salem City School Board member and associate director for the Office of Academic Programs at Virginia Tech. “As they are trying to teach, they are also trying to monitor which students are on their cell phone and asking that they put the cell phones away or taking the cell phones from these students. It is not a productive use of instructional time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While studying teacher burnout and their well-being, Tim Pressley, associate professor in the Department of Psychology at Christopher Newport University, found that student behavior has “drastically changed” since returning to in-person learning due to the pandemic. Further research found that students relied heavily on their phones, scrolling through social media and talking through classroom lessons.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Technology is kind of just getting out of hand with students using it,” Pressley said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Critics are concerned that parents’ and students’ anxieties about special learners’ needs and gun violence in schools will increase if policies restrict cell phones in schools. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cohen raised similar concerns after an unsuccessful </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB28" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cell phone bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was returned to the House Education Committee for review in March. She said the bill could have negatively impacted English Language Learners and students with disabilities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill would have empowered local boards to prohibit cell phones and other “handheld communication devices” such as Chromebooks, which can be used to message other students during class.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want to make sure … that we are not doing anything to stigmatize or not support our students with disabilities,” Cohen said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cohen said another common reason parents want their children to have their cell phones is in case of a school emergency, such as a school shooting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Public alarm about gun violence in Virginia schools was heightened after a then-six-year-old student brought a firearm from home to his Newport News elementary school and shot his teacher. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Providing assurance to parents that even if their child doesn’t have their cell phone on them during the school day, that they will receive communication from the school regarding emergency situations, is an important component to get them to buy into the changes to cell phone policies,” Bradley said. “I do think that’s probably going to be one of the tougher hurdles to overcome.”</span></p>

(Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former President Donald Trump rallied in Chesapeake, Virginia about two weeks before a nationally-televised assassination attempt at a Pennsylvania rally left him and two others wounded, and one person dead. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While it’s unclear whether there will be more presidential rallies here before the November election, amid heightened public safety concerns, local and state police agencies plan to continue collaborating with federal agencies to ensure the safety of all participants.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This political violence is very scary for so many people and it really rattled the nation in so many ways,” said Tim Barney, a University of Richmond professor who specializes in rhetoric and communication studies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He added that Virginia is going to be looking to law enforcement to “step up their game” and to do “the good work that they always do in protecting us, but to be extra careful in this heightened rhetorical arena.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, Trump’s campaign traveled to Chesapeake for a star-studded rally that included Gov. Glenn Youngkin, Attorney General Jason Miyares, and former Republican Govs. Bob McDonnell and George Allen, and U.S. Rep. Jen Kiggans, who represents the second congressional district.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No safety issues related to violence were reported from the event; the biggest threat of the day was the scorching temperature.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than 200 members of the public who attended the event were provided treatment on-site for heat-related issues, according to Heath Covey, a spokesperson for the City of Chesapeake. Covey said seven people were transported to local medical facilities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The event was also staffed with more than 100 members of the Chesapeake Police and Fire Departments. Additionally, more than 50 Chesapeake Sheriff&#8217;s Office personnel, along with additional support from the Virginia Beach and Norfolk Sheriff&#8217;s offices, were involved. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While county police and sheriff’s offices have jurisdiction over their respective counties and towns, the Virginia State Police have jurisdiction across the entire commonwealth. However in cases such as presidential campaign visits, it&#8217;s been the practice of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to combine efforts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">John Jones, executive director for the Virginia Sheriff’s Association, said partnering with other agencies provides “maximum coverage” to protect the public and “that is not going to change” in the future, including for a future campaign rally. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m confident that we will be there as a partner, we will be cooperating with all the law enforcement agencies involved and will do everything in our means to ensure the safety of the public,” Jones said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bill Carrico, a former state senator and executive board member of the Virginia State Police Association, said the way Virginia police agencies handled the Chesapeake rally exemplified why he trustsVirginia’s law enforcement to handle large presidential events.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We [the police association] have an organization that prides themselves on not letting things happen to individuals,” Carrico said. “I can assure you that the Secret Service probably understands when they come to Virginia, that our agency is going to be looking at these [operation] plans, and would have [to] push back if they think that something is left unattended,” said Carrico.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Trump campaign has not revealed whether any events are scheduled in Virginia before election day on Nov. 5. President Joe Biden ended his presidential reelection campaign Sunday, and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to replace him as the Democratic nominee. There are no known events in Virginia scheduled for Harris as the presumptive presidential nominee.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this feature, we aim to highlight the frequency with which officials around Virginia are resisting public access to records on issues large and small — and note instances when the release of information under FOIA gave the public insight into how government bodies are operating.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Former Richmond city spokeswoman was warned repeatedly about credit card use</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to records obtained by the </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/government-politics/city-credit-card-spokesperson-petula-burks-richmond-officials/article_436376b0-42e0-11ef-ae31-fb2beb2ff1c5.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richmond Times-Dispatch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, former city spokesperson Petula Burks and executive assistant Raymond Dark received several warnings about overdue balances on their city-issued purchasing cards.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The newspaper reported that Burks’ card was suspended after a backlog of unpaid charges and accidental use. She resigned July 1 after accumulating nearly $100,000 in service charges “from consulting and advertising firms operated by her former business partner.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Records revealed that Burks started to fall behind significantly in reconciling charges in April 2023, with unsettled transactions worth $9,415.75.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the following months, Burks still had thousands of dollars remaining to clear up, leading officials to consider suspending her purchasing card. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Further investigation by the Times-Dispatch found that oversight was unclear for purchasing cards and that Burks failed to resolve transactions after mistakenly using her card for a hotel stay and rental vehicle. City officials also found that Dark disregarded email communications about overdue payments, which resulted in the city suspending his card.</span></p>

	<div class="newsroomSidebar"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Mercury’s efforts to track FOIA and other transparency cases in Virginia are indebted to the work of the </span><a href="https://www.opengovva.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Coalition for Open Government</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a nonprofit alliance dedicated to expanding access to government records, meetings and other state and local proceedings.</span></div>

<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Media outlet argues for access to Virginia execution recordings</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NPR, an American public broadcasting company, and a team of attorneys are </span><a href="https://www.rcfp.org/npr-virginia-execution-records/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">seeking</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> through an appeal access to several execution tapes recorded by Virginia Department of Corrections prison employees, after an unsuccessful attempt to retrieve the records in the Charlottesville Circuit Court.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2021, the Virginia legislature </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/virginia-legislature-sends-death-penalty-repeal-to-northam/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">voted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to abolish capital punishment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The media outlet is joined by the First Amendment Clinic at the University of Virginia School of Law, which is administered by attorneys from the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, appealing the lower court’s decision.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, NPR unsuccessfully sued the department to release the recordings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think these records are very valuable because this process is largely happening within sort of a black box,” said Ian Kalish, a clinical supervising attorney at the Reporters Committee, in an RCFP interview. “It’s important for the public to understand what happens in these situations because these actions are being taken in the name of the public. I think just being able to facilitate that type of oversight is quite important.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Department of Corrections disclosed that it recorded 32 tapes concerning 27 executions. NPR journalist Chiara Eisner </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/01/19/1149547193/secret-execution-tapes-virginia" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">published</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> an additional four recordings that a former prison employee donated to the Library of Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attorneys representing NPR argued on Tuesday that </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title2.2/chapter37/section2.2-3706/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">state law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> allowing the exclusion of certain records from mandatory disclosure does not exempt actions conducted by the department, such as the employees’ recordings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the Office of the Attorney’s General disagrees. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The General Assembly has afforded broad protection to all records of persons incarcerated in the Commonwealth of Virginia, and that exception applies here,” said Margaret O’Shea, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">assistant attorney general, at Tuesday’s hearing. “It gives DOC the discretion if it so elects to withhold these records, balancing out the various competing privacy interests at issue.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Governor’s office reacts to D.C. claims to unsuccessful arena proposal</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MuckRock’s </span><a href="https://www.muckrock.com/news/archives/2024/jul/17/for-the-record-requesting-documents-for-the-stadium-that-never-was/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">records request</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> digging into the unsuccessful arena project slated for Alexandria this week uncovered past rebuttals from Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s office, which claimed last February that D.C. officials made “numerous assumptions” on the project, and how it leads to a “extremely misleading narrative.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MuckRock, which is a nonprofit news site, received from the governor’s office over 300 pages regarding the proposal that would have brought the Washington Wizards and Capitals to Virginia from their home in Washington D.C. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin and supporters touted the positive aspects of the project, namely that it would generate a fiscal impact of $12 billion and create roughly 30,000 jobs. The deal would have required the General Assembly to create an arena authority that would have the ability to issue $2 billion in bonds for the project. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the proposal failed because the legislature and governor weren’t able to compromise on a deal, amid public concerns about the negative impacts on the environment, taxpayers, transportation, and quality of life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monumental Sports and Entertainment, the owner of both the Wizards and Capitals franchises, agreed to keep the teams in the District of Columbia.</span></p>

(Parker Michels-Boyce for The Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Tuesday, Virginia reached another stop towards expanding passenger rail by authorizing the sale of the Virginian Line to Norfolk Southern Railway Company, for $54 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Commonwealth Transportation Board authorized the Virginia Passenger Rail Authority to sell approximately 28 miles of track back to Norfolk Southern. By state law, the board is required to consider approving the sale of any property valued in excess of $5 million. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The transportation board approved VPRA’s amended capital budget, which includes an increase from $433 million to $487 million for the expansion of passenger rail to Christiansburg. The money stems from existing funds in VPRA’s nearly $6 billion capital budget.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to VPRA, the capital funds will help cover the purchase of the Manassas Line and infrastructure improvements in Roanoke to accommodate more trains and rights to run passenger service on Norfolk Southern’s Main Line, or N-Line, to Christiansburg. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The funds will also cover infrastructure costs to build a platform and siding track at the Cambria station site.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DJ Stadtler, executive director for VPRA, said at Tuesday’s CTB meeting that the authority “came up with a much better deal that will conceivably get us to Christiansburg faster for a lot less money” and would be “beneficial” for passenger rail in the commonwealth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Secretary of Transportation Shep Miller said Virginia “got a better situation” in Christiansburg after behind-the-scenes efforts to arrange the agreement, which still must be considered by the VPRA Board of Directors. They’ll do that at their next meeting, scheduled for Aug. 27.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;m excited,” Miller said. “It&#8217;s not all done yet. It is subject to due diligence and lots of work that we have to do between now and the end of August.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than 40 years have passed since passenger service has operated through the Southwest Virginia region.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to VPRA, the agreement with Norfolk Southern would support the expansion of two Amtrak round trips to Christiansburg and provide for a third, operating between Roanoke and Christiansburg.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The purchase of the Manassas Line, operated by the Virginia Railway Express commuter rail service, would allow more trips outside the weekday commuting pattern, including evening and weekend service.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The line originates at Union Station in Washington, D.C., and goes to Broad Run in Prince William County.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VPRA staff will brief the authority on the CTB’s decision at the Aug. 27 meeting. Under the concept agreement, the expansion project could be completed before 2028.<br />

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If successful, the case could strengthen the reformed transgender student school policies adopted by Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration, requiring </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/09/16/youngkin-administration-overhauls-virginia-transgender-student-policies/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">parental approval</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for any changes to students’ “names, nicknames, and/or pronouns.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Wisconsin, a group of parents attempted to overturn in court a school division’s decision to implement guidelines allowing students to change their gender identity at school without parental consent or notification. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Parents have the right to be involved in major decisions affecting their children&#8217;s lives. This case presents an opportunity for the U.S. Supreme Court to provide much-needed clarity and reaffirm that government officials cannot override parents’ fundamental rights simply because they believe they know better,” said Miyares in a July 8 statement. “It is essential that schools work with parents, not against them, to support a child’s wellbeing.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not all schools in Virginia have supported the revised policies. The state’s revised transgender student policies haven’t been embraced by all school districts in the state. The Virginia Department of Education was facing </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/aclu-sues-virginia-department-of-education-over-transgender-policies/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">two lawsuits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — stemming from Hanover and York Counties — over the policy changes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Monday, the York County Circuit Court accepted the VDOE&#8217;s pleas in bar and dismissed the one case. The second case in Hanover was continued to Aug. 20.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Breanna Diaz, policy and legislative counsel for the ACLU of Virginia, which promotes and defends citizens’ civil liberties and rights, said the lower court in Wisconsin has already ruled that the parents did not experience any actual injury from the decision, compared to the transgender and nonbinary students in Virginia who alleged they experienced “real harm” and “actual discrimination” due to the revised policies in the commonwealth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In February, the ACLU of Virginia announced that it and law firm Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer, LLP are representing two transgender students in the counties of </span><a href="https://www.acluva.org/sites/default/files/field_documents/hanover_model_policies_complaint.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hanover</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.acluva.org/sites/default/files/field_documents/final_york_county_complaint_w._verification_1.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">York</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who are challenging the department’s policies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The reality is that what a few parents want doesn’t always match school policies designed to accommodate all families,” Diaz said in a statement. “Parents who opt for public schools are signing up for a system that must serve entire communities, and although parents can opt out of public schools by choosing private schools or homeschooling, they can’t remake public schools to match their individual preferences.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adults and Virginia schools must put pupils first by affirming all students, Diaz continued. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Virginia’s leaders should focus on making Virginia schools safe for students of all gender identities, starting by rescinding the policies that have already harmed so many Virginia families.”</span></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Passengers worried their summer travel plans would be disrupted by a schedule change to the ferry service over the James River will now have smooth sailing after all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, the Virginia Department of Transportation announced a reduced schedule to begin on July 8 because the service for the Jamestown-Scotland Ferry lacked a </span><a href="https://www.jobs.virginia.gov/jobs/ferry-chief-engineer-surry-virginia-united-states-ea70de5e-1bd0-4011-a35d-7fddc345e2c4" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">certified chief engineer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and had employees on protected leave statuses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the issue has been </span><a href="https://www.vdot.virginia.gov/about/our-system/ferries/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">resolved</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at least for now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“VDOT has been working hard to address this critical staffing situation and was able to reach sufficient staffing levels at the end of last week to sustain full-service operations at this time,” said Brittany McBride Nichols, a spokeswoman for VDOT’s Hampton Roads District, in a statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, VDOT, like similar services across the country, is still facing a shortage of people to fill maritime positions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nichols said the total number of engineer positions for the ferry includes 10 full-time positions, one full-time contractor and four hourly positions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of July 1, the ferry has two full-time VDOT vacancies and one full-time contractor vacancy for the ferry chief engineer positions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As [the chief engineer] position is required by the United States Coast Guard to operate the vessel, it is critical that we fill as many of our open positions as possible immediately to avoid any future schedule changes,” Nichols said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Certified chief engineers are required to have extensive training, complete a specific engineering exam successfully, and have more than 10 years of experience to earn the necessary credentials.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While this combination of advanced training and substantial experience ensures that chief engineers are highly qualified to maintain the safety and reliability of the ferry service, Nichols said the requirements have made the position more challenging to fill.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, the federal government </span><a href="https://www.maritime.dot.gov/sites/marad.dot.gov/files/2024-02/MARAD%20Mariner%20Workforce%20Strategic%20Plan%20FY23-27.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a strategic plan to address mariner recruitment, training, and retention concerns. Some strategies include developing new mariner apprenticeship programs, identifying barriers for potential students to participate in the federal student aid programs by maritime institutions, and increasing federal support for maritime K–12 programs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">David White, executive director for the Virginia Maritime Association, said the shortage is a symptom of a more significant issue for the maritime industry. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Until more people know about and take [an] interest in the many financially and personally rewarding career opportunities … throughout our maritime and supply chain industries, positions that affect our everyday lives will go unfilled,” White said in a statement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He added that the association is </span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2024/01/13/column-thanks-to-maritime-hampton-roads-is-an-ocean-of-opportunity/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">working</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to address the issue by introducing more students, specifically in K-12, to the opportunities available “right in their backyard that will allow them to participate in the economic engine of our region.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, the ferry, which is free, saw an average of 2,185 vehicles per day travel across the river, an increase from the 1,922 vehicle trips in 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ferry service has grown in popularity since the pandemic but has not reached its pre-pandemic ridership average of 2,506 trips per day in 2019.</span></p>

(Courtesy of SDI Productions via Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia will soon establish guidance to restrict or eliminate student cell phone use during instructional time at school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Tuesday, Gov. Glenn Youngkin issued Executive Order 33, which directs his administration to “heed the call” of parents, public health professionals, educators and others by establishing cell phone-free policies and procedures for school divisions, in light of growing concerns over children’s health and declines in academic performance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Department of Education, in collaboration with the Departments of Health and Health and Human Services, must clearly define what “cell phone-free education” means, and publish model plans and draft guidance on implementing </span><a href="https://www.doe.virginia.gov/programs-services/school-operations-support-services/cell-phone-free-education-in-virginia-k-12-public-schools" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cell phone-free education</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Virginia’s K-12 schools on its website by Aug. 15, according to the governor’s directive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The directive will establish “the clear goal to protect the health and safety of our students by limiting the amount of time they are exposed to “addictive” cell phones and social media and eliminating “clear distractions” in the classroom, Youngkin said in a statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The governor added that $500,000 in existing funds allocated to the Departments of Education and Behavioral Health and Development Services will be made available to implement the initiative. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the governor’s office, the funds will support state and local efforts to facilitate family nights and community engagement events to combat youth mental health challenges, and provide microgrants for school divisions to help implement cell phone best practices in their communities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of the policies’ development, the departments will be required to hold listening sessions seeking public input on “age-appropriate cell phone-free education policies and procedures, gather feedback on best practices currently underway in Virginia public schools, and receive input for the draft guidance,” the governor’s executive order reads. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The departments are slated to release the final guidance by Sept. 16 of this year. The order directs school boards to adopt the policies by Jan. 1, 2025, or before. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s order cites American Psychological Association </span><a href="https://www.apa.org/monitor/2024/04/teen-social-use-mental-health" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">research</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that suggests adolescents who spend over three hours on social media daily have double the risk of poor mental health. The order also references studies showing that children spend about 4.8 hours a day on social media, and that students who use their phones during class learn less and earn lower grades. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Therefore, creating a cell phone-free education environment in public schools is not only a prudent measure but an essential one to promote a healthier and more focused educational environment where every child is free to learn,” Youngkin directive states.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of Virginia’s school boards have already begun banning or restricting cell phone use in schools. </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB28" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> empowering local boards to institute such prohibitions on cellphones and other “handheld communication devices” during regular school hours died last session.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">James Fedderman, president of the Virginia Education Association, said in a statement that the organization recognizes the mounting worries over how cell phones impact students in classrooms and thinks it&#8217;s “essential” to approach the issue with “a nuanced perspective that considers the real-world needs of our students and teachers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fedderman, whose organization is the largest educator advocacy group in the state, went on to urge the Virginia Department of Education to engage with educators to develop balanced guidelines “that support effective teaching and learning while also addressing legitimate concerns about distractions.”</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bryan Viera, who arrived in America unaccompanied, and Millie Okoro, who arrived with family, migrated from different countries to the U.S. as teenagers, both to make a better life for themselves and to make their mothers proud. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They enrolled in and graduated from public high schools in Virginia, leaning heavily on the support of a few counselors, teachers and groups that work with migrant youth to attain their educational goals. Now young adults, Viera and Okoro’s journeys reflect that of thousands of youth the American government has released from federal custody to sponsors in Virginia over the past decade. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Migrant children are supported by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services&#8217; </span><a href="https://www.acf.hhs.gov/orr/about/what-we-do" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which is responsible for providing asylum seekers, including unaccompanied children, with equitable, high-quality services and resources.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of the agency’s duties, the office is responsible for supporting unaccompanied children until it can release them into safe settings with sponsors, who are commonly family members, until their immigration proceedings.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">From October 2014 to April of this year, the agency <a href="https://www.acf.hhs.gov/orr/grant-funding/unaccompanied-children-released-sponsors-state" target="_blank">reports</a> 33,812 unaccompanied children have been released to a sponsor’s care in Virginia.  </span><a href="https://www.acf.hhs.gov/orr/grant-funding/unaccompanied-children-released-sponsors-state" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ranked eighth with the most children released in other states. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A federal law requires the commonwealth to provide all children, including migrants, “equal access” to a public education, regardless of their or their parents’ actual or perceived national origin, citizenship, or immigration status. This means migrant children may be navigating the same challenges Virginia-born children are facing, as the state grapples with declining assessment scores, striking policy issues and troubling student absences. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leaders and media reports have also questioned the disappearances of migrant children in the U.S. and Virginia, youth who are from predominantly Spanish-speaking countries including Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador. As of June 28, a total of 41 migrant youth have been reported missing from the Town of Culpeper, with Hispanic people representing the second largest portion of the residents.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What happens when migrant kids arrive in America, alone?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ORR assists in finding a sponsor or family member to take care of children who arrive in America without their parents. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to ORR, the office was created as part of the Refugee Act of 1980 to support refugees, unaccompanied refugee minors, and Cuban and Haitian entrants. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since its establishment, Congress has expanded the office’s services to meet demands for asylum seekers, refugees, survivors of torture, unaccompanied minors, and victims of trafficking. The search for a sponsor can sometimes span the U.S. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Children who arrive to the U.S. without parents entered a sponsor’s care in </span><a href="https://www.acf.hhs.gov/orr/grant-funding/unaccompanied-children-released-sponsors-county" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">14 Virginia localities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Oct. 2023 to April 2024, including Loudoun, Arlington, Prince William and Fairfax Counties in Northern Virginia, the city of Roanoke in the Southwest region of the state, Norfolk in Hampton Roads, and central Virginia’s Chesterfield and Henrico Counties, as well as the capital city of Richmond. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nationally, unaccompanied children were in the ORR’s care for an average of 27 days in 2023, which is the lowest annual average length of care per child since 2015.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A New York Times’ review of 2023 ORR data found 42% of unaccompanied children nationwide were released to a parent or guardian; in Virginia, 46% were. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sponsorship candidates undergo a screening process to determine if they’re able to provide for a migrant child’s physical and mental well-being. ORR is also responsible for determining whether the candidates have engaged in any activity that would be a </span><a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/georgia-news/advocates-worry-about-unaccompanied-minor-surge-in-georgia/EIEBPS5PEFEIZJTGWYHTPNZIMI/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">potential risk</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the child. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regarding legal requirements, sponsors sign the </span><a href="https://www.acf.hhs.gov/orr/policy-guidance/unaccompanied-children-program-policy-guide-section-2#2.8.1" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sponsor Care Agreement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to ensure the child is present at all future immigration proceedings and that, if an immigration judge issues a removal or voluntary departure order, they report to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, for removal from the United States.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The duties of the sponsor also include enrolling the child in school and ensuring their attendance, following the requirements of the state in which they live and otherwise supporting their academic success, the agreement reads.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ORR has organized with </span><a href="https://www.acf.hhs.gov/orr/contact-information/state-virginia-programs-and-services-locality" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">partners</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Virginia to assist with resources including churches and social service groups. Virginia also provides </span><a href="https://www.dss.virginia.gov/community/ona/refugee_services.cgi" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">services</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> through the Department of Social Services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to ORR, the agency has no legal authority to compel children released or their sponsors to respond to inquiries or participate in such services that involve assistance with school enrollment or attendance and connecting the child or their sponsor to community-based resources suitable to their needs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s congressional lawmakers, including U.S. Rep. Morgan Griffith, R-Salem, have sought to improve operations around releasing unaccompanied minors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In April, Griffith filed </span><a href="https://morgangriffith.house.gov/uploadedfiles/rep._griffith_unaccompanied_minor_placement_notification_act.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> requiring HHS to provide advanced notification to school districts and child welfare agencies when a minor is placed in their respective jurisdiction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Unaccompanied minors are crossing our southern border in record droves,” said Griffith, in an April statement. “ORR currently fails to notify any school district or child welfare agency if an unaccompanied minor is placed in a home, leading to issues of illegal child labor and abuse. The Unaccompanied Minor Placement Notification Act changes this HHS policy and it will give some protection to minors from exploitation.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">State policy seeks to address absenteeism, language barriers to learning</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia lawmakers and school divisions have attempted to both support children who speak English as a second language — some of whom migrated to the country on their own — and tackle chronic absenteeism.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like other states, the commonwealth has been dealing with a troubling trend of chronic absenteeism, or students missing at least 18 days of instruction for any reason, including excused and unexcused absences.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Okoro, who attended high school virtually for almost two years, said she wished she could’ve gone in-person sooner, but her family was concerned regarding her immigration status. But in 2023, her last high school year, she decided to go in-person.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Everything was happening so fast at the same time, and I wanted to get a lot of stuff [done], but I wasn&#8217;t really aware of my situation,” Okoro said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She said she was oblivious to preparing for college until she arrived and met with her college counselor, the Dream Project — a group that empowers immigrant students who face barriers to their education through mentoring and offering scholarships — and even a member of custodial staff, who spoke her second language, Spanish.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Viera added that the language barrier made it extremely difficult for him and other Spanish speaking students to follow classes. Later in his high school career, Viera said he started to recognize some of the gaps schools had in helping and encouraging migrant youth, including training staff.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said he believes the lack of support for students who don’t speak English could be one of the reasons students are deterred from staying in school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They just didn&#8217;t know what to do with me, they didn&#8217;t know how to help me and I could see some of them felt really bad about not being able to, but it&#8217;s part of the lack of training that the [schools] give to the staff at the schools,” Viera said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the keys to their success to finishing high school in Virginia and enrolling in college was their attendance at Virginia’s public schools.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I just knew that if I needed help, I feel like education would have been … the first place to look for and so I tried as much as I could to limit the amount of absences I had, and if I had any absences, it was for a good reason,” said Okoro.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Viera said he’s uncertain where he would be if he didn’t show up to class, stayed after school or accepted volunteer opportunities. He recently graduated from college and is working in the technology industry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I feel like if I didn&#8217;t attend school as often, if I missed class, I feel like I wouldn’t have achieved or accomplished the grades that I had … [or earned] the scholarships that I [received],” Viera said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a survey by the Virginia Association of School Superintendents, Virginia’s chronic absenteeism rate was more than four times higher during the 2022-2023 school year than pre-pandemic. Approximately a quarter of the 85 school divisions surveyed had a chronic absenteeism rate of over 25%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response, Virginia education leaders launched a </span><a href="https://www.doe.virginia.gov/teaching-learning-assessment/all-in-va/attendance-matters/chronic-absenteeism-task-force" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">task force</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to address students&#8217; disappearance from the classroom and incorporated Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s “</span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/news-releases/2023/september/name-1013658-en.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ALL IN VA</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” plan to combat the learning loss during the pandemic through “high-intensity tutoring” and promoting school attendance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Superintendent of Public Instruction Lisa Coons said transportation, food and housing challenges can be factors for children missing school. Children may also be deterred from school because they are behind their class in learning, and may need mental health support, problems Coons said the state is working to correct as they try to educate caretakers on the resources available to students and the importance of being in school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want to make sure that our students are in school because we know that&#8217;s the best place for them,” Coons said. “We know they access their learning and their experiences and their relationships with their peers and the adults in the school community, but it also provides support for some of those barriers that are hurting or causing students to not be able to be engaged as successfully and well in their education.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the last session, the General Assembly </span><a href="https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/get/budget/4972/SB6002/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">agreed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to appropriate $72.1 million over the next two years to expand and provide targeted support for English learner students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“English Learner students are one of the fastest growing segments of the student population, and their needs also vary greatly depending on their prior education experiences and English acquisition,” said House Education Chairman Sam Rasoul, D-Roanoke, during a February House Appropriations Committee hearing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Richmond, and Del. Michelle Malando, D-Prince William, carried successful legislation revising the state code to require that state funding support ratios of instructional positions for English language learner students based on each student’s proficiency level.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The budget includes language that directs the Department of Education to enter into statewide contracts for mental health providers for public school students and attendance recovery services for “disengaged, chronically absent or struggling students.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Language was also added to the budget requiring schools that receive state funding for the “After-the-Bell” breakfast program to report their chronic absenteeism rates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Northern Virginia, Edu-Futuro, an nonprofit organization focused on empowering immigrant and underserved youth and families through education and workforce development, has helped to address chronic absenteeism among Latino youth and English Learner students by forming an outreach team tasked with contacting hard-to-reach students and their families, and working to return chronically absent youth to the classroom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the team’s first year in the 2022-2023 school year, Edu-Futuro returned 62% of the 273 children referred to them to the classroom in Fairfax County.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Through working directly with hundreds of families, our outreach team has found that students often don&#8217;t want to abandon their studies,” said the organization in a </span><a href="https://edu-futuro.org/about-us/#" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2022-2023</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> annual report. “They need encouragement and concrete help to address the underlying challenges that led to their absenteeism, such as financial struggles, mental health issues, or family crises that require the support of government or nonprofit partners.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Alfonso Lopez, D-Arlington, </span><a href="https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/amendment/2024/1/HB30/Introduced/MR/124/46h/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">proposed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the state appropriate $400,000 over the next two years to help Edu-Futuro expand its services to help reduce chronic absenteeism at public schools in Northern Virginia. The provision was not included in the state budget. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legislation carried by Sen. </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB619" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Todd Pillion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, R-Washington, to address chronic absenteeism was continued to next year. The companion bill carried by Del. </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB767" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Israel O’Quinn</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, R-Washington, which was left in the House, would have added the definition of “educational neglect” into state law and required school staff to report to authorities if a parent’s child is not attending school regularly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Karen Vallejos Corrales, executive director of the Dream Project, said she hopes lawmakers will continue to support and invest in counselors and parent liaisons to help migrant youth when they arrive. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She also hopes lawmakers will continue to support career and technical education programs for students, in-state tuition for students who are undocumented, and supporting state aid for students who go to public universities in Virginia. </span></p>

<p><b>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Continuing challenges: Many migrant children disappear and others work dangerous jobs</h4>

	 </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About 85,000 migrant children have been </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/25/us/unaccompanied-migrant-child-workers-exploitation.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> missing, some of whom have later been found </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/exclusive-hyundai-subsidiary-has-used-child-labor-alabama-factory-2022-07-22/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">working</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> dangerous jobs including in some </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/12/14/us/roofing-children-immigrants.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hazardous</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> environments. These same problems can be a cause for concern after children are released from ORR’s purview.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Culpeper Police Department Sgt. Norma McGuckin, who has leading efforts to find dozens of missing migrant children, said the area is known among the Hispanic community as a good place to find steady landscaping work. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McGuckin said one of the most surprising takeaways from her investigations is that out of the 41 children who have disappeared from Culpeper, only a handful of children are enrolled in school. Culpeper Police Department keeps an </span><a href="https://crimewatch.net/us/va/culpeper-county/culpeper-pd/cases/current" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">online record</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of missing children.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sponsors McGuckin has worked with in prior investigations are frustrated when children disappear, yet afraid of reporting the children out of fear they will be returned to their home country. She added some of the older children also have a sense of responsibility to support their families back home financially, so they’re more focused on finding work than studying schoolbooks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They do want to do the right thing and they do want to help these children to succeed in this country the best way that they can provide them help with, but unfortunately … the child already has this plan in mind when they come in across the border that they came here for work,” McGuckin said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares has called the situation “a serious emergency that is being ignored by the federal government.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Vulnerable unaccompanied minors are being dropped off in our cities and counties, and local social services and law enforcement agencies have no idea,” Miyares said in a February statement after writing a </span><a href="https://files.constantcontact.com/d3e83e11901/2527d423-ec6a-485e-a840-74241dfafe2e.pdf?rdr=true" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">letter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the White House about the problem. “How can they protect and check in on children they don’t know are there? We must advance federal, state, and local collaboration in the face of this unprecedented, horrifying crisis. No child should experience the uncertainty and vulnerability that these children are facing.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also in February, the Office of the Inspector General published a </span><a href="https://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/OEI-07-21-00250.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that found gaps in ORR’s screening and follow-up process with sponsors. The office reviewed the ORR’s processes, including its </span><a href="https://www.acf.hhs.gov/orr/policy-guidance/unaccompanied-children-program-policy-guide-section-2#2.8.4" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">post-release services,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> following a surge in referrals of unaccompanied children in 2021. Once the office examined data from March to April of that year, the Inspector General recommended changes to how ORR screens candidates for sponsorship and monitors them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is important for ORR to protect children from unsafe placements by taking appropriate steps to screen sponsors while also releasing children from care in a timely manner and without unnecessary delay,” the letter states.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The office found that in 16% of children’s case files, one or more required sponsor safety checks lacked any documentation indicating that the checks were conducted. The office also found that the case files of 19% of children released to sponsors with pending FBI fingerprint or state child abuse and neglect registry checks were never updated with the results.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeff Hild, acting assistant secretary of the Administration for Children and Families in the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the program ORR, said that the period reviewed was one of the most “challenging periods in ORR’s history” amid a historic number of unaccompanied children placed in ORR care, the largest and fastest expansion of emergency capacity, and at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As ORR worked quickly to respond to this unprecedented emergency, and with limited resources, it prioritized the safety and well-being of children at every step,” Hild wrote in December before the report was published.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hild said in a nine-page response that the office is working to meet the recommendations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Efforts by the </span><a href="https://www.scrippsnews.com/us-news/the-struggle-to-locate-migrant-children-missing-from-us-homes" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Center for Public Integrity and Scripps News</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> helped lead to a </span><a href="https://www.acf.hhs.gov/orr/policy-guidance/unaccompanied-children-program-policy-guide-section-5#5.10.6" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">policy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> change with ORR after investigators were denied information to find missing children.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In February 2023, ORR entered into an </span><a href="https://www.acf.hhs.gov/orr/policy-guidance/unaccompanied-children-program-policy-guide-section-5#5.10.6" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">agreement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children to provide all available data that might help locate the child.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then in August, ORR updated its </span><a href="https://www.acf.hhs.gov/orr/policy-guidance/unaccompanied-children-program-policy-guide-section-5#5.10.6" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">policies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to clarify that, in cases of missing children, it will share information with investigative agencies without having to go through the full case file request process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some kids who come to Virginia from other countries find themselves working hazardous jobs that put their lives and health at risk.</span><b> </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia recorded 302 child care labor violation cases from 2020 to 2023, according to a child labor </span><a href="https://virginiainterfaithcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ChildLaborReportHiF-1.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> compiled by the Virginia Interfaith Center for Public Policy, released in March of this year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Because most labor violations go unreported, the actual number of child labor violations are likely to be significantly higher than those reported,” the center noted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than half of the cases occurred in 2022.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Citing research that found teens who work more than 20 hours tend to have lower grades, more absences and higher dropouts, the center’s report underlined the importance of child labor laws. The report also said young workers have higher rates of job-related injuries and injuries that require emergency department attention.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Department of Labor began a federal investigation into illegal child labor performed by migrant children following a damning </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/18/magazine/child-labor-dangerous-jobs.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last year by the New York Times. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last September, the agency confirmed that it was investigating Fayette Janitorial Service, LLC, a company that had provided contract cleaning and sanitation services to slaughterhouses and meatpacking companies nationwide, including Perdue Farms, where the agency alleged migrant children were being used to clean slaughterhouses at Perdue’s plant on the commonwealth’s Eastern Shore.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“High-profile cases occurring in Virginia that are being investigated at the federal level have detailed children cleaning equipment with acid and pressure hoses,” the Interfaith Center’s report stated. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Times found that Marcos Cux, who migrated to Virginia from Guatemala, was hired at age 13 to work an overnight shift at an Accomack County Perdue plant, one of 15 migrant youths working there. None were older than 17. Cux’s forearm was torn “open to the bone” by a conveyor belt in the poultry deboning section of the plant he’d been sanitizing, the Times reported. He was in eighth grade at the time.</span></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong / Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A task force directed by the Virginia legislature has recommended creating a dedicated funding stream for threat assessment team training on college and university campuses and allowing teams to share confidential information about a person who’s the subject of an investigation with other public institutions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An assessment team may investigate a person, whether a student or potential employee of a college or university, if they are determined to pose a “significant” threat of violence to others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This month, a task force directed by the state’s Secretary of Education and Secretary of Public Safety and Homeland Security released its </span><a href="https://rga.lis.virginia.gov/Published/2024/RD284/PDF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with a handful of recommendations to improve how threat assessment teams, responsible for campus safety, operate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legislative action would need to be taken before any of the recommendations could be implemented.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the 2007 mass shooting at Virginia Tech, lawmakers passed </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?081+sum+SB539" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> requiring colleges and universities to establish threat assessment teams to help prevent violence on campus. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since then, such laws have been expanded, requiring all K-12 public school divisions to have teams and permitting institutions of higher education to obtain records of people considered a “significant” threat on campuses, following the killing of three University of Virginia football players by another student in November 2022.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the task forces’ recommendations was to dedicate a stream of funding for assessment team training.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The task force said the existing training requirement was never funded and was supported through grants. The group added that the most recent grant funding for assessment team training has expired.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Without grant funding, the department will be unable to deliver mandated training without </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">charging substantial tuition for training,” the report stated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The task force also recommended removing language from state law requiring the Department of Criminal Justice Services to approve an independent entity for training assessment teams, which they called “problematic.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the existing requirement, team members have to complete at least eight hours of training with the DCJS or a group it approves within 12 months of being appointed and at least two hours of additional training every year after that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The provision that discusses training conducted by an independent entity approved by the department is problematic, because DCJS does not have specific licensing authority for those independent entities, there is no criteria by which DCJS can judge whether to approve those entities and because it gives DCJS no authority over curriculum for those outside entities,” the report stated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The task force also proposed an amendment to the state code that would require each member to complete an introductory foundational course in threat assessment, approved and delivered under the supervision of DCJS within 12 months of joining the threat assessment team and complete a minimum of two hours of threat assessment training each academic year after that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another task force recommendation would amend state law to allow the public college or university’s threat assessment teams, which conducted an initial investigation of a student or employee deemed a “significant” threat, to share confidential information about that person when they are considering transferring schools or gaining employment at other Virginia public colleges and universities. At private Virginia institutions, they would be required to share that information with the dean of students, if the person investigated as a potential threat is a student, or with human resources if that person is an employee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The notification would occur after the initial assessment team determined through a “full inquiry and assessment,” compared to the current, less-clear language mandating teams take action“ pursuant to an investigation.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Existing state law only requires threat assessment teams to notify the receiving institution of the subject of their investigation or determination. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report stated that the provision’s current language could have made teams liable for defamation in other states because the requirement failed to explicitly limit the notification requirement to only Virginia schools.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The task force did not provide a list of best practices and procedures guidance for threat assessment teams because the ones the task force identified and would have recommended were “inconsistent” with the changes made in </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB1916" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that passed last year, the report stated. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The task force does not have the liberty to publish best practices guidance that is inconsistent with mandates in the Code of Virginia.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The colleges and universities that have received approval from the state will offer specialized instruction in areas such as computer science and technology. Lab school admission is based on a lottery system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ODU’s lab school collaboration will “expand high-quality educational opportunities for their students,” and has “expanded the definition of what it means to be a fiscal agent, in part going above and beyond in multiple different ways,” said Grace Creasey, president of the Virginia Board of Education, during a work session before Friday’s vote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, Gov. Glenn Youngkin and lawmakers agreed to a state budget requiring private and two-year institutions to partner with public institutions to obtain their respective lab school funding from the state. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The governor’s administration, which has supported the establishment of lab schools — institutions similar to charter schools — has gone back and forth with the General Assembly over whether state law allows lab school applications from both private and public institutions to be considered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The administration, with support from the attorney’s general office, previously said that state law does not prohibit the lab school committee from accepting applications from all institutions. However, the legislature disagreed. Opponents, including state Democrats, have repeatedly said the schools take away from public school funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to the budgetary decision, five schools — Emory &amp; Henry and Roanoke Colleges, and Mountain Gateway, Paul D. Camp and Germanna Community Colleges — chose to resubmit their applications. The schools’ applications were recommended for approval by the lab school committee and subsequently approved by the board.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Applications are reviewed by the department and review committee before reaching the board. The groups review such areas as lab school curriculum details and budget assumptions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The five newly approved lab schools will use the rest of the state’s lab school funds in the current budget, expiring June 30. Gov. Youngkin had proposed $60 million for lab schools over the next two years but the legislature declined to add the funds to the spending plan they and Youngkin signed off on last month.</span></p>

(Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Board of Education took another step on Friday to clarify how schools will be rated and student performance measured to better determine how to direct state resources. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The board, on the superintendent’s recommendation, approved </span><a href="https://www.doe.virginia.gov/home/showpublisheddocument/55336/638542370775530000" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">four performance descriptors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: “Distinguished,” “On Track,” “Off Track” and “Needs Intensive Support.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schools considered “distinguished” are those that exceed the state’s expectations for growth, achievement, and readiness, while “needs intensive support” schools are those that “significantly” do not meet any of the state’s expectations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The “on-track” and “off track” descriptors mean schools are either meeting or not meeting expectations. However, questions surfaced on where the terms came from, the benchmarks, and the descriptions behind the labels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the proposed plan, Virginia will begin collecting data for the new performance framework starting in August. Results will be released during the 2025-26 school year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Board President Grace Creasey, a Gov. Glenn Youngkin appointee, said the department will do more work to flush out the descriptions as the revision of the state&#8217;s accreditation system moves forward. </span></p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Va. Department of Education begins developing new accountability system&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/09/18/va-department-of-education-begins-developing-new-accountability-system/embed/#?secret=g1nIoImPIQ#?secret=pqmql4OGbU" data-secret="pqmql4OGbU" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I would like to remind us that the purpose here is transparency and understanding on behalf of not just people in schools, not just those of us sitting here in this room, not people who do education every day,” said Creasey on Friday. “This is for people to understand who are parents and families; and so while we&#8217;re deciding what the main categories are, these descriptors have yet to be fully baked at this point.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier in the process of revising the accreditation system, the board considered two different measures to track academic performance: an achievement index and an overall school rating, which raised concerns about the potential impact on low-performing schools and efforts to recruit teachers and influencing parents to seek other school choices for their children.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since April, teachers, parents, students, and education leaders have told the board they support using category descriptions instead of an A-F rating scale.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The category descriptors are part of a larger plan by Youngkin’s administration to overhaul the existing accountability system, which focuses on accreditation and measures schools based on academic achievement, performance gaps, student attendance and graduation and dropout rates, and factors like building safety, student-teacher ratios and licensure. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schools are then labeled accredited, accredited with conditions or not accredited.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Members of the administration and the board have criticized the current system for being vague and failing to address declines in student performance in subjects such as math and reading.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The administration’s process includes splitting up the state’s accreditation system into two parts: an accreditation system, to assess whether schools meet all requirements laid out in state laws and regulations; and an accountability system, to provide “timely and transparent information on student and school performance.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the new system, schools will be rated based on students’ success, measured by their mastery of subjects and academic growth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stakeholders and the board are split on the weight factors totaling the overall score for each school level. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier the board expressed that “mastery” is important to make sure students thoroughly understand the concepts before graduating to the next grade level. Others have urged the board to keep “mastery” and “growth” at an equal weight.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The overall score for elementary schools consists of three weight factors: 65% mastery, 25% growth, and 10% readiness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In middle schools, the performance score is weighted 60% mastery, 20% growth and 20% readiness; high schools’ performance score is weighted 50% mastery, 35% readiness and 15% graduation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VDOE staff said the performance descriptors would be in addition to the three federally required support and improvement identification categories: Comprehensive, Targeted and Additional Targeted. The designations are given to schools because a specific group of students may need assistance in catching up to the instruction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schools identified as “comprehensive” receive full federal support for the entire school, compared to “targeted” schools, which receive support for low-performing subgroups.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is all about providing a holistic picture to the public that’s more transparent, more clear about where schools are performing across all the indicators in the system,” said Anne Hyslop, director of policy development for All4Ed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, the department contracted with Hyslop to work on changes to the accreditation system along with Chad Aldeman, the Edunomics Lab policy director at Georgetown University. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Board member Anne Holton, former state secretary of education and an appointee of Democratic Govs. Terry McAuliffee and Ralph Northam, was the lone vote against accepting the recommendation, saying she needed more information about the descriptors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There are at least a dozen significant decisions, including one of the most important decisions of these ‘where the lines are going to be drawn’ that we haven&#8217;t made yet, even though we&#8217;re implementing the system starting with the school year that starts in six weeks,” Holton said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She added that she’s concerned that the proposed accreditation system has not been “fully thought out” and will have “unintended consequences” on teachers, families and “our neediest students.”</span></p>

The findings come after a months-long study into easing vehicle traffic congestion, specifically on popular Interstates 81 and 95, and possible ways to stop rising toll costs.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Cost concerns</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission, which conducts analysis and provides oversight of state agencies on behalf of the General Assembly, 7% of EZ-Pass users from Northern Virginia surveyed said they don’t use the toll routes because of their design and layout.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, 72% of respondents said they refrained due to costs ranging from $2 to more than $20, depending on the travel length and congestion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“72% of the people polled said the high cost of the tolls was preventing them from using the toll lanes, and to us, this confirms a major flaw in the private toll lane concept,” said Stewart Schwartz, executive director of the Coalition for Smarter Growth, which advocates for walking, cycling and using public transportation as sustainable, equitable alternatives to driving.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On June 5, researchers presented their </span><a href="https://jlarc.virginia.gov/pdfs/reports/Rpt590.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">results</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to state lawmakers. The findings also included a review of the state’s </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title33.2/chapter18/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">public-private transportation partnerships</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which are agreements between the state and private entities to develop and operate toll roads.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">NoVa tolls and highway congestion</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the report, five toll operators manage over 100 miles of road in Northern Virginia alone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Jeremy McPike, D-Prince William, whose district encompasses toll lanes, said on June 5 that the state&#8217;s review of contracts with toll operators is key to addressing the costs for drivers. Researchers said the contracts allow operators to determine access and are rated based on several factors including a vehicle’s weight, type and number of axles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McPike hopes the Department of Transportation will focus on standardizing the contract provisions with toll operators to ensure they&#8217;re applied “fairly and equitably across all around the system.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Research staff also found that some drivers had trouble navigating express lanes because of the “complex nature of facilities and tolling,” such as limited entry and exit ramps and dynamic toll pricing, which can vary based on the traffic conditions to maintain a free-flowing level.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just 44% of drivers in Northern Virginia understood the requirements to use </span><a href="https://vdot.virginia.gov/travel-traffic/commuters/hov/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">high occupancy vehicle</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or HOV lanes, the report revealed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Researchers said most Northern Virginia drivers correctly identified the toll price when shown a static image of a toll sign, compared to others who were less likely to understand toll price when shown a video approaching a toll sign.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Researchers recommended that the Virginia Department of Transportation require toll operators to use signage consistent with existing signage, especially for state roads.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While researchers found some benefits to the toll operator partnerships, they also found contractual restrictions complicate attempts to alleviate congestion around Northern Virginia’s Occoquan, one of the most congested traffic areas in the commonwealth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adding more lanes on I-95 may not be a cost-effective long-term solution to congestion, according to VDOT, which researchers cited in their report.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McPike said there are other plans to help address congestion in the region, such as expanding rail services, “but the long-lasting growth projections still have failing infrastructure that needs to be addressed by Virginia. It’s gotta start soon, or else we&#8217;re going to continue to be decades behind.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Researchers said a 2012 toll operator contract requires the state to pay penalties if a project in the region diverts traffic away from I-95 and the express lanes, decreasing revenue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the contract, Virginia would be required to pay the toll operator if it adds general lanes on I-95, on the Occoquan Bridge on Route 1 or if it expands Route 1 from Lorton Road in Fairfax County to Garrisonville Road in Stafford.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What the study said about I-81</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State officials have considered using a public-private partnership toll system to improve the 325-mile Interstate 81, which runs north to south through the western part of the commonwealth. However, researchers told lawmakers the concept would not be suitable given the “substantial” state contribution required. The measure would have cost up to $13 billion for a car-only tolled lane.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I-81 does not have enough congestion to warrant creating a toll system on the corridor, researchers said, despite its daily use by freight truck drivers and other travelers who use it to connect to dozens of communities, colleges, and businesses. The area’s traveling terrain and the trucks make delays less predictable compared to other interstates in Virginia, and they are likely due to random incidents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kim Sandum, an Alliance for the Shenandoah Valley coordinator and transportation lead, said she hoped researchers would have focused more on addressing the safety issues instead of congestion on I-81. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In December 2018, the Commonwealth Transportation Board </span><a href="https://www.ctb.virginia.gov/projects/major_projects/i-81_study.asp" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">adopted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> findings from an I-81 Corridor Improvement Plan, which she said focused on addressing the corridor’s safety issues, which stem from its constrained configuration, and lack of capacity and reliable detour routes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That whole process had to do with fixing the safety issues so that you wouldn&#8217;t have the six-mile traffic back up when a truck crashes,” Sandum said. “Secondarily [it] addressed congestion, but the focus of the fixes was safety,” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She added &#8220;congestion isn&#8217;t the issue on 81 like it is on 95. Safety is the issue on 81 that leads to congestion when an incident happens.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia is expediting plans to widen I-81 in the Salem area. Last month, lawmakers agreed on a budget that appropriates $70 million in fiscal year 2025 for the project and up to $175 million from year-end revenue surpluses for the next three fiscal years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The commonwealth is also expected to receive $42 million from the federal government for I-81 corridor improvements, but additional funding would be needed to complete them. Staff said increasing the regional fuel tax by one cent per gallon is the most feasible path to raising the money, with a potential annual revenue of $10 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other funding options could include adding a regional surcharge to the state’s highway use fee or considering a user fee and other taxes for electric and fuel-efficient vehicles, including heavy EV vehicles.</span></p>

(Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A handful of Virginia school boards are exiting the Virginia School Board Association, the longest-running organization dedicated to supporting school boards in the commonwealth, over claims that it has failed to meet their needs and doesn’t align with their conservative values.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gina Patterson, executive director of VSBA, established in 1906, said she would not comment on the claims made by the few boards but instead responded that the association’s decisions are based on the school boards’ priorities, not staff’s.</span></p>

<p>Bedford County</p>
<p>Isle of Wight County</p>
<p>Orange County</p>
<p>Rockingham County</p>
<p>Warren County</p>
<p><em>*List as of June 14 at 5 p.m.</em></p>
</div>
	</div>
	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What we do is based on the decisions of the majority of our members, based on legislative positions and how they want us to lobby for or against something at the General Assembly,” Patterson told the Mercury.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VSBA offers school boards networking opportunities, professional development sessions, optional add-on policy and legal services, governance training, and can assist with superintendent searches.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conservative and some newly elected board members, including those from Warren and Orange counties, said the organization wasn’t incorporating their legislative priorities and providing training that mirrors their principles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before they were elected, some of those school boards’ members campaigned on certain parents’ frustration with how school boards operated by allowing “divisive concepts” in schools, endangering students, adopting controversial policies around transgender students and books, and renaming schools and mascots connected to the racist ideals of the Confederacy. Gov. Glenn Youngkin focused his campaign on many of the same issues. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tiffany Van Der Hyde, executive director of We The People, a 501(c)(4) nonprofit organization tracking shifts in school board memberships, said Gov. Youngkin rallying with parents over education issues in 2021 contributed to some Virginia school boards’ political polarization and the exodus of many of their members.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s election “empowered a lot of far-right candidates to seek office in this space, and we saw a lot of really great conservative, local school board members across the state decide not to run again,” Hyde said.“ They just didn&#8217;t want to be a part of it and when they left, the more extreme candidates filled those gaps.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Boards exit from VSBA</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some school board members claimed that VSBA, which the boards pay through agreements, has failed to prove its value to their communities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Warren County Board Member Ralph Rinaldi said during a Sept. 6 vote to leave the VSBA that he believed the school staff and board could govern themselves and implement policies relating to issues like school discipline without the association.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They do provide some services that are worthwhile, but I look at the return for what we&#8217;re putting in and what we&#8217;re getting, then I look at our geographic location, and there are other counties here in the [Shenandoah Valley] that sort of get snubbed by them,” Rinaldi said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Warren County School Board became one of the earliest to decline to renew its membership with VSBA, followed most recently by boards in Orange County and Rockingham County. Rockingham voted to begin its membership with the alternative School Board Member Alliance, but keep VSBA’s policy services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On May 20, board members in Orange County voted not to renew their agreements with VSBA, citing thousands of dollars in costs and saying they could find resources elsewhere. Members are also only attending some training sessions, which carry additional fees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Orange County board member Darlene Dawson claimed that the VSBA has been a “monopoly” for a long time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They self-identify as a lobbying organization, and they lobby for many things that I, on principle, stand against, and I&#8217;m not interested in supporting them,” Dawson said in May. “I prefer to take my training from someone who supports my values.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">A controversial alternative</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="http://mysbma.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">School Board Member Alliance of Virginia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a conservative-leaning group and nonprofit organization, has emerged as a popular alternative for some of VSBA’s former school board members in the past year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of June 12, the association represents one-tenth of Virginia&#8217;s school boards members and supports parental rights, educational freedom for families and traditional academics. Unlike the VSBA, the Alliance offers individual memberships. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our professional development is based on the powers and duties afforded to school board members under Virginia law,” said Shelly Norden, spokesperson for SBMA. “We believe every child deserves a quality education in a safe and disruption-free environment. School boards have the legal authority to ensure this is happening.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alliance members and leaders have reportedly </span><a href="https://www.wavy.com/news/local-news/york-county-school-board-org-threatened-board-member-ahead-of-vote/#:~:text=YORK%20COUNTY%2C%20Va.,obtained%20by%20WAVY%20News%2010." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">threatened</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a board member in York County (which the SBMA refutes) and </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/virginia-confederate-school-names-26db1b3532208ef8fb1f545c1482b9ff" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rebranded</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> two schools with Confederate names in Shenandoah County.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Norden said the alliance’s members were elected to local school boards to serve their constituents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“SBMA launched to give school board members a choice when it comes to professional development,” Norden said in an email to the Mercury. “Our goal is to continue adding professional development opportunities and services that will enable our members to serve their communities effectively.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Keeping the agreement</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some board members have been unsuccessful in swaying their colleagues to retain their membership with VSBA, despite the organization’s long history and track record of advocacy. Others remain optimistic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think you get out of these organizations, what you put into them, and if you choose to attend the professional development conferences and sessions that each organization offers, I think you will get more out of it than you think,” said Robert Hundley Jr., a Hanover County school board member and former VSBA board president, at a June 11 Hanover County School Board meeting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other members across the commonwealth expressed concern that leaving VSBA could impact whether their school’s policies and procedures would be updated to ensure the division’s compliance with state laws. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That&#8217;s what it does,” said Orange County Board Member Jack Rickett, who voted against leading VSBA. “Can other people do that? Yes, they can … Lawyers are going to cost money, and we will have extensive legal fees when we remove ourselves from the VSBA.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Rockingham County, board member Jackie Lohr pointed out that VSBA’s position as a lobbyist for school boards gives members a way to influence policymakers that they wouldn’t otherwise have.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When we&#8217;re no longer members, we no longer have a voice, we no longer have a vote,” Lohr said at the June 10 Rockingham school board meeting. “They are a big, big machine and they will continue to lobby, and they have the ears of a lot of politicians and if we&#8217;re not there to provide the conservative voice, no one else will be.”</span></p>
<p><em>Correction: This story inadvertently published that Warren County Board Member Tom McFadden Jr. voted against renewing the membership instead of Ralph Rinaldi. </em></p>

(Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia NAACP on Tuesday filed a lawsuit against the Shenandoah County School Board for what it called “reaffirming discrimination,” after the school system voted to rebrand schools with Confederate names in May. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lawsuit alleges that the school board violated the U.S. Constitution, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Equal Educational Opportunity Act. The plaintiffs seek to remove the Confederate names, mascots and vestiges, and to prevent any future school naming involving Confederate leaders or references to the Confederacy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On May 10, the Shenandoah County School Board </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/virginia-confederate-school-names-26db1b3532208ef8fb1f545c1482b9ff" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reversed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a 2020 decision by a previous board to rename two schools after Confederate Generals Turner Ashby, Robert E. Lee and Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson. In 2021, the schools on the division’s southern campus, which included North Fork Middle, were renamed from Stonewall Jackson High School to Mountain View, and Ashby-Lee Elementary School to Honey Run.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shenandoah County Public Schools responded to a request for comment, but did not immediately provide remarks.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_38925" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:1024px;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-38925" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_2528-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_2528-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_2528-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_2528-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_2528-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_2528-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  A view from outside Stonewall Jackson High School in Shenandoah County.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This backward move has received a negative reaction all over the world, and the world is watching to see if this variety of the seeds of hate and disenfranchisement will take root and return Shenandoah County and the commonwealth of Virginia to the days when racial exclusion was the law of the land,” said Rev. Cozy Bailey, president of the Virginia NAACP.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Tuesday, Bailey, members of the state NAACP and their attorneys gathered with about 45 community members and students in front of the Shenandoah County Circuit Court to announce the legal action against the school board’s decision to restore Confederate names to the schools. It appears to be the first school district in the country to do so. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bailey described the board’s decision on May 10 as “cold-hearted” and reminiscent of the Jim Crow era. He said the organization is not trying to revise history, but is “chartering” a better path for the future by learning from the past and not making the same mistakes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some people, including a portion of Shenandoah residents who support the school names reversal, believe the Confederacy represents a heritage of Southerners’ courage against the federal Union while fighting for the rights of southern states. Others, including civil rights groups and some Shenandoah students and families, view the Confederacy as defenders of slavery and a foundational part of America’s history of racism.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Between the 1950s and 1960s, local leaders in Shenandoah County named public schools after Confederate leaders.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since that time, a movement to make schools more inclusive and equitable has advanced in courtrooms and through legislation at the state and federal levels. In recent years, localities statewide have made a concerted effort to address the commonwealth’s history of white supremacist ideology and historical practices of creating unfair advantages for white people by implementing policy changes and hosting community discussions on these topics. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several Virginia communities renamed roads that bore the names of people connected to slavery and removed signs and symbols of the Confederacy, such as statues.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attorneys from the Washington Lawyers’ Committee and Covington &amp; Burling LLP are representing the plaintiffs — the NAACP and five current students in Shenandoah County Public Schools. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marja Plater, senior counsel with the Washington Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs, said the Confederate generals believed deeply and fought to preserve the ideology of white supremacy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is what these men are known for,” Plater said. “Honoring them is to honor the legacy of discrimination.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Ashley Joyner Chavous, an attorney with Covington &amp; Burling, the community was involved early in the process of pushing back against the renamed schools, before the legal team received assistance from families in the community and their “brave” children who stepped up to share their perspectives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;ve only come to learn more, and we look forward to engaging with the community as we proceed in this meditation,” Chavous said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lawsuit was filed Tuesday in the Western District Court of Virginia in Harrisonburg. A judge and court date have not been set.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to documents from the Virginia Department of Education, the private institution in Southwest Virginia joins more than a dozen institutions that are not being considered, some of which have withdrawn their applications including Eastern Shore Community College, Southside Virginia Community College, Hampton University and the University of Lynchburg.</span></p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Virginia education board approves six more lab schools to aid students; is the process too quick?&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/01/virginia-education-board-approves-six-more-lab-schools-to-aid-students-is-the-process-too-quick/embed/#?secret=NFoPU5Y9Me#?secret=KxYUcfBdfy" data-secret="KxYUcfBdfy" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ferrum College President Mirta Martin blamed the state for changes during the review process after it received a nearly $200,000 lab school planning grant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Martin said she </span><a href="https://www.ferrum.edu/news/ferrum-college-receives-virginia-department-of-education-grant-for-partnership-laboratory-school-with-franklin-county-public-schools/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">received</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a call from Secretary of Education Aimee Guidera last month to break the news.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“At that point, I told her very candidly, I&#8217;m not going to go down silently into the night because this is not a political issue; this is doing the right thing for some of the most underserved populations in Virginia,” Martin said in an interview last month with the Mercury.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Virginia Department of Education, Ferrum received additional time to respond to questions before ultimately having its application axed by the department from consideration for the College Partnership Laboratory School committee. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration has actively sought to establish laboratory schools, much like charter schools, to offer another layer of educational choices with specialized instruction. But opponents, including Democrats, say the schools take away from public school funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of the approval process, which involves the Department of Education reviewing elements such as curriculum details and budget assumptions, applicants are welcome to withdraw their applications at any time and resubmit them at a later time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Christian Martinez, a spokesman for the governor&#8217;s office, said Guidera and the staff at the Virginia Department of Education have “openly communicated” that the new budget language reduces the available funding for lab school operations, which will impact the evaluation of some proposals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Private institutions, including Ferrum, faced another challenge during the process when the governor and lawmakers agreed to a budget last month requiring them to submit their applications along with a four-year public institution of higher education to handle the financial and administrative duties for each lab school and enact an annual reporting requirement related to financial sustainability.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As Virginia continues to emerge as a national leader in lab school development, Governor Youngkin will focus on restoring excellence in education by creating innovative pathways for students to explore potential careers and better prepare for their future in the commonwealth,” said Martinez.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Ferrum’s view of the process</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ferrum officials pointed to the ongoing rule changes as to why its application failed to reach the application committee for review.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The college requested $10.6 million for the initial four years, which is more than schools like James Madison University with a larger enrollment size requested. JMU asked for $7 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Martin said the requested funding is to cover a larger territory compared to other institutions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to published documents that were later removed from the education department’s website, the agency first received Ferrum College’s Academy for Opportunity and Innovation application on Feb. 1. The proposed academy would have focused on providing high school students interested in employment in public service and health-related fields.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Officials also said many of the committee’s questions had already been answered or included in the application.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to college officials, the department asked Ferrum to expand the application from Franklin County High School to 12 school divisions after submitting the first version of its application. Ferrum officials said they made the changes despite the potential commuting challenges in the Southwest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Officials also had another challenge when state lawmakers added language into the two-year budget requiring private institutions to partner with public institutions on lab school applications.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If the rules had been consistent from the beginning of the process, we would have had a fiscal partner out from day one, but that was introduced after we were already waiting in line to get in front of the standing committee,” said Jason Powell, associate vice president of academic affairs and chief innovation and research officer at Ferrum College.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Powell, the administrative costs for those grants are likely to increase, even double, after the budget decision.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the projected costs, Martin said Ferrum would be willing to find a four-year public institution partner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We were never afforded that opportunity, but if afforded the opportunity, we will comply,” Martin said. “We will find a fiscal agent that will partner with us … to be able to provide this critical education to this underserved population.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Lab schools update</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On May 21, following an hour-long closed session with its legal team, the Board of Education approved two lab school applications: one from Old Dominion University to create a school in Suffolk, the other from George Mason University to create a school in Frederick.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These two lab schools will bring valuable STEM education to the Hampton Roads and Shenandoah Valley communities and bring our total to 14 across the commonwealth,” said Youngkin in a May 22 statement. Lab schools have been a priority education issue for Youngkin’s administration and a sticking point of debate among Democratic legislators.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In partnership with higher education institutions, creating the state-approved curriculum, lab schools offer students tuition-free instruction for careers in computer science and technology. Lab school admission is based on a lottery system. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Five schools that submitted successful lab school applications — Emory &amp; Henry and Roanoke Colleges, and Mountain Gateway, Paul D. Camp and Germanna Community Colleges — will be </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/education/virginia-lab-schools-youngkin-surovell-department-of-education/article_e8202bfe-17ba-11ef-a75d-2b10360fd953.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">required to resubmit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> them after language in the recently passed state budget emphasized that state code does not allow lab school funding to go to private or two-year colleges, a position Democrats have long held.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Todd Reid, a spokesman with the VDOE, said it would not be able to provide an update on the status of the applications submitted by private institutions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Youngkin administration, with support from the attorney’s general office, previously said that state law does not prohibit the committee from accepting applications from all institutions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No new funding for lab schools was included in the two-year budget, after the governor proposed $60 million for them which lawmakers declined to add to the spending plan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the committee’s June documents, the state’s current lab school fund balance is $9,647,232. Norfolk State University, and prospective partners Old Dominion and Eastern Shore Community College, are expected to meet with the lab school committee on June 10.</span></p>

(Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Officials from Virginia Commonwealth University and VCU Health System told lawmakers on Wednesday they are reviewing an agreement to pay the city of Richmond approximately $2.5 million annually in lieu of taxes for a development that was never built, after the school paid the city, investors and developers nearly $80 million to exit the failed building project. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2021, VCU Health System signed a lease with a developer to construct the Clay Street Project, which included a medical tower, office and retail space and parking on the site of Richmond’s former Public Safety Building at Clay and 10th Streets. At the time, VCU agreed to pay the city a total of $56 million in lieu of taxes for the $325 million project, which was to be paid out in increments of $2.5 million annually, according to the </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/business/real-estate/clay-street-public-safety-building-failed-development/article_454fc558-dfb4-11ee-84ed-9f90d77ad1f2.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richmond Times-Dispatch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, a year later the partnership ended after the developer and the health system could not agree to terms on the budget due to unsuitable site conditions and increased construction costs. As part of the health system’s plan to cancel the project, it paid $80 million, but the annual $2.5 million payments to the city in lieu of taxes continued. Now, lawmakers and VCU Health leaders are questioning and investigating whether the annual payments are legal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VCU’s health system was directed to terminate the payments, according to </span><a href="https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/amendment/2024/1/HB30/Introduced/CR/C-14/1c" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">language</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> included in the recently approved state biennium budget. Under that measure, the health system must provide a report to the legislature on the status of that decision by Oct. 1.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Speaking in the past tense, I think at the time that this was agreed to, it was felt to be correct to do that; in the present tense, that’s being reviewed and why we are currently in conversations with the city about that very topic,” said Marlon Levy, interim CEO of VCU Health System.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission, which conducts analysis and provides oversight of state agencies on behalf of the General Assembly, VCU Health has made at least one $2.5 million payment to the city.</span></p>
<p>Petula Burks, a spokeswoman for the city of Richmond, said in a statement: “The city believes the guaranteed obligation agreed to by VCUHS needs to be honored. It is a contractual requirement entered into by VCHUS of their own volition.”</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Jeremy McPike, D-Prince William, said, however, “you can’t tax something that doesn’t exist,” throwing in his support for officials to review the agreement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“[VCU] has no controlling interest at this point,” McPike said. “The only way to pass through IRS tax exemption to a leasehold is to have an actionable operation of a leased facility or a component of [one], of which it has none.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, lawmakers directed researchers to conduct the study and review the health system’s response to the Clay Street Project.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Officials from VCU addressed lawmakers following a presentation by the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission, which reviewed the roles and responsibilities of the VCU Health System’s Board of Directors, the system’s governance structure, and the capital procurement process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hal Greer, staff director for JLARC, said the report only focuses on the findings and recommendations to improve VCU’s capital processing infrastructure. No recommendations were made regarding the Clay Street Project.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VCU President Michael Rao, who also serves as the health system’s president, said on Wednesday that acquiring the property was important for the system’s future in 2021. But the project became “impossible” with national economic pressures such as inflation intensifying during the pandemic.</span></p>

(Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Researchers said VCU Health had improved its capital process by hiring outside consultants and revising its capital project process. Still, they said, more work is needed to develop a long-term strategic capital plan, strengthen several policies, and increase staffing to handle capital projects that can sustain and expand the system’s operations effectively.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two key recommendations included eliminating the health system president position and creating two separate positions, VCU Health System CEO and VCU SVP of health sciences, roles that are currently combined. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both recommendations would require changes to the Code of Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Researchers recommended the president’s position be eliminated because it&#8217;s a conflict of interest. The health system president is also the university president.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Board members told the research team that they believe the university president should not be the board chair, should not be able to vote, and supported eliminating the position. According to JLARC staff, the president has the authority to evaluate the performance of the health system CEO and recommend compensation for that person, and can schedule executive committee meetings and modify the order of business for the Board of Directors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rao said he supports the idea of the position being eliminated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These are roles that a lot of my colleagues, regardless of the structure around the nation, do not share with me,” Rao said, adding that it can be confusing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">JLARC staff also recommended that the health system’s board members have longer terms, possess expertise in additional topics relevant to  health system governance, and be impartial. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VCU officials said after the presentation that plans to address JLARC’s recommendations are underway.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state budget adopted in May includes a stark change from one of Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s transportation-related amendments: the newly enacted budget allows the Northern Virginia Transportation Commission — the regional body of jurisdictions responsible for funding the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (Metro) — to keep its trust fund intact.</span></p>

</ul>
</div>
	</div>
	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Late in the months-long budget deliberations, Youngkin </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/04/17/youngkin-proposes-using-nova-investment-fund-to-support-metro/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">proposed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> additional funding for Metro, but it would’ve stripped money from NVTC’s investment fund that’s used by Northern Virginia jurisdictions. The governor eventually agreed with lawmakers on a spending plan that didn’t dip into NVTC’s fund. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s a step forward and it&#8217;s a credit to the legislature as well as the governor for coming together,” said Matt de Ferranti, the commission’s chair. “[We’re] also quite</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">lucky that the economy has been going so well that we&#8217;re able to have the funding; this means that the plans that all the Northern Virginia jurisdictions in NVTC had for spending the money can now be followed through on.”</span></p>
<p>Funding for the trust fund is generated by localities in <span class="c-mrkdwn__highlight">Northern Virginia</span> to help cover the cost of Metro’s operations. If the money from the trust fund had been used under the governor&#8217;s proposed amendment, it could have depleted the fund and forced localities to find other means to pay Metro in fiscal year 2026.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for Metro, de Ferranti said Metro has made some significant decisions to address the projected $750 million shortfall. He noted that leaders now have to work with the agency to address the long-term funding challenges for Metro, which is the “economic backbone of this state.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During this year’s legislative session, Metro asked legislators to consider taking action by adjusting the 3% cap on annual state funds provided to Metro, which prevents jurisdictions from overpaying. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a </span><a href="https://www.mwcog.org/documents/2023/12/19/chief-administrative-officers-workgroup-on-wmata-cost-structure---interim-report-metro-initiatives/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> prepared by the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments, Metro, over the past three years, provided Maryland, Virginia and Washington, D.C. a credit of $196 million due to jurisdictions’ unclear funding during the pandemic. The agency also waived the 6% annual increase over two years and reduced the baseline subsidy levels for subsequent budgets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MWCOG found that the subsidy payments did not account for the “historic levels of inflation” and increased costs stemming from labor agreements, which resulted in an additional deficit of about $266 million.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Metro</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Metro received millions in additional funding from Virginia, Maryland and Washington D.C. to meet the projected shortfall threatening services and jobs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s spending plan includes $144.7 million in additional funding for Metro that temporarily suspends the 3% cap that was </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title33.2/chapter15/section33.2-1526.1/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">enacted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2018.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We appreciate the collaboration of our regional partners on this board-approved budget that will keep our community moving,” said Randy Clarke, Metro General Manager and CEO, in a statement. “This region is a great place to live, work, and play, and our recent ridership reflects the vital role Metro plays in getting people where they need to go.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The agency says it has found $50 million in cost efficiencies, but will also be increasing fares by 12.5%, which keeps fares in line with inflation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In April, Metro adopted a $4.8 billion capital and operating budget. Officials in the region offered </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/01/11/council-suggests-virginia-reset-subsidy-payments-to-metro-amid-budget-shortfall/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for helping to address funding needs for the agency in the short and long term.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am proud of the historic, bipartisan budget last month that invests in highways and public transit across Virginia,” said House Transportation Chair Karrie Delaney, D-Fairfax, in a statement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She said the investments mean Virginians can get where they’re going “safely and on time,” and will help address WMATA’s short-term funding needs. Delaney said another measure she is proud to support is the establishment of the Northern Virginia Growing Needs of Public Transit Joint </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+ful+SJ28ER+pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subcommittee</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which will study long-term, sustainable, dedicated operations and capital funding for Metro. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I look forward to working with my colleagues on the subcommittee and in the General Assembly to finally present a plan that prioritizes long-term reliability to the public,” she said.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Toll relief</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After budget discussions, lawmakers kept their original relief package for toll users in Hampton Roads by dedicating $101 million in budget funds over the next two years to support discounted tolls for eligible drivers earning less than $50,000 annually.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Finance and Appropriations Chair Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, campaigned on a relief package which, when combined with the state’s existing </span><a href="https://www.vdottollrelief.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Toll Relief program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, could net eligible drivers a 100% toll rebate for up to 14 trips per week through the Elizabeth River Tunnels until 2036. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">I-81 widening</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia has its eyes set on expediting the widening of a much-used corridor of Interstate 81 in the Salem area. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The budget lawmakers approved provides $70 million in fiscal year 2025 and additional language that designates up to $175 million from year-end revenue surpluses for the </span><a href="https://improve81.vdot.virginia.gov/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I-81 improvement program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the next three fiscal years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 325-mile corridor connects dozens of communities, colleges and universities, and is key to transporting freight.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Virginia Department of Transportation, nearly 50% of the state’s value of goods are transported through the corridor, which has the highest per capita truck volume in the commonwealth.<br />
</span></p>

(Virginia Department of Rail and Public Transportation)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Starting next summer, the Virginia Breeze bus line will offer customers the state’s first east-west bi-directional bus service, from Harrisonburg to Virginia Beach, via the Tidewater Current.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Tidewater Current will run year-round and make stops at Virginia Beach, Norfolk, Newport News, Williamsburg, New Kent, Richmond, Charlottesville and Harrisonburg, according to a recent announcement by the Virginia Department of Rail and Public Transportation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jennifer DeBruhl, the outgoing director for DRPT, told the Mercury in March that there has been increasing demand for transportation options to travel across the commonwealth. She said the route name Tidewater Current is derived from the Hampton Roads region’s former moniker and represents a connection to Virginia’s coast. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As I conclude my time as DRPT Director, this route expansion is not just a project, but a legacy that I am proud to leave behind,” said DeBruhl in a May 21 statement. “I am grateful to have been a part of this journey from the beginning and to have helped connect underserved communities throughout the commonwealth.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Tidewater Current was one of two bus routes being considered by the board. The alternative was a longer route that would have cost the state about $572,000 and included stops in Suffolk, Petersburg and Richmond’s Staples Mills area, a transportation hub which is also home to Amtrak’s </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/business/development/amtrak-train-staples-mill-virginia-henrico/article_3a88b7b8-d73c-11ee-b389-07beb63b0366.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">most-used train station</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the Southeast.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More passengers are projected to use the Tidewater Current route, which will need $506,010 in annual operating costs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The service is funded through the Federal Transit Administration’s Intercity Bus Program, ticket sales, and I-81 improvement funding from the Virginia Department of Transportation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A one-way ride on the Tidewater Current is estimated to take less than seven hours. Ticket prices have yet to be determined.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Breeze has generated nearly 220,000 rides in its history and ridership increased by 10% from 2023 to 2024, according to DRPT. Out-of-state travel connections have also increased by 53% during the same period.</span></p>

Board of Education</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ruling, which mandated public school desegregation nationwide, Virginia’s scholarship fund named after the landmark Supreme Court case has gained $2.5 million in federal and state aid.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state’s Brown v. Board of Education scholarship fund now stands at more than $3.4 million, after $500,000 in federal funds were awarded in March and $2 million in state funds were confirmed in the commonwealth’s newly passed two-year spending plan, according to the scholarship committee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At a Wednesday morning meeting, the committee elected Sen. Angelia Williams Graves, D-Norfolk, as chair. In an email to the Mercury  after the meeting, Graves wrote that she’s “grateful” the committee was able to receive the funds “so that we can continue to contribute to the education of Virginians adversely affected by the Brown v. Board of Education decision and their descendants.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since 2004, the purpose of the fund has been to support descendants of people denied a public education during Massive Resistance, when Virginia imposed laws to prevent school desegregation and allowed some schools to close to avoid integrating. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ken Woodley, an author and former journalist who originally proposed the fund, urged federal and state lawmakers to make contributions after the committee learned last year it had less than $1 million available.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Creigh Deeds, D-Charlottesville, and Del. Terry Kilgore, R-Scott, proposed legislation requesting $5 million for the fund in the state budget. On the federal level, U.S. Sens. Mark Warner and Tim Kaine requested $1 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In December, the committee capped the number of awardees at 10 because of uncertainty with the state budget. Once the state and federal funds were confirmed, Woodley wrote in a </span><a href="https://brownscholarship.virginia.gov/pdf/meetings/5-22-24-Meeting/Descendants-scholarship-funding-budget-appropriation.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">May 14 letter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that he hoped the funding would allow the committee to increase the number of scholarships</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Wednesday, the committee approved 40 to 45 eligible applications pending further review, according to Graves&#8217; office.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“God’s fingerprints have always been all over this program since it fell into my mind on February 18, 2003. But God’s fingerprints are not alone,” Woodley wrote. “As is so often the case when something of goodness blossoms in this world, human fingerprints join God’s &#8230; in [the] most important ways.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Woodley said everyone’s “fingerprints are all over this first Civil Rights-era reparation” in U.S. history.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am deeply thankful for all that each of you has done and will do for this healing program,” he said.</span></p>

Education groups still doubt that the state's current spending on teacher salaries is enough to reverse current staffing shortfalls. (Ned Oliver/ Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legislation that would have aligned Virginia teachers’ pay with the national average or higher by the 2027-28 school year won bipartisan support but was blocked from the state budget by Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+amd+HB187AG" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">veto</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last week. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two-year budget, signed last week, includes $540 million to help pay for 3% salary increases for teachers and state employees in both years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The governor said he supported the goal of “ensuring that teachers and state-funded education support positions are funded competitively,” but didn’t approve the bill to boost educators’ salaries to the national average because it relied heavily on what he viewed as flawed data from the </span><a href="https://www.nea.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Education Association</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which represents educators across the country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his veto, the governor said the legislation does not “accurately reflect” the state of teacher compensation in Virginia and that NEA’s methodology includes substitute teacher compensation and fails to account for supplemental salary expenditures in determining teacher compensation. He added that the legislation does not account for various scenarios, such as an economic downturn or state of emergency, that could impact teacher pay rates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The measure also didn’t include Youngkin’s earlier recommendation to create an annual teacher compensation review.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Consistent, annual reporting of accurate teacher compensation data is essential for lawmakers and the governor to make sound decisions,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The governor further explained his veto by noting that since 2021, the state has invested $1.6 billion to grow teacher salaries by 23%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin said that Virginia‘s average teacher pay was already projected to hit the national average this fiscal year. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Education Association argued that the governor’s administration is “mistakenly” making comparisons between the estimated national teacher pay average in the National Education Association Rankings and Estimates report and the Virginia estimate in the Virginia Department of Education (VDOE) </span><a href="https://us-west-2.protection.sophos.com/?d=virginia.gov&amp;u=aHR0cHM6Ly9yZ2EubGlzLnZpcmdpbmlhLmdvdi9QdWJsaXNoZWQvMjAyNC9SRDg4L1BERiNwYWdlPTY=&amp;p=m&amp;i=NjE2MDc1YzFjYTYxZmYwZjRhYzYwMzg4&amp;t=SFE4R0lZNUdrNnYreW1VU1hKaHArc0R5TEVRMW1icGZTZzJjTWE2REJ6ND0=&amp;h=5c73f2d4bb9c4437a791f76142735cd0&amp;s=AVNPUEhUT0NFTkNSWVBUSVaWs13c0X3SBALsuplEtI0D38A8K9yJ_5AmE4RH8zYZM9y3m0T6LdZ6_pxqY5vGvdycylk0w7XlKY6v7lRlB6L6" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Annual Salary Survey Report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The estimates provided within these two reports are calculated using different data and methodologies and are not comparable,” VEA said in a </span><a href="https://www.veanea.org/vea-statement-on-veto-governor-standing-up-for-confederacy-and-sitting-down-for-teachers/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">statement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Friday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to NEA’s recent </span><a href="https://us-west-2.protection.sophos.com/?d=nea.org&amp;u=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmVhLm9yZy9zaXRlcy9kZWZhdWx0L2ZpbGVzLzIwMjQtMDQvMjAyNC1yYW5raW5ncy1hbmQtZXN0aW1hdGVzLXJlcG9ydC5wZGYjcGFnZT00NA==&amp;p=m&amp;i=NjE2MDc1YzFjYTYxZmYwZjRhYzYwMzg4&amp;t=bi9heGFSTzRhNlRnK2trakdIbTFIdXVtc0g4NlN0TDB4YUI4c1BlRnFqUT0=&amp;h=5c73f2d4bb9c4437a791f76142735cd0&amp;s=AVNPUEhUT0NFTkNSWVBUSVaWs13c0X3SBALsuplEtI0D38A8K9yJ_5AmE4RH8zYZM9y3m0T6LdZ6_pxqY5vGvdycylk0w7XlKY6v7lRlB6L6" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Virginia’s salary average is $65,058, which is below the national estimated average of $71,699.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia, like other states, provides NEA data to compile state averages in their </span><a href="https://www.nea.org/sites/default/files/2024-04/2024-rankings-and-estimates-report.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">annual reports</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, removing non-instructional positions and allowing for an “apples to apples comparison” across all the states, according to VEA.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Department of Education’s “Annual Salary Survey Report” includes all salary expenditures, including supplemental pay, for classroom teachers, homebound teachers, guidance counselors, librarians, and instructional technology positions, VEA stated. NEA includes only classroom teachers, substitutes, and homebound teachers and excludes supplemental pay. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While lawmakers debated the actual national average during this year’s session, they agreed compensation must be improved for teachers, as vacancies have grown since the pandemic. Youngkin’s veto magnified some Democratic lawmakers’ concerns with Virginia’s educator shortage.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This school year began with over 4,000 teacher vacancies across our commonwealth, and the governor is not interested in attracting or keeping teachers here. If he was, he would have signed my bill that would have ensured Virginia teachers are being paid at the national average,” said Del. Nadarius Clark, D-Suffolk, one of the bill’s carriers, along with Sen. Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clark added that the governor’s veto indicates where he stands on public education.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When the governor lets our teachers down, when he doesn’t value them, he is telling the communities they serve and their students that they don’t matter either,” Clark said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Youngkin’s veto coming in the same week as the 70th anniversary of the landmark </span><a href="https://nmaahc.si.edu/explore/initiatives/brown-v-board-70" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brown v. Board of Education</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ruling — in which the Supreme Court of the United States mandated states desegregate public schools — Lucas said the inequities the case tried to address decades ago still persist in her community and throughout Virginia, which the governor’s rejection of the bill won’t help resolve.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Governor Youngkin doesn’t care about public education and is determined to hold our students back,” Lucas said. “This is just a small part of his broader agenda to disenfranchise Virginians, and we will not stand for it.”</span></p>

(Wyatt Gordon/ For the Virginia Mercury) </p><p>Gov. Glenn Youngkin took his final <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/20/youngkin-vetoes-bills-on-contraception-access-skill-games-confederate-heritage-rollbacks/">actions on bills</a> from Virginia&#8217;s 2024 legislative session on Friday, signing seven more measures into law. One of those was <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb1071" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses%3D241%26typ%3Dbil%26val%3Dhb1071&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1716299797237000&amp;usg=AOvVaw15RzNWD4pBgCbmtsTWMGLA">legislation</a> that will expand all localities&#8217; speed-reducing authority to include roadways within a business or residential district and state-owned highways.</p>
<p>Lawmakers passed a measure a few years ago allowing localities to decrease roadway speed limits in their jurisdictions to as low as 15 mph. However, lawmakers found that the Virginia Department of Transportation <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/03/18/youngkin-administration-considers-bill-to-expand-local-authority-to-lower-speed-limits/">denied seven of eight speed limit decrease requests</a> because, by <a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title46.2/chapter8/section46.2-878/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title46.2/chapter8/section46.2-878/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1716299797237000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3O4zzlYR04-cb1Mg7FbZCK">state law</a>, only the Commissioner of Highways could authorize changes on state-maintained roads. The newly-signed bill requires counties, cities and towns to post signs reflecting reduced speed limits and to report the change to the Commissioner of Highways.</p>
<p>“While additional work will need to be done on this policy in the future to continue to improve its implementation while continuing to guarantee road safety, the bill can move forward at this time,” Youngkin wrote in a press release announcing the bills he signed and 48 others he vetoed.</p>
<p>Del. Betsy Carr, D-Richmond, sponsored the legislation, which is set to take effect July 1.</p>

Glenn Youngkin speaking with reporters outside the Capitol Building on March 7, 2024. (Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, Gov. Glenn Youngkin vetoed 48 more bills passed by the Democratic-led General Assembly, blocking legislation aimed at preserving contraception access, ending state perks for Confederate heritage groups and legalizing slot machine lookalikes known as skill games.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Friday was the governor’s deadline to act on a final batch of bills the General Assembly had returned to him in April. Most of the vetoes dealt with legislation Youngkin tried to amend in ways the legislature opposed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin has now vetoed a total of 201 bills from the 2024 legislative session, a record-setting number for a modern governor that reflects Virginia’s divided government and the dueling priorities of the state’s Democratic legislature and Republican governor. Nearly 850 bills won final approval. Here are highlights of some of the bills that met their end at the tip of Youngkin’s veto pen. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Skill games</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As expected, Youngkin vetoed a high-profile bill that would tax and regulate skill games in Virginia, a setback for gambling interests and business owners that lobbied to have the machines turned back on in convenience stores, truck stops and restaurants across the state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Skill game supporters are hoping a new bill could emerge from the remains of the one Youngkin killed, but it’s unclear when and how that might happen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislation vetoed by the governor was one of the most intensive efforts to date to convince Virginia to officially sanction machines that have evaded gambling taxes and regulation for most of their existence in the state. A ban on the machines took effect in 2021, but was suspended for nearly two years as skill game backers fought the ban in court. The Supreme Court of Virginia reinstated the ban last fall, leading to an urgent push by the skill game lobby to change the law and get rid of the ban.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="NCkGCjHhlZ"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/08/as-special-session-approaches-are-skill-games-dead-or-alive/">As special session approaches, are skill games dead or alive?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;As special session approaches, are skill games dead or alive?&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/08/as-special-session-approaches-are-skill-games-dead-or-alive/embed/#?secret=9m2fpzrFyV#?secret=NCkGCjHhlZ" data-secret="NCkGCjHhlZ" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its failure could mean the machines remain banned for at least another year, unless General Assembly leaders agree to call lawmakers back to Richmond in a few weeks or months for what would be an unusual summertime session on a gambling issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The governor had proposed a higher tax rate, stricter regulations and sweeping geographic limitations on skill games meant to stop the machines from cannibalizing revenue from Virginia’s casinos and Rosie’s gambling facilities tied to horse racing.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Access to contraceptives, bias training in maternal health care</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin vetoed</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=HB609" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> right-to-contraception legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Richmond and Del. Cia Price, D-Newport News. The lawmakers say their proposal is relevant because of the</span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/youngkin-contraception-virginia-general-assembly-hashmi-price/article_c74b197a-fb59-11ee-92c1-1b2a173616ec.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> shifting national landscape</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> surrounding reproductive health care laws and how some states are targeting</span><a href="https://stateline.org/2022/05/19/some-states-already-are-targeting-birth-control/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> birth control access.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The veto came after Youngkin had previously sought amendments to the bill that Hashmi said “gutted” it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The version of the bill that passed the legislature says that health care providers have a right to prescribe contraceptives and that people have a right to obtain them. It also offers definitions of forms of contraception, and outlines legal actions that could be taken if rights were infringed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the Supreme Court of the United States overturned federal abortion protections in 2022, Justice Clarence Thomas offered an opinion that indicated other settled cases could be revisited in the future — such as Griswold v. Connecticut, which protects contraception access. Youngkin’s previously proposed substitute would have aligned Virginia with the federal rulings. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Hashmi and Price said their legislation would be useful should the Supreme Court reverse its previous rulings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin wrote that the bill would create “an overly broad cause of action against political subdivisions and parents, as well as medical professionals.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price said in a text message that she thinks the governor is “picking and choosing so called First Amendment issues” and that his “hypocritical stances are an impediment to protecting our rights.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She added that lawmakers will try again on the bill. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I will continue to fight for this,” she said. “It’s too important to not (do so).”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin also vetoed another reproductive health bill that he’d first tried to change. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 35 would require unconscious bias and cultural competency training when renewing medical licenses. It was among a suite of bills aimed at improving maternal health —</span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/government-politics/virginia-black-maternal-health-carroll-foy-youngkin/article_4608fd84-d1ae-11ee-8379-138efdfc34c7.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> particularly Black maternal health</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — that cleared the legislature this year, some of which Youngkin has signed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On this bill, he&#8217;d sought amendments that advocates for the measure worried would have made trainings just a “</span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/youngkin-doulas-black-maternal-health-general-assembly/article_34a9f222-f379-11ee-8dc9-e36a8194fce6.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">checked box.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His proposed substitute would have required completion of “two hours of continuing learning activities that address maternal health care for populations of women that data indicate experience significantly greater than average maternal mortality, including African American, indigenous, and Hispanic women and women in underserved rural communities.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In explaining his veto, Youngkin noted how the legislature did not accept his amendment but that he wants to keep working with lawmakers on maternal health issues. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I will continue working with the General Assembly on our shared goals of providing more support for mothers and mothers-to-be,” he wrote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Galina Varchena, a policy director with Birth In Color, previously told the </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/youngkin-doulas-black-maternal-health-general-assembly/article_34a9f222-f379-11ee-8dc9-e36a8194fce6.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richmond Times-Dispatch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the original version of the bill would be crucial to ensure training is evidence-based — something that was missing from Youngkin’s proposal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s so easy to put something in place and then pretend that it solved a problem,” Varchena said. “We need to make sure that when we’re talking about training — is it working?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A study shows that Black people are more likely to</span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7384760" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> experience negative maternal health outcomes, in part, due to providers’ racial bias</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hestat/maternal-mortality/2021/maternal-mortality-rates-2021.htm" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Black women are also more likely to die from pregnancy complications than white women</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill’s key patron, Sen. Mamie Locke, D-Hampton, stressed that the bill could play a role in better health outcomes. She accused Youngkin on social media of having a “lack of understanding” through his veto and that the very unconscious bias the bill hoped to help solve played a role in his action. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This bill was not about partisanship or ideology,” she wrote on X, the site formerly known as Twitter. “It was about ensuring better healthcare outcomes for patients, mothers and their babies. It is a shame unconscious bias drove this veto.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Clean energy bank</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Included in the round of vetoes was Youngkin’s rejection of a bill to create a </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB729" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clean Energy Innovation Bank</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a funding mechanism designed to tap into hundreds of millions of dollars coming from the federal government in the form of loans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, and Del. Alfonso Lopez, D-Arlington, carried the bill this session after hearing a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/12/11/feds-pitch-virginia-on-loan-opportunities-for-renewable-energy-transition/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">presentation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the U.S. Department of Energy&#8217;s Loan Program </span><a href="https://studiesvirginiageneralassembly.s3.amazonaws.com/meeting_docs/documents/000/001/884/original/U.S._Dept._Energy_Lon_Programs_Office.pdf?1701876345" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Office</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the state’s ability to get funding for about 80% of the costs of clean energy projects, including those that transition fossil fuel sites into renewable sources. The state would only have to put up about 3% of a project’s funding in order to receive the long-term, lower-interest financing option.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Utility providers and homeowners would have been eligible for the financing, and projects that reduce greenhouse gas emissions, with a 15% cap on funds disbursed for projects involving coal bed </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/12/20/new-report-says-virginia-could-incentivize-methane-capture-from-coal-mines/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">methane</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and new </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/04/10/governor-amends-vetoes-and-signs-energy-environment-bills/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">nuclear</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, such as a small modular reactor.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="6o9qivvAzO"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/04/10/governor-amends-vetoes-and-signs-energy-environment-bills/">Governor amends, vetoes and signs energy, environment bills</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin had previously tried to put a re-enactment clause on the bill, which would’ve required it to be passed again next session before becoming effective. The legislature rejected that amendment during the reconvened session. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While I agree with the underlying purpose behind the legislation, regrettably, the General Assembly did not adopt my recommendations which would have allowed the opportunity for conflicts between the entity created by this legislation and existing programs at the Virginia Department of Energy to be resolved,” Youngkin said in his </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/governor-of-virginia/pdf/Veto-Statements.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">veto</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> memo.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Surovell, the governor had said at one point that other state agencies could have acted as the State Energy Financing Institution and received the federal funding, such as the Department of Housing and Community Development taking in money for energy efficiency efforts. Another difference, Surovell said, was the governor wanted to have the bank overseen by the Virginia Department of Energy, which would answer more directly to the administration instead of the 12-member board with non-legislative citizens that the bill would’ve created to oversee financing of projects statewide. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I wanted to create one SEFI that could finance everything,” Surovell said. “He wants to control everything. It’s just not how the government works.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lee Francis, deputy director of the League of Conservation Voters, which backed the bill this session, said Youngkin’s failure to sign the bill “ is an incredible missed opportunity and would follow a pattern of this governor putting politics ahead of what’s best for Virginia&#8217;s economy and sending good paying clean energy jobs to other states.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Confederacy-related license plates and tax breaks</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the General Assembly rejected Youngkin’s amendment to a bill to </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB812" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">repeal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> state-issued special license plates honoring the Sons of Confederate Veterans and Gen. Robert E. Lee, the governor ultimately vetoed the legislation on Friday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin had proposed lawmakers return next year to vote on the legislation and to have the state analyze the effects on the commonwealth’s revenue should the plates be discontinued. </span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="1zaibmpYyu"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/04/15/youngkin-proposes-a-second-vote-to-remove-robert-e-lee-license-plate/">Youngkin proposes a second vote to remove Robert E. Lee license plate</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He&#8217;s just not brave enough to do the right thing, and I believe he knows that he&#8217;s wrong,” said Del. Candi Mundon King, D-Prince William, who carried the legislation. “He wants to continue to appeal to MAGA extremists who want to relive the Civil War.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Department Of Motor Vehicles, as of Feb. 27, 1,783 Robert E. Lee plates and 543 Sons of Confederate Veterans plates are currently in circulation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin also vetoed </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB568" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to eliminate tax exemptions for the national and Virginia division of the United Daughters of the Confederacy, the Confederate Memorial Literary Society and the Stonewall Jackson Memorial.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Alex Askew, D-Virginia Beach — who carried the legislation, along with Sen. Angelia Williams Graves, D-Norfolk — said the veto raises questions about fairness and fiscal responsibility. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is crucial that we align our tax code with our values and vision for the commonwealth without delay,” Askew stated. “The governor&#8217;s unexplained focus on preserving these tax breaks is perplexing.” Askew added that Virginians deserved to know “why the governor is providing tax relief to historically pro-slavery institutions instead of extending tax breaks to more deserving organizations that offer opportunities for all.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin signed seven bills on Friday, including ones to expand localities’ ability to lower roadway speed limits, to allow schools divisions to offer one-year, nonrenewable local eligibility licenses for teachers, and to task the Board of Education with creating guidelines for notifying parents about school-related drug overdoses. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However citizens of the commonwealth view Shenandoah County School Board’s recent decision, Virginia appears to be the first in the nation to restore Confederate school names, after years of vigorous community engagement, a controversial renaming process, and a change in board priorities related to race, diversity and inclusion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On May 10, the Shenandoah County School Board </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/virginia-confederate-school-names-26db1b3532208ef8fb1f545c1482b9ff" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reversed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a 2020 decision by a previous board to rebrand two schools previously named after Confederate Generals Turner Ashby, Robert E. Lee and Thomas &#8220;Stonewall&#8221; Jackson. In 2021, the schools on the division’s “southern campus” that included North Fork Middle were renamed from Stonewall Jackson High School to Mountain View, and Ashby-Lee Elementary School to Honey Run.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To some, the Confederacy represents a heritage of Southerners’ courage against the federal Union and fighting for the rights of southern states. Others view the Confederacy as defenders of slavery and a foundational aspect of America’s history of racism.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Four days after the decision, when Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin was asked by a reporter to comment on the reinstated Confederate school names during a press conference following the passage of the state’s two-year budget, he said he was unfamiliar with the topic. He added that he believes those decisions are at the discretion of the local school districts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ve been very clear all along that we need to teach all of our history, the good and the bad, that we can’t know where we are going unless we know where we’ve come from, but to the specifics of the decision, you’ll have to forgive me because I haven’t been very close to them,” said Youngkin. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, commented on the Shenandoah school names the day after the board made their decision, calling it “outrageous.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to recent data from the Department of Education, white students make up most of the total student enrollment in Shenandoah schools at 73%, ahead of Black students at 2.9% and Hispanic pupils at 17%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I feel really sad for the students, both Black and white and Latino, who have to deal with leadership that is backwards looking and not forward looking, that doesn&#8217;t believe that the Confederate names for those schools are wrong,” Scott said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But we will continue to fight to make sure that the real history is known and that we will get better from it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Beau Dickenson, a former teacher of American History at Shenandoah County’s Stonewall Jackson High School, public schools, particularly high schools, began to be named after Confederate between the 1950s and 1960s, as the Civil Rights Movement swept through the nation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many localities named their schools after Confederate leaders in response to the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in the 1954 Brown v. Board of Education case mandating desegregation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the 1950s, school boards and lawmakers, including Virginia’s U.S. Sen. Harry Byrd, were fighting against the U.S. Supreme Court’s 1954 decision to desegregate schools, a strategic effort known as Massive Resistance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia </span><a href="https://encyclopediavirginia.org/entries/massive-resistance/#:~:text=An%20attempt%20by%20Massive%20Resistance,than%20desegregate%20in%20September%201959." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pushed back against integration</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by cutting off state funds for integrated schools, issuing tuition grants to white children to attend segregated private schools and closing public schools to prevent desegregation in Charlottesville, Front Royal and Norfolk.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dickenson said one of the school closures near Shenandoah was in neighboring Warren County, which he believes made school boards aware of why the schools were closed, adding that the news was also featured in the Northern Virginia Daily newspaper for both communities to read.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During this time, Shenandoah leaders named one of its high schools after Stonewall Jackson, on Jan. 12, 1959. Jackson was famously known for leading Confederate soldiers in Shenandoah County and working under Gen. Robert E. Lee during the Civil War.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Days later, federal and state courts ruled that closing schools was illegal. However, Massive Resistance was not declared illegal by the Supreme Court until 1968, a ruling stemming from the Green v. County School Board of New Kent County case. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The convergence of all those forces makes it abundantly clear, I think, that this naming was politically motivated,” said Dickenson.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the last four years, localities statewide have made a concerted effort to address the commonwealth’s history of white supremacist ideology and historical practices of creating unfair advantages for white people by implementing policy changes and hosting community discussions on these topics. Several communities renamed roads that bore the names of people connected to slavery and removed signs and symbols of the Confederacy, such as  statues.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The 2019 candidates’ forum</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Shenandoah County, the controversy around the school names has been discreetly discussed in smaller groups for years. But one of the most notable times the question about changing the Confederate names surfaced publicly was during a District 2 school board candidates’ forum in October 2019.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marty Helsley, who was then a candidate for the Shenandoah County School Board, fielded a number of questions, including ones about his interest in changing the high school’s name from Stonewall Jackson, which he opposed, according to </span><a href="https://www.nvdaily.com/nvdaily/school-board-candidates-make-their-case-for-election/article_906050bc-063e-5305-9a69-e93f20a7f69c.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Northern Virginia Daily</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This valley is rich in Civil War history,” Helsley said during the event. “Stonewall Jackson, if you are an expert in Civil War history, was a fine gentleman. Apparently, the School Board then decided to name the school after Stonewall Jackson for excellent reasons and it should stay that way.”</span></p>
<p>Helsley on Monday, May 20 denied the remarks attributed to him by The Northern Virginia Daily.</p>
<p>&#8220;My response, if I recollect, said &#8216;I will look at the merits when it comes up,&#8217; something to that effect,&#8221; said Helsley.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In November 2019, Helsley was elected to office, joining a group predominantly composed of former educators and parents of school-aged children including Shelby Kline, Andrew Keller, Michelle Manning, Cindy Walsh and Karen Whetzel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Walsh said when she joined the board in 2016, the board was focused on addressing local issues. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But things started to change between 2015 and 2020, she said, after a series of events: a white nationalist killed nine worshippers at a historically Black church in Charleston, South Carolina; hundreds of white nationalists marched through Charlottesville and clashed with counter protesters, killing one and injuring 19; and the killing of unarmed Black man George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Gradually I would hear from people more about how inappropriate the names were on the southern campus, but it was still relatively quiet the first couple of years,” Walsh said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She said even though Shenandoah County didn&#8217;t have a lot of racial incidents, eventually it “felt like the right thing to do, to nip it in the bud and take care of getting those names off of those schools.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Manning said after listening to her board colleagues and school staff talk about the struggles that they observed from dealing with students during a “fragile emotional time” in middle and high school, something needed to be done. She voted in favor of removing Confederate monikers from the schools.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It just seemed like it was the thing to do and, and I don&#8217;t regret my vote at all, because I still feel to the core of my being that it was the right thing to do for students,” Manning said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a June 2020 resolution, leaders from the Shenandoah County </span><a href="https://www.whsv.com/2020/06/25/board-of-supervisors-pass-resolution-for-continued-support-of-black-lives/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Board of Supervisors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Q8SKpcdivlUVqOtOS0PISJluQlAvVwCN/view" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">School Board</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> condemned racism in separate resolutions. The school board did not stop there.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The renaming process</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On July 9, 2020, Whetzel and Walsh, who served at the chair and vice chair on the board, agreed to add an item to the board’s agenda to retire the school names of Stonewall Jackson High and Ashby-Lee Elementary, and the rebel mascot at North Fork Middle School. The measure passed in a 5-1 vote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shenandoah retired the name — </span><a href="https://wtop.com/prince-william-county/2020/06/prince-william-county-votes-to-rename-schools-honoring-stonewall-jackson/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">joining</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Prince William County, which had two schools bearing the same name — in June 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Helsley was the only member to vote against renaming the schools, according to minutes from the meeting.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_19824" class="wp-caption alignright" style="max-width:100%;width:300px;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-19824 size-medium" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/stoney_Wall_CROP_NBC12-300x181.png" alt="" width="300" height="181" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/stoney_Wall_CROP_NBC12-300x181.png 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/stoney_Wall_CROP_NBC12-1024x619.png 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/stoney_Wall_CROP_NBC12-768x464.png 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/stoney_Wall_CROP_NBC12-696x421.png 696w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/stoney_Wall_CROP_NBC12-694x420.png 694w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/stoney_Wall_CROP_NBC12.png 1050w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Stonewall Jackson Middle School in Hanover was renamed. (NBC12)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The meeting, which was virtual, created friction between the public over the process and perceived lack of public participation. The board allowed speakers to respond to  the motion, but diverted from its common practice of waiting a month before taking action, according to Helsley. Some community members took issue with that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We had a problem with the lack of process and the lack of public involvement,” said Mike Schiebe, a spokesperson for the Coalition for Better Schools, made up of county residents that formed after the decision.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We didn&#8217;t have a chance to really be involved and that upset a lot of people in Shenandoah County,” he added. “So it proved to be very divisive.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During an in-person Sept. 10, 2020 meeting, the board reaffirmed its vote and, in a resolution, outlined a plan for renaming the schools and finding a new mascot for the middle school. The board also added language in the resolution to include public input into the decisions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Walsh said changing the names cost money beyond the signs outside the school, “things that you wouldn’t think of,” from stationary and uniforms to gym bleachers, to name a few. She said it cost a little over $300,000, much of it from the districts’ savings, not its operating budget.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the resolution stated, “under no circumstances shall this motion be construed as requiring the expenditure of funds that have not been appropriated to the Shenandoah County School Board for the current fiscal year.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Opponents of the name change argued that the board said taxpayer dollars would not cover the schools’ name change costs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Walsh and Manning said the funds were from the board’s savings and donations collected during the pandemic, when the Shenandoah Valley Regional Program for Special Education program was not in operation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That mirrors the cost breakdown presented in a March 11, 2021 </span><a href="https://go.boarddocs.com/vsba/shenandoah/Board.nsf/files/BYYS996D54FF/$file/School%20Name%20Change%20budget%20amendment%20-%20FINAL.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">board presentation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which showed that the costs were covered by $135,000 from unused salary accounts for frozen positions, and $133,284 from residual Shenandoah Valley Regional Program for Special Education tuition. Manning said </span><a href="https://www.shenandoahforward.org/about" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shenandoah Forward</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which she and others founded, raised the remaining amount, under $40,000.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Walsh said it was common for the board to spend funds from the board’s savings on one-time expenses, such as capital projects, and not recurring ones, such as teacher salaries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Jan. 14, 2021, the board accepted the new names of the two schools. The next month, the board selected the </span><a href="https://www.whsv.com/2021/02/17/generals-chosen-as-mascot-for-stonewall-jackson-high-north-fork-middle/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">generals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as the mascot for both Mountain View and North Fork.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the months following the vote to retire the names, board members faced a recall, some received threats by email and phone. Another member expressed that their mailbox was knocked over by a truck.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title24.2/chapter2/section24.2-233/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">state law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, elected officials can be removed from office by a circuit court through a petition for “neglect of clear, ministerial duty of the office, misuse of the office, or incompetence in the performance of the duties of the office” when it has a material adverse effect upon the conduct of the office.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Board members said it was upsetting to be considered for a recall because it meant that the petitioners — some of whom they knew personally — believed they were not doing their job properly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whetzel, who had just lost her husband after 47 years of marriage, was the only member that received enough signatures for a recall. Her board term ended before any action was taken in court. The case was dismissed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I told myself, some of [the petitioners] just think they&#8217;re signing [a sheet] that they&#8217;re against the name change, and I respect that,” Wentzl said. “So that might have been my way of dealing with it because it&#8217;s not fun to be served petitions for your removal.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schiebe said he’s well aware of the local historic connections to the previous names, but he said the coalition’s main problem was with the board’s approach to retiring the names.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There&#8217;s a lot of people who are really focused on the names and what they are, and in our group, if the public was polled, and if the community as a whole decided we want to change the names or whatever, we would have accepted it,” Schiebe said. “We&#8217;re more focused on the process and our lack of involvement in our own government, which is … one of the cornerstones for our democratic process and of our constitutional rights.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">A change</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2021, the school board’s decision to rename the schools led to a unified effort by county residents to overturn the board’s action. Others made their voices heard at the voting polls, selecting candidates that shared their views. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, four years after the vote to retire the Confederate names, the makeup of the six-member school board has been completely overhauled following two elections. The new members are Dennis Barlow, Kyle Gutshall, Brandi Rutz, Thomas Streett, Gloria Carlineo and Michael Rickard. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of the members of the 2020 board, who started their terms at different times, completed their terms and did not seek reelection.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_33886" class="wp-caption alignright" style="max-width:100%;width:300px;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-33886" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/IMG_3633-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/IMG_3633-300x225.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/IMG_3633-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/IMG_3633-768x576.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/IMG_3633-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/IMG_3633-2048x1536.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  &#8220;I Voted&#8221; stickers are displayed at a Richmond polling place during the 2022 midterm elections. (Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2022, Barlow, Gutshall and Rutz joined the board for the first time and soon had an opportunity to weigh in on restoring the Confederate names, but a measure to do so failed in a 3-3 vote. The failed measure would’ve included a plan for the school to pay thousands for a community survey about the issue to be conducted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Helsley, who initially was not in favor of changing the Confederate names, voted in 2022 to keep the names Mountain View and Honey Run. He said his vote was in the best interest of the students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I saw no need to reverse back to put the Stonewall Jackson [name] back,” Helsley said. “That did not sit well with the group that wanted to put it back.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But in 2024, the board’s ability to restore the names changed when three new members joined, replacing the remainder of the 2020 board.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schiebe said the Coalition for Better Schools did not endorse any candidates, but some members did support them individually. He said the coalition has had about 20 volunteers working to provide information to the public and has hundreds of supporters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The coalition received overwhelming responses in favor of restoring the Confederate names, Schiebe said, after the group conducted two controversial surveys. Some argued the results came from a portion of the county and not the whole county. The </span><a href="https://go.boarddocs.com/vsba/shenandoah/Board.nsf/files/D4GKB54F9AF2/$file/CBS%20Survey%20Results%20Data.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">mail-in survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> produced a response rate of about 13%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the board ultimately voted 5-1 to restore the Confederate names, agreeing to use only private funds for the restoration costs after the meeting extended until the next morning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a </span><a href="https://go.boarddocs.com/vsba/shenandoah/Board.nsf/files/D4GKB24F9AEF/$file/CBS%20Restoration%20Letter.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">letter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the board, the coalition said the legacy of Stonewall Jackson, “while complex, remains an important part of our local history,” and described Ashby and Lee as “prominent figures and local heroes.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gutshall, who represents constituents in District 4, which isn’t where the schools are located, said they overwhelmingly supported retaining the school names Mountain View and Honey Run but respected their colleagues’ viewpoints. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don&#8217;t feel like I would be doing my job properly if I sat here and ignored them, even if I didn&#8217;t necessarily agree with what they were expressing to me,” Gutshall said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Board members’ decision was partially informed by the previous board&#8217;s “lack of process” when it changed the school names in 2020. Others argued that the agenda was published over the Fourth of July weekend and did not provide enough time for the public to respond.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How it was done in 2020, it was not done right,” said Board member Thomas Street, adding that it was secretive and a “knee-jerk” reaction. “I was very disappointed in that leadership.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">District 3 School board member Gloria Carlineo added “This was not an innocent mistake by some inexperienced school board. No, this was a carefully choreographed machinations of a school board colluding to ignore the people they represented.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schiebe said the coalition was happy with the board’s decision and hopes to help with the fundraising.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Board Chair Barlow said the school board expects the renaming transition to be completed by July 1, but is in no rush, the </span><a href="https://www.nvdaily.com/subscribe/?ref=articleMax" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Northern Virginia Daily</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reported. The school division retained some items with the Stonewall Jackson name that are in storage.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The blueprint?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the board’s success in restoring the Confederate school names, some lawmakers and supporters are embarrassed and concerned that it could be a regressive blueprint for other localities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It can always happen elsewhere. We are a democracy. No matter how backwards your views are, you can vote… but we&#8217;re gonna continue to do our best to educate and advocate for what&#8217;s right,” House Speaker Scott said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Richmond, lawmakers including Sen. Mamie Locke, D-Hampton, said the board’s decision to revert back to the original Confederate names was not a surprise because the candidates being elected have “no commitment” to diversity, equity or inclusion, which “flows from the top of [Virginia’s] gubernatorial administration.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Locke, who serves on the Senate Health and Education committee, said across Virginia school board memberships are changing, resulting in some that are “stuck in time” and are more interested in “revisionist history” than supporting the best interests of children, teachers and the schools.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This whole revisionist history idea is what is driving renaming schools to the names of Confederate generals and paying homage to a lost cause.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020, Locke along with Del. Delores McQuinn, D-Richmond, carried successful legislation that gave localities the authority to remove or relocate war memorials, such as the vaunted Monument Avenue statues of Confederate army leaders. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Candi Mundon King, D-Prince William, who supports ending further reminders of the Confederacy, said the backlash by the Shenandoah board mirrors opposition to legislation she carried this session to repeal the state’s ability to issue special license plates honoring the Sons of Confederate Veterans and Gen. Robert E. Lee. The governor vetoed the measure last Friday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think that this just underscores the importance of local elections and how people are reenergizing the sort of false story of the Civil War to try to hurt people and divide people,” Mundon King said. “They know that these names are divisive and hurtful.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sam Rasoul, chair of the Virginia House Education Committee, added that while this was a “stain” on the nation and the commonwealth, he still believes Virginia has made great progress.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are hoping that no other schools go backwards and build on this terrible decision that was made that will be an anomaly,” Rasoul said. “We need to keep moving forward and trying to find ways of embracing the values that truly make us American.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If the governor is not going to follow the laws, then there are consequences for it,” said Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax. “Sometimes following a law you don’t agree with is uncomfortable, but when you raise your right hand and swear to God that you are going to follow the laws of the of the Constitution of the Commonwealth, it was my understanding he took that stuff pretty seriously, but that doesn’t always seem to be the case if he doesn’t agree with the law.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Martin Brown currently serves as the cabinet’s chief officer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Christian Martinez, a spokesperson for the governor, when asked if the governor would return the word “equity” back into the office title, did not directly answer the question. Martinez instead said the administration has been in compliance with the law and will continue to do so.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Budget provision spells out DEI director requirement</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Surovell proposed budget language in an effort to have the word “equity” put back in the office title.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the budget, “if the governor has not appointed a director of the Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion by July 1, 2024” following Virginia Code 2.2-435.12, the director for the Department of Planning and Budget “shall transfer the appropriation to the </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacodefull/title4.1/chapter15/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Cannabis Equity Business Loan Fund</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.” The fund provides no- and low-interest loans to qualified, licensed cannabis business owners to help promote business ownership and economic growth in communities that were disproportionately impacted by cannabis when it was fully prohibited in the state.</span></p>

(Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state budget also includes $3.6 million in funding for the DEI office over the next two years, a $1 million increase compared to the governor’s initial budget he unveiled in December.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last April, the state’s DEI office was thrust into the national spotlight after Brown, the director, remarked that “DEI is dead” at the Virginia Military Institute.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Let’s take a moment right now to kill that cow. DEI is dead,” Brown said. “We’re not going to bring that cow up anymore. It’s dead. It was mandated by the General Assembly, but this governor has a different philosophy of civil discourse, civility … living the golden rule, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, Democrats asked Attorney General Jason Miyares whether the governor was following the law when he changed the name of the position.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Surovell </span><a href="https://twitter.com/ssurovell/status/1653405503953723392/photo/1" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wrote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the DEI title mandated by the state didn’t appear on the official state website and “uses an incorrect name and refers to Mr. Brown as the Commonwealth of Virginia’s Chief Diversity, Opportunity, and Inclusion Officer.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Miyares </span><a href="https://www.oag.state.va.us/files/Opinions/2023/23-022-Surovell-Scott-issued.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">responded</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that if the governor makes sure the state’s laws relating to the DEI office are “‘faithfully executed,’ he may include within his cabinet a Chief Diversity, Opportunity and Inclusion Officer who is charged with performing duties supplemental to those of the Director of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The attorney general also pointed out in his response that “equity” is not defined in the statute.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With no statutory or judicially imposed definition, the governor, in fulfilling his duty to ‘faithfully execute’ the statute, is afforded some degree of discretion in affording its terms a workable meaning,” Miyares wrote.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;ve heard very different scenarios from those who were on the ground and in encampments either as students or as community members that were part of those protests,” Hashmi said. “I think it&#8217;s important to get a very clear picture of what&#8217;s happened.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Demonstrators and faculty members have criticized law enforcement and college administrators for their handling of anti-war protests, including using pepper spray to clear encampments. While the majority of the protests in Virginia have called for a cease-fire in the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas militants and have drawn attention to the </span><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/longform/2023/10/9/israel-hamas-war-in-maps-and-charts-live-tracker" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">deaths of thousands</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Israeli and Palestinian citizens, some demonstrators have also claimed that protests have connections to antisemitic activity on campuses, </span><a href="https://www.wric.com/news/local-news/richmond/its-overwhelmingly-difficult-to-be-jewish-at-the-moment-jewish-leader-says-vcu-pro-palestinian-protests-are-anti-semitic/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">WRIC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reports</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hashmi, who serves as chair of the Senate Education and Health Committee, said on Monday she wants a more precise picture of how the protests unfolded after hearing various reports about the demonstrations that have yielded 80 student arrests at the University of Mary Washington, Virginia Commonwealth University, Virginia Tech and the University of Virginia over the Israel-Hamas war.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, said in a letter that Virginia must understand the policies allowing students to exercise their protected right to free speech while maintaining campus safety.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is imperative that we understand the protocol followed and resources used by our local and state police when requests for assistance are made by our institutions of higher education,” Scott wrote. “We should identify areas where we can improve state policies in order to mitigate the incidents of unrest and arrest that we have witnessed this spring.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both chambers of the General Assembly approved the new two-year budget plan by wide margins. In the House of Delegates, the vote was 94-6. The state Senate approved it 39-1. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This has been a protracted process,” House of Delegates Appropriations Committee Chairman Luke Torian, D-Prince William, said on the House floor prior to the vote. “But working together with the Senate and the governor we have developed a product that all parties believe will meet the needs of the commonwealth.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The handful of votes against the budget were cast by Republicans, but Gov. Glenn Youngkin officially signed the document Monday afternoon, resolving the budget standoff and officially ending the remote possibility of a state government shutdown on July 1.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We in fact listened to one another,” Youngkin said. “And understood each other’s priorities and perspectives. And that came together in the budget that we are going to sign today.”</span></p>

<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">No tax increases, no tax cuts</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new budget agreement reflects the narrowly divided political dynamic in Richmond after Youngkin failed to win GOP majorities in last year’s legislative elections. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislation doesn’t include any of the tax cuts Youngkin called for in his original budget proposal last year. It also temporarily drops the idea of expanding the state’s sales tax to digital purchases like streaming services, downloads and software licenses, a tax expansion Democrats had included in their budget plan to help raise more money for public schools. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The end result is a budget with no tax cuts and no tax increases, but Democrats have signaled they plan to keep studying the digital sales tax proposal as part of a broader look at the state’s code ahead of the 2025 legislative session.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats characterized the agreement as a win and emphasized that it reflected virtually all of the spending priorities they laid out during the regular session that ended in March.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is essentially the same budget that the governor called ‘backwards’ and now he will be signing it into law,” House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, said in a statement. “We have historic funding for education, healthcare, coastal resiliency, and gun violence prevention. We are being consistent with our values and putting our money where our mouth is.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Education funding</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to the elimination of the digital sales tax, the state will lose $169 million in education direct aid spending. However, the budget includes more than $370 million for the At-Risk Add-On, which supports economically disadvantaged students, and a more than $70 million increase in support for English learner students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two-year budget includes state money to pay for 3% salary increases in both years for teachers and other school staffers as well as state employees. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The compromises on how public education will be funded in the new two-year spending plan “raise concerns about long-term fiscal stability of our state budget to fund critical K-12 priorities in the future,” the education advocacy group Fund Our Schools Coalition said in a statement after Monday’s special session wrapped. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The plan also has significant new spending to improve the state’s behavioral health system, adding more resources to help Virginians suffering from mental health crises.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">RGGI reentry language nixed</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to backing off the digital sales tax proposal, the budget deal dropped a Democratic provision aiming to force the Youngkin administration to have Virginia rejoin the carbon market known as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Finance and Appropriations Committee Chair Sen. Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, suggested those steps were necessary as part of the back-and-forth with a Republican governor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I know these actions are not popular &#8230; and many feel that we are essentially kicking the can down the road, but progress can take time and sometimes compromise,” Lucas said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The market requires electricity producers to purchase allowances to emit carbon as a way to incentivize decreasing the release of planet-warming carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.The revenues are returned to the participating states, where in Virginia about $730 million had been directed toward flood resiliency and energy efficiency programs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Youngkin had called the monthly fee tacked onto customer&#8217;s monthly bills to recoup the allowance purchases — which amounted to about </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/07/26/dominion-gets-approval-to-charge-customers-again-for-carbon-market-participation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$2.39</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Dominion territory — a “hidden tax,” prompting him to withdraw Virginia from the market through an executive order and regulatory change, despite advocates saying a legislative change is needed. The matter is being </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/10/27/fairfax-county-judge-weighing-fate-of-suit-over-youngkins-carbon-market-withdrawal/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">challenged</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Floyd County Circuit Court.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Rip Sullivan, D-Fairfax, said in a floor speech that Youngkin insisted the RGGI language come out  “under threat of veto.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If RGGI is a tax then so are the additional fees Virginians will soon see on our electric bills,” Sullivan added, referencing legislation carried by </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=Hb1491" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Israel O&#8217;Quinn, R-Washington</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=Sb454" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Dave Marsden, D-Fairfax</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, that Youngkin signed, allowing utilities to recover early development costs for a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/04/10/governor-amends-vetoes-and-signs-energy-environment-bills/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">small modular reactor. </span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for his insistence on removing the RGGI reentry language, Youngkin said in a press conference Monday afternoon, “We had a robust discussion around all aspects of the budget. … If we know that everyone is not happy then we probably landed in a good spot.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some environmental groups, except for the Chesapeake Bay Foundation and the Virginia Energy Efficiency Council, who support the RGGI funding coming into Virginia, released a </span><a href="https://appvoices.org/2024/05/13/rggi-budget-compromise/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">statement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> earlier in the day that said removing the language was a “capitulation by the General Assembly.” The Bay Foundation and Environmental Defense Fund said in their own statements not including the RGGI language was a disappointment, but separate measures included in the newly approved budget — including funding for pollution reduction measures and a new Chief Resilience Officer — are to be lauded.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Veteran families’ tuition waiver changes</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even as legislators in both parties hailed the deal’s passage as an example of putting partisan differences aside, some lawmakers pointed to a new problem that arose during budget talks that happened largely in private and was apparently only spotted once the deal became public.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several legislators in the House and Senate voiced concerns about a provision included in the budget they passed that will impact the </span><a href="https://www.dvs.virginia.gov/education-employment/virginia-military-survivors-and-dependents-education-program-2-2-2" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Military Survivors and Dependents Education Program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (VMSDEP), which provides college tuition waivers to the spouses or children of permanently disabled military veterans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Language in the budget will now require family members of disabled veterans seeking to further their education at a college or university to first complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), a change from the previous standards that required applicants: be the spouse or child (age 16 to 29) of a living or deceased veteran of the United States Armed Forces, United States Armed Forces Reserves, or the Virginia National Guard Virginia residents; have a physical presence in Virginia; and attend a Virginia public college or university. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The program is administered through the Virginia Department of Veterans Services (VDVS) in collaboration with the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia (SCHEV).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several senators said on the floor that the budget language adds an unnecessary roadblock for veterans&#8217; families trying to obtain an education.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is an issue I&#8217;ve heard from numerous families who really feel blindsided by what has happened,&#8221; said Sen. Tara Durant, R-Fredericksburg. &#8220;We expect this type of legislation to go through the proper process, through committee, when those who are impacted by it can come before committee and speak on it. &#8230; Instead [we are] legislating this through the budget. Many of us today are surprised to see how this is going to impact those families.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Bill DeSteph, R-Virginia Beach, characterized it as an unintentional error.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There&#8217;s nobody here that wants to cause any harm to those who sacrificed their lives, and what we recognize as a benefit or helping hand for their children. &#8230; I know that in our hearts of hearts, we don&#8217;t want to cause any harm to this program. I&#8217;m asking for Gov. Youngkin to call [for] a study on&#8221; the program&#8217;s requirements, DeSteph said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Jeremy McPike, D-Prince William, the patron of the 2019 legislation that expanded the program, agreed that its requirements needed further study and said his original intent was for the fund to provide veterans&#8217; spouses and children &#8220;opportunities for undergraduate&#8221; education, not &#8220;medical school and other things&#8221; he said the program is currently being used to pay for.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin proposed an amendment that would have preserved military families&#8217; access to the program without the new FAFSA requirement but lawmakers rejected that suggestion, and all of his amendments, when they reconvened in the April 17 veto session.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Partisan drama was kept to a minimum Monday, and General Assembly leaders appeared to be trying to complete the budget as quickly and efficiently as possible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t want to keep y’all here any longer than I have to,” Scott quipped at one point while presiding over the House. “As much as I love you all.”</span></p>
<p><em>Mercury editor Samantha Willis contributed to this story.</em></p>
<p><em>Editor&#8217;s note:</em> This story has been corrected to reflect that McPike&#8217;s legislation expanded the <span style="font-weight: 400;">VMSDEP program, but did not create it. </span></p>

(Courtesy of Rebecca Rivas/Missouri Independent)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia has implemented new guidelines to establish a unified rating and improvement system to assess the commonwealth’s publicly funded early childhood care providers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Approximately 75% of child care programs that received public funding previously did not participate in the state’s voluntary quality measures, according to Del. David Buolva, D-Fairfax, who co-patroned 2020 legislation that led to all publicly funded providers being required to participate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the following year, a pilot system known as the Unified Virginia Quality Birth to Five system, or </span><a href="https://www.doe.virginia.gov/teaching-learning-assessment/early-childhood-care-education/quality-measurement-and-improvement-vqb5" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">VQB5</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, was created to improve children’s school readiness and expand access to parents and support providers. Advocates say the new system is a critical tool for the state, providers and families to gauge the effectiveness of Virginia’s early childhood education programs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is always important to have the data to show where young children are so that we can make the right investments moving forward,” said Alison Gilbreath, senior director for policy and programs for Voices for Virginia&#8217;s Children. “We want all children in Virginia to be ready for kindergarten when they reach that age and we also need to know what communities are struggling the most and sometimes the data can really help us understand what is working well and what isn&#8217;t.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kathy Glazer, president of the Virginia Early Childhood Foundation, said in a statement that the organization has been supportive of the system’s developments and implementation throughout the commonwealth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“By focusing on providing feedback to teachers regarding effective interactions with children and use of curricula that is aligned with Virginia’s early learning standards, VQB5 drives increased quality improvement across settings and classrooms,” Glazer said. </span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The new rating system</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, the Board of Education voted unanimously to adopt the system’s </span><a href="https://www.doe.virginia.gov/home/showpublisheddocument/54001/638492791550300000" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">guidelines</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which will apply to over 3,200 birth-to-five programs including child care centers, and Head Start and Early Head Start programs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The move is in conjunction with ongoing state efforts to prepare children for school and secure affordable child care, with the well of federal funds drying up.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="4hPI0k19PU"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/01/29/with-child-care-increasingly-unaffordable-virginia-legislation-seeks-to-make-long-term-changes/">With child care increasingly unaffordable, Virginia lawmakers propose long-term fixes </a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;With child care increasingly unaffordable, Virginia lawmakers propose long-term fixes &#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/01/29/with-child-care-increasingly-unaffordable-virginia-legislation-seeks-to-make-long-term-changes/embed/#?secret=ezAhfW016y#?secret=4hPI0k19PU" data-secret="4hPI0k19PU" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the rating system, a birth-to-five program’s quality of teaching and learning is measured by its interactions between a teacher and child, and a curriculum that is aligned with Virginia’s early learning and development standards. The department said provider profiles, including ratings, will be available online in the fall.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The guidelines will help the state understand how classroom-level experiences impact school readiness and longer-term child outcomes, and provide accurate and supportive feedback to meet diverse needs of classrooms. </span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Previous efforts</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The board’s vote builds on Virginia’s efforts, dating back to legislation in 2020, to improve school readiness for children.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Less than half of Virginia’s children enter kindergarten without any literacy, math and social-emotional skills they need for success, and [it’s] even more acute for at-risk children entering kindergarten,” said Bulova during a Feb. 7, 2020 House Appropriations committee hearing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislation, which Buolva helped to carry along with then-Democratic Sen. Janet Howell, moved early care and education operations oversight from the Department of Social Services to the Department of Education because the previous system was “fragmented,” Bulova said, lost efficiency and confused providers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill also created the </span><a href="https://www.doe.virginia.gov/data-policy-funding/virginia-board-of-education/board-committee-meetings/early-childhood-advisory-committee-ecac" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Early Childhood Advisory Committee</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which is required to obtain federal funding. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislation also established the Early Childhood Advisory Committee (ECAC), which advises the board on all programs, systems and regulations related to Virginia’s unified early childhood system.</span></p>

(Courtesy Port of Virginia)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even while unexpectedly supporting the Port of Baltimore over the past three months, the Port of Virginia is on its way to having the deepest channels on the East Coast by next year, a distinction that will help it further support the exchange of domestic and international goods.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Port of Virginia CEO and Executive Director Stephen Edwards, such investments have helped the company maintain a competitive edge in the market. </span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="i7F1vqBbZw"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/04/03/decades-of-foresight-enable-va-to-process-cargo-diverted-from-maryland-after-bridge-collapse/">Decades of foresight enable Va. to process cargo diverted from Maryland after bridge collapse</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, the port processed 3.25 million twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs) — a unit of measure used in the industry to determine cargo capacity — which is slightly less than the 3.7 million it handled in 2022.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Baltimore aid</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Thursday, Edwards provided an overview of the port’s operations at an annual luncheon with business leaders and officials from around the commonwealth. He also detailed how the port handled additional cargo shipments that were diverted from the port in Baltimore after a ship crashed into a bridge above the port’s channel in March.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Officials from the Port of Virginia have handled about 15,000 additional container units and multiple ro-ro shipments, such as vehicles and machinery, to keep supply chains moving. The temporary measure is expected to end this month due to developments of reopening the Port of Baltimore.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s a testament to our team, our operations, and the strategic investments in projects that we are able to meet these moments while still performing at the highest level,” said Edwards, who also commended other ports on the East Coast for rising to the occasion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When something works and works well, it is, after all, human nature not to pay too much notice, but the Key Bridge collapse put a spotlight on the vitality of our work and our industry,” Edwards said. “I know we&#8217;ve all felt a greater focus on the implications of what we do each and every day.”</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Going deeper</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Edwards said the port’s implementation of the $1.4 billion </span><a href="https://www.portofvirginia.com/the-future/gateway-investment-program/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gateway Investment Program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is helping transform its operations, highlighted by a dredging project to deepen the channel at Norfolk Harbor.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Port officials said Norfolk Harbor is the only channel on the East Coast with Congressional authorization to dredge down to 55 feet. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the dredging and widening are complete, port officials said the harbor will offer the “deepest, widest channels on the U.S. East Coast and commercial channels will allow safe, two-way traffic” for larger ships.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, who presented Edwards with a resolution on Thursday commending the port’s work, said the commonwealth is committed to investing in the cargo terminals in Hampton Roads and Richmond.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;ve invested hundreds of millions of dollars to make sure that our port is the very best port with the deepest water, but we also have to continue to sustain that investment,” Scott said, adding that these investments create jobs and make the commonwealth more competitive. </span></p>

(Style Weekly)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">University of Virginia leaders provided an update in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl8-8PsY9Ng" target="_blank">virtual town hall</a> on Tuesday about the protest on campus last Saturday where 27 people were arrested. A dozen were identified as students, three as either former students or employees and four as university employees, according to UVA President Jim Ryan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The remaining eight people were unaffiliated with the university, and one was charged with assault.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Saturday was a terrible and terribly sad and upsetting day,” said Ryan during the video call on Tuesday. “It was traumatic, I know, for everyone involved; it was far from the resolution I or any of my colleagues had hoped for.”</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="j6PoeyHNew"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/06/more-than-125-arrested-at-four-virginia-universities-amid-nationwide-protest-over-israel-hamas-war/">More than 125 arrested at four Virginia universities amid nationwide protests over Israel-Hamas war</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;More than 125 arrested at four Virginia universities amid nationwide protests over Israel-Hamas war&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/06/more-than-125-arrested-at-four-virginia-universities-amid-nationwide-protest-over-israel-hamas-war/embed/#?secret=WfSunE4hed#?secret=j6PoeyHNew" data-secret="j6PoeyHNew" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ryan said Virginia State Police, who deployed pepper spray to clear an encampment on campus, became involved after officers met “physical confrontation and attempted assault” from protesters. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That&#8217;s when the decision was made to call on the state police, after the protesters were given repeated warnings to leave and didn’t,” Ryan said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to a question sent in from the public about punishments the arrested students were facing, UVA Police Chief Tim Longo said he modified the no trespass orders for those students who were charged following the protest, to allow them “to complete their exams, [and] remain in their dormitory spaces until such time as their academic obligations are over.” After that, the orders will resume throughout the summer and will be lifted at the start of the fall semester, Longo said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ryan also addressed questions about why the university’s response to Saturday’s protest over the Israel-Hamas war differed from its response to the Unite the Right rally in August 2017. In that event, hundreds of white nationalists, some carrying torches, marched through Charlottesville and clashed with counter protesters; one person was killed and 19 others injured. University and Charlottesville leaders faced sharp public criticism after the rally, which drew international attention.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think, in hindsight, some of the difficulties with 2017 was not reacting quickly enough,” Ryan said. Concerning Saturday’s demonstration and the protesters’ encampment, Ryan said “I was thinking that if we don&#8217;t act and we don&#8217;t move, and we just let this unfold, are we </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">going to be faced tomorrow with not 22 tents, but 50 tents, or 75 tents and with 20 outsiders? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then, where will we be? So it&#8217;s risky to act at any particular point, but it&#8217;s also risky to sit back and watch, and wait.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement following the president’s remarks, the American Association of University Professors at the University of Virginia condemned the administration’s actions and made several demands, including that the university drop any criminal and internal charges against students and faculty. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The association also said it found allegations that demonstrators were “unusually disruptive or a source of any danger to others unfounded.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We question the allegation that the demonstrators had clearly violated university policy,” the association wrote. “We further dispute that such violations – if indeed there were any – were anywhere close to sufficient to justify the extraordinary and unprecedented use of force we witnessed on Saturday.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The association wrote that the university’s Board of Visitors </span><a href="https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https://freespeech.virginia.edu/statement-free-expression-and-free-inquiry&amp;data=05%257C02%257C%257C4705e0a151a643894e4a08dc6e3e7495%257C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%257C1%257C0%257C638506461744653152%257CUnknown%257CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0=%257C0%257C%257C%257C&amp;sdata=ZkzX6lXJRuYX40Az3IVt/ysXNwXRIOf+Ip8utOEhDjk=&amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">has affirmed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that First Amendment protections apply to the University of Virginia and said it found the extreme use of force on University Grounds on Saturday an “inexcusable violation of these fundamental principles.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students have also been arrested on other college campuses in Virginia — the University of Mary Washington, Virginia Commonwealth University and Virginia Tech — as the world watches the raging war between Palestine and Israel that has lasted for over six months, following the Palestinian militant group Hamas’s assault on Israel near the Gaza Strip.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Demonstrators in Virginia and across the country are calling for a cease-fire, for America to reject forms of hate and for universities to divest from companies with ties to Israel, which they say makes them complicit in the war.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two days ago, media reported the Hamas militant group has accepted an Egyptian-Qatari cease-fire proposal that could end a seven-month long war.<br />

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Department Of Education on Monday removed from committee review a lab school application from Ferrum College, a religious and private university, asking the commonwealth to pay $10.6 million for the initial four years of its initiative.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state’s College Partnership Laboratory Schools Committee did recommend three lab school applications to the Board of Education for final approval: Richard Bland College in Petersburg; Old Dominion University in Norfolk; and George Mason University in Fairfax. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The lab school committee had several questions regarding the [Ferrum College lab school] application,” said Todd Reid, a spokesperson for VDOE, adding that State Board President Grace Creasey wanted to ensure the school had more time to prepare responses and clarifications to those questions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reid did not provide a date for when the application would be back for the committee’s review. The next meeting is expected in June.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The attention on lab school applications comes after state Democrats opposed supporting private universities seeking to create lab schools with state funding, concerned that doing so would take away resources from public institutions.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Ferrum’s lab school application</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Laboratory schools, which operate like charter schools, offer students tuition-free specialized instruction for high-demand careers like teaching, computer science and technology. Higher education institutions create their own curriculum for the programs, which is reviewed by the state, in partnership with local employers and community organizations. Students are accepted through a lottery system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to documents published on the department’s website, the department first received Ferrum College’s application to create the Ferrum College Academy for Opportunity and Innovation on Feb. 1. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The academy’s focus will be to provide high school students interested in employment in public service and health-related fields with dual enrollment options and industry credentials to get jobs and fast-track their careers by giving them the confidence and opportunity to seek early advancement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Franklin, Henry and Patrick counties expressed interest in partnering with the Ferrum Academy. According to the documents, Virginia Western Community College declined to participate, due to overlaps in programming with their own laboratory school grant applications, resulting in public school systems in Roanoke County and Roanoke City Public Schools declining to participate in the academy. Martinsville schools also declined to participate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ferrum’s application also stated that its academy would be an opportunity to involve homeschooled students, which would be allowed by state law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The stipulation that enrollment in the college partnership laboratory school ‘shall be open through a lottery process on a space-available basis to any student who is deemed to reside within the commonwealth’ … further underscores the opportunity to serve homeschooled students within the region,” Ferrum’s application read.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Ferrum’s application, tuition would be the largest non-personnel annual cost for the academy at $4,530 per pupil.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Monday, the five-member committee did not comment on the application in an amended meeting agenda. Instead, the department removed the application documents before the committee meeting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lab school applications like Ferrum College’s are receiving more attention after the board approved and awarded funding for two private higher education institutions last month: Emory and Henry received $3.8 million, and Roanoke College received $2.3 million. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s unclear whether contracts for those applications have been signed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2022, the General Assembly adopted </span><a href="https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/get/budget/4623/HB30/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chapter 2 of the 2022 Appropriation Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which Gov. Glenn Youngkin signed, stipulating that a “college partnership laboratory school” means a public, nonsectarian, nonreligious school in the commonwealth established by a baccalaureate public institution of higher education.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats said the language was created to keep funding focused on public four-year institutions before expanding to private or religious schools.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the Youngkin administration, with support from the attorney’s general office, says that definition in state law does not prohibit the committee from accepting applications from all institutions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The committee recommended lab school applications from Richard Bland College, ODU, and GMU be approved by the board. The board has already approved 12 lab school applications, including one for VCU, the first university to launch a lab school earlier this year.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Virginia’s lab school landscape</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2022, lawmakers passed </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+sum+HB346" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> establishing laboratory schools. They appropriated $100 million to support the Virginia College Partnership Laboratory fund, established 12 years before for colleges and universities with teacher education programs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Out of the $100 million, $5 million was earmarked for planning grants to support eligible entities in the design of lab schools and to assist in drafting and submitting lab school applications to the board. A total of $20 million was designated for initial start-up grants for approved lab schools to make one-time purchases and $75 million for per-pupil operating grants to support ongoing expenses for lab school operation and maintenance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richard Bland College’s Globe Academy proposes creating engineer career pathways in science, technology, engineering and math, or STEM, using art for student vision planning. The academy’s enrollment will be focused on high school students at Petersburg City, Dinwiddie County, Sussex County and Prince George County Public Schools.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richard Bland’s application estimates first-year expenses will total $1.28 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Suffolk, Old Dominion University’s STEM Academy at Booker T. Washington Elementary School proposes offering hands-on experiences with science, technology, engineering and math to develop proficiency and promote critical thinking and problem-solving skills, prompting a deeper understanding of core subjects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The academy will be focused on serving elementary school students at Suffolk County Public Schools and will cost $1 million in the first year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the northernmost part of Virginia, George Mason University and Frederick County are partnering to develop The Shenandoah Valley Rural Regional College Partnership Laboratory School for Data Science, Computing and Applications.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The school, which will cost $1 million in its first year, will start with high school students enrolled at Frederick County Public Schools before expanding to other school divisions. In partnership with Laurel Ridge Community College, the lab school will focus on advancing data science, computing and applications for students and teachers through innovative research, education and community engagement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additional funding for Virginia lab schools is still uncertain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin proposed $60 million for lab schools in his budget presented late last year, but lawmakers offered no investments in their budget presented at the close of the legislative session in March. Both sides have traded exchanges over whether to include funding for lab schools in the two-year budget that is expected to be finalized next week, ahead of the current budget’s expiration on July 1.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of the most notable Virginia protests that led to arrests occurred at the University of Mary Washington, Virginia Commonwealth University, Virginia Tech and, most recently, the University of Virginia.</span></p>
<p>Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares said in a Sunday appearance on Fox News that protesters at UVA — where 25 people were arrested Saturday after Virginia State Police deployed pepper spray to clear an encampment that several staff and students described as peaceful — ignored multiple warnings to leave the area and &#8220;blocked and surrounded&#8221; campus officers, and &#8220;that&#8217;s when they had to ask for state police to intervene.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Friday, May 3, Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2024-05-03/youngkin-says-college-protests-have-crossed-peaceful" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> during an interview with Bloomberg TV that his administration determined that nonstudents are causing “real problems” and inciting hate speech, antisemitism and violence during demonstrations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If they&#8217;re peaceful, then of course, that&#8217;s part of our constitutional right and part of the American fabric, but we can&#8217;t allow hate speech, antisemitism and most importantly, violence and disruption and threats,” said Youngkin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to media reports, multiple arrests have been made on Virginia’s college campuses as the world waits for a resolution in the war between Palestine and Israel that has lasted for over six months, following the Palestinian militant group Hamas’s assault on Israel near the Gaza Strip.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Demonstrators across the country are calling for a cease-fire, for America to reject forms of hate and for universities to divest from companies with ties to Israel, which they say makes them complicit in the war.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This weekend, some state colleges and universities will hold their commencement ceremonies, hosting graduates’ families and other guests on campuses. On May 11, Youngkin will speak at VCU’s commencement ceremony at the university&#8217;s convention center. 13 people were arrested during last week’s demonstration on VCU’s campus.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Commencement is an official university event and disruptions will not be tolerated,” said Brian McNeill, a spokesman for VCU. “We expect our graduates and their guests will celebrate with behavior that allows everyone to enjoy this milestone occasion. But anyone who engages in a prolonged disruption may be asked to leave the ceremony or could be removed from the Convention Center.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Michael Stowe, a spokesman for Virginia Tech, where more than 80 protesters were arrested last week, no changes are being made to any commencement activities in Blacksburg. He said any updates will be posted on the university’s </span><a href="https://commencement.vt.edu/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">commencement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> webpage.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Demonstrations</h4>

	
<p>On Saturday afternoon, 25 protesters were arrested at the University of Virginia, the culmination of a nearly week-long demonstration that University President Jim Ryan said in a <a href="https://news.virginia.edu/content/message-president-ryan" target="_blank">statement</a> started as &#8220;a peaceful public demonstration&#8221; near the university&#8217;s chapel Tuesday. It is not clear how many of those arrested were UVA students.</p>
<p>&#8220;We hoped and tried to handle this locally,&#8221; Ryan&#8217;s statement read in reference to the efforts of UVA Police Chief Tim Longo to allow protests to continue on campus for most of the week.&#8221;But when UPD’s attempts to resolve the situation were met with physical confrontation and attempted assault, it became necessary to rely on assistance from the Virginia State Police,&#8221; Ryan wrote, noting that people unaffiliated with UVA presented safety concerns at Saturday&#8217;s protest.</p>
<p>&#8220;The reality is that what you had at UVA is students that were warned repeatedly they were violating both the student code of conduct, that it was an unlawful assembly, there was trespassing, there were outsiders that were there,&#8221; Miyares said on Fox News Sunday after Saturday&#8217;s incidents at UVA. &#8220;One thing I want to stress is Virginia is not New York; you have a very different governor, you have a very different AG and we&#8217;re not gonna tolerate that.&#8221;</p>
<p>34 members of the school&#8217;s history department faculty released a <a href="https://twitter.com/ErikLinstrum/status/1787205261322563738/photo/1" target="_blank">statement</a> Saturday afternoon on X as the events on campus continued unfolding, condemning &#8220;the repression of a peaceful protest of our students by armed state police in riot gear.&#8221; The statement said university staff, students, and administrators had been collaborating since April 30 to ensure the protests stayed nonviolent so the educators were &#8220;stunned&#8221; by the university&#8217;s decision to call in state police.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beginning in the evening on Saturday, April 27 protesters in Fredericksburg, including  college students, were arrested by law enforcement amid demonstrations at the University of Mary Washington. Combined with those taken into custody at Virginia Tech and VCU, a total of 107 people were arrested, 68 of them students, at all three campuses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Richmond, demonstrators set up encampment structures that VCU said in an </span><a href="https://news.vcu.edu/article/2024/04/vcu-campus-update" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">April 30 statement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> impacted campus operations and safety, and violated the university’s Reservation and Use of Space </span><a href="https://vcu.public.doctract.com/doctract/documentportal/08DA32A740D31FB4D9FC17CC1351AF65" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">policy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After law enforcement and university staff asked demonstrators “respectfully and repeatedly” to comply with policies throughout the day, including ones that bar the setting up of tents and other structures, the university said officers provided four mass warnings to individuals who chose not to leave the encampment before declaring an unlawful assembly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some demonstrators who chose not to leave threw objects at officers and sprayed them with unknown chemicals. Law enforcement officials responded using pepper spray to disperse the crowd. VCU Police report that officers did not use other chemical agents, such as tear gas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VCU said 13 individuals were arrested and charged with unlawful assembly and trespassing. Six of those arrested were students; these students will proceed normally through the university’s student conduct process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“VCU will enforce its directive that prohibits encampments, including the installation of structures and stockpiling items that could be used to build a structure or aid an encampment,” the university said in a statement. “This will be done to comply with our policies and to support allowing students, faculty and staff to complete the semester successfully.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Fredericksburg, law enforcement arrested 12 demonstrators, including nine students, for trespassing, according to a </span><a href="https://www.umw.edu/news/2024/04/27/message-from-the-president-jefferson-square/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">letter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from University President Troy Paino.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paino wrote that demonstrators were allowed to protest at Jefferson Square, according to the </span><a href="https://students.umw.edu/student-affairs/free-speech/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">university’s policy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on expressive activity. But by the late afternoon on April 26, a threat assessment taken by officials determined the encampment was prohibited and tents were not permitted. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Against the guidelines, demonstrators put the tents back up on April 27, leading officials to cancel the remainder of the event.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paino said attendees were instructed to leave, but some remained, resulting in 12 being arrested for trespassing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Events that do not follow instructions, attempt to disrupt classes or activities, or endanger the health, safety, and security of our campus community will not be allowed,” Palino wrote in a letter to the university community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Blacksburg, Virginia Tech reported that 82 individuals, including 53 current Virginia Tech students, were arrested and all were charged with trespassing.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Reaction from legislature</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the aftermath of arrests at Mary Washington, Virginia Tech, VCU and UVA, leaders and lawmakers have reacted to the protests, with most asserting that they value free speech, but responding differently on how to demand change. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats have leaned on President Joe Biden’s </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/03/biden-backs-peaceful-protest-denounces-campus-chaos-over-gaza/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">message</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that states “peaceful protest is protected” in the United States and “violent protest is not protected. It’s against the law.”</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="4bOQfFIiiT"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/03/biden-backs-peaceful-protest-denounces-campus-chaos-over-gaza/">Biden backs peaceful protest, denounces campus ‘chaos’ over Gaza</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Biden backs peaceful protest, denounces campus ‘chaos’ over Gaza&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/03/biden-backs-peaceful-protest-denounces-campus-chaos-over-gaza/embed/#?secret=6I7Pta9ig7#?secret=4bOQfFIiiT" data-secret="4bOQfFIiiT" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p>Sen. Creigh Deeds, D-Charlottesville, <a href="https://twitter.com/CreighDeeds/status/1786852013969420324" target="_blank">said</a> Friday on X that UVA&#8217;s protests had been peaceful and questioned the police&#8217;s reaction to the demonstrations.</p>
<p>&#8220;I’m not sure what change provoked this sort of response by the police. Violence is unnecessary. I will be interested in knowing whether the change in tactics was decided in Charlottesville or Richmond.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Others have taken a stance to condemn the policing of the First Amendment, according to a joint statement signed by five Democratic lawmakers: Sen. Saddam Azlan Salaim, D-Fairfax, and Dels. Rozia Henson Jr., D-Prince William, Adele McClure, D-Arlington, Joshua Cole, D-Fredericksburg, and Nadarius Clark, D-Suffolk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Freedom of speech and the right to protest are rights protected by the United States Constitution. Full stop,&#8221; said Henson. &#8220;Arresting students for exercising their constitutionally protected rights to peacefully assemble and protest violence erodes confidence in our own governmental institutions and must be closely scrutinized.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The group of lawmakers also urged colleges and universities that have arrested their own students for “participating in constitutionally protected protesting to de-escalate tensions,” to reconsider their actions and re-engage with students to “facilitate a more peaceful path forward.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Minority Leader Todd Gilbert, R-Shenandoah, said his colleagues referenced in the joint statement fail to recognize the “unlawful nature” of some of these protests and associated themselves with the “worst of the bigoted messages” from demonstrators. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As long as these protests remain inside the rules of these universities, they have a right to happen, no matter how nauseating and odious the views on display,” Gilbert said in a </span><a href="https://virginiahouse.gop/2024/04/30/leader-gilbert-statement-on-campus-protests/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">statement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> applauding the governor, Attorney General Jason Miyares and law enforcement for the “even-handed way” they have handled the demonstrations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He added that if demonstrations turn into intimidating Jewish students, trespassing, or other illegal activity, they can be shut down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Virginia’s colleges are not preschools where petulant children need to learn basic rules and manners,” Gilbert said. “Campus officials and law enforcement officers told these young adults the rules. They broke the rules, and now they’ll face the consequences.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The list of new rules designed to protect victims of campus sexual assaults and the rights of LGBTQ+ students has come under attack by Republican attorneys general in several states.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Miyares </span><a href="https://www.oag.state.va.us/media-center/news-releases/2727-april-30-2024-attorney-general-miyares-joins-fight-to-preserve-title-ix-student-privacy-and-fairness-for-women-in-education" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">called</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the changes a “dangerous overhaul” of Title IX, and said the new </span><a href="https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/t9-unofficial-final-rule-2024.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rules</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would negatively impact students, families and schools in the commonwealth. The ruling also comes after Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration </span><a href="https://www.doe.virginia.gov/home/showpublisheddocument/46509/638252918535370000" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">overhauled</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the commonwealth’s transgender student policies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Biden Administration&#8217;s unlawful rule would jeopardize half a century of landmark protections for women, forcing the administration’s social agenda onto the states by holding federal funding hostage,” Miyares said in a statement. “They are avoiding Congress and the constitutional process because they know it will not pass. We cannot roll back Title IX in the name of false equity.”</span></p>

(Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attorney generals from Tennessee, Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio and West Virginia have also signed onto the suit, which was filed in Tennessee. Separate lawsuits have been filed in other states, including </span><a href="https://lailluminator.com/2024/04/29/louisiana-sues-biden-administration-over-title-ix-rules-that-protect-lgbtq-students/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Louisiana</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and Texas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Title IX, which has undergone several transformations based on the political party in office, was created to address women’s rights and prohibits any federally funded school or education program from discriminating against any student based on sex since it was established in 1972. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Department of Education said some differences compared to the previous version </span><a href="https://michiganadvance.com/2024/04/19/biden-administration-to-roll-back-the-betsy-devos-title-ix-rules/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">developed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> under the Trump administration, include protections against all sex-based harassment and discrimination, prohibits schools from sharing personal information and supports students and families. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Narissa Rahaman, executive director for Equality Virginia, said in a statement that the rule prevents opponents from weakening “crucial” civil rights protections including for LGBTQ+ students by ensuring that pregnant and parenting students have a right to equal education opportunities, protecting student survivors and guaranteeing the rights of LGBTQ+ students to come to school as themselves without fear of harassment or discrimination.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Students across races, places, and genders prove every day that they can do great things, especially when there are strong Title IX protections in place, which is why the Biden Administration’s updates to the Title IX rules are essential to ensure every student can thrive at school,” said Rahaman.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new rule is slated to take effect on Aug. 1 and will apply to complaints of alleged conduct that occurs on or after that date, according to the Department of Education. </span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Protections</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the ruling protects students and employees from all sex-based harassment and discrimination, it will also impact LGBTQ+ students and employees, including providing complete protection from sex-based harassment and prohibiting schools from sharing personal information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schools must act “promptly and effectively” to protect and treat all students and staff who make complaints “equitably.” Schools must also provide support measures to complainants and respondents, and act to end any sex discrimination in their programs and prevent any recurrence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rule further clarifies the definition of “sex-based harassment,” which means to treat someone unfairly because of their gender; and the scope of sex discrimination, including schools’ obligations not to discriminate based on sex stereotypes, sex characteristics, pregnancy or related conditions, sexual orientation, and gender identity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The federal agency said the changes will empower and support students and families by requiring schools to disclose their nondiscrimination policies and procedures to all students, employees, and other participants in their education programs so that students and families understand their rights.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The final rule also protects against retaliation for students, employees, and others who exercise their Title IX rights, and supports the rights of parents and guardians to act on behalf of their elementary school and secondary school children. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rule also protects student privacy by prohibiting schools from disclosing personally identifiable information with limited exceptions, which is something the Youngkin administration has opposed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advocates say one of the rights students should have is the power to decide who finds out about their transgender status, to protect them from being bullied or harassed.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Virginia policies</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2021, the first model </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/09/12/despite-law-few-virginia-school-districts-adopt-state-model-transgender-policies/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">policies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for transgender students were designed under former Gov. Ralph Northam to provide school officials guidance on the treatment of transgender and nonbinary students and to protect the privacy and rights of these students. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, some schools declined to adopt the model policies, and the state law that led to them lacked enforcement incentives or penalties.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The current policies adopted by the Youngkin administration were revised to </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/09/16/youngkin-administration-overhauls-virginia-transgender-student-policies/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">require parental approval</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for any changes to students’ “names, nicknames, and/or pronouns,” direct schools to keep parents “informed about their children’s well-being” and require that student participation in activities and athletics and use of bathrooms be based on sex, “except to the extent that federal law otherwise requires.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia schools have also not fully adopted the newly revised policies, and state law has not changed since the policies were overhauled in 2023.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Department of Education faces </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/aclu-sues-virginia-department-of-education-over-transgender-policies/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">two lawsuits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over the policies adopted by the Youngkin administration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“All Virginia students, including our transgender and non-binary students deserve to feel safe and welcomed at schools,” said Wyatt Rolla, a senior transgender rights attorney with the ACLU of Virginia. “Accessing restrooms, locker rooms and other facilities that are necessary when you are at school learning is a key part of our schools being inclusive of those transgender [and] non binary students that are part of our community.”</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Athletics not included</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The provisions under the new Title IX rule did not mention anything about requiring schools to allow transgender students to play on teams that align with their gender identity. Virginia has taken its own shot at banning transgender athletes from competing in sports through legislation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In February, the Youngkin administration attempted to challenge the Virginia High School League’s policy on transgender athletes, the </span><a href="https://dailyprogress.com/news/local/government-politics/youngkin-administration-play-to-change-policy-for-transgender-high-school-athletes-falls-short-in-charlottesville/article_0ab1748c-c54c-11ee-9a8f-4745a6f30110.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Daily Progress</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reported. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposed policy would have matched with the administration’s current </span><a href="https://www.doe.virginia.gov/home/showpublisheddocument/46509/638252918535370000" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">policies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that students should be placed on teams based on their biological sex rather than their gender identity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia High School League, which oversees interscholastic athletic competition for Virginia’s public high schools, </span><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OxLAgeE0tBHCgcHBdYoMBDGepYL2fN7W/view" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">allows</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for transgender athletes to participate on teams that match their gender identity, but under certain conditions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simultaneously, lawmakers in the Virginia General Assembly controlled by Democrats killed bills, including </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB68" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 68</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, during the previous session that would have essentially banned transgender students from competing in sports.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Tammy Brankley Mulchi, R-Mecklenburg, who carried </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB723" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 723</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, said students like her 6-year-old granddaughter should have a choice to play with their own gender during a Feb. 1 Senate Education subcommittee hearing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mulchi’s bill would have required schools and colleges to have separate sports for boys and girls based on their biological sex. Any dispute would require a note from a doctor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If she [my granddaughter] wants to play an all-girl sport, I want her to play against girls that were born girls and not play against someone that is much stronger than her or can hurt her and take away her chances of a scholarship,” Mulchi said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Sen. Stella Pekarsky, D-Fairfax, argued during the February hearing that whether students are competing with their respective biological sex or not “children of all ages, sexes have different builds and strengths and no children are alike on the same team.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration, which has made </span><a href="https://www.doe.virginia.gov/teaching-learning-assessment/specialized-instruction/laboratory-schools" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">laboratory schools</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a priority since the governor’s term started in 2022, the </span><a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=1l1D4JcqarSrTO1cevIFiZmv1O-TJufM&amp;ll=39.786194094943916%2C-75.87854405056015&amp;z=7" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">list of applications</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> accepted by the board increased from six to 12 on April 18. The additions are Paul D. Camp Community College, George Mason University, Old Dominion University at Newport News and Chesapeake, and private schools Roanoke College and Emory and Henry College.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In a desperate move to advance his political agenda, the Governor’s administration is recklessly fast-tracking approvals of new lab schools and willfully breaking the law by extending state grant funding to private and two-year universities,” said James Fedderman, president of the Virginia Education Association in a statement. “Although these institutions can launch lab schools, the budget couldn’t be more clear that they are disqualified from receiving state grant funding.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Todd Reid, a spokesperson for the Virginia Department of Education, said in an email that for the past two years the department has been working closely with community colleges, universities, school divisions and communities on their lab school proposals and applications. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is no surprise that we are seeing several applicants now ready for board consideration as many of them have been moving on similar tracks through the planning process for a similar amount of time,” said Reid.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Why lab schools?</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Laboratory schools, which operate like charter schools, offer students tuition-free specialized instruction for high-demand careers like teaching, computer science and technology; higher education institutions create their own curriculum, which is reviewed by the state, in partnership with local employers and community organizations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students are accepted through a lottery system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dating back to his campaign, the governor has called for more options for students, including providing more options for students in public education by expanding charter schools. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In January 2022, Youngkin proposed in his first budget investing $150 million to kick start 20 new charter schools. During his first month in office, he </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/proclamations/proclamation-list/virginia-school-choice-week.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">signed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a proclamation standing up for school choice during School Choice Week.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We must empower parents and students with choice and innovation in K-12 public education,” Youngkin said in a statement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But he faced opposition from Democrats on his pledge for school choice because it would siphon funding from already underfunded public schools.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By mid-February, the administration’s position changed slightly after Democrats killed efforts to add more charter schools. Laboratory schools then became Youngkin’s alternative to public schools. </span></p>

    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">A debate over language</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Later that year lawmakers passed </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+sum+HB346" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> establishing laboratory schools and appropriated $100 million to support the Virginia College Partnership Laboratory fund, which had been established 12 years before for colleges and universities with teacher education programs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Out of the $100 million, $5 million was appropriated for planning grants to support eligible entities in the design of lab schools and to assist in drafting and submitting a lab school application to the board. A total $20 million was designated for initial start-up grants for approved lab schools to make one-time purchases and $75 million for per-pupil operating grants to support ongoing expenses for lab school operation and maintenance.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/get/budget/4623/HB30/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chapter 2 of the 2022 Appropriation Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which the governor signed, stipulated that a “college partnership laboratory school&#8221; means a public, nonsectarian, nonreligious school in the commonwealth established by a baccalaureate public institution of higher education.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During a Senate Finance and Appropriations Committee hearing at the time, then-Sen. George Barker, D-Fairfax, said the language was created to keep the funding for public four-year institutions before any expansion to other institutions of higher education is considered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That language is not squishy,” he said. “That language is very clear.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since then, however, the administration and legislature have debated which applicants can receive state funds under the definition of lab schools and how much funding should be appropriated over the next two years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s administration says the definition in state law does not prohibit the College Partnership Laboratory Schools Standing Committee from accepting applications from all institutions. In two April 10 letters, Deborah Love, a senior assistant attorney general, agreed, saying: “In my view, there are no legal impediments to the Standing Committee’s consideration of this application.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Love wrote that the office reviewed earlier versions of the </span><a href="https://www.doe.virginia.gov/home/showpublisheddocument/53941/638490432877400000" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roanoke</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.doe.virginia.gov/home/showpublisheddocument/53925/638490432828330000" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emory &amp; Henry Colleges</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> applications and provided feedback to the department on March 21 and April 4, and Feb. 2 and March 5. However, the feedback the office provided to the department was not included in the committee’s public documents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Democrats and the Virginia Education Association are critical of the education department awarding grants to private colleges such as Ferrum College, the University of Lynchburg and Virginia Union University.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Education Committee Chair Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Chesterfield, said the administration attempted to rewrite the state code about establishing College Partnership Laboratory Schools prompting Democrats to make sure funding was supporting public education.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We put a lot of safety rails on it so that so-called ‘college partnership schools’ would only be delivered through four-year institutions,” said Hashmi. “They would not be open to private actors and they would have to follow a process of approval that included local school divisions and so there has been a lot of effort on the administration’s part to bypass some of those safety rails that we put in.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Sen. Mark Peake, R-Lynchburg, said he hopes the state will support lab schools, public and private, both of which he pointed out benefit public school children.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;m not looking at the school that&#8217;s providing it, I&#8217;m looking at students that are receiving it,” said Peake, who sits on the Senate Education committee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think we need to take new looks at how we are educating our children and the opportunities we&#8217;re giving our children, and that is especially the case after the learning shortfalls we have had since Governor [Ralph] Northam shut down our schools during the coronavirus,” Peake said. “When you look at the learning loss our students are facing since the coronavirus shut down, we&#8217;ve got to try everything possible to get our kids caught back up and if it&#8217;s lab schools, I think it&#8217;s a great opportunity.”</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Funding</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Within the past two years, the Board of Education has accepted six lab school applications: Virginia Commonwealth University, James Madison University, the University of Mary Washington, the University of Virginia, and Germanna and Mountain Gateway Community Colleges.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VCU’s partnership with </span><a href="https://coderva.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CodeRVA</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Regional High School was the first application approved by the Board of Education and awarded $6 million. It opened in January. While VCU is a public university, the decision was criticized because it supported a regional school that was already “fully funded” and “fully staffed.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fedderman of the Virginia Education Association, suggested the money could have gone instead to neighboring Overby-Sheppard Elementary School in Richmond.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Virginia is one of the richest states in the country, yet we spend less per student in state funding than states with fewer resources, such as Alabama and West Virginia,” Fedderman said in a statement at the time. “Showering one school with huge amounts of state and local funding might look nice and distract some of the public, but parents of kids in other public schools want and deserve adequate funding for their students, too. Let’s work to fund all our public schools like we fund our lone lab school.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats </span><a href="https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/amendment/2024/1/HB30/Introduced/CR/125/18c/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reiterated</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in budget amendments during the recent legislative session that public funds for lab schools should only be used for public four-year institutions. Youngkin and lawmakers have gone back and forth over whether to include funding for lab schools in the two year budget.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After trading proposals, which included Youngkin proposing $60 million and the General Assembly offering no investments for lab schools, the two are at a stalemate before the current budget ends on July 1. </span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Change in process</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The budget negotiations and disagreements on language are not the only issues plaguing lab school decisions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On April 11, Virginia’s College Partnership Laboratory Schools Standing Committee voted 3-2 to adjust the process for approving applications by cutting the number of reviews from two to one before submitting them to the Board of Education for final review. While some members said the move would help, others expressed concern after the process was created a year ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Board member Andy Rotherham, a Youngkin appointee on the committee, said the move would streamline the process for applicants to meet with reviewers and travel to Richmond.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think we just need to continue to try to refine it [the process] to maintain the highest bar of quality, but also think about how can we do it as efficiently as possible,” Rotherham said at the meeting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said if the committee finds any issues with applications, it has options including sending applications to the board with conditions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of the notable elements reviewed in applications is a school’s plan for serving all students including those with disabilities, English language learners, and students who are academically behind or gifted. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title22.1/chapter19.1/section22.1-349.3/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">state law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, all lab schools are subject to “all federal and state and constitutional provisions prohibiting discrimination on the basis of disability, race, creed, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, religion, ancestry, or need for special education services.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Applications must also include plans for student recruitment and enrollment, the school&#8217;s financial plan and policies, including financial controls and audit requirements; and assurances that the college partnership laboratory school is nonreligious in its programs, admission policies, employment practices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Fundamentally the accountability for actually authorizing these schools lies with the nine members of the state board who it’s incumbent on them to look at everything including the public comment which is still provided in this process,” Rotherham said</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Board Vice President Bill Hansen, a Youngkin appointee, also supported the change.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think it&#8217;s the evolution of where we are, where the Department of Education is, where we are in the process and I just really don’t have any concerns whatsoever that we’re going to be stepping away from quality outcomes of what we’re all seeking to achieve here,” Hansen said during the meeting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Joan Wodiska and Pam Moran, committee chair and vice chair, voted against changing the process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moran asked the committee to consider keeping a second review on a case by case basis, but no action was taken.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t want to vote ‘no,’” said Moran. “I&#8217;d like to be able to have these proposals get the support and go through the process if they need to, and [if] there are some that are coming to us that we may say … ‘let&#8217;s send it on,’ I&#8217;m good with that;  but I don&#8217;t want to leave out a piece of the process that gets people something that they need to then get back to the place where they can go to the state board.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wodiska added that she believes having a first and final review is necessary, a historical practice done by the state board.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The role of a standing committee as charged under law is to set a process to review applications,” Wodiska said. “That is our role, that is our charge. There are millions of taxpayer dollars at stake in these conversations, but most importantly is the welfare of the students and educational professionals that will be at these lab schools.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Education Committee Chair Sam Rasoul, D-Roanoke, who represents a part of Roanoke City near Roanoke College, said he considered the board’s decision presumptive when the budget is not completed and the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission found that Virginia has been underfunding public education for a number of years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Lab schools in and of themselves are not a bad idea,” Rasoul said. “The question is, are we going to be diverting funds when we just had a massive report from JLARC, saying how underfunded our public schools are, given that funds for new projects like this seem to divert away from needing to pay our teachers at the national average mental health resources and other critical services.”</span></p>
